MySQL : AVG of AVG impossible?

I want to do an average : the problem is for 1 item i'm calculating the AVG of each elements ( working ) but as soon as i want the GLOBAL average of the averages of the categories (something and foo) it doesn't work (mysql throw me an error : see the syntax i used just below). I need to do that because i want to sort the result by the global average SELECT AVG(AVG(category1)+AVG(category2)) /2 as moy ..... ORDER BY moy DESC Thanks, edit : I would like to have the average of averages of each category edit 2 : got table : server (...) got table : answer_poll (price, interface, services, quality) a user's got 1 server, and he can answer to a poll for this server severall times SELECT s.name , s.type , COUNT(s.GSP_nom) as nb_votes, TRUNCATE(AVG(quality), 2) as quality, TRUNCATE(AVG(price), 2) as price, TRUNCATE(AVG(interface), 2) as interface, TRUNCATE(AVG(services), 2) as services FROM answer_poll AS v INNER JOIN server AS s ON v.idServ = s.idServ GROUP BY s.name ORDER BY global average :d This request = the average for each category, but i want the average of the averages :p
