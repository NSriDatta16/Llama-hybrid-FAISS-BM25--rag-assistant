Many options Report percentages as they are: e.g. just as a table or graphically e.g. as a stacked barchart (pro: it is already a percentage, easy to do, no loss of information, con: with many categories a bit messy - perhaps that's why you seem to look for a single number) Take a cut-off: % that are at least "somewhat satisfied" (pro: easy and reasonably interpretable, con: loss of information by dichotomizing) Assign a score: e.g. 0 to 100 and form average of some form (pro: easy, con: hard to interpret/many choices - Is even spacing from 0 to 100 sensible? Is an average meaningful? Is the difference from 0 to 25 really the same as from 50 to 75?) Item response theory: anchor to some instrument (e.g. subsequent renewed business/use of service) and/or look at test-retest scores, then bring to a 0 to 100 scale (e.g. inv_logit function 100), if you must (pro: clear basis for linking it to something meaningful, reasonably solid theoretical basis that tries to get to an underlying concept, con: the most work, not much you can do in this direction, if you just have a single score on a single occasion for each person) There's probably quite a few more options.
