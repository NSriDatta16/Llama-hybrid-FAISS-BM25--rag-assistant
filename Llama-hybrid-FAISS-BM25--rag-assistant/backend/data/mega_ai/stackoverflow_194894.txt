The reason I don't like having my QA people do it, is because I don't like the idea of them creating their own work. For example they might leave out things that are simply too much work to test, and they may not know the technical detail that is needed. Yikes, you need to have more trust in your QA department, or a better one. I mean, imagine of you had said "I don't like having my developers develop software. I don't like the idea of them creating their own work." As a developer, I Know that there are risks involved in writing my own tests. That's not to say I don't do that (I do, especially if I am doing TDD) but I have no illusions about test coverage. Developers are going to write tests that show that their code does what they think it does. Not too many are going to write tests that apply to the actual business case at hand. Testing is a skill, and hopefully your QA department, or at least, the leaders in that department, are well versed in that skill.
