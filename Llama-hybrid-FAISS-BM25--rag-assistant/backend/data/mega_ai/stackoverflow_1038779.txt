There's not a good way to do this. Many developers use something like this: # { padding:100px; } But frankly I am not a big fan of it. It's very tag-soupy and fragile. Starting with ASP.NET 4.0, you will be able to control the ClientID of an element in code, so you can specify IDs for elements you know you will need to target with CSS or JS. In the meantime, I recommend using classes. In the system I work on, we require classes and ban IDs for any client-side code (CSS or JS) because it's just not worth the extra overhead. Classes can work just fine as IDs - nothing stopping you from having many unique (one-use) classes, and there's no real issue with working this way from a maintainability standpoint.
