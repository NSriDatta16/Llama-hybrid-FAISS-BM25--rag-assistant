es with in-context image generation and editing capabilities. It is available in Max, Pro, and Dev models. Max is the highest quality model and can be used to iteratively modify an existing image by using prompt while Pro is optimized to balance quality and speed of generation. Dev is an open-weight model released under non-commercial license, same as Flux.1 Dev. Related to Flux is text-to-video model SOTA, under development as of June 2025. Reception According to a test performed by Ars Technica, the outputs generated by Flux.1 Dev and Flux.1 Pro are comparable with DALL-E 3 in terms of prompt fidelity, with the photorealism closely matched Midjourney 6 and generated human hands with more consistency over previous models such as Stable Diffusion XL. Flux has been criticised for its very realistic generated images. According to media reports, depictions ranged from an image of Donald Trump posing with guns to disturbing scenes, which triggered discussions about ethical implications of Flux models. After the release of the model, social media platform X was flooded with Flux-generated images. Black Forest Labs has not provided exact details of the data used to train the model. Ars Technica suspected that Flux is based on a large, unauthorised collection of images scraped from the internet, a controversial practice with potential legal consequences. According to a test performed by Japanese technology news website Gigazine for Flux.1 Kontext, the model series has a good understanding of the English language and can easily transfer style of the image from photorealistic into anime-style according to prompts given by the user; however, its ability to understand Japanese is quite poor. Availability In addition to the official BFL Playground on its website, the Flux models are also widely available through various third-party platforms for creative and professional use. These include repositories on platforms like Hugging Face and Replicate. References External links Official website Flux models on Hugging Face Flux models on Replicate Flux models on FAL.ai
