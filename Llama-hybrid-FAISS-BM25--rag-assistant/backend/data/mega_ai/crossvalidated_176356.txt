The intercept might be interpreted as the estimated baseline log odds when all independent variables are set to 0, or the reference category in case of categorical variables. The probability when all independent variables are set to 0 is log(intercept)/(1+log(intercept)). With a standardized continuous variable, the intercept is the estimated log odds for the event when the standardized variable is 0. The problem is that mean probability in your sample is not the same as probability when the standardized variable is 0. If the probability of having an event (or whatever the dependent variable is) is 0.1 when the standardized variable x is 0, and the estimated coefficient for x is 1, this means that for an individual whose value for x is 1, the odds ratio will be exp(1)=2.71. We can calculate the expected probability for an event in such an individual: base odds = 0.1/(1-0.1) = 0.11. odds for this individual: 0.11 * 2.71 = 0.3 probability for this individual = 0.3/(1+0.3) = 0.23 Now, for an individual who is one standard deviation below the mean on the x variable, the odds ratio will be exp(-1) = 0.37: odds for this individual: 0.11 * 0.37 = 0.03 probability for this individual = 0.04 So the +1 sd of x means a probability of 0.23 and -1 sd means a probability of 0.03. If we instead calculate the probability for +2 sd we get a probability of 0.45, and for -2 sd we get a probability of 0.01. It's easy to see that the average probability in the sample will be higher than the probability for individuals whose value on x is 0, because the probabilities are skewed because of how odds and odds ratios work. As for your question, I don't think it's possible to make the intercept represent the mean probability, because in logistic regression, (log) odds and odds ratios are estimated, not probabilities, and the mean probability is not really meaningful to consider in a logistic regression.
