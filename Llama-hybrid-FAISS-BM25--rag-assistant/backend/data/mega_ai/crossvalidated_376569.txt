Regularization in Bayesian updating

I'm building an online algorithm (I have streaming data) that does Bayesian Linear Regression. Each time data comes in, I use standard Bayesian updating formulae to calculate the posterior, which then becomes the prior for the next batch of data. (For example, I use the formulae from Bishop's textbook below) I then predict which treatment gives the highest expected outcome value, and then assign that treatment. All's fine for models with few variables, but as dimensionality increases, I might want to do regularization. How should I do this?
