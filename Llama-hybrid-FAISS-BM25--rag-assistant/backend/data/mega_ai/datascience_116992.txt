Are there deterministic problems a neural network can't learn?

I have a software which takes 5 input numbers and outputs a number, deterministically. I want to try and mimic this software precisely with a neural network, but I am finding it very difficult. The loss function seems to hover around one value throughout training or occasionally increase, but it does not seem to minimize. The function I want to mimic is relatively complex and I believe it involves solving differential equations. What are some things I might try to make this work better? Are there some functions that just can't be learned by a neural net?
