Icons in menu are smaller than they should be

SOLVED: I was using icons from sdk v9 (Android 2.3 Gingerbread) which seems to have different dimension. The asset studio also creates icons for 2.3. So I placed gingerbread icons to drawable-xxpi-v9 and for older versions I put icons from SDK v8 to drawable-hdpi and it works fine now Original question: Hello I have a little problem. All the icons in my apk are smaller than the same icons in other apps (Gmail etc.) This is how it looks like in my apk and this is the same icon in Gmail.apk . I have copied these icons directly from SDK to the specific folders for hdpi, mdpi and ldpi. Here is an example of a hdpi icon I use and my menu.xml Does anybody know how to make these icon have the same size as in other apk's? I have tried the asset studio with no effect. UPDATE: If I reference an icon directly from android (android:drawable) then it has normal size. However not all icons can be referenced.
