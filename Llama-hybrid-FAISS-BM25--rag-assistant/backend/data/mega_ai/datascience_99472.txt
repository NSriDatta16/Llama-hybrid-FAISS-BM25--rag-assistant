Understanding sequence prediction There are 3 types of Sequence Prediction problems namely: predict class label, predict a sequence or predict a next value In your case you are looking forward to predict the next value. Tutorials Few tutorials I have found related to sequence prediction with code example. Simple Sequence Prediction With LSTM helps to predict the next value A guide to sequence prediction using compact prediction tree python , CPT model is a Lossless Model ensures accurate sequence prediction 5 Examples of Simple Sequence Prediction Problems for LSTMs helps to achieve sequence prediction using LSTM recurrent neural networks Sequence prediction models There are many different ways to perform sequence prediction such as using Markov models, Directed Graphs etc. from the Machine Learning domain and RNNs/LSTMs from the Deep Learning domain. However, the RNNs and LSTM have few drawbacks Longer training time Re-training required for sequences not seen in the previous training iteration. This is a very costly process and is not feasible for scenarios where new items are encountered frequently Most popular sequence prediction models from research communities are mentioned below Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) It is based on the Markov property and has inspired a multitude of other models such as Dependancy Graph (DG) All-K-Order-Markov (AKOM) Transition Directed Acyclic Graph (TDAG) Probabilistic Suffix Tree (PST) Context Tree Weighting (CTW) Compact Prediction Tree (CPT) is a much recent proposed prediction model which compress training sequences without information loss by exploiting similarities between subsequences. It has been reported as more accurate than state-of-the-art models PPM, DG, AKOM on various real datasets. Conclusion From the research communities I found, that Compact Prediction Tree be the choice for researchers considering how well it performs compared to other models. The tutorial is mentioned in #2 for implementation in python, however its original implementation is in Java .
