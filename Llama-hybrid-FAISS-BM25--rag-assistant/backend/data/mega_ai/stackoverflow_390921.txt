Testing Data Access Persist Methods

Just wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to test ones data access methods. I have found testing retrieval data access methods is much easier because i can just mock out the ExecuteReader and return a populated dataTable.CreateDataReader() . By doing this I can test to see if my object is populating correctly if a result set is returned. But how do i translate this to my persist methods (i.e. add, update, delete, etc). What i want to test is whether it populates the command parameters correctly, etc. Any ideas? Cheers
