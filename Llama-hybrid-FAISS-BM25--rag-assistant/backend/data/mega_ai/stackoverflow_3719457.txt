Joomla Navigation Question

I'm brand new to Joomla but after browsing around a demo site and doing some reading I think it may be the solution I'm looking for. I just have one question regarding navigation. The site I'm building will need a fairly complex navigation system. The organization I work for offers many programs open to their clients. Each program is represented by its own set of pages on the website. This set of pages is comprised of: "Info", "Dates", "Pricing", "Contacts", etc. Totaling about 5 pages for each program. To navigate between these pages, we'd like to have a horizontal navigation that is standard between all program pages. This nav bar will link between pages that are in a given program set but won't link to others. Is there a way to accomplish this in Joomla without having to manually create links on each page for all 70 programs?
