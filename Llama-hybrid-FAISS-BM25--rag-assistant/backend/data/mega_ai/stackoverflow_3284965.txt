You can at least shorten it a bit. Right now, you're send a GUID, which is a 128-bit number, in a format that is essentially hexadecimal with extra dashes. If you view the GUID as a byte array and convert it to Base64, you can cut things down a bit. Likewise, "query=academic" could be "q=a". The GUID is currently taking up 36 characters. Converting to Base-64 cuts this down to 22, saving 14 chars. Replacing "query=academic&key=" with "q=a&k=" shaves off another 13. Cutting a total of 27 characters may well keep your URL short enough not to wrap, despite the presence of ampersands and equal signs. One more detail: the Base-64 text is going to end with an "=", which will then be hex-encoded into "%3D". The solution is to cut that character off, because it's just padding. With credit to the original posters, it looks like the best bet is a combination of things: Compact GUID with base-64. Shorten key names and, if possible, values. Wrap URL in angle-braces to encourage client to parse it properly. If possible, replace key names with URL-rewriting, so that it looks like a path.
