Multiple comparison issue in multivariate logistic regression

I am assessing a bunch of risk factors related to HIV infection by logistic regression. First I will conduct a couple of chi square tests or t-tests to see if each factor is associated with HIV infection or not. Then I will pick those factors with p value less than 0.1 out of the bivariate analysis above and include them in the multivariable logistic regression model (adjusted model). In this case, is multiple comparison a concern for me? Why and why not?
