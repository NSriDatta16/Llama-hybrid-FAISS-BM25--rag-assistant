What is the distribution of sample means of a Cauchy distribution?

Typically when one takes random sample averages of a distribution (with sample size greater than 30) one obtains a normal distribution centering around the mean value. However, I heard that the Cauchy distribution has no mean value. What distribution does one obtain then when obtaining sample means of the Cauchy distribution? Basically for a Cauchy distribution $\mu_x$ is undefined so what is $\mu_{\bar{x}}$ and what is the distribution of $\bar{x}$?
