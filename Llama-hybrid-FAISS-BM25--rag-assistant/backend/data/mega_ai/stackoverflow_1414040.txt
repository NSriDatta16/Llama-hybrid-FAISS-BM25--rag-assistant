One alternative I've seen, in GIS programs, is to abandon putting this at the top of the window altogether. For example, ArcGIS puts the (very few) quite common "commands" in the menu/toolbars, but then has an entire docked window in their UI (which can be turned on and off) that provides a tree view of all of the available commands (they call this ArcToolbox - not too creative of a name on their part, but it makes sense to their users). There are quite a few advantages to this - The main one is that you can have a hierarchical, categorized structure of commands that's fairly fast to navigate. In addition, plugability becomes quite easy, as plugins can just add commands to the tree or create new tree nodes. It's not as elegant, in some ways, but it seems to be fairly easy for most people to handle.
