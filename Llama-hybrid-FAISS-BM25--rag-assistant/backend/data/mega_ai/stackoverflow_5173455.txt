Ensure minimal coverage on new Subversion commits

We have a massive project with almost no unit tests at all. I would like to ensure from now on that the developers commit new features (or bugs!) without minimal coverage for corresponding unit tests. What are some ways to enforce this? We use many tools, so perhaps I can use a plugin (jira, greenhopper, fisheye, sonar, hudson). I was also thinking perhaps a Subversion pre-commit hook, the Commit Acceptance Plugin for jira, or something equivalent. Thoughts?
