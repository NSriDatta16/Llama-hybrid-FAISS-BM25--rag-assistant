Unless your applications share the same domain (e.g. both on example.com, or one on a.example.com and another on b.example.com), cookies won't help you here. You need some session storage that's accessible by both your apps, e.g. in a database that both have access to (for example, that's how stackoverflow.com and serverfault.com do it). However, you need to somehow find out, which user account/session on Site A corresponds to the same account on Site B; you only need to do this once (to continue with SO " associate your accounts ").
