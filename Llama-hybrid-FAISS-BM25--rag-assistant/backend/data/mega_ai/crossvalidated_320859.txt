The memoryless property here means that if the expected waiting time for a new arrival is $\lambda$ and it has already been $t$ since the last event, the expected waiting time is still $\lambda$ and not $\lambda - t$. In the case of your specific example, the "event" that you are waiting for is for a given teller to become available. To translate this into the context of the memoryless property, it means that regardless of how long each of those individual customers has already been talking to their teller prior to your arrival, your estimate is that it will take $\lambda$ time for a teller to become available. When that happens, we have a new observation for the process, you step up to be served and the clock starts all over again for all three tellers . It doesn't matter how long they've already been working with that particular client, all we know is that their window still isn't open and it takes on average an additional $\lambda$ amount time for any teller to become available regardless of how long they've already been at work on a particular customer . Therefore, our estimate of how long it will take for any of the three current customers to get served is the same, so each has an equal chance of being the next one served and, equivalently, the last one to leave.
