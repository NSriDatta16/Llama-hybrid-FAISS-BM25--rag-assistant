Free SWF Obfuscator

Does anybody know of a free flash obfuscator(protector)? All I can find are commercial ones with free trials. I have done numerous google searches, and have been unable to find what I am looking for. I know that obfuscators do not make your swf hack proof, but they make things harder. Things I am looking for in an obfuscator: Unlimited obfuscations No time limit No watermark (or on the left side only! Right side is no good, same with center) Able to publish work (no special player needed other than standard flashplayer) I really was surprised to see how hard it was to find a good obfuscator (tried encoder, protection, etc. instead as well) and how easy it is to find a decompiler.... It is imperative that my code be protected, at least partially, to discourage the hacking of my game.
