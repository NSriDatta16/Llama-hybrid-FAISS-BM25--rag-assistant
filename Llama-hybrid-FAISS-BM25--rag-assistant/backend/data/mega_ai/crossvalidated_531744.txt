Binary classification, F1 score 0=0.95, 1=0.06

I'm building a machine learning model to predict a process failure (1=fail, 0=no-fail). To begin with, I have a class imbalance ratio of 1:51. After some wrangling, I applied Clustering-Based Oversampling to fix the imbalance (ratio 1:1.001). Then I tried a logistic regression model and this were the results: precision recall f1-score support 0 0.98 0.93 0.95 10638 1 0.04 0.15 0.06 208 accuracy 0.91 10846 macro avg 0.51 0.54 0.51 10846 weighted avg 0.96 0.91 0.94 10846 I want to know what does a high F1 score for 0 and low F1 score for 1 means before I go any further experimenting with different algorithms. Info about the dataset: 22 predictive features: 1 numerical continuous, independently normalized with np.log 2 numerical binary (0, 1) 2 numerical ordinal, ranges 1-4 and 0-2 respectively 17 numerical binary that were one-hot encoded from 17 classes (I didn't apply n-1 variables) Info about multicollinearity: I have 6 variables with VIF ranging from 2 to 6. Info about the model: LR = LogisticRegression(C=0.01, solver='liblinear').fit(X_train, y_train.values.ravel())
