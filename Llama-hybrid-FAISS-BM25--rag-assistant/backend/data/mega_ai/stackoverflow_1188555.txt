ok I should have been more clear on why I was clearing down the local repo - I understand this is not a normal step as part of the build cycle. I was clearing down my local repo to emulate what would happen if I tried a build for the very first time and nothing exists on a remote repo. This is because on checking out the parent + modules all the code I need is present. Parent \----module1 (includes assembly classifier) | \----module2 | \----bundle eg build with empty repo from parentbuilds module1, module2 then bundle. All works well in this order: parent, module1, module2, bundle however if I have an empty repos and cd to X then build maven cannot work out that it needs to build the parent which depends on module1 and module2, so if possible I'd like it to build in this order: parent, module1, module2, bundle I think this is not possible in maven as you say there is no mechanism for conditional module builds! I thought maven would support this as it has info on the parent and the parent has info on the children, but I think I was inferring too much. Many thanks for your replies Rich. Getting there with maven but it is like pulling teeth, in large part due to the style of the sonotype manual. ps editing of questions looses context. I didn't realise stackoverflow did this. usenet style had it right first time, write your own reply, include references to former replies if required, post at the bottom. Editing prior posts IMHO erases the flow of a conversation - for some issues the journey to the solution is as instructive as the destination! this last paragraph is 400 chars :-) eg I could not put this comment in as recommended because it goes over the technical sound barrier of 600 characters.
