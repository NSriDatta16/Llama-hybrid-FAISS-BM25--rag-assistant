This type of problem is not all that unusual, as not everyone has control over the version of Python that they use. A few years ago I had this very problem as most of my work took place on a Windows PC, but at one point we needed to run it on a large UNIX box which was subject to strict change control, meaning that I couldn't install Python 2.5. I think even now that box may be running Python 2.4. Looking back on my solution, it wasn't particularly elegant, but here it is... while True: try: from xml.etree.cElementTree import * break except ImportError: pass try: from xml.etree.ElementTree import * break except ImportError: pass try: from cElementTree import * break except ImportError: pass from ElementTree import * break This was part of a module called xmlutils.py which was used by the rest of my code rather than importing xml.etree.ElementTree (or whatever) directly. Edit: I should point out that cElementTree and ElementTree were the names for xml.etree.cElementTree and xml.etree.ElementTree before they became part of the standard library.
