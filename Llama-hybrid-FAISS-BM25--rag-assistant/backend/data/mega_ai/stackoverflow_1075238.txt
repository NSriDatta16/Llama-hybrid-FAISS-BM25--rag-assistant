It can be accomplished very simply in two queries using mysql variables. I would point out that Quassnoi has a great answer that may work better for your application. But this is useful to keep in mind: If you are using a transactional storage engine (innodb): START TRANSACTION; SELECT @myvar := MAX(flag) FROM t WHERE code = '...' UPDATE t SET flag = @myvar WHERE code = '...'; COMMIT; If you are using a non-transactional storage engine (myisam): LOCK TABLES t WRITE; SELECT @myvar := MAX(flag) FROM t WHERE code = '...' UPDATE t SET flag = @myvar WHERE code = '...'; UNLOCK TABLES;
