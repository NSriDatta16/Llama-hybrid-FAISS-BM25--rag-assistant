Programmatically trigger "detect displays."

I’m trying to trigger the same thing that the system does when you click on “Detect Displays” in the “Displays” System Preferences pane. Is there a way to do this programmatically? My goal is to create a LaunchAgent that does this at login to reset the display resolution in case a user messes with it.
