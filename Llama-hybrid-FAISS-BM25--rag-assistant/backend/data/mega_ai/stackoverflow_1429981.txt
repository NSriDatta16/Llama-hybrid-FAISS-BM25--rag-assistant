HttpURLConnection in android doesn't send correct User-Agent header

I have found an issue. I have a server that uses User Agent header to identify the device that is connecting to it. But when i connect to the server using HttpURLConnection i get no User Agent header, but when i connect with the browser it sends the correct User Agent. For testing i am using an echo server that replies with the headers it found on the request. When i connect with browser i get: eg: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 1.5; en-fr; HTC Hero Build/CUPCAKE) AppleWebKit/528.5+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Mobile Safari/525.20.1 Up.Link/6.3.1.20.06.3.1.20.0. But when i connect by code with UrlConnection i get: User-Agent: UNAVAILABLE. Does anyone know we i get different behaviors? How i can i connect in the same way the browser does? EDIT: What i really need is not only the User-Agent header, i also need some special headers (x-up-subno actually). This header is added by the APN of the operator, but for some reason when i connect by code that headers are not added to the request. From browser: From code: Thanks,
