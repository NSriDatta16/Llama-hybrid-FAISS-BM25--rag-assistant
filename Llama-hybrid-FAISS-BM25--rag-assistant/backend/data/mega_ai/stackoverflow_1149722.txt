Can't believe nobody has mentioned the Perl Best Practices . There's also a Twitter feed that delivers one PBP per day. I learned Perl from Robert's Perl Tutorial , which I recommend, but it hasn't been updated since 1999. A newer recommended tutorial is Steve's Perl Tutorial . For web development with Perl, the clear winner is Catalyst , and the Catalyst wiki is the starting point for learning.
