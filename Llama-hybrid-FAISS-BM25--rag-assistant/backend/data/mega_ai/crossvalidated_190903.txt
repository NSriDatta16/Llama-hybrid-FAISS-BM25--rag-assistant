Financial time series data: Imputing before or after calculating returns?

I've got several time series of daily prices ($(p_t^j)_{t=1,\dots,n}$ ) of different tradable cards $j=1,\dots,k$. I'd like to calculate the time series of the (log)returns $r_t= \log(\frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}})$ (omitting the index $j$ here in favor of readability. For some $t$, the value of $p_t$ is missing. To make the different time series of returns comparable for different cards, I'd like to use some kind of imputation technique (haven't decided on what to use yet - probably hot deck for a start). If $p_t$ is missing, should I rather use an imputed value $p'_t$ to calculate $r_{t}= \log(\frac{p'_t}{p_{t-1}})$ and $r_{t+1}= \log(\frac{p_{t+1}}{p'_{t}})$, or should I consider $r_{t}$ and $r_{t+1}$ as missing and impute them directly as $r'_t$ and $r'_{t+1}$? Apart from trying both variants and validating which will create the better time series (by whatever measure), are there more general aspects to consider when doing this kind of imputation?
