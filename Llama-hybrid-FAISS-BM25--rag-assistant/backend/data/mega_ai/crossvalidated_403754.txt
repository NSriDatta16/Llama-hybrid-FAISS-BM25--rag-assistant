Randomized search can take long for a big dataset, this is quite normal. You should check the parameter n_jobs which helps to parallelize the search and make it faster ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html ). However, in general there are more optimised solutions for this, i.a. bayesian optimization (check out this great blog post with python code: https://thuijskens.github.io/2016/12/29/bayesian-optimisation/ ). Instead of selecting hyperparameters randomly without any strategy, bayesian optimization tries to find hyperparameters that lead to better results than in the last setting. You approach a better solution step-for-step and probably in less time.
