Isaac is right that you could reduce the features to lines, and use them as shared boundaries. But the software he mentions - FME - has a transformer called the Generalizer which will simplify them as you wish while still retaining them as polygons. The option to use is called 'Preserve Shared Boundaries'. You can download FME from [here][1] and request a 14-day eval license to try it out.
