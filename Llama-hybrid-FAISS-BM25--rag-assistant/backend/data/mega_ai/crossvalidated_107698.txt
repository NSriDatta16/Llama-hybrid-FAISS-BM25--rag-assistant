First you have sample images data that should be given as a training to your neural network. Then for your input images try to d-sample them in some fixed small array size and then give d-sampled image as input to your neural network. Learn from the example of OCR Click here find the code here In above image you can see it try to match d-sampled image array with stored character images. For your definition make small d-sampled images for objects and then give them as training data for example, plane image, car image. Increase the size of the matrix for d-sampling. Because in my program i was just d-sampling characters. You will need bigger matrix to properly store objects. You need some algorithm to d-sample properly and try to convert image in black and white. and also try algorithm to detect and crop object from an image to d-sampled one. Try learning encog framework image processing examples with various neural networks.
