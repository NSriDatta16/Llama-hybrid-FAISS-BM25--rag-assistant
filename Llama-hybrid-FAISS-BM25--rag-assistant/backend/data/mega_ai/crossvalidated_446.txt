The Gelman books are all excellent but not necessarily introductory in that they assume that you know some statistics already. Therefore they are an introduction to the Bayesian way of doing statistics rather than to statistics in general. I would still give them the thumbs up, however. As an introductory statistics/econometrics book which takes a Bayesian perspective, I would recommend Gary Koop's Bayesian Econometrics .
