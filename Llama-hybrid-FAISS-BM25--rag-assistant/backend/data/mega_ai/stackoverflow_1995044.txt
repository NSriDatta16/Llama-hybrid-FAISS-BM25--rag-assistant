You need to use config.AppSettings.Settings["DataStorageLocation"] . See the MSDN documentation for a sample. Alternatively, and IMHO better, you could use System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[name] to access the AppSettings of the host application. This is probably more flexible than your technique, as it will also work if your DAL assembly is, for example, hosted in a service tier on IIS. Accessing configuration information from the host application's configuration file directly in this way is perfectly accceptable, and generally better than passing configuration information down through the layers.
