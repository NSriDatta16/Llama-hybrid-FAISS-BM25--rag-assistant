How do I suppress an unused dummy argument warning for a single function in Fortran?

I have the following FORTRAN code: FUNCTION inverse_deterministic_cdf(dist, p) RESULT(value) !=========== result ============ REAL(C_DOUBLE) :: value !====== input parameters ======= TYPE(deterministic), INTENT(IN) :: dist REAL(C_DOUBLE), INTENT(IN) :: p !======= subroutine body ======= value = p ! This is only here to suppress unused dummy argument warning value = dist%value END FUNCTION inverse_deterministic_cdf In this case, inverse_deterministic_cdf is an implementation of an inverse_cdf interface, which is why there's the unused p here. As you can see, I have a method of suppressing the unused dummy argument, but it feels inelegant to me. Does anyone have any best practices for how they handle this? (I also want this to be compiler agnostic.) I know how to suppress the warnings universally, but I want to be warned when I have an unused dummy argument and I'm not anticipating it. Edit to add (upon request): The inverse_cdf interface is defined thusly: INTERFACE inverse_cdf MODULE PROCEDURE inverse_distribution_cdf, inverse_normal_cdf, inverse_lognormal_cdf, inverse_deterministic_cdf END INTERFACE
