Eclipse updates are extremely slow

Today I tried to download EGit plug-in from eclipse.org, and waited an hour and nothing happened. I tried three more times, waited for three hours and stopped. Then I tried to clone egit from the repository developers, but it began to clone at a rate of 5kbps. Then I thought maybe something wrong with my Eclipse, and decided to download a new one. Eclipse main site opened with a super-slow speed (although bigger than 5kbps). I'm just afraid to download the installer at this speed. Can anybody repoduce it? What should I do?
