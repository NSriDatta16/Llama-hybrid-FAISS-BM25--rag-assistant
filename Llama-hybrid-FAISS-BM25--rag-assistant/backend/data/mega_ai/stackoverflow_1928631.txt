UITableViewCell reorganize subviews when the 'delete' button appears

Does anyone knows any method to resize subviews(I.E. UILabelView) when Delete button appears. There could be two methods: 1.Capture a notification, if there's one, when the button appears in the UITableViewCell 2.Tell the framework re-arange it automatically.
