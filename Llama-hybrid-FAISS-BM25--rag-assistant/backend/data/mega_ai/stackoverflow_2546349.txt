Typically I organize like so: project/ main.py models.py app.yaml index.yaml templates/ main.html foo.html ... styles/ project.css js/ jquery.js project.js images/ icon.png something.jpg And I have all of my handlers in main.py, all of my models in models.py, etc. If I have a lot of handlers, and I can easily split the functionality of some handlers from the others (like taskqueue handlers vs. request handlers vs. xmpp/email handlers) I'll add another foo_handlers.py to the mix, but usually I just cram them all in main.py But then again, I tend not to write hugely complex Python App Engine apps...
