Jython: Making a simple beep on Windows

I'm working with Sikuli, which (I think) is build on Jython. I want to make a script that does a small gentle beep to attract the user's attention. (This is on Windows.) How can I do this? I see that the winsound module is not available on Jython. (Note that I want to use the sound card, not the built-in beeper.)
