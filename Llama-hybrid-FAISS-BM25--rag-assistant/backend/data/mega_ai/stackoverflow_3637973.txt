Waiting for execvp in main

int main() { ... if(!fork()) { execvp(cmdName,cmdParam); } printf("In main()..."); return(0); } Assuming I have correctly passed the cmdName & cmdParam arguments, how do I wait for the process created by execvp to finish, before resuming the execution of main()? Does the execvp() create a process which is a child of the newly fork()ed process?
