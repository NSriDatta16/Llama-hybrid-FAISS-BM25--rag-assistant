The bootstrapped confidence intervals for ORs are strangely big or small in my binary logistic regression. Are they valid in the first place?

This question is an extension to my previous question , although it is not repeated. My bootstrapped ORs are OK. They are equal to non-bootstrapped ORs. However, the confidence intervals of the bootstrapped and non-bootstrapped regressions differ vastly. While the non-bootstrapped regression reports for example OR's 95% CI ~= 1.2 to 2.3, the bootstrapped one reports OR's 95% CI ~= 1.1 to 25000. It is strange and non-practical . My questions are: Is this bootstrapped OR CI correct ? Can I keep my bootstrapped model in my study for its advantages, but report the non-bootstrapped OR CI? Can I report both regressions? Many thanks.
