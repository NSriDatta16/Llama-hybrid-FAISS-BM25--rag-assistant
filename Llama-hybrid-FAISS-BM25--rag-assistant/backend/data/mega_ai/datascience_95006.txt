Once the training is completed, use your trained model instance in a NER pipeline , using the same tokenizer as before: from transformers import pipeline nlp = pipeline('ner', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer) s = "I am Joe and live in London" print(nlp(s)) Don't forget to save your model after training using save_pretrained !
