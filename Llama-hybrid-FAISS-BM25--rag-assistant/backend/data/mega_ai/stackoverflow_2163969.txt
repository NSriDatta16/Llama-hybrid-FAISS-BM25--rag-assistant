Embedding RSS and Twitter onto Static FBML?

I've been asked to build a facebook fan page, that displays the latest RSS from a blog and the latest tweets from an user. Something just like this: http://www.facebook.com/ibmargentina?v=app_223277347226&ref=ts I already know the basics for working with FBML, but I can't figure how can I display external data... Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance..
