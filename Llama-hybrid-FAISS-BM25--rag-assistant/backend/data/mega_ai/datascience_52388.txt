Generative network understanding

I was going through GAN's notebook by fchallot on Generative Adversarial Networks where, in the Generator Network , he creates a Dense layer with $16*16 * 128$ (where 128 is the number of channels). How exactly does latent_dim=32 becomes of shape $16 * 16$ in the network. How are these values decided?
