Most file system designs today are taken from Unix operating systems design (like Unix has hierarchical FS before VMS), as Unix become more popular then its FS become the main stream. Then these concepts were taken to other OSes. Unix had not versions of files. Later, different approach was taken for keeping older version - snapshots. They have advantage in that they are atomic and take entire snapshot of all system. It has also significant advantage of saving lots of space for files that are partially updated. So today, if somebody thinks of supporting versions it is better to do with snapshots (as many file systems are support them and of course all modern storage systems). So, this useful feature died together with operating systems like OpenVMS (that is almost dead today)
