Yes, in most cases all of your authentication should go through the same controller. However, Zend Auth is not a controller type. Zend Auth is an API for utilizing common authentication methods like a database or http. Its job is really just to be a wrapper around the grunt work of writing authentication code. Zend Acl is what you are looking for to distinguish between normal and privileged users. You only involve Zend Acl after the users have authenticated and logged in. Most of what you need is in the ZF documentation. I read almost all of the documentation for Auth and Acl before it made great sense to me. Even though ZF's Auth, ACL, Storage_* and other classes are used very closely together, they all serve very distinct purposes. With a little time you will see that they build on each other nicely.
