If you implement the add method to insert the element in sorted order (or anywhere but the end of the list), you are violating the contract of the List interface. Semantically, it's not a List , and it isn't safe to pass it to any code that is expecting one. Pretending to implement the List interface will only lead to trouble. How about using a TreeSet ? instead? Set list = new TreeSet (); Of course, a Set will not permit duplicate elements. If you want something that allows duplicates, but still allows efficient, in-order retrieval, try a heap-based collection, like PriorityQueue .
