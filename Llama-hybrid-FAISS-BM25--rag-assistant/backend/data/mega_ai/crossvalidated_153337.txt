Traffic volume/flow prediction method

I have traffic volume data (Surrey City, CA) like this I wish to use Artificial neural network (Deep Learning) or ARIMA to predict traffic flow/volume of the urban area with the use of previous traffic count data. I want to know whether it is a good technique to predict traffic condition. I want to make the data 2013 as training set and the data 2014 as a testing. Is it possible to do traffic flow/volume prediction in next time period if only use this dataset or we need other data to support it? Did I choose the right method? Or which method is suitable for this case? I really appreciate if somebody could help me with how to do that... I need guidance, I am new in neural networks.
