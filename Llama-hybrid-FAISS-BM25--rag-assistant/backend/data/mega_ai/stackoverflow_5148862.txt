They're tied to the page, effectively; a result which returns the homepage won't include content from another page. As with any other organic ranking scenario, Google aims to return the best individual page for a query; as such, if it percieves your homepage to be a more authoritive resource and result for the search query, it'll return that rather than the page containing the microformatted data. I'd tentatively suggest that the wider problem is one of value attribution, and that undertaking some page-level SEO in order to clearly signpost content/context, and to ensure that content is distinct and relevant at page-level (and in one place for one topic) might help.
