SQL Server Agent Job Timeout

I have just had a scheduled SQL Server job run for longer than normal, and I could really have done with having set a timeout to stop it after a certain length of time. I might be being a bit blind on this, but I can't seem to find a way of setting a timeout for a job. Does anyone know the way to do it? Thanks
