Explain Root Mean Square Error to non-technical audience

My company is in the process of switching equipment from one vendor to another. We measured several metrics from the existing and new equipment and compared the time series. The ideal is to have no difference between the old and new equipment. For that, we use Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the difference. We are to present the findings to upper management and employees at the plant, many of whom have no background in statistics. How should I explain the concept of RMSE to those audiences? If series X and Y have an RMSE of 5, how should I explain that 5 in layman's terms?
