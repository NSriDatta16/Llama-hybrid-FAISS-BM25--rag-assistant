I've used PHPUnit with good results. PHPUnit, like other JUnit-derived projects, requires that code to be tested be organized into classes. If your project is not object-oriented, then you'll need to start refactoring non-procedural code into functions, and functions into classes. I've not personally used a JavaScript framework, though I would image that these frameworks would also require that your code be structured into (at least) callable functions if not full-blown objects. For testing GUI applications, you may benefit from using Selenium , though a checklist written by a programmer with good QA instincts might work just fine. I've found that using MediaWiki or your favorite Wiki engine is a good place to store checklists and related project documentation.
