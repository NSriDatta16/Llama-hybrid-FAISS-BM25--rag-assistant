Residual deviance difference between multinom() and vglm() function

I have used two functions multinom() in package nnet and vglm() in package (VGAM) to make a multinomial logistic regression. # packages require(nnet) require(VGAM) require(foreign) # load data gator The coefficients obtained from these two models are similar. However, the residual deviance are by far different (540 and 52, respectively). But, these above differences only observed for response variable in matrix form. When response variable is presented in single column, both approach gives the same residual deviance (359.96) and AIC (375.96). # load data ml Could you help me explain why they are different?
