$K_y$ represents $K(old, old)$ . You are marginalizing out the Prior over function values, which is explained in the "Prior" section of the blog. By marginalizing out the prior over function values you are able to optimize parameters of kernel function(in the case of RBF kernel it is $l$ and $\sigma_f$ ) based on the information you acquire from the training data. I believe this blog is a review of the some chapters of "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams". The book explains the concepts clearly.
