How to take daylight savings time in to consideration when converting timezones in Javascript?

Currently I have this code: var databaseTimeZoneMS = -240 * 60000; var time = ('' + date_str).replace(/-/g,"/").replace(/[TZ]/g," "), dt = new Date, seconds = ((dt - new Date(time) + ((dt.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000) + databaseTimeZoneMS)) / 1000), However, if daylight savings time is not in effect databaseTimeZoneMS should be -300 * 60000. How can I check if it is daylight savings time? Is this even the right way of solving this problem? It seems rather messy and inelegant.
