break/interrupt a time.sleep() in python

I need to break from time.sleep() using ctrl c. While 1: time.sleep(60) In the above code when the control enters time.sleep function an entire 60 seconds needs to elapsed for python to handled the CTRL C Is there any elegant way to do it. such that I can interrupt even when the control is in time.sleep function edit I was testing it on a legacy implementation which uses python 2.2 on windows 2000 which caused all the trouble . If I had used a higher version of python CTRL C would have interrupted the sleep() . I did a quick hack by calling sleep(1) inside a for loop . which temporarily fixed my issue
