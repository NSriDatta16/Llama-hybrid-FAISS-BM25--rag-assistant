Average of logs or log of average

The primary outcome of a clinical trial is the proportion of individuals with a >2 log10 decrease in viral load at Week 24. Viral load is measured on 3 consecutive days at baseline & again at 3 consecutive days at Week 24 (an average is used as variability is expected). In order to calculate the log decrease, is it correct to either a) log10 the individual results & calculate the average, or b) average the raw results & log10 this? Eg, Suppose for one individual, results were 1300, 1250, & 2000 are obtained at baseline & at Week 24, results were 700, 600, 450. Would the log10 decrease be: a) average(log10(1300),log10(1250),log10(2000)) - average(log10(700),log10(600),log10(450) = 3.171 - 2.759 = 0.412 b) log10{average(1300,1250,2000)} - log10{average(700,600,450)} = = log10(1516.67) - log10(583.33) = 3.181 - 2.766 = 0.415
