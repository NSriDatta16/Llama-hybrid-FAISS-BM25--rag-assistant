Strange error with Tooltips and TitleWindow

I'm developing an application with TitleWindows that are created using the PopUpManager so they can be dragged. Buttons on a ButtonBar display them. After some testing, I found out that the error below is triggered when I am displaying the TitleWindow for the third time (not first or second, but only third) and I try to retrieve the ToolTip from either the Button on the ButtonBar or the TabNavigator in the TitleWindow (by hovering the mouse over these components). RangeError: Error #2006: The supplied index is out of bounds. at flash.display::DisplayObjectContainer/addChildAt() at mx.managers::SystemManager/http://www.adobe.com/2006/flex/mx/internal::rawChildren_addChildAt() at mx.managers::SystemChildrenList/addChild() at mx.managers::SystemManager/addChildToSandboxRoot() at mx.managers::ToolTipManagerImpl/http://www.adobe.com/2006/flex/mx/internal::createTip() at mx.managers::ToolTipManagerImpl/http://www.adobe.com/2006/flex/mx/internal::showTimer_timerHandler() at flash.utils::Timer/_timerDispatch() at flash.utils::Timer/tick() Also, when I try clicking the Button to display the TitleWindow for the fourth time and I'm faster than the ToolTip to avoid the error, I get this error: RangeError: Error #2006: The supplied index is out of bounds. at flash.display::DisplayObjectContainer/addChildAt() at mx.managers::SystemManager/http://www.adobe.com/2006/flex/mx/internal::rawChildren_addChildAt() at mx.managers::SystemManager/addChild() at mx.managers::PopUpManagerImpl/addPopUp() at mx.managers::PopUpManager$/addPopUp() at assets.components::FloatingWindow/show() at MethodInfo-1879() I have a FloatingWindow class (attached) which extends TitleWindow, and then I'm creating a new class called SearchWindow which extends the FloatingWindow. The ButtonBar is in a class that extends HBox. The ButtonBar has the following function to display the SearchWindow: function searchButton_click(event:MouseEvent):void { //Show Search Window if (searchWindow.removed == true) { searchWindow.map = _map; searchWindow.webService = wsGetData; searchWindow.show(30); } } The pattern of this error is strange. Why just on the 3rd time do I get the error with the ToolTip and 4th time with the Poping up the TitleWindow? Could part of the problem be my leap-frogging of classes? I have a custom ButtonBar class, where the SearchWindow is created, which is a custom class based off another custom class (FloatingWindow), which is based off TitleWindow. Can this be the cause of the problem? Any help is greatly appreciated.
