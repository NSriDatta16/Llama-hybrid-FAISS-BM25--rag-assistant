Short answer: Yes. Longer answer: Consider a dependent variable $y$ consisting $J$ categories, than a multinomial logit model would model the probability that $y$ falls in category $m$ as: $ \mathrm{Pr}(y=m | x) = \frac{\exp(x\beta_m)}{\sum_{j=1}^J \exp(x\beta_j)} $ where $\beta_1 = 0$. So if $y$ has three categories (1,2,3), you could get the three probabilities as: $ \mathrm{Pr}(y=1 | x) = \frac{\exp(x0)}{\exp(x0) + \exp(x\beta_2) + \exp(x\beta_3)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(x\beta_2) + \exp(x\beta_3)} $ $ \mathrm{Pr}(y=2 | x) = \frac{\exp(x\beta_2)}{1 + \exp(x\beta_2) + \exp(x\beta_3)} $ $ \mathrm{Pr}(y=3 | x) = \frac{\exp(x\beta_3)}{1 + \exp(x\beta_2) + \exp(x\beta_3)} $ In your special case where $y$ has two categories this condences to: $ \mathrm{Pr}(y=1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(x\beta_2) } $ $ \mathrm{Pr}(y=2 | x) = \frac{\exp(x\beta_2)}{1 + \exp(x\beta_2) } $ This is exactly a binary logistic regression.
