PCA finds the clusters by maximizing the sample variances. So, to compare PCA the best possible quantitative measure is one that utilizes this fact. The one I can think of right now is "the average variance of all the clusters weighted by cluster size". You can think of a better quantitative measure keeping in mind the working principle of PCA & features of your dataset.
