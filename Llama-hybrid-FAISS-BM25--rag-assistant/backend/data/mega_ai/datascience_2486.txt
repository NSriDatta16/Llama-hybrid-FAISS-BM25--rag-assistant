Visualizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Multiple Explanatory Variables

I was wondering if anyone was aware of any methods for visualizing an SVM model where there are more than three continuous explanatory variables. In my particular situation, my response variable is binomial, with 6 continuous explanatory variables (predictors), one categorical explanatory variable (predictor). I have already reduced the number of predictors and I am primarily using R for my analysis. (I am unaware if such a task is possible/ worth pursuing.) Thanks for your time.
