You are taking the time series aspect into account, since you are modeling that certain data points come from the same persons. If you have only two data points per person, an AR or similar model doesn't make a lot of sense. Your presentation of uncertainty is also nice. I'm more concerned about the fact that you are running a Bayesian model with eight parameters and eight data points. I'd expect your results to heavily depend on the priors. Have you varied the priors to see what influence they have? You should be able to get more citation counts than for just two years (that are 40 years apart). If you could get more data, you could probably do more sophisticated modeling. And I'm not so sure whether your data are just a sample . Yes, of course it is a sample of the base population of "all researchers". But if you are only interested in your four specific researchers, then whether or not your data are "just a sample" depends on whether there are citations to these people's work that are not captured in your citation counts. And while Google Scholar and similar are imprecise in counting citations, I'd still think they are 90% correct, so the difference between your data and the base population (all citations to A-D) is pretty small. In which case, it isn't very helpful to do a whole lot of statistical inference. Best to just report the raw numbers.
