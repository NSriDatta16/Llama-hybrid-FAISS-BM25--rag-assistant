I'm a fellow physicist that transitioned to data science. Let me start by telling you that you have more than enough knowledge to work in industry right now, you just need to translate well your skills into an industry oriented CV, which is very different from an academic CV. I don't think that online courses will aggregate much weight in your CV after a PhD and so many years of experience. I recommend you to invest time on developing some projects from data analysis to model deployment using current industry technologies. Learn how to work on cloud based systems, such as AWS or Azure. Invest some time on how to do quality code, use versioning tools such as git, containerisation (docker), and learn SQL. I'm sure all the statistics and mathematics are well covered already by your previous experience. Domain knowledge is also important when companies hire data scientists, so if you want to move to a specific field that is not related to physics, you should also study about it a little bit. Another thing, get involved with the data science community where you live. Try to find meet-ups and events to participate. This can help you grow your network in the right direction and find new opportunities.
