Storage of private and public key in MySQL-DB

Probably somebody asked that already, but I couldn't find any usefull information and I've never done it before. So here is the problem. If I'll get a set of key pairs (DSA public and private keys) with different time validity and unique ID, what is the best way to store them in MySQL-DB using Java? Is it a good idea at all to store them in DB? Thank you in advance. Mur Ps. another problem, i cann't really imagine, how do the both keys look like? just byte arrays?
