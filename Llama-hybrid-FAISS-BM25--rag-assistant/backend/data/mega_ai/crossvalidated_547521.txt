Some insight can be achieved by writing the WAPE explicitly as a weighted average. Recall that with any data $x_i$ and corresponding weights $\omega_i$ (not summing to zero) the weighted average of the data is $$\operatorname{WA}(\mathbf x, \mathbf \omega) = \frac{1}{\sum_i \omega_i}\,\sum_{i}\omega_i x_i.$$ (When all the $\omega_i$ are equal and nonzero, this equals the usual arithmetic mean.) Comparing to the WAPE suggests we let $$x_i = 100\, \frac{y_i - \hat y_i}{y_i}$$ be the relative residuals (in percent) of the data $y_i$ with respect to their predicted values $\hat y_i$ and let the weights be $$\omega_i = y_i.$$ Assuming all the $y_i$ are positive, so that all these ratios are defined and $|y_i|=y_i,$ we may rewrite the WAPE as $$\begin{aligned} \operatorname{WAPE}(\mathbf x, \mathbf \omega) &= 100 \frac{\sum_i|y_i-\hat y_i|}{\sum_i y_i} = \frac{1}{\sum_i y_i}\,\sum_i \left| 100\, y_i \frac{y_i - \hat y_i}{y_i} \right| = \frac{1}{\sum_i \omega_i}\, \sum_i \omega_i \left|x_i\right|\\ &=\operatorname{WA}(|\mathbf x|, \mathbf \omega). \end{aligned}$$ This reveals two things: Yes, the WAPE is a weighted average percent : the percents are the absolute residuals $\left|y_i - \hat y_i\right|$ relative to the data $y_i$ and the weights are the $y_i.$ This is a little strange, because ordinarily one would express residuals relative to the fitted values, which would make the $\hat y_i$ the weights as well as the denominators of the $x_i.$ There are many reasons for (2). For instance, most valid models of non-negative data will guarantee $\hat y_i \ne 0$ even when the observations $y_i$ might be zero or even negative (think of what an additive error term can do to a positive value). As a result, it would be much more difficult to conduct a theoretical analysis of the statistical properties of your version of the WAPE in most situations. I therefore doubt one can find many applications in the literature or even a standard name for it. There are a huge number of ways to measure relative errors. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/201864/919 for a brief introductory account.
