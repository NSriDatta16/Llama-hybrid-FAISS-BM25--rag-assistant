Python Apache local/internal server error?

I am creating HTML form and using Python to code it. I have installed Apache version2.2 and Python version 2.6. Here is the code: #!C:\Python26\Python.exe -u #import cgi modules import cgi #create instances of field storage form = cgi.FieldStorage() #get data from the fields first_name = form.getvalue('first_name') last_name = form.getvalue('last_name') print "Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n" print " " print " " print " Hello - Second CGI Program " print " " print " " print " Hello %s %s " % (first_name, last_name) print " " print " " The code I have written gives me an internal error. But, when I remove the following lines it runs fine. #import cgi modules import cgi #create instances of field storage form = cgi.FieldStorage() #get data from the fields first_name = form.getvalue('first_name') last_name = form.getvalue('last_name') I edited the httpd config file and added lines: AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py .pl ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/cgi-bin/" Why is internal error message being displayed when the lines are added? And, I am new to building HTML forms in Python. Suggestions on tutorials on HTML form using Python for Windows would be really helpful. Thanks. PS: The files containing script are located in cgi-bin Apache folder.
