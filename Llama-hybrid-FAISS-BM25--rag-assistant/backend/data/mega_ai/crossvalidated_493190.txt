Why does the causal markov condition allow for the interpretation of a bayesian network as a causal diagram?

A related question is here . As far as I can understand from scanning reviews on causal discovery , there are two critical conditions, (1) the causal markov condition and (2) causal faithfulness. It is not clear to me that either of these conditions fails for just 'standard' Bayesian networks, and, how the PC/FCI algorithms or other algorithms out there, constrain the search space for Bayesian networks with a causal interpretation. Concretely then, my question would be: How does the PC algorithm find Bayesian networks with a causal interpretation, versus just any algorithm to find Bayesian networks in general? We know that we can find multiple Bayesian networks that satisfy conditional independence relations, but what allows us to interpret the output of PC algorithms to have that causal interpretation? Additionally, this example on 3 nodes clarified for me that you can have several Bayesian networks, but only one which has certain values in the interventional probabilities that can be checked against data. Still, I am confused as to how causal discovery algorithms encode these interventional probabilities (or something equivalent to it) to check against data.
