One way you could do this is: Save the canvas contents as a base64 encoded PNG image by calling canvas.toDataURL() and store the encoded string in the page's localStorage . When you want to restore the canvas, you would create an image, set the src to be the value previously stored locally and then draw that image on the canvas. There are other methods, such as recording all the drawing operations, storing them locally or in a server session and 'replaying' them when the page is next visited.
