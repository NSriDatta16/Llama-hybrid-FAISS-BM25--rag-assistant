Reference on Time Series Parameter Estimation

I'm trying to learn techniques for estimating the parameters of standard time series (AR, ARMA, GARCH, etc.), and can't seem to find a solid resource online. Specifically, I'd like one that addresses the estimate of standard errors of such estimates as well. An example of what I'd like to learn is from my question here . I'd like some references to texts/online resources that explain these issues well.
