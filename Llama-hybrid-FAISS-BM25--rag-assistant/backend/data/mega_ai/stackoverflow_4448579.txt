Is it possible to implement a "slide-to-scroll" behaviour for ScrollViewer?

For a touchscreen-enabled application, I would like to modify the standard ScrollViewer controls in my WPF 3.5 application: Instead of showing scrollbars, I want the user to scroll by clicking in the control area and dragging the content (similar to the behaviour on Apple's iPhone). I would like to do that by applying a style to the ScrollViewer, because (a) I can apply a style automatically to any ScrollViewer in a window (even the ones contained in controls like ListView) and (b) I can use the standard Windows Scrollbar-style if the application is running on a normal desktop with keyboard and mouse. My first idea was to use a custom control template for the ScrollViewer. The default control template is described in the MSDN and uses a ScrollContentPresenter. Normally, I would just derive a class from ScrollContentPresenter and add the slide-to-scroll behaviour there, but for some reason, ScrollContentPresenter is sealed - I can't derive from it. I've tried putting a ScrollContentPresenter into a UserControl, and putting the user control into the ScrollViewer control template, but that didn't work either. Is there a simple way to get this behaviour, without re-writing all the ScollViewer/ScrollContentPresenter functionality?
