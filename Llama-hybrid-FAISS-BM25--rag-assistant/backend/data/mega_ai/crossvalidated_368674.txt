Using Class Probabilities from Random Forest to do Ranking

Assume that we have set of documents which are being labelled as relevant and non-relevant. Can I used the class probabilities generated by Random Forest in python scikit-learn to rank the documents based on the probabilities? #generate synthetic data X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=4, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=0, shuffle=False) clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=0) clf.fit(X, y) predictions = clf.predict_proba([[0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 7, 5, 2]]) print(predictions) Assume the example above which I have two documents, where each document has four features. The probabilities generated by RF will be as follow: [0.14297294 0.85702706] [0.29163087 0.70836913] The left column is probabilities for relevant and the right column is probabilities for irrelevant. I plan to used the probability score on the left column to rank the documents accordingly. Is it the right way to do ranking with Random Forest?
