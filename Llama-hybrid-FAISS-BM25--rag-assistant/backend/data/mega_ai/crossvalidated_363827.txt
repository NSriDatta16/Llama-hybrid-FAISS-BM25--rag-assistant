As @ChrisUmphlett suggests, you can do this by stepwise reduction of a logistic model fit. However, depending on what you're trying to use this for, I would strongly encourage you to read some of the criticisms of stepwise regression on CV first. There are certain very narrow contexts in which stepwise regression works adequately (e.g. simplifying an existing model for clinical use , or "lazy" picking of a predictive model in cases with a well-powered study, a relatively small number of predictors, and interest only in prediction rather than inference (Murtaugh 2009 Ecology Letters 12:1061-1068)), but there is almost always a better solution. probably a better solution: penalized logistic regression set.seed(1001) X You do have to read and understand a bit more to use penalized regression approaches: e.g. see this quick intro by Trevor Hastie . still want to do stepwise logistic regression? dd
