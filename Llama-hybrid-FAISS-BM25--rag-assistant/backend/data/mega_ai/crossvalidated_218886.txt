There is a huge literature on time series classification and clustering in the data mining community. Many algorithms have been proposed, many similarity metrics invented. But, as pointed out by [1], a large number of these algo are not effective in real world applications. The ref section should get you started on this topic. [1] Keogh, E., & Kasetty, S. (2003). On the need for time series data mining benchmarks: a survey and empirical demonstration. Data Mining and knowledge discovery, 7(4), 349-371.
