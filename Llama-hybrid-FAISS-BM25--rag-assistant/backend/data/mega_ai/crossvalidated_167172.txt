Two things to consider (generally speaking): Overfitting is not a concern Random Forests, and the most improvement will come in the first few hundred trees. If you just want to run it once and get a pretty good answer, I'd set n to 1500 or more and you should be in pretty good shape. If you're implementing this in R, the foreach package makes it pretty easy to implement random forest in parallel, so if you have 4 or 8 cores you should be able to significantly decrease the training time of your model.
