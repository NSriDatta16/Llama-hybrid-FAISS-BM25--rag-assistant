Decide what is the "best model" depends on the analyst criteria as well as performance metrics. If you are starting you can check the site: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/7 auto.arima function from forecast package in R can help you with the initial step. It creates several models and retrieves the best, according to AIC ( Akaike Information Criterion ) statistic. The AIC (which is indeed very similar to BIC) bases on two key concepts: Accuracy of the model Complexity of the model. In general terms, more parameters (more variables) tend to provide more accuracy but incurring in overfitting. For example, an Arima(3,0,1) is more complex than Arima(1,0,1). AIC intends to be a good trade-off between complexity and accuracy. This concept applies to other predictive models if you build a random forest model you will pick those few variables (complexity) that maximize the prediction (accuracy) To check if the time series if stationary check this full example: http://www.statosphere.com.au/check-time-series-stationary-r/
