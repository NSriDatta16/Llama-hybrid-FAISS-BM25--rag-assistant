Model averaging - models with different covariates

I have run models using negative binomial glm.nb() in R and have 3 top models with really close AIC ( M1 How can I average coefficients if the covariates are not in all the models? Do I have to add "0" to my models? I tried using summary((model.avg(candidate models)) and modavg.glm() but neither of those commands seems to want to compute my estimates because my models are negative binomial. Although when I read the MuMIn's pdf it said that glm.nb was supported by model.avg. Is there somthing else that I should write on the command?
