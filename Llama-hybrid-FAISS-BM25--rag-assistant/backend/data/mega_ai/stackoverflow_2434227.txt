Normally, you cannot directly access a CHECKEDOUT version, since the actual content is stored locally (for snapshot views) or in the local View Storage (for dynamic views). The ClearCase server knows about the CHECKEDOUT status (which is why you see it in the config spec), but won't have its content. The only way you could access a CHECKEDOUT version would be: if the file has been CHECKEDOUT in a dynamic view if you can that remote dynamic view from your workstation Then you will actually see both the dynamic view and the storage space of that dynamic view (which, for dynamic views, contains private files and checked out files) In short, the only way is to somehow access "the other view" (impossible with snapshot views unless you have a physical access to the workstation where the view has been created, possible with dynamic views which can be "mounted" on any ClearCase client)
