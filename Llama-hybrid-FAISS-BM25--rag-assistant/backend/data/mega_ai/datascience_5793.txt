What is the difference between Latent and Explicit Semantic Analysis

I'm not quite sure what "latent" refers to in this context. In Computing Semantic Relatedness using Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis they say ''Our semantic analysis is explicit in the sense that we manipulate manifest concepts grounded in human cognition, rather than 'latent concepts' used by Latent Semantic Analysis''. What does that mean in simple terms? I had a look at the related Wikipedia articles, ( Latent (wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis), Explicit wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_semantic_analysis) ), and I wasn't able to make heads or tails of it. Perhaps someone with a better appreciate of the nuance involved here might be able to provide me with a clear indication of the similarities and differences, the pros and cons between these two methods for accessing document/text fragment relatedness to a particular concept.
