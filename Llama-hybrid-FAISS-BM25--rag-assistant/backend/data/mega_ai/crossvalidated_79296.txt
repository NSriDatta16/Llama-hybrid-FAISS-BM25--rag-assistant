The statement "Won't that μβ(x^3) be computed using x4 and x5 recursively?" is true if x^3 were an unknown message but once observed it has collapsed to a specific value and the property of μβ being a function means you don't have any other dependency (as it has no other arguments) Solving this multi-step markov was factorised into solving each step in "message space". Each message encodes a pdf function. Usually approximated by mean and variance only. The "product" step is a product of probabilities .. the combined message usually has a mean like a "certainty" weighted average and the variance generally reduces as the solution converges.
