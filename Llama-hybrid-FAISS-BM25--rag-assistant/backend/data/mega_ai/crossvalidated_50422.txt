Cumulative counts or counts for Poisson regression

I have a set of data with measurements X1 and X2 across multiple time points, T1, T2 and T3. I would like to conduct a Poisson regression using X1 and X2 on the counts of a phenomenon. An example of how my dataset would like is as follows (pardon my inelegant code): library(lme4) set.seed(888) df As can be seen, I have 2 "counts" variable. One is cumulative, one is not. My question is should I be doing: model.count OR: model.cumulative.count
