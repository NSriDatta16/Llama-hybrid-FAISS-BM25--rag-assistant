Examples for commercial applications of data mining in pharmacy

I've always heard that data mining and machine learning tools/techniques are heavily used in the pharmacy sector and biology, but I have never heard of companies that offer commercial applications of data mining for them. Once I heard my professor saying that if you really want to know the state-of-the-art in data mining, then look at the pharmacy sector. But again, I can't find any companies that apply them. My questions: Can you please tell me some commercial applications and usage of data mining in the pharmacy and biology sector? What companies offer such applications for the pharmacy and biology sector?
