How to allow user to drag a dynamically created control at the location of his choice

I am creating an application where I need to generate dynamically created controls say textbox or label etc. Now what I that user can relocate that textbox to his desired location. Like we do in Visual Studio. One way is to get new location by getting values from him using textbox. But I want the user interface easy. Can we have such functionality in winforms
