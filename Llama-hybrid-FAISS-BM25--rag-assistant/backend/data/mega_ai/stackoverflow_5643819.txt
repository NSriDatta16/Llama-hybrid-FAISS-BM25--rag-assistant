How to get started with developing Internet Explorer extensions?

Does anyone here have experience with/in developing IE extensions that can share their knowledge? This would include code samples, or links to good ones, or documentation on the process, or anything. I really want to do this, but I'm hitting a giant wall with lousy documentation, lousy code/example code/lack thereof. Any help/resources you could offer would be greatly appreciated. Specifically, I would like to start with how to get access to/manipulate the DOM from within a IE extension. EDIT, even more details: Ideally, I would like to plant a toolbar button that, when clicked, popped a menu up that contains links to external sites. I would also like to access the DOM and plant JavaScript on the page depending on some conditions. What is the best way to persist information in an IE extension? In Firefox/Chrome/Most modern browsers, you use window.localStorage , but obviously with IE8/IE7, that's not an option. Maybe a SQLite DB or such? It is okay to assume that .NET 4.0 will be installed on a user's computer? I don't want to use Spice IE as I want to build one that is compatible with IE9 as well. I've added the C++ tag to this question as well, because if it's better to build one in C++, I can do that.
