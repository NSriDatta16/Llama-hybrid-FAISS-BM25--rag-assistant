Is there a groovy equivalent to the beanshell source() method?

I've scoured the groovy doc and haven't found an analogue, but things there are organized a bit haphazardly. I'm switching from beanshell to groovy and was using the source("fileloc") method in beanshell to inline-include other, utility beanshell scripts for reuse. Is there a standard function to do this in groovy or a best practice?
