With reference to the last para, your conclusion is invalid. The GLM procedure does not invoke intercept for comparing it against a particular group estimate. ( FURTHER refer to your last but one paragraph). The Pr value (for z) does not test the intercept. The GLM method compares groups with mean estimate to generate a maximum likelihood estimate.
