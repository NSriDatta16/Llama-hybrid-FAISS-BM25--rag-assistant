All three possibilities look good to me. The question, however, is: how much traffic do you expect? Each of the options you presented suits better to a given scenario. Let's say you will have A LOT (thousand of thousands) users and not a lot of hardware available then you should probably try to minimize the number of requests to your app and store data in the client as much as possible before sending it to the server. If it is smaller application then using Session or some other central database storage would be fine. It all depends on your requirements.
