Dude, I don't quite understand what you are asking, however I'll give it a shot. First off, I dont believ you need to use a HASTABLE unless you'll be searching a list via keys. It appears you just want to keep the previous callculated result during the application runtime scope (or lifetime). Look into making your vairables Global. 'This variable is outside the scope of the function. Private previousResult As Integer Public Function ComputeData(valueOne as Integer, ValueTwo as Integer) as Integer previousResult = valueOne - valueTwo Return previousResult End Function Whenever the ComputeData is called the the new calculated result is stored in the previousResult variable. Note that it is a valid storage for the lifetime of the application.
