Analyzing the results from a logistic regression

I'm new to logistic regression. Can you help me understand how to read this? Here's what I understand - For every +1 of continous_variable , the probability of the outcome goes up by 4.88%. If they have 0 for continous variable , then the probability of the outcome is -314.49%. Both of these are significant and that means that we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between outcome and continous variable . glm(formula = outcome ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = dataframe) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -4.2917 -0.2904 -0.2904 -0.2904 2.5247 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.144947 0.095262 -33.01 Is that correct? Is there stuff that I'm missing? Thank you! Context - continuous_variable is the number of a particular action that was taken by one person. outcome is whether that person took a final action coded in 1 or 0. The dataset was analyzed in R and was a dataframe with two fields: continuous_variable and outcome . Also, for sample sizes, there are about 3,000 records and about 2,700 where outcome = 1.
