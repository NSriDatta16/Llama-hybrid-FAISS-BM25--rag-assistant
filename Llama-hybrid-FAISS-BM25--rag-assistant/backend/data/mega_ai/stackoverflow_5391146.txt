It's possible that you forgot to set up the SD card when creating the QVGA AVD. Try setting it up again. Also, you should not be hard coding path to external storage. http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html explains some of the APIs to access external storage. The following snippet might detect some issues with mounting. boolean mExternalStorageAvailable = false; boolean mExternalStorageWriteable = false; String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState(); if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) { // We can read and write the media mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = true; } else if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY.equals(state)) { // We can only read the media mExternalStorageAvailable = true; mExternalStorageWriteable = false; } else { // Something else is wrong. It may be one of many other states, but all we need // to know is we can neither read nor write mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = false; }
