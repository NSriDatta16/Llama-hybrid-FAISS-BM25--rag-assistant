Is a Random Forest Capable of Learning and Predicting Numerical Trends in Panel Data?

In a panel data set consisting of exponential functions, each indexed by an integer i ranging from 0 to 100. The exponential function is defined as f(i, t) = A(i) * e^(-r(i) * t), where A(i) is the launch point that increases by 10% for each successive function, and r(i) is the decay rate that decreases by 1% with each increment of i. The features for the model are i (the index of the function) and t (time), and the target is the value of f(i,t). Using Random Forest algorithm for this task. The model is trained on the first 80 exponential functions (indices 0 to 79) and tested on the last 20 (indices 81 to 100) as hold-out data. Can the Random Forest model effectively predict the values of f(i, t) for indices 81 to 100 even without seeing any sample of it?
