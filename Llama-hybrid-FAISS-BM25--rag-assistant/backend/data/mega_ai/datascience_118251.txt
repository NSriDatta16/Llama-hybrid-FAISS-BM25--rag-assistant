Conformal Prediction is a distribution-free statistically rigorous uncertainty uncertainty quantification framework in the form of prediction sets for classification and prediction intervals for regression (Vovk, V.; Gammerman, A.; and Shafer, G. 2005. Algorithmic Learning in a Random World. Berlin, Heidelberg:Springer-Verlag. ISBN 0387001522., and Shafer 2005). Bayesian method provides a natural and principled way for modeling uncertainty. In Deep learning, epistemic uncertainty concerns the probabilistic estimation of model parameters. There are number of approaches have been developed to measure uncertainty in neural networks, such as approx. Bayesian deep learning techniques such as Monte-Carlo dropout (Gal, Y.; and Ghahramani, Z. 2016), DropWeights (Ghoshal, B.; and Tucker, A. 2019), and an ensemble of deep models (Lakshminarayanan, Pritzel, and Blundell 2017).
