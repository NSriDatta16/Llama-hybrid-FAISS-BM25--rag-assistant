Set #include directory from C++ code file

In MSVC++ you can always do #pragma comment( lib, "libname.lib" ) TO link a library in from a code file, instead of fiddling with the project options dialog. I'm looking for a way to add "Additional Include Directories" from the code file instead of using Project Settings/Configuration Properties/C,C++/General/Additional Include Directories . Is there a way to do this?
