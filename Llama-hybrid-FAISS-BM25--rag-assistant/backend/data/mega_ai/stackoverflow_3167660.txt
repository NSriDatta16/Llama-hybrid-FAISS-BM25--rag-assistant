URL for the user profile? to be a subdomain or text after the slash?

I'm creating an online based system that has public user profiles for all users.. I'm wondering how to organize the URLs for these public user profiles? What could be better for the SEO and of course for the user friendliness? {username}.mysystem.com or mysystem.com/{username} or maybe even mysystem.com/users/{username} Thanks in advance!
