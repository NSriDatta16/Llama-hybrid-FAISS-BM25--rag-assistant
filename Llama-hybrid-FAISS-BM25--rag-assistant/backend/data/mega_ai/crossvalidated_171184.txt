One way to check whether a single continuous variable $X$ is predictive for a categorical variable $Y$ is to fit a multinomial logistic regression model for $Y$ using $X$ and one without any predictors, and to perform a nested likelihood-ratio test to check if $X$ is predictive for $Y$. A simple way to generalize it to $n$ variables by repeating it for each variable separately and selecting only the most important ones. The obvious drawbacks is that this method is not able to capture non-linear relationships and that it may select redundant variables, but it may be a good way to start. An alternative method is to use L1 regularized logistic regression and to select the best feature set using cross-validation or some other model selection method (like BIC or AIC), similarly to LASSO for continuous outcome variables.
