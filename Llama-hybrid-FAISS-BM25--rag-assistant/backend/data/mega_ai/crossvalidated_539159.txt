Neural Network for dates in text

I wanna train a neural network to identify dates on a text, eg. "Hi, this month is december 2021", days will only be numbers (not including monday, tuesday, etc.) and months may vary, such as december, DECEMBER, DEC, dec; and years (2021, 21) , also the input can be with connectors like " december of 2021 " ,"21/12/2021","21-dec-21","21_12_21" . How would the dataset have to be so it identifies these paremeters and what neural network type is the best?
