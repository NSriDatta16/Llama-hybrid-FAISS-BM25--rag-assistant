Be honest with your management team , make sure they know. Don't ever try to mislead people about the scope of your knowledge - it doesn't impress them and only causes you problems. Work with your team to evaluate your options - it may be possible to change technologies, or perhaps someone else in the organization can help mentor or support you. Changing course earlier on is easier and less expensive than later. Adjust your project timeline to take into account the potential risk and delays caused by working beyond your core strengths. If you don't have enough knowledge to estimate the risk, be very conservative in the confidence factor of your estimates and timeline. Look for an expert in the domain/technology and see if you can engage them either as a consultant or advisor on your project. Nothing makes a bigger difference than prior experience in a domain. Take some time to try to create a simpe prototype or proof-of-concept in the domain/technology you will be working on. Look for possible issues that could emerge. Sometimes unexpected problems surface when you try to create a simple prototype - this can help steer the effort when working on the real thing. See if the scope of your project can be scaled back. If you are already "behind the curve" the best way to improve your odds of success is tackling something smaller, rather than larger. Seek out advise from people you trust. Especially people whose expertise and knowledge has some bearing on the problem or technology you're taking on. They may be able to give your more specific advise or ideas.
