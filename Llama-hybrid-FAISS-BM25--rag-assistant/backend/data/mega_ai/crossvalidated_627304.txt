Durden's answer is totally correct from a mathematical standpoint. I will reframe the question from another point of view. From a Frequentist approach, you know the results up to round eight. You know that Alice won 5 rounds and Bob 3. The best guess you can get (only considering this) is that the probability of Alice winning a round is 5/8. This might be a good guess or not, for example Alice may have got lucky and Bob unlucky or some other factors may have played in. The Bayesian approach tries to account for new information that you may have. I will include an example to avoid being too general and not specific enough: Imagine that Alice and Bob are playing online at some videogame (some about fighting so we can get the win/loss result). Imagine you are Bob's sibling and know that, if Bob is losing, he will ask a friend to play for him and this friend is the best player of the world. In this case, this new information is very useful as it dramatically changes the result you expect in the next rounds (you would expect for "Bob" to win each of the three remaining games). Frequentist rely on the data they have observed, while Bayesian statistics consider your beliefs/knowledge about it. In Bayesian statistics, in some models, the final result comes from a weighted average between the results from the frequentist approach and the "weight" you give to the information that you know. If you want to know more, I recommend you to watch the first few videos of "Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis" from Coursera. Hope this helps!
