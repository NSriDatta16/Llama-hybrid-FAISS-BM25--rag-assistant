Pardon me, but what the heck are you doing? If you want to optimize the objective, you should determine the actual constraints which constrain the parameters whose optimal values you are trying to find. If there is a cost component, then either include that as part of the objective function (for example, revenue minus cost), or maximize revenue subject to some cost (and possibly other) constraint. The constraints as you have provided them do not seem to make any sense in the context of an optimization problem. It looks like you're trying to convert approximate regression relations between the parameters, and then trying to impose some constraints based around those, perhaps with some wiggle room, in a way which doesn't seem to make any sense. So follow the advice in the preceding paragraphs.
