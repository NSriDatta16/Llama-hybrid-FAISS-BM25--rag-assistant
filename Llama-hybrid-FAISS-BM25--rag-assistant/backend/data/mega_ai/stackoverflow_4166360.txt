An option would be to run the nunit command line with parameters. Check the parameter /run for instance: /run=UnitTests.TestMainProgram.Test_Sum_NegativeValues_ResultCorrect You can specify what you want to run with a good granularity, from an entire namespace to a function. If you have your tests organized in such way that the 'top offenders' are grouped by namespace or class you can achieve it. The problem you can find is how to execute 'the rest' of them whithout having to mantain the build configuration everytime you add a new namespace. Depending on your classes setup it is feasible or not. If you badly need this another option can be to organize your tests in different assemblies.
