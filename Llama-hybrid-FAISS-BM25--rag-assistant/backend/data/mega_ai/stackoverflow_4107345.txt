In response to your comments you might find what your looking for with the property textAppearance . Open the themes.xml file here: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/froyo-release/core/res/res/values/themes.xml If you do a find for textAppearance you notice various entries such as: @android:style/TextAppearance.Widget.Button ... ?android:attr/textAppearanceInverse ... This allows you to some extent to style Components throughout your application as shown in the Maragues example. So whilst its not possible to fully control the style of all child elements withint say a listview, scroll view etc, there is some limited support for controlling the styles some Text based components such as the TextView and or Button.
