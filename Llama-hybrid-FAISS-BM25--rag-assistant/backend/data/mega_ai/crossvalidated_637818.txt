All the answers are terrific. I'll just add a "big picture" note. We use data reduction not because it's perfect but when the alternative is a disaster. One of the worst things you can do with data is to take a huge number of collinear features and predict to find the "right" features that predict Y. The data have no chance of finding the right variables in that setting. Data reduction reduces the problem to an analysis that lives without your sample size and collinearity limitations. As a side note, sparse PCA is one of the more promising data reduction methods and gives a better interpretation than regular PCA in most cases.
