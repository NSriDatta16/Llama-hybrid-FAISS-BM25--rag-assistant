There's a way to avoid AppleStore?

i need to develop an iPhone application that is a Client of serverside application. This application is not for customer but for sell agents. I know that if i try to send to Apple to put on Apple Store they reject it because the application have no sense for Apple Store. The company is small so i can't use the Enterprise program. The only way i can use now is to use Ad Hoc mode but in this case if i made an update you need iTunes and i must find a way to avoid this. Thanks for the help.
