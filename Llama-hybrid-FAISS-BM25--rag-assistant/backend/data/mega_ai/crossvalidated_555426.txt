In time series forecasting, this is called "using a holdout sample", or simply "working with test data" (in contrast to the "training data" you use to fit your model). The point in time where the training data ends and the test data begins is the "forecast origin". And of course, it's a good idea, since in-sample fit is a notoriously poor guide to out-of-sample performance.
