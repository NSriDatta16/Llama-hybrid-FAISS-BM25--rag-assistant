Gaussian Processes, basic question about how the prior is computed

I'm approaching the topic of GP, and I have a question regarding how functions are sampled. On my textbook is stated that to represent a distribution over a function (the prior): we only need to be able to define a distribution over the functionâ€™s values at a finite, but arbitrary, set of points, say x1, . . . , xN . Now, this confuses me, how do we compute the probability distribution between two points? For instance, if we know $P(X_1)$ and $P(X_2)$ how do we compute the distribution between these two points? More tangibly, how do we sample an infinite number of points from $\mathcal{N}(f|\mu,K)$ and make this nice graph of GP Prior? (From Machine Learning a Probabilistic Approach)
