Using Exception Filter Inject may be simpler than using the delegate workaround. For a real answer to your question you will need a response from Anders Hejlsberg, or someone who was in the original design meetings. You might try seeing if you can get it asked by the Channel 9 interviewer next time the C# design team is interviewed . I'd guess that when the original decision was made, exception filters were seen as an unnecessary complication that might do more harm than good. You can certainly see a desire to remain 'silent' about unproven features in this interview about the decision not to support checked exceptions: The Trouble with Checked Exceptions . I think the postmoterm diagnostic scenarios argue strongly for providing access to exception filters in the language. However those scenarios may not have been articulated at the time. Also those scenarios really need proper tooling support, which certainly wasn't available in V1. Finally there may be big negatives about adding this feature that we are not considering. If there isn't a connect bug on this you should enter one and encourage others to vote it up. [I'd recommend asking for access to the CLR feature rather than attempting to design how it fits in the language.]
