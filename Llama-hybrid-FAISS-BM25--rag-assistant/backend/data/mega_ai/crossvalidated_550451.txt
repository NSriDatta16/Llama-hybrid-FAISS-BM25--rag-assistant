Two questions on Cross Validated that contain answers: What is the difference between "testing of hypothesis" and "test of significance"? Is the "hybrid" between Fisher and Neyman-Pearson approaches to statistical testing really an "incoherent mishmash"? Papers that explain in depth with historical context: Goodman, Toward evidence-based medical statistics. 1: The P value fallacy. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10383371/ Hurlbert, S., & Lombardi, C.
