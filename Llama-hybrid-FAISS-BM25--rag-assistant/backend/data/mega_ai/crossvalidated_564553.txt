Usually, PCA is useful for dimensionality reduction. In your case, you have only 3 and it doesn't make sense. Anyway, if it is only a toy example e you would like to understand how to interpret the results, the first component is negatively associated with all three features while the second is negatively associated with LAPOP05_10 and positively associated with the other two features. The interpretation of loadings becomes useful if you can assign a sort of label to the components. For example, if one component is associated with economic features, you may use that component for regression as a feature that represents the economic aspects.
