Well, if I remember correctly what little I ever knew about ergodic theory, mixing implies ergodic, and ergodic means that time averages and space averages are the same, which is the justification for sampling over a sequence of random samples. So one would like to know that one's sampling scheme is mixing. I suppose this is really only an issue if one is inventing a new sampling scheme. But more often, one is just using some software off the shelf, with (one hopes) known properties.
