For the second one, you could do: expr = (p^a q (-1 + q^b))/(-p^a q - q^b + p^a q^b + q^(1 + b)) //. {x__ (-1 + q ^b) -> -x (1 - q^ b)} Out: -((p^a*q*(1 - q^b))/(-(p^a*q) - q^b + p^a*q^b + q^(1 + b))) As for the first one, I don't see any gain ... HTH! Edit Answering your comment: I'm still not sure what are you trying to achieve with the first tranformation, but here is a try: Numerator@expr/q/Collect[Distribute[Denominator@expr/q], q^(b - 1)] (p^a (1 - q^b))/(-p^a + (-1 + p^a) q^(-1 + b) + q^b) Anyway, I think a warning is a must here: Forcing Mathematica to show results in an "elegant" way can be very tricky for large expressions. I suggest trying to learn how to do it only after you master Mma quite a bit. Then, as a simple exercise to get started you may try several ways to force Mma to show -1+a as a-1
