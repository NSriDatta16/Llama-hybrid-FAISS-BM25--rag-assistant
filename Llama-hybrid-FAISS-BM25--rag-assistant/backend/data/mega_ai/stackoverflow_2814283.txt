Anthony and Timores are correct in their responses, but I'll try to get creative with some ideas here: If you can leverage the same backend services, perhaps when a drag begins (MouseDown + MouseMove) you could send a chunk of XAML up to a service to store/cache the content, and when a drag ends on the other application (MouseEnter + MouseUp over the drop target), you could call that service to pull down the cached content In Silverlight 4, you have access in the local file system to the users "My" folders. You may be able to use a temporary file and the drag begin/drag end events described above to transfer you XAML chunk from one app to another. Refer to http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/11/18/whats-new-in-silverlight-4-complete-guide-new-features.aspx#localfiles If you are wanting to drag and drop text, you might be able to utilize the clipboard. So when a drag begins, copy text into the clipboard. When you end your drag in the other app, read from the clipboard and add the contents to the drop target
