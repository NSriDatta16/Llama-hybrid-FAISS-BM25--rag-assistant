The popularity of the build system is important, because it means more people in your organization (and future employees) are likely to know it and be able to support it. I would say don't do it. Don't use Jam. Does anyone but boost use it, anyway? I think Ant, for example, is a much more popular system and I find it easier to learn. Do your organization a favor and don't touch jam.
