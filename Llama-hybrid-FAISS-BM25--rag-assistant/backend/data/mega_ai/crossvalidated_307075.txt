When you say "large space of possibilities" do you mean when you have a large number of parameters to estimate? The basic issue there is that probability densities get weird in high dimensions: specifically the density becomes too spread out and a sampler has a hard time coping. Michael Betancourt has a nice introduction to Hamiltonian MCMC that also deals conceptually with some of the problems with MCMC in high-dim settings in the first few sections. If you want more specifics you might also look at general discussions of probability in high dimensions , although you'll need to think about how this intersects with the behavior of an MCMC sampler.
