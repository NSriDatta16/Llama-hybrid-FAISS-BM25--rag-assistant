How to constrain gradient boosting predictions to be non-negative?

I have a regression problem with the target always nonnegative, I used gbdt as the model, but sometimes the model outputs negative prediction value.Is there any way to output nonnegative value using gbdt, or how to impose nonnegative target(prediction value) constraint for gbdt or any other machine learning model?
