Visualizing variability from graph

It is written in the book Applied Logistic Regression, Second Edition. By David W. Hosmer and Stanley Lemeshow , p.2 that a problem with the above graph is that the variability in CHD at all ages is large . But I cannot visualize the variability in CHD. Did they mean the distance between the two straight line by variability? But 0 and 1 for CHD indicate absence and presence of CHD and these two levels are just nominally defined. If I want to represent it by 1 and 1.01, then the distance will not be so large. From what angle should I visualize the variability in CHD?
