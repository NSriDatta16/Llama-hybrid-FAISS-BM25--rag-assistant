Object oriented JavaScript help

I have the following code: var HD = function() { }; HD.Car = (function() { var _date = "09/07/2010"; return { Make: undefined, Model: undefined, showMakeAndModel: function() { document.write(this.Make + " " + this.Model + " (data correct as of " + _date + ")"); } }; })(); var bert = new HD.Car(); bert.Make = "Ford"; bert.Model = "Capri"; window.onload = bert.showMakeAndModel(); And get the following error: HD.Car is not a constructor All I'm trying to do is test (to learn) the 'singleton pattern' with closure (for private members) so not a 'real' example, but the book I'm reading suggests this is the way to do it. So a little confused - any help would be much appreciated.. Rob
