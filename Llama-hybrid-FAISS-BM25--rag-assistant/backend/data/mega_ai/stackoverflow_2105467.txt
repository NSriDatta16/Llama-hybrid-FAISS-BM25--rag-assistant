Let me try to give you some additional information, I am working at a issuer bank. If the transaction involves 3D Secure, then the first step is 3D secure authentication, and only after success the autorisation. If the issuer bank did hand over the handling of 3D secure to another organisation, then it is true that they never see the transaction in case of 3D secure errors. In other words, they never did an authorisation. It depends if they know about the 3D secure error. Therefore, contacting the issuer will probably not help. If I am correct, then you've issues with multiple 3D secure organisations. If I assume that every issuer has his own 3d secure organisation, then you have problems with credit cards from different issuers (you named securecode and securesuite). Therefore I think it has nothing to do with the credit card, but with your processing only. Isn't the problem completely in hands of your payment processor? Or are you maybe doing something wrong in your communication with the payment processor? Notice that Visa and Mastercard did implement 3D Secure a little bit different. (Maybe a stupid question, but are you sure that the cards with an error are Visa and Mastercard? Could it be true that the customer uses a card (e.g. JBC) that is not supported by your payment processor?)
