Off the top of my head: IsolatedStorageSettings are typically slower to access and save to than IsolatedStorage files. You can't save null in Settings, but you could create your own serialized representation of this. The use of directories can make working with a large number of files much easier than requiring a long or complicated naming convention for the key to an object in Settings. In some cases you may want to refer to an object stored in IsolatedStorage. You can't do this if it's saved in settings. I suspect that objects added to Settings are still serialised in some way (in the background) - my guess would be binary serialization - as they need to be persisted to disk. By defining your own serializiaton you can be sure that this will work correctly/as expected. If you just rely on the system to do it you could end up with unexpected behaviour. If you have your own serialization you also have some guarantees on future and cross platform compatibility. (If that's a concern.)
