A time series is stationary if all its statistical properties do not depend upon the time origin. If this requirement is not fulfilled, the time series is not stationary. Even a stationary time series cannot be described on the basis of just one sample record. Its statistical properties must be analyzed by averaging over the ensemble of sample records at different time origins. If statistical properties are the same for any individual sample record and for the case when they are determined through ensemble averaging, the time series is ergodic. As statistical properties of a heteroscedactic time series are time-dependent, it is not stationary and, of course, not ergodic. Its properties determined for a single sample record cannot be extended to its past and future behavior. Incidentally, the correlation/regression analysis cannot be applied to time series as dependence between them (the coherence function) is frequency-dependent and can be characterized through (multivariate) stochastic difference equations equations (time domain) or the frequency response function(s) (frequency domain). Extending regression analysis developed for random variables to time series is erroneous (e.g. see Bendat and Piersol, 2010; Box et al., 2015).
