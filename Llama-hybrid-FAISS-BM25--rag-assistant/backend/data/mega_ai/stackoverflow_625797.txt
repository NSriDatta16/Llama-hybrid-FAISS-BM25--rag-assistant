ASP.NET generates control names and ID's according to the position of the control in the page hierarchy. If this hierarchy is not going to change between successive page regenerations,then you can be sure that the control ID generated will not differ. Another notable point is that control IDs have random names on each request when you use Fragment caching. Another idea would be store the ClientIDs (available server-side) into hidden field(s) and then retrieve this information via script.
