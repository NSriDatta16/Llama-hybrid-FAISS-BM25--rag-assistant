First you can try psyco, that may give you a speed up as much as 10x, but 2x is more typical If you can post the code up somewhere, perhaps someone can point out how to leverage numpy. If your task doesn't map well only numpy then cython is a good choice to convert a intensive function or two into C code just by adding a few cdefs. If you can show us the code (even just the hot spots) we can probably give you better advice. Perhaps you can modify your algorithm
