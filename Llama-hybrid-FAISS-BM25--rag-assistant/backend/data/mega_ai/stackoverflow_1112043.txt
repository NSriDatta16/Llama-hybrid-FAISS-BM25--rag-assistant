For the sake of consistency, it is probably better to stick to one generation of JSP technology. That said, don't let idealism stand in the way of pragmatism. Scriptlets + expressions (recipe for spaghetti code): Standard actions: JSTL (custom tags), using a standard action to instantiate the bean: If the beans are instantiated in a controller servlet instead of the JSP, standard actions can often be dropped from JSTL code too. The introduction of custom tags paved the way for other frameworks, so often JSTL isn't used either. To understand the exact cause of your error, see if you can find the generated servlet code (if any). In Tomcat, this ends up in a work directory with a name like org/apache/jsp/foo_jsp.java
