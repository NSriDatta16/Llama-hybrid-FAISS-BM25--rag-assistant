The loss function is what is minimized to obtain a model which is optimal in some sense. The model itself has a decision function which is used to predict. For example, in SVM classifiers: loss function: minimizes error and squared norm of the separating hyperplane $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}, \xi) =\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2 + C\sum_i \xi_i$ decision function: signed distance to the separating hyperplane: $f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b$
