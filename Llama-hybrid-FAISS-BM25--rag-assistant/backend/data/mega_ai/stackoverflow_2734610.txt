Yes, even in a "release" build without any PDB's you will have the method names in a stack trace. But personally I would consider this a code smell . It implies a very fragile code path (for example what happens if you make a WriteLine method that calls a Write method, do you look at the caller's caller in that case?). It also is probably not cheap to take a snapshot of the stack trace on every logging call. I recently posted a question about using MEF to inject a logger into my class and I wanted to associate a type name with the log data as well. MEF worked out pretty well for me as I was able to import an ILogger instance for each class that wanted to use it and when the ILogger instance was imported, I would set its Category property to the name of the current class. No reflection, no stack trace. It worked pretty nicely for me.
