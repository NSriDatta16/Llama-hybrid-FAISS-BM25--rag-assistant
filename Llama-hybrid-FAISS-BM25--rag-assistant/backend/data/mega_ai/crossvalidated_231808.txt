If using EM to estimate the GMM parameters, BIC works quite well in choosing the number of clusters (in my experience). However EM is susceptible to 'singularities' in the likelihood function, that is, when a component's variance becomes very small. A better approach is to use a Bayesian treatment based on variational methods - Variational GMM. See Christopher Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book (chapter 10). This resolves both issues - avoiding singularities and choosing the number of clusters / components. In my experience, it works quite well.
