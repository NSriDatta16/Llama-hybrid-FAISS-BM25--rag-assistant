Ignore field order in DataContractSerializer

When deserializing, DataContractSerializer requires not only that an element name matches, but also that it is in a certain order with respect to the other elements. My application is such that every field can be uniquely identified by its name. I would therefore like it to be possible for the XML file to contain the elements in any order and for the deserializer to still work. Is it possible to set up a DataContract like this? The introductory paragraph in Data Member Order suggests that order is enforced optionally , but I haven't found a way to actually make it optional.
