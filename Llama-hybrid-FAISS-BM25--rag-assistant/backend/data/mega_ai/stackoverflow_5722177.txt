jQuery/CSS - How to style the first occurrence of an element inside of another element?

Here's my problem. HTML Headline First paragraph that needs to be yellow. Second paragraph that need not change. :) Third paragraph that need not change. :) If I use #content p:first-child {color:yellow; } it doesn't work because p isn't the first-child of content ... h1 is the first born. How can I do this without touching the HTML code? Thank you! All the best, Cris
