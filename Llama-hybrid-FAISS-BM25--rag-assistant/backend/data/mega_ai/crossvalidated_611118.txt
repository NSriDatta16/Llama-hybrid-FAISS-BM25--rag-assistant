Endogeneity in Logistic Regression

I am currently working on a logistic regression, where innovation is my independent variable and correlation is my dependent variable. I have some other independent variables and interaction terms but this is my main effect. How do I test for endogeneity? And is there a syntax in R? Thanks you a lot in advance.
