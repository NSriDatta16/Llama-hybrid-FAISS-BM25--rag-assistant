Rewrite rule for user agent with mod_rewrite

I'm trying to redirect all requests to a domain from a particular user-agent to a subdomain. My rule is as follows: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Test Agent/(.*)$ // But all I get when starting the web server is: Syntax error on line 4 of /var/www/misafe/internal/misafe-old.conf: RewriteCond: bad flag delimiters It looks OK to me but I'm obviously missing something and the error is not helping much. Any ideas? Thanks, J
