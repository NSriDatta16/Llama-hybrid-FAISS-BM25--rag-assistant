There are several possible approaches. If you really care about variance, you can take Bayesian approach which models relevant properties as distributions. It sounds like you don't really care about variance, you want proportional outcomes for different groups. This is sometimes called equalized odds . This can be done by post-processing to create a calibrated classifier score that changes the output labels to your desired objective.
