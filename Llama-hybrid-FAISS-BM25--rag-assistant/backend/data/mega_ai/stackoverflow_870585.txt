Since all the options here involve calling array , and it seems to be the "PHPish" way of doing things, I'll throw in that if you're doing this all the time that maybe it makes sense to have a function z() (I'm just thinking along the lines of $() in jQuery) that aliases to array() . Besides the length of the name array, I don't see how the Ruby version is any more elegant. There are less characters, but I somewhat dislike that you can't immediately tell the difference between a function parameter and a key/value pair in that example code.
