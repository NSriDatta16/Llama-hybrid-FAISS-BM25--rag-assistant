If you want average to return a Fractional number you'll need to use this definition: average a = (sum a) / (fromIntegral $ length a) (/) is the Fractional division operator whereas div is the Integral division operator. Note you also need to use fromIntegral because length returns an Int which is not a part of the Fractional type class.
