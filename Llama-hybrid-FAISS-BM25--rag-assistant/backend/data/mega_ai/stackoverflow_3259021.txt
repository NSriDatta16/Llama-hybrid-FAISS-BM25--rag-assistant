To work cross browser, you could add some definitions to your css to keep the color your definition. For example, let's say you have this in your css: p {color: black} a {color: blue} Now, I'm not sure if your .yshortcuts is wrapping the a tags or is positioned inside the a tags, but for purposes of my illustration, I'm going to assume they wrap around the a , so a solution would be to change your css to: p, p .yshortcuts {color: black} a, .yshortcuts a {color: blue} Basically, you would have to do this everywhere that color is defined in your css (assuming that Yahoo! could do this to any text). This is not as elegant as the other solutions given, but should work for IE6.
