Turned out that with latest FNH (some revision after RC) this is possible now. I wonder if this is because I asked ;-) So I had this mapping.JoinedSubClass ("UserId", m => { m.HasMany(x => x.Currencies).Element("Currency").AsBag(); } ); and it stopped working after upgrading to RC. Then I moved this into its own class public class OrganizationMap : IAutoMappingOverride { public void Override(AutoMapping mapping) { mapping.HasMany(x => x.Currencies).Element("Currency").AsBag(); } } it started to work again. Just like I wanted! Now I don't even need to indicate JoinedSubClass as this is the default, anyway. I can just override my subclass properties which is cool. Though it wasn't too easy to figure out why NH started to complain about association of strings... I even thought that .Element is broken in RC. I wonder why JoinedSubClass still has this mapping part if it doesn't completely work.
