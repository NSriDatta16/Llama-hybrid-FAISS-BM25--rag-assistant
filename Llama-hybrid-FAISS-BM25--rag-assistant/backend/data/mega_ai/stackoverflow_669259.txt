there is no need for two keys in array. array with name as key, and rating as value will do. Sort it with arsort() ; the algorithm is not perfect, you can do it optimally with linked list. Although I think linked list implemented in PHP will be actually slower that function call to asort() for 6 elements. For big O estimation, you can assume that sorting 6 elements has constant time. You'll only sort when you encounter movie rated higher then the actual, so in average case you'll do it less an less often, while progressing. You'll sort on every movie only in worst case scenario of having initial list sorted from lowest rated.
