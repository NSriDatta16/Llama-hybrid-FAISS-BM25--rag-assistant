Comparing a distribution of percentages

I have two populations that I would like to compare, each of which contains N samples. Each sample itself contains many events that can be categorized into 20 different, mutually exclusive, categories. These are expressed as percentages but could be expressed by raw counts. The percentages of each row (sample) sum to 100%. I would like to be able to determine if the populations are different/distinct based on the distributions associated with each sample. Thanks for you advice. Example of how the data is organized: Population 1: SampleName, Category1, Category2, Category3, ... Category20 Sample1, 0.04, 0.09, 0.20, ... 0.07 Sample2, 0.14, 0.09, 0.10, ... 0.00 Sample3, 0.08, 0.19, 0.24, ... 0.03 ... SampleN, 0.04, 0.64, 0.02, ... 0.17 Population 2: SampleName, Category1, Category2, Category3, ... Category20 Sample1, 0.03, 0.07, 0.21, ... 0.00 Sample2, 0.05, 0.03, 0.10, ... 0.30 Sample3, 0.17, 0.59, 0.14, ... 0.03 ... SampleN, 0.34, 0.24, 0.12, ... 0.07
