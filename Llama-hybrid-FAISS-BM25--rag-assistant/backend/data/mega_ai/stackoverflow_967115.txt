How to temporarily turn off "snap-to" (anything) in Delphi IDE /visual designer (D2007)

Every once in a while this drives me crazy: I want to move a control to some precise location, WITHOUT any kind of "snapping" -- snap-to-grid, snap-to-guidelines, snap-to-border, etc... and Delphi won't let me. Is there a key combination that one can use while dragging to temporarily turn off any and all "snapping"? I seem to recall it being available in D6, but can't for the life of me find a similar combination in D2007, short of going into Tools -> Options, etc... (which kind of defeats the purpose).
