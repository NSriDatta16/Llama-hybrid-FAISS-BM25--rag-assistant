neural network to match image

I am pretty new to neural networks and I would appreciate some guidance... maybe books or articles on the following topic: I am an airfoil designer. At fixed flow conditions, the pressure on the airfoil wall will be different depending on its geometry, e.g. thickness. For different geometries, I have a large data set of pressure distributions along the airfoil (they can be treated as images). My idea is to use those "pictures" as training data of a neural network (input), in which the output will be the geometry of airfoil. Then, I would like to target a pressure on the wall (picture) and get a nice airfoil design... Please let me know if you are aware of similar studies and if there is any book to start with!
