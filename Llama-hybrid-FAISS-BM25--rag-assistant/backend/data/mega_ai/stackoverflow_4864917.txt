is it possible to "go back" in java eclipse debugger like dragging the arrow in VS

Is there an option to take the stack pointer - or arrow in the debugger, backward and change the current execution line, as in visual studio. Today I am using a "workaround" of modifying the source file. this will take me to the beginning of a method, but sometimes it is just not good enough.
