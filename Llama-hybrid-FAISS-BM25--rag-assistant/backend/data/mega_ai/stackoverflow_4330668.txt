I'd create a protocol, say MapCallBackDelegate, to handle what you want to do. This avoids tightly coupled code. Put this in your map annotation view header file @protocol MapCallBackDelegate -(void)updateAnnotation:(id)whatEverParamsYouWant; @end Then make your Map View implement this protocol. When you create your map annotation view, give it a property @property (nonatomic, retain) id callbackDelegate; And when you add it to your map, set that property to self myMapAnnotationView.callbackDelegate = self; so when you want to change the title/subtitle/position, you just invoke that message on the callbkacDelegate. This is elegant because it reduces tightly-coupled code, allows other objects to implement the same protocol for code reuse later, and promotes information hiding in your MapAnnotationView.
