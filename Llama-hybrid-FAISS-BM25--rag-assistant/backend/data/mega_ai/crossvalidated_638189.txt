The goal here is to show the usual OLS solution as arising from the method of moments (so a special case of a generalized method of moments estimator that is popular in economics). The point is that you expect a certain condition to hold that has economic meaning, in this case, that each feature $x_i$ is uncorrelated with the error term. If that is the case, then $\mathbb E\left[x_i\varepsilon\right] = 0$ for each $x_i$ . Method of moments estimation operates on the idea that, if we want a certain moment property to be true in the population, then we should expect it to be true on average in the sample, so we replace the expectation with the sample mean and the true error $\varepsilon$ with the empirical residuals that estimate the errors. Then we get that the empirical moment equals zero. You donâ€™t have to derive the OLS estimator this way. Indeed, it is fine to derive the OLS estimator as maximum likelihood estimation for a Gaussian likelihood, even just saying that you want to minimize the sum of squared residuals because you want to impose a more severe penalty for bad misses than absolute residual minimization gives, free of reference to likelihood or even moment conditions (in some sense, purely mathematical, not statistical). I find it elegant that all of these coincide.
