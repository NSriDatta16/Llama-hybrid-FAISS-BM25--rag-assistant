How to add an image to a SAP Adobe Form from the MIME repository?

I have loaded an image to the SAP MIME Repository: Name : watermark100.bmp MIME Type: Icon (Under technical information on the properties window. I didn't set this, I assume SAP defaults that in based on the file type when I upload). Now I'm trying to display this image in a SAP adobe form: In the Form Interface I have created a global Constant: GV_IMG_WATERMARK TYPE STRING VALUE 'watermark100.bmp' In the Context I have created a Graphic Node: Name: WATERMARK Graphic Type: GRAPHIC CONTENT Field: GV_IMG_WATERMARK MIME Type: 'icon' //I have also tried '.bmp' Unfortunately, when I test the form, no image displays. Any idea what I'm doing wrong? Additional Comments: I can display the image by pointing to the URL & embedding it in the form, but that is not sufficient for what I'm trying to do. The image have to be loaded from MIME, and displaying the node will be conditional. There seems to be a somewhat convoluted way where I can convert the image to an XSTRING and pass that to the form, I will probably try that next, but it seems overly complex for what I'm trying to achieve.
