(This is intended as as comment on gerry3's answer above, but I am not yet able to comment on other users' questions and answers.) A small improvement for gerry3's - very elegant - solution. If I'm not mistaken, the line otherObject.displayOrderValue += delta; will actually perform pointer arithmetic if displayOrderValue is not of primitive type. Which may not be what you want. Instead, to set the value of the entity, I propose: otherObject.displayOrderValue = [NSNumber numberWithInt:[otherObject.displayOrderValue intValue] + delta]; This should update your entity property correctly and avoid any EXC_BAD_ACCESS crashes.
