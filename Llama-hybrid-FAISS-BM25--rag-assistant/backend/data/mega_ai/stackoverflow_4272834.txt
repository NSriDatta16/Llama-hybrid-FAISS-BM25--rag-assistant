I (sometimes) like to transpose with Flatten, as it works with a 'ragged' array. Map[Flatten, Flatten[{array, column}, {2}]] giving {{a, 1, 2, x}, {b, 2, 3, y}, {c, 3, 4, z}} But if, say, the column has only 2 elements column2 = {x, y}; Map[Flatten, Flatten[{array, column2}, {2}]] giving {{a, 1, 2, x}, {b, 2, 3, y}, {c, 3, 4}} (Transpose will not work here)
