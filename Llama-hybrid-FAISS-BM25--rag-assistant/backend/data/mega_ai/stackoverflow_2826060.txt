Able to create a custom Theme from scratch which validates with good HTML/CSS and also pays attention to usability and accessibility. (Whilst still looking kick-ass). You usually don't want to create themes from scratch but from a starter theme like Zen instead. For Drupal you will need: PHP, it's a PHP framework, so to really understand and use it, you need to understand PHP. SQL, the list of SQL serves that Drupal can use is growing, but you will need to understand * SQL, relational database and how to setup some basic architecture. Javascript (and jQuery). Drupal uses the jQuery js library, so it will be a lot easier if you not only, know how yo use javascript, but also understand how to use jQuery and some of it concepts. The hook system and how you can alter Drupal core and modules implementing hooks. The naming convention for hooks, theme functions etc. Modules It's not easy to make a must know module list, as not only is the modules you use very dependent on the site, but also how you use them. The two top modules in Drupal is. Views Know how to make basic views and blocks. Know how to make more complex views with relationships and terms. Know how to use hook_views_query_alter , to make complex queries. Know how to use hook_views_default_views , to create specific views. CCK Know how to setup content - what field types to use. Know how to create your own field_formatters - the foundation for theming CCK fields. Another module that I find very powerfull once mastered is Panels. It allows you to do a lot of complex and difficult things with very little and simple code. There is a lot of hooks you need to learn, and not much documentation. But once you understand Panels, you find that you time has been well spent. Hooks The most important hooks to learn, to create a basic module is probably: hook_form_alter() - change forms without changing code. hook_menu() hook_theme() hook_nodeapi() - almost anything regarding nodes hook_schema() - create tables hook_install() / hook_uninstall() - create tables and clean up. hook_perm() - when you need special access control. hook_init() - things to want always to happen. hook_user() - if you need to tap into user actions or modify the user object. You don't need to use all of these hooks all of the time, but they are some of the most used ones.
