Detecting mouse action with neural network

Inspired by sentdex Python plays GTA V series ( https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5 ), I decided to try some machine learning. Long story short - I made an app, which creates random red and blue filled ellipses. One at a time. App sets cursor over ellipses and press mouse button according to color. That way I captured ~250k frames(128x96 in 50 files with 5k frames each) with mouse position(18 bits - 8 bits X, 8 bits Y an 2 bits for mouse buttons) and fed it to neural network(googlenet inception). Learning rate was set to 0.001. This image shows graph after training. It stopped at ~0.22 accuracy. I thought it's a total disaster, but I decided to test the model, and it actually did quiet good. Here is the model playing. It makes 15% misclicks over few thousand samples, and those misclicks aren't that much off. Before diving into more complex environment, I'd like to ask if this approach is any good? What is considered a good sample for the network in a more complex stuff? Is 0.22 accuracy decent for that kind of task, or are there any ways to improve that score? I use tensorflow with tflearn.
