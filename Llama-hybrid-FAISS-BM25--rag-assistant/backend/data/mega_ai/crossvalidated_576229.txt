This sounds more like a candidate for a permutation test. Relevant for the conclusions of the study is whether a decrease in this number took place across generations. So your hypothesis is that there would be a decrease in PCs with regard to generations. This means that your null hypothesis is that there is no such decrease, or that all the generations are roughly the same, or "random". In such a case, the permutation test would randomly permute the generation numbers to simulate a null distribution where PCs of different lengths can happen in any generation, regardless of order. The next decision that you need to make is how do you operationalize "decrease". There are tests for trends , but you want to use a permutation test, so you need to define some statistic that measures the decrease (e.g. the difference between the first and last generation, the average difference between subsequent pairs, the slope of linear regression, etc). In the permutation test, you would calculate the statistic over the "null" data and then compare the result from experimental data to the distribution of the statistics estimated over the null re-samples. This would tell you how likely the statistic would be if the null hypothesis was true, the $p$ -value. I don't use Matlab, so let me use Julia to give an example, as the syntax is quite similar. using GLM using Random using Statistics generation = [0:8;] # Expt 3m data scrapped from your plot unique_PCs = [7.6, 7.7, 7.1, 6.6, 6.7, 6.4, 6.6, 6.75, 6.2] X = hcat(ones(length(generation)), generation) y = unique_PCs # linear regression slope slope = coef(lm(X, y))[2] null_slopes = [] for i in 1:5000 # randomly permute the rows of X X_null = shuffle(X) null_slope = coef(lm(X_null, y))[2] append!(null_slopes, null_slope) end # calculate the probability that the observed slope # is lower or equal to the slopes from the null distribution mean(null_slopes . As you can see from the example above, the probability of observing as small regression slope as for Expt 3m in the "random" data under null distribution is low.
