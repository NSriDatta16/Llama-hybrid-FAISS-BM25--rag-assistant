Its this Grid which dims the "parent" window content and consumes all the mouse events that would otherwise go to "parent" content. Inside the Overlay Grid is another Grid called "ContentRoot" which contains the border, chrome and your child content. Its this Grid that gets dragged around and will have a Margin.
