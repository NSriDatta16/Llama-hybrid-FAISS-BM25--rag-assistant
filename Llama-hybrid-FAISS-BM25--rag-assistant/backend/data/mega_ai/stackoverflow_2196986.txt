Well, it is a little bit difficult to follow your code, since you only have a fragment of it, and few of the really relevant bits. For example, based on your available code, your list should be forever empty, since you never associate the searchAdapter with a ListView ...at least in the code you have shown. That being said, the following lines seem particularly odd: searchAdapter = getFeed(URL); searchAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged(); I am going to assume that getFeed() (not shown) creates a new ListAdapter of some sort. If getFeed() is creating a new ListAdapter , there is no need to call notifyDataSetChanged() on it, as its data set hasn't changed -- it's brand new. Moreover, unless you are associating this new ListAdapter to your ListView , the new ListAdapter will have no effect. If I'm barking up the wrong tree, consider adding lines to your sample showing the implementation of getFeed() and where you are using searchAdapter .
