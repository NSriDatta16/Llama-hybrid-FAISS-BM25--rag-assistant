I will go through the options and tell you some problems I can see: PHP: If you don't mind trusting user agent this will work well. I am unsure how some search engines will react to different content being displayed for their bots. htaccess: You would probably need to redirect the bot to a different page. You could use the url parameters but this would be no different then using a pure PHP solution. The bot would index the page it is redirected to and not the page you wish to visit. You may be able to use the rewrite engine to over come this. meta tags: Even if you could use meta tags to get the bot to ignore certain words, it wouldn't guarantee that search engines won't ignore it since there is no set "standard" for meta tags. But that doesn't matter since I don't no of any way to get a bot to ignore certain words or phrases using meta tags. JavaScript: No bot I have ever heard of executes (or even reads) JavaScript when looking at a page, so I don't see this working. You could display the content you want hidden to the users using JavaScript and bots won't be able to see it but neither will users who have JavaScript disabled. I would go the PHP route.
