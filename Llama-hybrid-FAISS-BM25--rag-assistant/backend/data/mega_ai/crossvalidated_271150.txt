Your dataset is far too large to handle with sci-kit learn tree-based methods directly. What's your motivation for using regression trees on images? When doing any sort of machine learning on images you need to use a method that takes advantage of the spatial structure in images. The most popular approaches currently are convolutional neural networks, or the older SIFT feature transform. Even when applying a CNN model, you're probably going to need to downsample your images to 128x128 or even 64x64, 512x512 is too large. The most popular libraries are OpenCV and Tensorflow for SIFT and CNNs respectively. You may need a GPU for accelerating the CNN in this case, it's hard to say. SIFT features or other similar approaches (SURF, ORB) need to be processed a little to be used for regression, see here for an example.
