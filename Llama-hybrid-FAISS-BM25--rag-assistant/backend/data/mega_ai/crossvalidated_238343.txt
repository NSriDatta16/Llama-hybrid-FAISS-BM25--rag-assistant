Problem with one variable in a binary logistic regression

I analyzed four binary variables with a binary logistic regression. I used for the analysis of all four binary y-variables the same set of 9 x-variables (a-i). My problem deals with one of this four regressions. The results of the binary logistic regression shows that the x-variable "c" takes surprising high values regarding the regression coefficient B, Wald and Exp(B) (see table 1) indicating that this variable problematic. That is why I excluded this variable "c" from this one of four regressions. I am now in a difficult situation. I already wrote the scientific publication about this analysis, and I have to send it within a few days to the Journal. When I did this analysis, I asked my supervisor about this one variable c and he said it would be ok to leave this one variable out, whereas I did not do it in the other three regressions. But he is really no expert in statistics. I am trying to include a few sentences in the paper to explain why I did it. If the Reviewers are not fine with it, it would be o.k.. I would be fine with calculating it again and I think the paper all in all is great, and I would be surprised if I would get a rejection. But the explanation should be plausible with respect to the special characteristics of this variable c within the regression results. The problem is that I cannot calculate until submitting the paper. Could you give me some advice? What do you think about the regression results regarding this variable "c"? (I know, I break the rule of thumb of 10 events per item in logistic regressions; thatÂ´s a limitation I already mentioned in this paper) Table1 regression results Table2 correlation matrix
