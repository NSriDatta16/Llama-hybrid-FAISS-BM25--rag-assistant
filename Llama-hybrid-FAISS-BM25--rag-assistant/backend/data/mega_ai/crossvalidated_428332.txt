Estimating the autocorrelation parameter and include it in segmented regression model

For my analysis of time series data in R I am following a tutorial paper describing the analysis step-by-step: Wagner, A. K., Soumerai, S. B., Zhang, F., & Ross‚ÄêDegnan, D. (2002). Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series studies in medication use research. Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics, 27(4), 299-309. One section attends to "Correcting for correlation between values of the outcome measure over time" After applying different methods to check for autocorrelation (visually inspecting residual plots/ ACFs / PACFs and checking the Durbin-Watson-Statistic), I conclude that autocorrelation is present. The paper now suggest to "estimate the autocorrelation parameter and include it in the segmented regression model if necessary." My question is now: How can this be achieved? The above mentioned description makes it sound like a very simple step, however, so far I wasn't able to find a simple solution to this problem. Thank you very much!
