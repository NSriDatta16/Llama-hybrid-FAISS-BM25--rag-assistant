What is a good workflow for working with SCCS as a version control system?

Due to the restrictions put in place by our organisation, we are currently limited to using SCCS for version control. SCCS only lets one developer work on a file at the same time and this is creating bottlenecks within our workflow. Does anyone have any examples or tips on working with SCCS successfully?
