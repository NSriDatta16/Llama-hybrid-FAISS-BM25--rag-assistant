Flex: Select all items in an mx:List component programatically?

To select all the items in myList I wrote: myList.selectedItems = ['red','cyan','magenta'] ; But what if I don't know about the items in the mx:list in advance? How can I select all the items in a list without specifying their names? Thanks
