How do I get the responses from POE::Component::Client::HTTP?

My component POE::Component::Client::HTTP->spawn( Agent => "MyScript/1.0", Alias => 'browser', Timeout => 60, FollowRedirects => 3, ); This is the event handler of another POE component from where the HTTP request is sent sub connected { my ($heap,$kernel) = @_[HEAP,KERNEL]; my $request = POST 'http://mydomain.com', [qw(hello world this is my script)]; $kernel->post('browser','request','response',$request); } sub response { print "I am inside the response handler!\n"; # It never reaches here } I checked my Webserver logs and the HTTP request is sent correctly but it doesn't send the HTTP::Response object (or anything) to the response handler. What did I do wrong?
