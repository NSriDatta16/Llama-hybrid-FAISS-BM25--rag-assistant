I suggest reading the online book of Hyndman and Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: principles and practice". The book explains with details what time series analysis is and how to do it. You may find the book here: https://www.otexts.org/fpp The book uses R for statistical analyses, so you should have some knowledge of both programming in R and of statistics. You may find a tutorial on time series analysis here: https://rpubs.com/RatherBit/102453 Here is the Quick-R page on Time series: http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/timeseries.html At the bottom you'll find a 'Going Further' section, with some online resources for learning time series analysis with R. This is a CrossValidated page with a lot of additional indications for reading: Books for self-studying time series analysis? Hope this helps.
