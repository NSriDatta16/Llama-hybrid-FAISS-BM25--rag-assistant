Neural networks traditionally refer to a network or circuit of biological neurons. The modern usage of the term often refers to artificial neural networks (ANN), which are composed of artificial neurons or nodes - programming constructs that mimic the properties of biological neurons. A set of weighted connections between the neurons allows information to propagate through the network to solve artificial intelligence problems without the network designer having had a model of a real system. The goal is good, or human-like, predictive ability.
