Programmers are a very expensive resource, and you are losing productivity by using UltraEdit. Just do a little math: Suppose you spend 60 minutes a day for a month dealing with UltraEdit instead of programming. Then, maybe after month of adjustment, it only takes you an extra 30 minutes a day to use UltraEdit. Add those minutes together, and you get nearly 20 days per year! This means it costs your company nearly a month of your time every year to use UltraEdit. Now find a few colleagues who have similar opinions. If four or five of you get together, the amount of lost time gets really big really fast. Just flip the numbers around, and tell your manager that you know a great way to A) save the company a bunch of money or B) greatly improve programmer productivity. Whether that argument will work depends on your company (and your position in the company). The people who craft IT policies should understand that a programmer's computer needs are quite different from those of the average business user.
