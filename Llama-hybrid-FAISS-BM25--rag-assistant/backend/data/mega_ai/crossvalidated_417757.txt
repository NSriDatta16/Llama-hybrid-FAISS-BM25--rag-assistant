Update : Currently there seems to be a preference for using point clouds over raw meshes for 3d segmentation. They can use all the benchmarks below plus: S3DIS URL: http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html ScanNet URL: http://www.scan-net.org/ The state of the art seems to be [11] closely followed by [10] and both use PointNet++ [12]. The one you are refering to is the common PSB (Princeton Segmentation Benchmark) dataset [1]. Other Important datasets used for 3D mesh segmentation are: COSEG [2] URL: http://irc.cs.sdu.edu.cn/~yunhai/public_html/ssl/ssd.htm ShapeNet [3] URL: https://www.shapenet.org/ Other from Princeton [4] URL: http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/vkcorrs/papers_small/13_SIGGRAPH_CorrsTmplt.pdf Other basen on subset of ShapeNet [5] URL: https://cs.stanford.edu/~ericyi/project_page/part_annotation/ On the other hand, there seems to be no state-of-the-art page for 3D shape segmentation. But the papers I find most important are [6, 7, 8, 9], with 9 the state of the art.
