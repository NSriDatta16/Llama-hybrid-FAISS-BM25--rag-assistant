Be sure to pass on data structures between threads, always knowing which thread the data exclusively belongs to. If you use (as mentioned by Dan before) e.q. lockless queues to pass your data around, you shouldn't run into too many concurrency issues (as your code behaves much more like any other code waiting for some data to arrive). If you are, however, migrating single- to multithreaded code - this is an entirely different beast. It's very hard. And most of the time there are no elegant solutions.
