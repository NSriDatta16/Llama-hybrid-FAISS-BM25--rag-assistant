May I propose an approach you might consider especially if your goal is to have a record of what the user saw in the browser and not the actual markup their browser was served. The System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser class is designed to allow embedding of a browser within a Windows form. Once the control renders a page you can extract it as a bitmap using the DrawToBitmap() method. If you were to store the page response in the archive you also have to worry about the version of each externally-referenced resource (images, css files, etc) that existed at the time when the page archive was made. Ugh. Maybe you could implement the WebBrowser in an invisible form created by a Windows service? You would then simply queue the url of each page to be archived to this service which would render the page and add the bitmap to your archive.
