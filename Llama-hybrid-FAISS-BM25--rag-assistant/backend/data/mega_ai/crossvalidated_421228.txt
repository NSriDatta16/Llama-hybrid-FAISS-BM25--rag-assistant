There are several issues here. First, can you get rid of half the variables at once by either using only one measurement method or by taking the average? The upper left part of your first plot is not ideal for assessing this, because, for this question, we only care about the correlation across methods for particular variables. But it looks like all the points on the 45 degree line are very red, indicating very high correlation. I'd examine them more closely first, but it looks like the answer is yes. So, you are down to 150 variables. Second, can you reduce to 67 from 300? Well, sure. Why not? But why are you set on 90% of the variance? The first 5 components account for about 80% of the variance (34+18+10+10+8). That seems like a good place to stop. Third, if you are using this for prediction, you might consider partial least squares instead of PCA.
