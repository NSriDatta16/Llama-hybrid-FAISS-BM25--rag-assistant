PCA on loads of data

Assuming a big number of data points, with 3 features each. Let's assume 20,000 data points. I was trying to calculate eigen vectors and values, and I followed this algorithm in 3 steps [1], basically my steps are: calculate the mean vector for the 3 features x,y and z calculate covariance matrix, it will be of size 3 x 3 calculate eigen vectors and values. There will be 3 eigen vectors of size 3 and 3 eigen values. other steps for projecting, etc. Is it right to obtain only a 3 x 3 projection matrix for such a large sample of data, or I should calculate in chunks of 1000 data points for example and obtain more eigen vectors, like 20 sets? The purpose is plotting the eigenvectors to see a variation... At the moment I can't see what is the effect of having only 3 eigenvectors vs. more of them for subsets of data.
