Nadaraya Watson regression increasing bandwidth

I'm working with the Nadaraya Watson estimator and read the book of Wand and Jones (Kernel Smoothing, 1995) for introduction. On page 117 (for those who have the book) there is written that with larger bandwidth h the estimate tends towards the least squares line through the data. I would have said that with an increasing h tends the estimate to the average but not necessarily to the least squares line?
