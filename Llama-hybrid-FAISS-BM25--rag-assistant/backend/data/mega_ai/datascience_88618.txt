LED status detector

I have a piece of custom device that displays its working status by blinking LEDs fitted on the device. for example, the led is ON means the board is on led is OFF means the board is off. red led means error, green means all ok and so on. I want to detect the color of LED shown by a custom device using a CNN network. How do I prepare a dataset to achieve status LED Light color detection which is shown by a custom device? Note: I will be using C++ and Caffe and also I cant use simple image processing because of limitations from the camera hardware .
