The correct average revenue must be total revenue / total days, with your numbers this becomes $$ \frac{100000+120000+135000}{100+90+75} $$ You can express this as an weighted average by reexpressing the fraction above as $$ \frac{100}{265}\frac{100000}{100}+\frac{90}{265}\frac{120000}{90}+\frac{75}{265}\frac{135000}{75} $$ which shows that the right weighted average have weight "the fraction of days worked" and data the revenue per day for each project.
