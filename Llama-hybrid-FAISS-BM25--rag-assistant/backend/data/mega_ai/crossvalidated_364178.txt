How to train neural network to say whether a given input belongs to the samples we have in dataset or not?

Suppose I have n samples with m features and a binary output (say 0 or 1). How do I create a neural network model which says whether a given input(to be predicted sample) is present in the samples(dataset) we have or not ?
