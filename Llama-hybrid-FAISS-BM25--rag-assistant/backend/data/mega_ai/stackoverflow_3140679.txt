What open source software can I use to develop interior design software?

I need to develop an interior designing software :) Much like a virtual room designing software. There will be pre-designed 3D objects and they can dragged on to the room. You can change the room size etc... Much like a conventional home designing software :) After the room is designed i should be able to to make the user walk through it... I know that is a lot of requirements... But are there any open source IDE's/API's/Engines that can i use to achieve similar results?
