Suppose we had a data set. Something like this 1 M 17 B 2 F 23 W 3 M 19 A .... where the first variable is ID, second is sex, third is age and fourth is race ethnicity. then, we create a code where 1 means 1 M 17 B 2 F 23 W 3 M 19 A .... and then we say "Our data set is 1, using our code". This shifts all the complexity from the actual code number to the code algorithm. It's sort of silly, and the author is saying it is one extreme. The other extreme is to list the full data set. In between.... well, that's the tricky part. We could say "The data has XXX men, XXX women, average age XXX, and is mostly White"; but there are a ton of other reasonable representations.
