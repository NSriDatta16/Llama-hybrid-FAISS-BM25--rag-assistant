How come the deterministic part of Wold decomposition does not violate stationarity?

Wold's representation theorem states that every covariance-stationary time series $\{Y_t\}$ can be written as the sum of two time series, one deterministic and one stochastic: $$ Y_t=\sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j\varepsilon_{t-j}+\eta_t $$ where, among other things, $\{\eta_t\}$ is a deterministic time series, such as one represented by a sine wave. I am puzzled by the inclusion of a time-varying deterministic part. Does it not violate the definition of stationarity? Since the expected values of $\varepsilon$ s are all zero, $\eta_t$ gives the expected value of $Y_t$ . If $\eta_t$ varies over time (such as a sine wave does), the expected value of $Y_t$ varies over time, thus violating stationarity. What am I missing? Update: A follow-up question .
