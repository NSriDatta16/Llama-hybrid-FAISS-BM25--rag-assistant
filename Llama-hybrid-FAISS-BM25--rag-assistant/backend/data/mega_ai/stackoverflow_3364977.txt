How can I unit test a servlet with a request that just consists of xml content

I'm trying to unit test a java WFS web service implementation. The service can accept requests containing KVP params such as: http://www.someserver.com/wfs&SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.1.0&REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=InWaterA_1M or it can also accept a request containing an XML fragment such as I'm testing the KVP way using ServletUnit, which is straight forward: ServletUnitClient sc = servletRunner.newClient(); WebRequest request = new PostMethodWebRequest( "http://www.someserver.com/wfs request.setParameter( "SERVICE", "WFS ); ... request.setParameter( "TYPENAME" "InWaterA_1M" ); sc.getResponse( request); I can't figure out how to create a corresponding request for the XML type of request though. Any ideas? I'd rather not have to use another testing framework library unless absolutely necessary.
