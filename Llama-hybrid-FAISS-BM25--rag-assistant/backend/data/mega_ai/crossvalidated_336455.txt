FPR (false positive rate) vs FDR (false discovery rate)

The following quote comes from the famous research paper Statistical significance for genome wide studies by Storey & Tibshirani (2003): For example, a false positive rate of 5% means that on average 5% of the truly null features in the study will be called significant. A FDR (False Discovery rate) of 5% means that among all features called significant, 5% of these are truly null on average. Can somebody explain what that means using a simple numerical or visual example? I am having hard time understanding what it means. I've found various posts on FDR or FPR alone, but haven't found any where a specific comparison was made. It would be especially good if someone expert in this area could illustrate situations where one is better than the other, or both are good or bad.
