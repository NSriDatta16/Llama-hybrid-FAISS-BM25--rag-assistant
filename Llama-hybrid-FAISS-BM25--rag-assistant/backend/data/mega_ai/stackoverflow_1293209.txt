Personally, i'd store text. You can look at text with an editor or whatever, which will make debugging and mucking about easier. It's also vastly easier to write unit tests for, if you want to test that the contents of the cache file are what you expect. Later, if you find that your system isn't fast enough, and if profiling reveals that parsing the cached templates is taking a lot of time, you can try switching to storing bytecode - but only then. As long as the storage mechanism is properly encapsulated, this change should be fairly painless.
