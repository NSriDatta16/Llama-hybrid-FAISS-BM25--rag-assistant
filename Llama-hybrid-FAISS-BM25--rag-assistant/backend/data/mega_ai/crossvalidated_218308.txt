Logistic Regression will be the wrong answer in case of complete separation. Using Google I found, that the error message given in the comments is what SPSS writes in case of complete Separation. That's not to bad, as it is particularly easy to give a threshold in cases of complete Separation. Any number in between the largest GAP that leads to a Zero and the smallest that leads to a One will do. You might use the mean between those two as a threshold.
