In order to make a good model-selection you should always do some statistical tests and evaluate the accuracy of your model with a training and a test set (or via forward chaining, because cross-validation is not possible in time series. 1. Basics of the time series According to your plot you have a univariate time series with ~13 years of data (from 2007 to 2019). However I do not know the frequency of your data. Do you have monthly or weekly or even daily observations? ARIMA and SARIMA are often good models for monthly data. Nonetheless in time series with weekly and daily and hourly seasonalities you face distinct problems. There might exist multiple seasonalities and uneven numbers of seasons per year (a year has ~52,1429 weeks). In this case you should rather stick to a tbats model. 2. Stationarity A time series is (strongly) stationary if is has a constant mean and its higher moments are also constant over time. A time series is weak stationary if it has constant mean and constant variance over time. In order to simplify I will discuss whether the data underlying your plot is weakly stationary. While ARIMA can be applied on non-stationary time series it cannot capture all types of missing stationarity. 2.1 Constant mean (no trend) Your data apparently has no underlying trend. That makes model selection easier. 2.2 Constant variance The variance of your data is increasing over time. As far as I know increasing variance cannot be captured with a standard ARIMA model. 2.3 Unit root and structural change Until 2017 the variance of your data is steadily increasing, but then the variance gets suddenly very small. This can be either due to noise (and lack of data after 2017) or due to a structural change. If it is just noise an ARIMA/SARIMA model can be appropriate, but ARIMA and SARIMA cannot deal with structural breaks. 3. Seasonality You obviously have a certain type of seasonality. Once per year you have a very high number and the subsequent number is far below the average. Therefore I would stick to a model which takes seasonalities into account, e.g. SARIMA.
