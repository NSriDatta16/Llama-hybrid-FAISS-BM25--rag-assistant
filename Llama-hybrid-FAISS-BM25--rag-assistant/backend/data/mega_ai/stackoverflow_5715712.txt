Off the top of my head: var storage = new Mock (); storage.Setup(x => x.CreateWishList(It.IsAny (), It.IsAny ()) .Returns(10); Then create your CreateWishList object with its own constructor accepting an IStorage . var createWishList = new CreateWishList(storage.Object); To unit test your CreateWishList() method you would write a separate test. This test should purely by to check the code in CreateWishListV1() .
