Where should I put my css files?

I have a middle size of website that share a common header/footer and almost each page would have its own specific file for layout. I have put the common header/footer in a sperated html file, but I do not know where to put the css file because the link element in footer.html will not link to the current directory of this html file but the requiring php file. I look around quite a few websites and definitively there is no uniform solution. One solution is put all the css file in root-directory/css , while quite a few websites use hierarchical directory like '/skin' '/global' etc. The others choose a quite differential way using links like http://sstatic.net/stackoverflow/all.css?v=5fc0e3026fcc (this is the stackoverflow way). So my question which way is better or should I use for my situation? ps. actually I think this problem could also apply to image file storage.
