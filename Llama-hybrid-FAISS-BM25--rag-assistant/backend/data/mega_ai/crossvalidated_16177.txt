Variance Change Detection is part of diagnostic checking to ensure that the Gaussian Assumptions are met regarding the error series. Make sure that there are no violations of the mean of the errors being zero everywhere or at least not-significantly different from zero as this oftentimes is the cause of perceived variance changes. To validate this make sure there are no pulses , no seasonal pulses , no level shifts and no time trends in the residuals via Intervention Detection schemes. If this is true and there is no evidence of any auto-correlation in the noise series and all lag structures have been exacted from any user-specified causal series then simply try different points in time and see if the variance of the two groups , before and after the time point , are statistically significantly different from each other. This is the Chow Test applied to time series. Now if that test fails to prove a difference then one might then consider evaluating the Box-Cox test to determine if there is need for a power transform which untreated would falsely suggest variance change points. If you wished to post your series we could demonstrate these things using commercially available software ( that I have helped write ). Hope my remarks help you.
