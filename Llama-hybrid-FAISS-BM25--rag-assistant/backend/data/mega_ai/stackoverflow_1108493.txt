I like the idea of separating the data tier and the business logic tier. Therefore I am not putting any business logic to database but in code in my domain. If you are using some kind of ORM like NHibernate, the role of the database will automatically become just a storage and nothing else. You need to be careful when you start implementing parts of the business logic on the database and another part in your application! Best Regards
