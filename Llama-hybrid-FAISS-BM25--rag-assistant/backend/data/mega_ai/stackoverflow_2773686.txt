I figured out how to do this so it works with CS5. For anyone interested here is what I did to get the fonts to render as they did before the upgrade. Instead of embedding from the actionscript itself I used the text>embed fonts dialogue within the CS5 IDE. Selected and embedded the characters I wanted, then chose to export this for actionscript and gave it the name 'MyriadPro' camel-cased. Next within my actionscript classes I used Font.registerFont(MyriadPro) to register the font there. Within the css stylesheet the font-family reference is the camel case name, but with a space between. - So in this instance it's font-family:"Myriad Pro" I'm now able to embedFonts and use thickness and all other settings as expected. I hope this helps others who might run into this - b
