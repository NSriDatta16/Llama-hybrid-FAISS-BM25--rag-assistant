I think heuristic solution 2 does make sense. We know that both $A$ and $B$ are actual confusion matrices obtained from the dataset using different classification thresholds. Thus, by varying the classification threshold one may produce both $A$ and $B$ . Consider the cost matrix $C$ . It produced a confusion matrix that is either $A$ or $B$ . The threshold was selected so as to minimize the total cost. The cost due to $A$ under $C$ is $2310$ ; the cost due to $B$ under $C$ is $2156$ . Both $A$ and $B$ are feasible (see the previous paragraph) and the latter produces a lower total cost. If anything, $C$ cannot have yielded $A$ because a better solution is possible (feasible), and it is $B$ . Analogous argument suggests that $D$ cannot have yielded $B$ (total cost $1596$ ) as $A$ (total cost $1320$ ) yields a lower total cost and is feasible. From the previous two paragraphs it follows that the total cost of both pairs resulting from the correct match must be lower than the total cost of both pairs resulting from the wrong match. Thus you can use the total cost of each possible match as a basis for finding out the correct match (it will be the one minimizing the total cost).
