Well, this didn't actually crash the compiler -- It was merely a bug were VC++ wouldn't accept perfectly good code. ( details provided here ). The odd this about it was that it was only triggered when three fairly obscure conditions were all met. Moving one line of code was all that was needed for an effective workaround. And one of the needed pre-conditions was "using namespace std;" which is widely discouraged in production code. Nevertheless, messages asking how to fix the problem were a staple on Microsoft VC++ newsgroups. I couldn't figure out how so many people stumbled onto an obscure bug. So, eventually, I asked someone..... The exact code needed to trigger the bug was an example in Stroustrup's " The C++ Programming Langauge ". (*) (*) Note, I'm not saying he did it on purpose. I sure he tested it under a UNIX variant of C++, and was completely unaware of it's affect on VC++.
