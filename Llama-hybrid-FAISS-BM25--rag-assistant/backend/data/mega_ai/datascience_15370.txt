You are trying to predict random numbers here. By design the lottery numbers are unrelated and one round has no impact on the next round. For machine learning you should use input that has some kind of "predictive power". I mean data that as some information or correlation with the target variable. You can of course train a prediction algorithm on that data like that, but it does not make sense to me. In case you find something that is a solid prediction, that might mean the lottery does not draw random numbers. ...this actually should be a comment, but StackExchange does not let me write a comment.
