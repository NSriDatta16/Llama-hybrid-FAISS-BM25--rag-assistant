Adjusting the response variable to incorporate scaling effects

I am using a random forest regression to model a count of species from a number of different survey areas. Each survey area has a different size. My question is how to model the response variable, to account for these scaling effects? Should I scale the Count prior to fitting the model? Count And then when predicting over a set of survey areas, adjust the response variable prediction by the size of the survey areas I am trying to predict. This will give a count that is in proportion to each survey area? Count_predictions
