No, this isn't a collection or object for all the form variables (that would be too easy). If that's what you want you can create a custom object like Big Red Dog described (brd6644). That's optional though; you don't need to create an object before you send it back. You could just pass each field as an argument referencing them by their Id. It really depends on preference and whether or not your CF services are OO-based. You also have the option of creating a data model and sending that back to CF like so: {beginDate.selectedDate} {endDate.selectedDate} {formModel.beginDate} {formModel.endDate} formModel.organization.name formModel.organization.address Here is more on Flex data models ... I'm still not completely sold on their usefulness... but it's another option.
