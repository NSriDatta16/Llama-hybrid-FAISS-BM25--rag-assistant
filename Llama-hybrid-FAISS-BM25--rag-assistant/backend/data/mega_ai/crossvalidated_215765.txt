Binary logistic regression to correct OR for mortality associated with a condition

I'm analyzing the results from a 20 patients prospective study and what I'm trying to do is to correct the odds ratio for bad outcome associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation for the severity of the patients conditions (measured by SOFA score). In order to do so I performed binary logistic regression with, as dependent variable the outcome of the patient and, as covariates I put the intersection between atrial fibrillation and the severity score SOFA. The numbers seems fine since the ExpB that comes out is 1,208, which is consistent with previous literature about the topic, but I'm not sure about the procedure I used to obtain it. Could you please confirm me I used the test appropriately?
