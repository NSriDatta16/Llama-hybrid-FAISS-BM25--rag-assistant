Proving that average treatment effect for RDD with multiple cutoffs is a weighted average of the causal effect at each cutoff

Let $Xi$ denote the original running variable and $Ci$ be the cutoff that unit $i$ faces (e.g., the nearest cutoff). For simplicity, I consider a case where the binary treatment is assigned if $Xi$ crosses the threshold Further, let's denote the potential outcome at each threshold $c$ as $Yic(d)$ . Finally, the standardized running variable is given by Also, consider the following estimand: I would appreciate any help to prove that: Given the following conditions: Under the assumptions (in addition to standard RDD assumptions): These three equalities below are true: for Thanks in advance for any help.
