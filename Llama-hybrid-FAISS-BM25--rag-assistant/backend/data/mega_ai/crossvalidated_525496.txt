Moving Average error term

In a MA(1): $$ y_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \theta \epsilon_{t-1} $$ What is the error term $ \epsilon $ ? So far I've read that it can be: Difference between data and forecasted value Difference between previous values: $ y_t - y_{t-1} $ Variation of other time series, like variation of temperature is $\epsilon$ and lemonade demand is $y_t$ Are all of those interpretations OK? If so what is the underlying property tying them together?
