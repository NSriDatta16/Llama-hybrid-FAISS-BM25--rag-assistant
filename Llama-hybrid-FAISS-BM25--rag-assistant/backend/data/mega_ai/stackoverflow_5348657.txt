You need to use an appropriate DirectorySearcher from System.DirectoryServices , and you need to search for the organizationalUnit AD class (I would recommend searching based on the objectCategory which is single-valued and indexed - much faster than using objectClass ) - something like this: List orgUnits = new List (); DirectoryEntry startingPoint = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://DC=YourCompany,DC=com"); DirectorySearcher searcher = new DirectorySearcher(startingPoint); searcher.Filter = "(objectCategory=organizationalUnit)"; foreach (SearchResult res in searcher.FindAll()) { orgUnits.Add(res.Path); }
