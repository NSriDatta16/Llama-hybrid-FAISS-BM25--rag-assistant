I have used another hack: create a dummy last section with an empty cell (invisible backgroundView) in the edit mode. With this, i can keep the section/row organization, and the reordering works wonderfully, even with the "last" section. Another way, is to have a section footer with, at least, the same height as your cells. In this case, the cell can go past the last cell of the last section.
