How do I get a predictions list from running svm in e1071 package

Q1: I have been trying to get the AUC value for a classification problem and have been trying to use e1071 and ROCR packages in R for this. ROCR has a nice example "ROCR.simple" which has prediction values and label values. library(ROCR) data(ROCR.simple) pred This gives the AUC value, no problem. MY PROBLEM is: How do I get the type of data given by ROCR.simple$predictions in the above example? I run my analysis like library(e1071) data(iris) y Upto here I'm ok. Then how do I get the kind of predictions that ROCR.simpe$predictions give? Q2: there is a nice example involving ROCR.xvals . This is a problem with 10 cross validations. They run pred This gives results for all 10 cross validations. My problem is: How do I use model and get all 10 results of predictions and labels into a list as given in ROCR.xvals ?
