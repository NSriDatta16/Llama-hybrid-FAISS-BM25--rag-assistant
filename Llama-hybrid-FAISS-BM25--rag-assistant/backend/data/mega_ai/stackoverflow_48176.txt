Embedding a remote Python shell in an application

You can embed the IPython shell inside of your application so that it launches the shell in the foreground. Is there a way to embed a telnet server in a python app so that you can telnet to a certain port and launch a remote IPython shell? Any tips for redirecting the input/output streams for IPython or how to hook it up to a telnet server library or recommendations for other libraries that could be used to implement this are much appreciated.
