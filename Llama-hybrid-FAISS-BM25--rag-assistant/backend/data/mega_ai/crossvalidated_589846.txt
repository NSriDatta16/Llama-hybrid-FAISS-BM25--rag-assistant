Selecting AR($p$) order using cross-validation

I am playing around with some simulations to see if it is possible to select the order of an AR( $p$ ) process using cross-validation. I simulate a number of observations of AR( $2$ ) using arima.sim() , I split the sample into the training set that contains 75% of the simulated observations and the test set that contains the remaining observations. I estimate the test MSE for $p=1,\ldots,50$ and produce the following plot. Of course there is a certain amount of randomness from simulation to simulation but I would say that it works very poorly if at all judging from the simulations. I would expect to the see the smallest value around $2$ but it is rarely the case. I would expect that as $p$ increases the model would start to overfit and that would lead to an increase in the estimated test MSE. Sometimes the picture looks like that but it is not a prevalent pattern. Does increasing $p$ actually lead to overfitting? Can cross-validation be used for time series in general and to select the order of an AR( $p$ ) process in particular? If no, what is the reason cross-validation does not work for time series or at least in this example? Any help is much appreciated! P.S. This is the R code that I use to produce the plot and play around with the simulations. n
