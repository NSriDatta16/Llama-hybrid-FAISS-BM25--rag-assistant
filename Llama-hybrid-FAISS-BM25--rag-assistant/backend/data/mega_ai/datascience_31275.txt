You could solve the problem in an unsupervised approach. build your data distribution with all food Portuguese words formulate your data points as a sequence of characters, rnn-effectiveness transform those words into its phonemic form, see text to phonemes converter use denoising auto-encoder, instead of using random gaussian as your corruption process. Since the problem is discrete, you could use some heuristics to corrupt each word by replacing random phonemes with others which is most likely to be similar. You have to find some automated way to do that corruption, get some insights from customers history data and see their words spellings error. As for the architecture, vanilla RNN is fine. see more Creating a Spell Checker with TensorFlow In a nutshell: it's formulated as a seq2seq problem, the source is the misspelled word, while the target is the correct one. DAE will be trained on input that is corrupted stochastically, thus it must learn to guess the distribution of the missing information (reconstruct the clean original input)
