I think this problem is suitable for solving with genetic algorithm and/or evolutionary strategy algorithm. I've done similar box packing problem with the help of evolutionary strategy algorithm of some kind. Check this out in my blog . So if you will use such approach - encode into chromosomes box: x coordinate y coordinate angle Then try to minimize such fitness function- y = w1 * box_intersection_area + w2 * box_area_out_of_shape + w3 * average_circle_radius_in_free_space Choose weights w1,w2,w3 such as to affect importance of factors. When genetic algorithm will find partial solution - remove boxes which still overlaps together or are out of shape - and you will have at least legal (but not necessary optimal) solution. good luck in this interesting problem !
