I think OP meant a multi-class model that predicts an outcome variable with multiple classes versus building multiple separate binary classification models for each class. Indeed these two modeling techniques are different, and should be used differently according to the problem. Multi-class Classification Problems These are problems where you have to assign cases to a dependent variable with multiple categories/classes/outcome. Classes are mutually exclusive, meaning that observations can be assigned to only one category at a time (estimated probability for every category of $Y$ adds up to one). Many algorithms exists for this type of problem. For example Random Forest, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Boosted Trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis, etc. Each with their own set of assumptions. In the muli-class case, multinomial logisitc regression actually picks a "pivot" class and runs a binary logistic regression for each class regressing on the pivot class. Multi-label Classification Problems These are problems where each case can be assigned to more than one category. The dependent variable is still multi-class, but we cannot use a multi-class classification model because the categories are not mutually exclusive. There exist several ways to deal with multi-label problems, one of which is to transform a multi-label problem to multiple distinct binary classification problems. This is known as a binary relevance transformation . This can be done by simply treating each class of the dependent variable as a binary outcome (in that specific class or not), and running a binary classification method (like binary logistic regression) on each of them. This is similar to the multinomial logsitic regression case because multiple binary logistic regressions are run, but it is also different because each model in this case is independent and do not depend on a chosen pivot class. Multi-class or Multi-label? To answer your question: "Multi-class to predict a multi-category dependent or several binary models to predict each class?". It really depends on your problem. Do you want to assign multiple classes to each observation? If so, you have a multi-label problem and the binary relevance transformation is a good way to model. Are categories in your dependent variable instead mutually exclusive? In this case, use multi-class classification models. Note: The downside of binary relevance is that it treats each category of the dependent variable to be independent, thus ignoring any dependencies across different classes. A label powerset transformation is a good alternative. This transforms the dependent variable into a multi-class variable with each class representing the occurrence of a combination of the original classes. A multi-class model is then run on these new combination classes. This takes into account the co-occurrence of classes not just single occurrences.
