Latex: Showing only few lines in lstlisting

For displaying only few lines of source code lstlisting has a linerange key which prints only those ranges. \documentclass[slidestop]{beamer} \usepackage{listings} \begin{document} \begin{frame}[fragile] \begin{lstlisting}[language=C,linerange={1-2,5-6}] #include int void main(int argc, char **argv) { printf("hello world\n"); return 0; } \end{lstlisting} \end{frame} \end{document} The above listing displays following lines of code without any spaces in between the lines. : #include int void main(int argc, char **argv) return 0; } What I really want is #include int void main(int argc, char **argv) return 0; } I want the lines 3-4 not to be displayed but I need blank lines for that range. So there should be 2 blank lines between first two and last two displayed lines. Constraints: Source code should not be changed, it is actually in a separate file which can't be changed The actual source code I have is pretty big so using multiple lstlisting for different parts of source is cumbersome. [Update]: My requirement in short: "lines in source code which are excluded in given range(s) should be printed as blank lines(even when they are non empty in source code)"
