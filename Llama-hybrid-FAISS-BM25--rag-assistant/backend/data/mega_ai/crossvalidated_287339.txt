Recommendation system: ranking multiple logistic regression models

I have a set of response variables (uptake of product A-C) such as uptake_a uptake_b uptake_c 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 I would like to recommend product A, B or C based on a set of explanatory variables. To achieve this, I was going to build a logistic regression for each one of the response variables and select one with the highest probability My questions are: Is it reasonable to compare probabilities derived from independent models? Do I need to worry about fixing the baseline? Is there a better way to do this than building independent models? Collaborative filtering comes to mind, but there are too few categories for it and CF won't allow me to effectively exploit the rich set of explanatory variables that I have. Many thanks!
