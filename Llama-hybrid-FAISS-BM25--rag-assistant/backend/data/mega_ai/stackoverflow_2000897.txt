That means that debamt was empty. Empty is not a correct integer value. You know, you could also use the || logical operator, which means OR. Because this row: if (empty ($debamt) && empty ($debdes) && empty ($cramt) && empty ($cramt)) die ("$cberror"); ...means that if even one of those values is NOT empty, the if clause will not fire. What you probably want is: if (empty ($debamt) || empty ($debdes) || empty ($cramt) || empty ($cramt)) die ("$cberror"); That way, if one of the fields is empty, the script will not continue. This also makes a lot of your consequent checks useless. Because of your current code, it is completely possible that $debamt gets through as empty. I'd engourage you to think your if clauses through and see what's really necessary.
