I suppose you could override the CreateDiagramView method in your DocView class, and call CreateDiagramView to get to the diagram. From there, you could listen to the DragDrop event. If you can understand what was dropped on you, you could do something with it. Note: I haven't tested any of this - just happened to have a DSL open and played a bit.
