java printf help needed

public class Format { public static void main(String args[]) { System.out.printf("%30s|%30s","Organization","Number of users"); System.out.printf("%30s|%30s","Arcot","100"); } } It prints: Organization| Number of users Arcot| 100 Why is the 2nd row out of alignment? The word "Arcot" is not given enough padding, although the word "100" is. I'm sorry, this text window applies its own formatting, it is not showing what I have pasted as the output. You may need to run the code to see the output obtained.
