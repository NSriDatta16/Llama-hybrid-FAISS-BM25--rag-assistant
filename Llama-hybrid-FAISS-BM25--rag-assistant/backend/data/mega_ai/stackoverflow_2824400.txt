"image drag and display" indicates user interaction. This can't be done in PHP. Interaction like this needs to be done client-side which means javascript. PHP is completely server-side. EDIT: When I wrote the answer there was no mention of javascript or jQuery so I was pointing out that php couldn't do what he was asking since it's only tagged php (I'm about to edit that). A better answer would be that the image would need to be a part of the form, otherwise it won't be submitted to php.
