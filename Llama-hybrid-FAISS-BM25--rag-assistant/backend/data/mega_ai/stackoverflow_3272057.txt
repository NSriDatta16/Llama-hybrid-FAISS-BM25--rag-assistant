regular expression and reorganize web page for iPhone

I noticed that there are some apps main function is to load the web page of a website and customize the better view for iPhone. I think it will analyse the html source codes. But I hope to know if there is any existed frame to do this, or I need analyse the html pages by myself base on regular expression? Welcome any comment Thanks interdev
