TINYINT unsigned is usually a better field type for this, although ENUM is a possibility as well. I tend to avoid ENUM because it's a bit of a hassle to roll out a new value in your code if have to put in database changes as well. A TINYINT only takes a single byte of storage, and can represent up to 256 different values, as opposed to storing a varchar of 'suspended', which takes up 9 bytes, plus one prefix byte. In this case, I would use 0, 1 and 2 to represent 'open', 'suspended' and 'closed' respectively. Again, ENUM allows you to use the text representation rather than the integer, but requires a column change if you want to add a new value. As for your questions about NOT NULL , yes, that is a method utilized to help ensure data integrity. It is surprisingly useful if you have the foresight to make it part of your table structures.
