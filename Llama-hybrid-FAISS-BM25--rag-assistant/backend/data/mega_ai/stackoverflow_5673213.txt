I like Shekhar answer a lot. As a general rule, when writing Python code, if you find yourself writing f or i in range(len(somelist)) , you're doing it wrong: try enumerate if you have a single list try zip or itertools.izip if you have 2 or more lists you want to iterate on in parallel In your case, the first column is different so you cannot elegantly use enumerate: for row in table: for i, val in enumerate(row): if i == 0: continue row[i] = int(val)
