I'm the front-end developer at my organisation and as such am responsible for the CSS. I create all the required classes for layout and UI, as well as periodically tidying up unused styles and mark-up. Our developers never need to add classes for presentation, but they do occasionally add classes for Javascript. In these instances I have asked them to prepend their classes with js- . This simply helps me identify classes that are not used for presentation, but are still required for functionality. My other class names are all descriptive of the content. Before we introduced this it was much harder to keep the mark-up tidy (by removing unused classes) as classes could seem redundant (with no references in the stylesheets), but were still used. I've not come across any documentation saying this is a bad idea. It works for us, so is simply a matter of personal preference.
