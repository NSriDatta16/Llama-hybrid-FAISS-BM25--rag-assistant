Bias correction of logarithmic transformations

I read that there is a bias when we transform a series with a logarithm and then applying the inverse function, but only in forecasts of the mean values. I don't understand what it means exactly. In the book "Introductory Time Series with R", there is a section about this very issue: The bias in the means arises as a result of applying the inverse transform to a residual series. For example, if the time series are Gaussian white noise $w_{t}$, with mean zero and standard deviation σ, then the distribution of the inverse-transform (the anti-log) of the series is log-normal with mean $e^{σ ^{2}/2}$. This can be verified theoretically, or empirically by simulation as in the code below: set.seed(1) sigma mean(exp(w)) [1] 1.65 > exp(sigma^2/2) [1] 1.65 The code above indicates that the mean of the anti-log of the Gaussian white noise and the expected mean from a log-normal distribution are equal. Hence, for a Gaussian white noise residual series, a correction factor of $e^{σ^{2}/2}$ should be applied to the forecasts of means. In the same section, it says that an adjusted forecast {$x'_{t}$} with an empirical correction factor is: $$\hat{x}'_{t} = e^{\hat{\log x_{t}}}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{e^z_{t}}{n}$$ where $\hat{\log x_{t}}$ is the predicted series given by the log-regression model. Does anyone know what this means? As far as I understand, when we apply a logarithm to a series and fit a (linear) model to the resulting values, we are doing the following: $$\log x_{t} = \alpha t + \beta + z_{t}$$ where $z_{t}$ are the residues. So, I would think that the reverse transformation is given by: $$x_{t} = e^{\alpha t + \beta} e^{z_{t}}$$ However, what is the forecasting of means and how is it involved in this procedure? I'm guessing it's $\displaystyle \frac{e^z_{t}}{n}$ but I can't see a justification. UPDATE : Suppose we use the model described above to predict some values $p_{t}$. Since we used a logarithmic transformation, to revert it, we have to do this for all new $t$: $$\exp{p_{ŧ}}$$ However, the book says that in order to apply the correction to each new predicted value, we need to do this: $$p_{\text{t}}^{\text{corrected}} = p_{t} \frac {1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n} e^{\hat z_t}$$ Why? I thought that the mean of the forecast is biased but not its individual values.
