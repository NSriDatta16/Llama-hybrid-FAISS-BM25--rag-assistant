Problem for a math formula in Weight Uncertainty in Neural Network

I am studying the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf and there is a formula I don't get page 4: I don't understand how they obtain this formula. Moreover, with chain rule, I get $\frac{\partial f(\mathrm w, \theta)}{\partial\mathrm w} = \frac{\partial f(\mathrm w, \theta)}{\partial \mu}$ . Could someone tell me the proof behind the formula? I am not very good with differentiation
