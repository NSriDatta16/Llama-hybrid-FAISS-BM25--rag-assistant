Logistic regression loss with continuous labels

I want to learn a logistic regression model but my outcome variable can take continuous values in [0;1], not only binary labels {0;1}. My model thus still needs a logistic link (to bound my predictions in [0;1]) but the log loss is not appropriate in my case. I cannot formulate my problem as a series of Bernoulli trials as in standard binary LR. Any suggestion for n appropriate loss in my case?
