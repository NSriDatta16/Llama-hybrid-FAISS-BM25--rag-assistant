11000 is an invalid class if your classes are mutually exclusive and if you have only five classes consisting of 10000,01000,00100,00010, and 00001. 11000 is no longer an invalid class once you define your class space to be all digits between 0 and 2^5. Ultimately it's up to you to decide what types of classes you would like to classify. Likewise for inputs: you can use however many inputs you would like as long as you are consistent between training and test/predicting. Your dataset sounds very abstract and that could be what is clouding your thinking. If you're just starting out with machine learning and neural networks, go with a well known dataset first so that you only need to think about the algorithm. A good example is the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. All the classes are digits 0-9 (10 total) and so there is no confusion about classes falling outside of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Google's Tensorflow library has a good MNIST tutorial here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html .
