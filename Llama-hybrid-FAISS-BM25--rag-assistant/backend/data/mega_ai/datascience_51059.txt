I will try to answer your questions: The train/test grouping is a common practice in Machine Learning/Data Science. The objective of this separation is to present some cases (training) so the algorithm can learn the model without memorizing it (overfitting), this means that the model solves the training cases and then gives a solution with the model to the cases in the test dataset. In that way, the solution is general for all the cases. The case in rank:pairwise is the same: You model your training dataset and apply it to the test dataset (of which you don't know the output). When you have your model applied to the test dataset, you get a solution, which you compare to the solution ( $Y$ ) of your test dataset. In that way you have a real solution and a model solution. In Data Science, the comparison of both is the real capacity of your model. 2. How can I get label to the specified group query based on the forecasting score results? The function pred = xgb_model.predict(test_dmatrix) must give you the label you are looking for. What's wrong with this code? Note: Is a good but not so common practice to verify with train/test grouping if your model doesn't overfit, and after verifying it doesn't overfit to get again a model with all the dataset together.
