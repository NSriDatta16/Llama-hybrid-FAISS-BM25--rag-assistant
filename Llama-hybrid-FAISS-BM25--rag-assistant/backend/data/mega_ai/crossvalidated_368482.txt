For years I had no idea what people were talking about when they dropped the term "fuzzy logic". No one taught me about it; it was completely skipped in all my mathematics and artificial intelligence courses. I believe this is because it was part of a wave of attempts to recategorize pieces of probability theory, most of which no one today has heard of because academics realized they were kind of silly and stopped passing them on. For some of that context, I recommend this vibrantly, hilariously scathing article from the 80s in which the author calls attention to a proliferation of (then) new theories for reasoning with uncertainty, calls them all balderdash, and shows why you can just use ordinary probability theory instead. (He actually calls out Zadeh specifically.) At the end he states Probability is the proper generalization of Logic, not "fuzzy logic", and I tend to agree. So to answer your question, Probability (Bayes Theorem, marginals, conditionals, etc.) isn't exactly the same thing as Statistics (populations, distributions, etc.), so, yes , there are questions Probability theory answers that Statistics doesn't, like "70% of the people on the bus are men. 50% of men have bags. 80% of women have bags. If I choose a person at random, what is the probability they have a bag?"
