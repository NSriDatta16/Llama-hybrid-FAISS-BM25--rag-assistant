My understanding is that the Delta Method is used. Page 50 of this note $^\dagger$ states this explicitly (see section 3.5). I've no idea how reliable this is! For more details on the delta method for calculating standard errors of the predicted probabilities in logistic regression, see section 2 of " Using the Delta Method to Construct Confidence Intervals for Predicted Probabilities, Rates, and Discrete Changes " by Jun Xu and J.Scott Long. I'll leave the reader to judge the reliability of the source. The CAR package provides simple methods for calculating standard errors in this way, if you wanted to compare results. $\dagger$ NB. The link to the said note is broken.
