I have a UI Scroll View with UIButtons on top. How do i make it scroll when they touch and drag the buttons?

I want something similar to how the iPhone homescreen works. I have my scrollview inside my main view, which scrolls to the right, but when you touch on the UIButtons, they become highlighted and dragging means they don't end up getting pressed but also the scrollview doesn't end up scrolling. It doesn't do this on the homescreen. How can i make it similar to this?
