You could use the intra-cluster distance , which is the average distance between any two points in the cluster. One way to measure the confidence of this value would be to bootstrap the intra-cluster distance. To do this, say you have N shots. Then take a bootstrap sample by randomly drawing N samples from the N shots with replacement and calculate the intra-cluster distance for the bootstrap sample. Repeat this a large number of times (at least 1000). The variation of the bootstrapped intra-cluster distances can be used to estimate a confidence interval.
