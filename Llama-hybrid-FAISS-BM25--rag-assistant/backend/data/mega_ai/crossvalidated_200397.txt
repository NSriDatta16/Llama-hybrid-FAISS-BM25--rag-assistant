Least conservative multiple testing correction

This is a general question regarding multiple testing when making confidence intervals. Suppose I have an unknown vector $$\mu = (\mu_1, \dots, \mu_p).$$ My goal is to estimate this vector, and create a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for each component $\mu_i$. I can of course make a $p$-dimensional ellipsoidal confidence region, but let's assume I don't want to do that. Due to the problem of multiple intervals, my realized coverage probability is going to be smaller that $(1-\alpha)$, and so there is a need for correcting for this. The most common way is to use a Bonferroni correction, but Bonferroni is ridiculously conservative as $p$ increases. My question: what is the least conservative method for correcting for multiple intervals? --EDIT-- I am not assuming any model setup. Lets assume $\mu$ is the mean vector of a $p$ dimensional distribution $F$, which I sample from using, say Monte Carlo.
