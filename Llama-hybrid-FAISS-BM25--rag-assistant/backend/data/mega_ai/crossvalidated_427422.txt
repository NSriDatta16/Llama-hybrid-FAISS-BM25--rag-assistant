How do I denote a linear regression with AR - correlation?

We can fit linear models and add correlation coeffitients. In the example, x is the dependent variable, which was measured during a time series: library (nlme) gls (x ~ time, data = my_data, correlation = corAR1 (form = ~ time)) My very simple question is: how is this sort of regression called? Is this a "linear autoregressive model"? Or is there a better name?
