Where does the name 'LSTM' come from?

Long short-term memory is a recurrent neural network architecture introduced in the paper Long short-term memory . Can you please tell me where the name comes from? ("Memory", as the network can store information because of the recurrence - but where does the "Long short-term" come from?)
