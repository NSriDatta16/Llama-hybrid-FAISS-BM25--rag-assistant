Perl network frame/packet parser

I am writing a small sniffer as part of a personal project. I am using Net::Pcap (really really great tool). In the packet-processing loop I am using the excellent Net::Frame for unpacking all the headers and getting at the data. I am getting concerned that this might not be terribly efficient ( Net::Frame is great but seems to be more than I need for this project). Also I dislike that for some Debian systems I had to manually compile libdumbnet (the package provided in the official apt repositories didn't seem to work, Net-Libdnet-0.92 didn't like it). All I want is to get at the payload inside a TCP segment. Is there any alternative ? Thank you. P.S. Would it be really really bad (read "thedailywtf.com worthy") if I just took the packet and searched it for some pattern ?
