Well the agile answer to that is "it depends". Try something, if it works for your team, persist else adapt/change. Explanation: Low-tech tools are recommended for the primary benefit of forcing people to get off their chairs, move about, talk-n-interact and feel involved in the teams' progress. However my personal experience is that adoption depends on the exact composition and attitude of team members. If the team as a whole doesn't like moving about / agree on post-its, don't continue with it ; try something else. Although more often than not, I see that "stuck" teams exhibit this resistance. You end up with a multicolored scrum board that has post-its that only the scrum master cares about. The high-tech tools are preferred by the suits/management primarily because they can press a few buttons and have ready reports. The flip side is that humongous/periodic data-entry to keep it in sync. Now with agile project management tools, the progress (or lack of it) is more obvious (early), hence I'd bet on more of this in the future. If your management has already chosen an 'organization wide standard', then you're stuck with it. Currently I'm experimenting with a shared spreadsheet, which has the list of stories/tasks for this sprint coupled with computed burndowns. This sheet is projected on a wall during scrums + put on a network share if anyone wants to view it. Updates are done during daily scrums by the SM.
