How to integrate expert knowledge to outlier detection algorithms?

Suppose I have a dataset of 20 features, X1 , X2 .. X20 . Say I perform an outlier detection algorithm such as One-class SVM ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html ) or IsolationForest ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html ) on the dataset. Suppose that I have some domain knowledge, such as if X1 the data point is really abnormal , or if X2==1 the value of X4 is not important anymore etc. How could I integrate these information to One-class SVM or IsolationForest?
