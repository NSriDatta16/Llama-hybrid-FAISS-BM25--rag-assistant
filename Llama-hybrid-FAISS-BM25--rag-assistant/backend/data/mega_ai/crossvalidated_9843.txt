Jason, Holt-Winters is a particular model form, normally additive or multiplicative and apparently may not be applicable to your particular time series. In general a Transfer Function incorporating both stochastic and deterministic structure has been found to a powerful way of handling problems like this. The problem you face I believe may be better handled with a mixed frequency model that might include one or more trends and/or level shifts and perhaps either weekly or monthly effects to deal with the "seasonal component" . Furthermore the model might exclude any identifiable anomalies so as to get a more robust "signal". I suggest that you post your original data to the web and have some of the readers use their methods/software to try to model the data. I will try and do the same. It might make for a very interesting comparison !
