Need HTML characters stripped out of excel export, but effects preserved

I'm exporting data using CF9's cfspreeadsheet tags and functions, some columns have HTML formatted text in them. I need to strip out the HTML tags, and convert characters like &lt and &amp to their equivalents. However, I'd also like to keep the effects of bold tags and paragraphs tags if possible. I know I can use rereplace, and others to brute force the output, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. Any ideas? Thanks for the help!
