android: adding audio files to android emulator [update] permission denied

For debugging purposes, I wanted to have a couple of mp3 files located somewhere "in" my android emulator. Is there anyway to directly push files from my OS file system to the storage system of android? If so, which directory does android keep audio files? if not, how can I access an SD card via emulator? [update2]: The problem in update1 solved. Should use adb push. [update1]: I followed kgiannakakis's advice to create an sdcard for my avd. However, I got Permission denied error when I try to create new directory inside it. $ cd sdcard $ ls LOST.DIR $mkdir musics mkdir failed for musics, Permission denied $ su mkdir musics su: uid 10016 not allowed to su
