Pay attention to the plot's y-axis label. It says: "Eigen values of original and simulated factors and components " (emphasis mine). Parallel analysis (PA) produces separate sets of eigen values for both factors ( factor analysis, FA ) and components ( principal component analysis, PCA ). While FA and PCA seem to be similar, those methods are conceptually different . Here's how Professor William Revelle (well-known expert in psychometric theory, maintainer of the Personality Project and the author of psych R package) explains the difference (Revelle, 2015, p. 158): Although on the surface, the component model and factor model appear to very similar (...), they are logically very different. In the components model, components are linear sums of the variables. In the factor model, on the other hand, factors are latent variables whose weighted sum accounts for the common part of the observed variables. In path analytic terms, for the component model, arrows go from the variables to the components, while in the factor model they go from the factors to the variables. My statement above about the contents of the plot is intentionally not very accurate for pedagogical reasons (but, I hope still conceptually valid), as, in fact, fa.parallel() and fa.parallel.poly() functions plot "the eigenvalues for a principal components solution as well as the eigen values when the communalities are estimated by a one factor minres solution for a given data set as well as that of n (default value = 20) randomly generated parallel data sets of the same number of variables and subjects" (Revelle, 2015, p. 175-176) [bold emphasis mine]. UPDATE (based on the OP's clarification of the question): I think that the double line output on number of factors/components is due to a second call to fa.parallel() or fa.parallel.poly() somewhere, because the standard output from fa.parallel.poly() contains only a single such line . See the MRE below. Code: library(psych) data(bock) fa.info Output: See the graphic output for a description of the results Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 3 and the number of components = 1 References Revelle, W.
