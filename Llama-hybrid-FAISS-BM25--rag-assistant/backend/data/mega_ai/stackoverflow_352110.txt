This is correct, allocations are made on a granularity of byte (possibly rounded up to an even number of bytes or even higher). This is true of any OS I've worked with, so it's not specific to managed code. The memory manager works with bytes, not bits. On the other hand, it's not hard to pack booleans into a bit array if you have lots of booleans and want to achieve higher storage efficiency (see BitArray ).
