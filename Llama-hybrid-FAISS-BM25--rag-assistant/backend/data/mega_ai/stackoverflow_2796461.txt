Use HTTP authentication. You can recognize curl by User-Agent HTTP header, but it is not safe - anybody can use such header (or use curl) to access your scripts. (edit) You can also use IP address of the request. Curl requests from cron will probably have 127.0.0.1; it should be not possible for anyone to make requests from this address (unless your website runs behind reverse proxy running on the same server). This is not 100% safe (for example on shared webhosting), but it might be safe enough. BTW. why not run PHP script directly from CRON? Then it does not have to be web-accessible at all.
