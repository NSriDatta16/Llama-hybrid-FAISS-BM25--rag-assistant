Is it possible to set the selectedIndex of a combobox based on its value

Is it possible to set the selectedIndex of a combobox based on its value, without having to iterate through the datasource? I set the datasource like this: caseDBTableAdapters.usersTableAdapter usersAdapter = new caseDBTableAdapters.usersTableAdapter(); caseDB.usersDataTable users; users = usersAdapter.GetUsers(); cbOwner.DisplayMember = "fullName"; cbOwner.ValueMember = "userId"; cbOwner.DataSource = users; It seems less elegant to have to iterate through the table fx. by doing: int counter = 0; foreach (caseDB.usersRow usersRow in users) { if (usersRow.userId == selectedUser) { cbOwner.SelectedIndex = counter; } counter++; }
