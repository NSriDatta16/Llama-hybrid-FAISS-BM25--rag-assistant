I have worked on active learning in classification and in SVM, that problem was same for me, if the boundary you found out by first model isn't that good the probability to have a good label for new points will decrease. If you have any other method to labelize your new generated points rather than using the boundary that can be a good way and your accuracy for the new generated boundary will be better.
