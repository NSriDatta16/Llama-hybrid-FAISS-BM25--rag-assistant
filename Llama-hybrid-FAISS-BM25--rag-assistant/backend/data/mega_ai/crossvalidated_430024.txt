How to generate data in order to fit the i.i.d. assumption in many machine learning applications?

In many examples in data science and machine learning, the training data and the target is assumed to be generated in an i.i.d. fashion. Example: https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/07/Papers/121.pdf On the importance of the i.i.d. assumption in statistical learning https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/10839/why-exactly-do-neural-networks-require-i-i-d-data Independent and identically distributed samples I'm not curious as to why we need the data to be i.i.d. This is obviously to simplify the math. But how can this assumption be satisfied in real life? How do I ensure that the data set that I generate use for training is i.i.d.
