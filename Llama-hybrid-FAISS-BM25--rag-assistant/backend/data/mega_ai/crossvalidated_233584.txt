Interpreting Logistic Regression In R

I have an experiment where I have 4 treatments and 2 outcomes (1 or 0) possible for each treatment. This is the result I calculated in R but I don't understand why only 3 of my treatments come up in the summary. How do I interpret this? The 4 treatments relate to nest sites that may either be a control, no egg, quail egg or artificial egg. > fm summary(fm) Call: glm(formula = Disturbed ~ Treatment, family = binomial, data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4823 -0.6681 -0.3715 0.9005 2.3272 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
