It depends what you mean by "best classifies", but if you mean "is the tree with the best training performance", no. The best performance on the training examples is not really a desirable property because it encourages the model to just memorise the data instead of learning the underlying pattern. There are a number of trade-off which need to be made in constructing the model, I believe ID3 constructs a tree in a greedy way by splitting the nodes which maximise the information gain.
