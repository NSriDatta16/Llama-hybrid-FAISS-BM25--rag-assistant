Calculating the probability of a car accident

This is a theoretical problem that I'm trying to calculate whilst at work. Essentially, what is the probability of a car accident in a state given that these variables are provided to you: Counties within the US States US States Number of car-crashes within the Counties Year Miles traveled; average and total Vehicle speed My initial approach was to include a poisson distribution following these variables as parameters: $\lambda = rt$ $r$ is the accident rates which is calculated by the number of car-crashes within counties multiplied by the average miles traveled, and all of it divided by the total miles traveled of all vehicles in the county. $t$ is the time, in this instance I'm working with data over 8 years so $t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8$ $k$ = number of accidents in a county The problem I have with using the poisson distribution is that higher accidents are under-represented relative to smaller accidents. Which tells me that places with lower accidents have a higher probability of an accident occurring than places with more accidents, though I disagree. Some sample data: #merged_counties States counties average_miles accidents total_miles TRAV_SP 1 Alabama AUTAUGA (1) 723.8889 16 6515 54.00000 2 Alabama BALDWIN (3) 192.7250 65 7709 44.23529 3 Alabama BARBOUR (5) 569.2857 9 3985 50.42857 4 Alabama BIBB (7) 599.8000 8 2999 54.28571 5 Alabama BLOUNT (9) 349.9231 18 4549 56.05882 6 Alabama BULLOCK (11) 705.0000 3 1410 5.00000 What alternative model would better capture the idea of the probability of a car-accident? I understand that more variables must be considered like weather, types of road, the persons psychology at the time etc... But I'm aiming for the most simplest framework. Assuming that the total accidents in Alabama are 1000, shouldn't Baldwin have a higher probability of an accident occurring, but the calculation says otherwise? accident_rate $accidents*merged_counties$ average_miles)/merged_counties$total_miles x $accidents[i])*exp(-accident_rate[i]*1))/factorial(all_data_counties$ accidents[i]) } x [1] 8.041571e-11 1.211741e-78 7.314061e-06 2.150642e-04 1.368526e-14 Note : I miss-interpreted the poisson distribution as $k$ should be 1 as I'm looking for the calculation of a single accident. The probabilities actually turn out rather handsome as a result as opposed to the values in the $R$ code above.
