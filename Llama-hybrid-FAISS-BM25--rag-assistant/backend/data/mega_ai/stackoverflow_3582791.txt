Does AutoCompletionExtender Method of AJAX Control Toolkit have to be static?

I have web page which is using AjaxControlToolkit:AutoCompleteExtener on some TextBox. This extender requires service method, from which it will get data to display: [System.Web.Services.WebMethodAttribute(), System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptMethodAttribute()] public static string[] GetCompletionList2(string prefixText, int count, string contextKey) { return DatabaseSearch.GetUnits().GetSymbolCompletion(prefixText, organizationToSearch); } In this method I use some argument = organizationToSearch. But I don't want this argument to be static ! And since the method is static I don't know what to do. If I remove the 'static' keyword from method definition it won't work... And I really don't want change organizationToSearch to static either! Please help.
