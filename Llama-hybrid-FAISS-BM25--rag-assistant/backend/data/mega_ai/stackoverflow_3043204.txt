Sharepoint application not working!

I am facing a weird problem and no body seems to have a solution for it. The thing is that i am working on a Sharepoint application. It was working fine until our organization underwent a network maintenance. The next day i try to run my application and kaboom!! it throws me an error A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server) I later found out that during the maintenance the IP of my machine has changed. It is possible that the change of an IP could result in my sharepoint application not working!! I did my research and found that nothing has been changed in my application and that the SQL server (which is on my machine itself) is working fine! And still my application is DEAD!! Please help, any suggestions will be helpful! thank you.
