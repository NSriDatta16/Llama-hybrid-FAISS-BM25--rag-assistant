Visual Studio 2008 version required on TFS Server 2008

We want to run our unit tests on our TFS server. We are running the database, TFS and the build agent on the same machine. We have set it up and it appears to work up to the point that MStest tries to publish the results to the TFS server. We get the following error: The "TestToolsTask" task is using "MSTest.exe" from ...... Invalid switch "/publish". Invalid switch "/publishbuild". Invalid switch "/teamproject". Invalid switch "/platform". Invalid switch "/flavor". For switch syntax, type "MSTest /help" MSBUILD : warning MSB6006: "MSTest.exe" exited with code 1. We think that the reason why we are getting this is that we have installed the professional version of Visual Studio on the build server. Question is : Do we have to install a Team System Edition of Visual Studio on the build server or will it work if we just install the TFS client? Thanks Shiraz
