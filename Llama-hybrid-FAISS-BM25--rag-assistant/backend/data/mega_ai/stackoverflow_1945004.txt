The general solution is to use windows hooks, filter to WH_CBT, filter to WM_CREATE, or something like that, get the window text and see if it is the one of your interest. One more important point: in hook you should use SetWindowLongPtr() to set window process to your own function, that will actually receive WM_CREATE event. In all calls this function should call the original window procedure.
