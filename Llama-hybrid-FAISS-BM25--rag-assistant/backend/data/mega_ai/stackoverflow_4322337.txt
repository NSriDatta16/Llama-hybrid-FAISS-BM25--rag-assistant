Sending packet using libpcap speed limitation

I wrote a program that captures Ethernet packets from some NIC (i.e eth0) at high speed (about 1Gbps) and forward traffic using pcap_sendpacket() to another NIC (i.e eth1). While the forwarder Ethernet interface is not connected to another computer NIC, forwarding speed is desired, but when I connect it, sending speed gets down awfully (from 900 Mbps to 100 Mbps). Can anybody explain the reason? OS : Kubuntu linux 10.10 Language : C++ Library : Libpcap
