That's a standard error that has nothing to do with parent/child relationships. You normally just need to add to the ShopCategory.php file in the lib/model folder a __toString() method public function __toString() { return $this->getCategoryName(); } Now since you've pulled out the category name from the shop_category table you need to create a function that gets the shop_categories_description that is a child of the shop_category and is the correct culture so that you have a category name to return.
