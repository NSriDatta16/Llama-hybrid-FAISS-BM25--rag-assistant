You can't mix model-first and db-first. Once you manually modify database you can't use Generate database from EDMX any more or you delete your changes performed directly in DB. In some cases it can be avoided by downloading Entity Designer Database Generation Power Pack extension to Visual Studio 2010. When using this extension together with VS 2010 Premium or Ultimate you can use additional DB generation workflows and T4 templates which are able to use VS tools to compare newly generated DB with existing DB and create only ALTER scripts. But still this will most probably not work with DB views because information about DB view is stored in SSDL (storage model description). Model-first doesn't use Views and every time you regenerate database it creates table instead of view. So if you want to run arbitrary SQL query use ExecuteStoreQuery (only EF4) or give up with model first.
