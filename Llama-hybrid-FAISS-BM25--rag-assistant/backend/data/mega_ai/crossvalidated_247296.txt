Cox's Proportional Hazards Model is usually used as equivalence tests for two survival curves.well you need to look for sample size before going to test for equivalence. There is a package 'survival' in R , that you can use. I have no idea on how your data looks.probably, looking at datasets(kidney,logan,nwtco,heart and many more) in 'survival' package might help you. well there is another test log rank that you can use. let me explain you the difference between cox and log rank Cox Model ,provides the primary information desired from a survival analysis, hazard ratios and adjusted survival curves, with a minimum number of assumptions. The long rank analysis answers the question of whether the two arms of a trial were different enough to be statistically significant. It place no conditions or assumptions on this analysis and ignores the fact that even the most well run clinical trials have imbalances between arms.you always want to see a Cox analysis produce a p-value equal to or lower than that of the log rank analysis of the survival data.When the Cox analysis produces a higher p-value - particularly a p-value greater than p=0.05 - then you have problems. Log rank is also considered by some to be the more pure measure of statistical significance since the Cox analysis depends on a qualitative judgment i.e weather there is increase or decrease of survival
