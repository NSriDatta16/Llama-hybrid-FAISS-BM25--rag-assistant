How can I sell a profile on magento?

I want to build a magento virtual store, where i can sell profiles in a website community. A profile is actually an account (identified with a unique code or password and username) where the user can fill some data, in my website community (the community is a separated platform, with a separated database). How can i do that? Is it possible to have a magento product like a unique code, that will be generated after the payment is done? Thanks a lot!
