Your sample is mostly on the right track. But your branch parameter is numeric. So you should use AS400ZonedDecimal instead of AS400Text: AS400ZonedDecimal branchNbr = new AS400ZonedDecimal(7,0) The RPG program may be expecting packed instead of zoned. No big deal, just use AS400PackedDecimal instead. As you construct your ProgramParameter object, your constructor requirements are different depending on if they are input or output parameters to your program. For input parameters, just pass the toBytes() results. There is no need to include the length. For output-only parameters, just pass the length. I agree with Robert's answer that there is some missing information, but his assumptions on the outputness of the error code seems valid. I would guess, however, that the DCIndicator parameter is input since your sample passes a value. For the error code parameter, after your program call, you'll need to extract the value and do something with it. Given what you have already, here is how the program call would work. Take note that I specified a library name of "MyLibrary". That is for example purposes. You will have to determine which library your program object is in. ProgramCall pgm = new ProgramCall(as400, QSYSObjectPathName.toPath("MyLibrary","ZM30000R","PGM"), parmList); if (pgm.run() == true) { String sErrorCode = (String) errorCodeTxt.toObject(parmList[3].getOutputData()); //Do something with your output data. } else { AS400Message[] messageList = pgm.getMessageList(); for (int i=0; i Something else to consider is library lists. Does the RPG program expect certain libraries to be in the library list? If so, you should issue CommandCalls to add the libraries to the library list before calling the program.
