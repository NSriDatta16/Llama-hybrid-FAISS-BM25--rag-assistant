Let me give it how I got it reading Tim's answer . It is based on the table views with hypothesis (estimated parameter) in columns and observations in the rows. In the first table, you have col probabilities sum to 1, i.e. they are conditional probabilities, whose condition, getting into the column event is supplied in the bottom row, called 'prior'. In the last table, rows similarly sum to 1 and in the middle you have joint probabilities, i.e. conditional probabilities you find in the first and last table times the probability of the condition, the priors. The tables basically perform the Bayesian transform: in the first table, you give p.d.f of the observations (rows) in every column, set the prior for this hypothesis (yes, hypothesis column is a pdf of observations under that hypothesis), you do that for every column and table takes it first into the joint probabilites table and, then into the probabilities of your hypothesis, conditioned by observations. As I have got from Tim's answer (correct me if I am wrong), the Critical Interval approach looks at the first table. That is, once experiment is complete, we know the row of the table (either heads or tails in my example but you may make more complex experiments, like 100 coin flips and get a table with 2^100 rows). Frequentialist scans through its columns, which, as I have said, is a distribution of possible outcomes under condition that hypothesis colds true (e.g. coin is fair in my example), and rejects those hypothesis (columns) that has give very low probability value at the observed row. Bayesianist first adjust the probabilities, converting cols into rows and looks at table 3, finds the row of the observed outcome. Since it is also a p.d.f, he goes through the experiment outcome row and picks the highest-prob hypethesis until his 95% credibility pocket is full. The rest of hypothesis is rejected. How do you like it? I am still in the process of learning and graphic seems helpful to me. I belive that I am on the right track since a reputable user gives the same picture, when analyzes the difference of two approaches . I have proposed a graphical view of the mechanics of hypothesis selection. I encourage everybody to read that Keith last answer but my picture of hypothesis test mechanics can immediately say that frequentist does not look at the other hypothesis when verifies the current one whereas consideration of high credibile hypothesis highly impacts the reception/rejection of other hypotheses in bayesian analisys because if you have a single hypothesis which occurs 95% of times under observed data, you throw all other hypothesis immediately, regardless how well is data fit within them. Let's put the statistical power analysis, which contrast two hypotheses based on their confidence intervals overlap, aside. But, I seem have spotted the similarity between two approaches: they seem to be connected through P(A | B) > P(A) P(B|A) > P(B) property . Basically, if there is a dependence between A and B then it will show up as correlation in both freq and bayesian tables. So, doing one hypothesis test correlates with the other, they sorta must give the same results. Studying the roots of the correlation, will likely give you the connection between the two. In my question there I actually ask why is the difference instead of absolute correlation?
