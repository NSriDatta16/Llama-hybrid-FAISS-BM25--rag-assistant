The distribution of the attribute vs the measuring tool?

Assume an attribute is normally distributed. Assume we sample from the top 5% of that distribution. Assume we measure the attribute with a multiple-choice test. Assume the difficulty level of the m/c test is such that the average difficulty is p=.5 The scores on the m/c test will tend to be normally distributed due to the test score being based on the binomial distribution. But the underlying attribute is not normally distributed in the population we are sampling from (since the population for the sake of this quesion is the top 5% of a normal distribution). Will the data reflect the tail of the normal distribution that we are sampling from, or will the data reflect a normal distribution due to the m/c measuring tool?
