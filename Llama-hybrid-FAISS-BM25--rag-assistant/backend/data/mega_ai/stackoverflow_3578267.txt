You cannot (and probably don't want to anyway). See INTO Clause (TSQL) for the MSDN documentation. The problem is that sparse tables are a physical storage characteristic and not a logical characteristic, so there is no way the DBMS engine would know to copy over that characteristic. Moreover, it is a table-wide property and the SELECT can have multiple underlying source tables. See the Remarks section of the page I linked where it discusses how you can only use default organization details.
