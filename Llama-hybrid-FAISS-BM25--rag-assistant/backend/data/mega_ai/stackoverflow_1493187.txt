C# Read text formatting?

I want to be able to read text from a Silverlight TextBlock (TextBlock Control) (Silverlight & C#) and check what formatting (as in: bold, italic, font size, etc...) has been applied to it, so I can store it in an XML file. Is it possible to find out what formatting has been applied to a piece of text with C# and Silverlight so it can be stored and re-used later? The text would be contained within a textbox or textblock control. Storage used can be XML but I've just found out Silverlight doesn't support XSL, so just XML. Regards, T
