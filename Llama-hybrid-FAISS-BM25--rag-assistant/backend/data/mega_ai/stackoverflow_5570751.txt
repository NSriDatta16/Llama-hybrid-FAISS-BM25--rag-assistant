As mentioned by spinning_plate, this problem is #P-complete so start looking for your aproximations :). I really like the #P-completeness proof for this problem, so I'd think it would be nice to share it: Let N be the number of paths (starting at s ) in the graph and p_k be the number of paths of length k . We have: N = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n Now build a second graph by changing every edge to a pair of paralel edges.For each path of length k there will now be k^2 paths so: N_2 = p_1*2 + p_2*4 + ... + p_n*(2^n) Repeating this process, but with i edges instead of 2, up n, would give us a linear system (with a Vandermonde matrix) allowing us to find p_1, ..., p_n. N_i = p_1*i + p_2*(i^2) + ... Therefore, finding the number of paths in the graph is just as hard as finding the number of paths of a certain length. In particular, p_n is the number of Hamiltonian Paths (starting at s ), a bona-fide #P-complete problem. I havent done the math I'd also guess that a similar process should be able to prove that just calculating average length is also hard. Note: most times this problem is discussed the paths start from a single edge and stop wherever. This is the opposite from your problem, but you they should be equivalent by just reversing all the edges.
