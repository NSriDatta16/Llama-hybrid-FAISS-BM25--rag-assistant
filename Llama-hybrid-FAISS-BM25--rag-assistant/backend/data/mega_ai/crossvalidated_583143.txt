I don't think this result is too surprising. Each of the points in your plot has an associated error measurement associated with it. The overall number of holes only varies in a small range, so the error will be similar at both extremes of number of holes. The largest number of holes you have is still quite small, so the results seem to be primarily driven by the scarcity of data. To apply a high-complexity model like boosting or random forest, you'll need much more data.
