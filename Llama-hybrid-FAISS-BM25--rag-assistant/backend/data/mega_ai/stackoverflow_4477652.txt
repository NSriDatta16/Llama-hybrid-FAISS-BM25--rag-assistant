The longer answer is that you've stumbled on a programming style which is popular because it's very concise, yet still easy to understand. It's a shortcut way to write: if ! @page_title.nil? return @page_title else return "Pragmatic Store" end So that one line with logical or's removes the need for an if/then. It does this because of the way that || is evaluated: from left-to-right, stopping at the first item that's not false. The example you found also leaves out the return keyword, because it's not explicitly necessary here.
