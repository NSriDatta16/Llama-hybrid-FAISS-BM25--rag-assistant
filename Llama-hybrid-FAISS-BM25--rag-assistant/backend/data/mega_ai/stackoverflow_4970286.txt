dh-make-perl is actually the right tool to put CPAN modules into Debian packages. Together with apt-file it can even prepare proper dependencies for you. About being able to "easily roll-back" though requires special attention to versioning or workflows. There are several approaches that might get your job done here: If you can force-downgrade packages you have won already most of the time unless you have very specific maintainer scripts that do jobs on package upgrades - then you will have to make them able to handle the downgrade, too If you have to go the regular upgrade-path, using approaches like using " +rollback " or similar might be something to consider. Dependency-packages are always a good idea for deployments to make sure no required package actually is missing. Also, you might want to invest some time in management frameworks like puppet , they might come handy here, too.
