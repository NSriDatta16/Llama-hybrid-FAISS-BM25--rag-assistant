What are good initial weights in a neural network?

I have just heard, that it's a good idea to choose initial weights of a neural network from the range $(\frac{-1}{\sqrt d} , \frac{1}{\sqrt d})$, where $d$ is the number of inputs to a given neuron. It is assumed, that the sets are normalized - mean 0, variance 1 (don't know if this matters). Why is this a good idea?
