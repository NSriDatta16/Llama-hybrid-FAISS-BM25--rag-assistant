The $h()$ is not a probability, it is a hazard, although they are monotonically related. The Cox model is not a full likelihood procedure, it maximizes a partial likelihood. Even though we don't directly estimate the hazard function as a nuisance parameter (which would be a conditional likelihood approach), we pretend we know what order people enter and leave the cohort, and who fails or is censored. This grouping, called the risk sets, is the key to the "normalizing" factor here. If we had a logistic regression, we would simply use the covariates to predict the probability of being a "case" in an analysis. However, since the sums of hazards don't normalize to any constant or have any bounds or constraints aside from being positive, we need to consider how many others are in a risk set to sort of rank the risk of a particular subject being a case in a particular risk set.
