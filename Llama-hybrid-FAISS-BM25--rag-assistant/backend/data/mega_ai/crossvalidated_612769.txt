Interpretation of DCC-GARCH model

For my Master thesis I have to perform the DCC-GARCH model to examine the correlation between real estate house prices and the stock market. I tested the data for normality (both not normal) and stationarity (both not stationary) and variance ratio test (was significant). I used the log function because of the non-normality and took the first difference. After this, the real estate house prices were still not stationary, so I took the second difference which resulted in stationary data. The stock market data was stationary after taking the first difference, but I think I need to take the second difference as well in order to use it for the DCC-GARCH model. The code I used for the DCC model is: #perform DCC model1=ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder=c(0,0)),variance.model = list(garchOrder=c(1,1),model="sGARCH"),distribution.model = "norm") modelspec=dccspec(uspec = multispec(replicate(2,model1)),dccOrder = c(1,1), distribution = "mvnorm") modelfit=dccfit(modelspec,data=(data.frame(ts_nominal,ts_share))) modelfit I'm not sure if I took the right steps to perform this analysis or if my code is even correct. Compared to other papers, I find it strange that only 3 parameters are significant and that alpha1 for stocks and dcca1 are almost equal to 1. Can anyone help me with this? Update: Further Research I have proceeded by taking the log return of both the property price index and stock price index. Then I used the diff() function, resulting in both time series being stationary. The results, however, are barely different than the last results I showed in the post.

For this, I extracted the dynamic correlations from the DCC-GARCH model, but as you can see in the graph 'fcor', these correlations all have the same value of 0.133784 with minimal changes. mod1=lm(fcor~long) > summary(mod1) Call: lm(formula = fcor ~ long) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.000000010205 -0.000000003962 -0.000000001022 0.000000004495 0.000000019842 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Can someone explain to me why the dynamic correlations barely change and why this has an effect on the linear regression result?
