It's not a problem strictly speaking, but you should pay attention to whether that interpretation makes sense in the context of your problem. If the squared value is what's important to your dependent variable, then this is what you'd expect to happen because it would have more explanatory power than the raw variable. For example, if you're a sports fan, you could use a players age to predict their performance. If you mean-shift that to something like 27, then the age variable can be negative if it is below 27 and positive if it's greater than 27. Well, players performance tends to have an arc that peaks at age 27, so if you put the raw age into the regression, chances are it would show not significant. If you put age^2 in though, it would. And likewise if you gave Lasso the choice between the two, it's a no brainer.
