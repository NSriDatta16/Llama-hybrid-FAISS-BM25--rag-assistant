I'm not sure if this will work for your particular situation or not, but can you execute this query with a stored procedure? If so, you can: A) Create a temp table with all your normal result columns, plus a Row column as an auto-incremented identity. B) Select-Insert your original query, sans the row column (SQL will fill this in automatically for you) C) Select * on the temp table for your result set. Not the most elegant solution, but will accomplish the row numbering you are wanting.
