Having trouble creating my Neural Network inputs

I'm currently working on a neural network that should have N parameters in input. Each parameters can have M different values (discrete values), let's say {A,B,C,…,M}. It also has a discrete number of outputs. How can I create my inputs from this situation? Should I have N×M inputs (having 0 or 1 as value), or should I think of a different approach?
