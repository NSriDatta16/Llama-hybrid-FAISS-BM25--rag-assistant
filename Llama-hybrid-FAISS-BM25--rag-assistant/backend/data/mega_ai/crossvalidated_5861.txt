A boxplot isn't that complicated. After all, you just need to compute the three quartiles , and the min and max which define the range; a subtlety arises when we want to draw the whiskers and various methods have been proposed. For instance, in a Tukey boxplot values outside 1.5 times the inter-quartile from the first or third quartile would be considered as outliers and displayed as simple points. See also Methods for Presenting Statistical Information: The Box Plot for a good overview , by Kristin Potter. The R software implements a slightly different rule but the source code is available if you want to study it (see the boxplot() and boxplot.stats() functions). However, it is not very useful when the interest is in identifying outliers from a very skewed distribution (but see, An adjusted boxplot for skewed distributions , by Hubert and Vandervieren, CSDA 2008 52(12)). As far as online visualization is concerned, I would suggest taking a look at Protovis which is a plugin-free js toolbox for interactive web displays. The examples page has very illustrations of what can be achieved with it, in very few lines.
