Extra Customer Functionality in Magento

I am building a Magento extension, in which I need to have the following three functionalities:- Each product in my Magento store will have the option to upload multiple image files, and it differs product-to-product. Some specific products may have 4 & some 3 & some will have 2 image files to be uploaded. But these files can only be uploaded by a registered customer only when he has paid the order first. After the order has been paid, customer can login into his account & see the order items in his "My Orders" section. In that section, he will be provided with options to upload files based on the product Sku. This is because some product Sku will have 4 file upload options available & some will have 3 & some 2 (as said in the last point). The admin can view those files in either the Customer's details or the Sales details. Can anybody please highlight what needs to be done in order to extend the Magento functionality without even touching the core Magento code. Many many thanks in advance.
