Combining parameter errors with phylogenetic errors

Say I am running a phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) regression with one predictor. A model will return me a coefficient with a standard error - corrected for phylogenetic relatedness. I also know there is uncertainty surrounding the phylogeny is use, so I run the same model multiple times using a sample of phylogenies from a MCMC generated posterior. Is there a way to combine the standard errors from each model (which will presumably be slightly different from model to model) with the phylogenetic error from across all models?
