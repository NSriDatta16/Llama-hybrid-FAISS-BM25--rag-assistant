I think the problem stems from how you treat angles greater than 180 (and those greater than 360 as well). If you reduce the angles to a range of +180 to -180 before adding them to the total, you get something more reasonable: int AverageOfAngles(int angles[], int count) { int total = 0; for (int index = 0; index 180) { angle -= 360; } total += angle; } return (int)((float)total/count); }
