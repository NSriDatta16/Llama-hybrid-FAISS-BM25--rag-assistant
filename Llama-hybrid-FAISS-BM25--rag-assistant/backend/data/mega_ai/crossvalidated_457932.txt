When "scoring" a data set, it is essential to have a clear understanding of your optimal scoring method. Is your goal to predict the website views a company gets, or the profit, the probability of failure, or something else? Without a clear goal, you are effectively just playing with numbers until you like what you see. Once you have identified a clear goal, you formulate that into a fitness function that can allow you to apply your model to your dataset, and get back a single number telling you how well your model fits. From there, you can optimize the parameters of any scoring model you want to try. If you are after an analytical formula, you are right to simply choose some form that "sounds good" then try them out and see how good they do. Sometimes your best forms will seem a little hard to interpret. This is normal in the field of ML and you have to balance that with your numeric fitness. That's called model transparency. What you have ended up with is effectively a linear mixture model in the log domain ( $\exp(a*\log(x)+b*\log(y))$ ), which is not uncommon. If you want to experiment with more general forms for your scoring, also consider using a decision tree or neural network.
