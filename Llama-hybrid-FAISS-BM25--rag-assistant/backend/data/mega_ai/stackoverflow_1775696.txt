WebBrowser Customization You can also look into IDocHostUIHandler::GetDropTarget if you want to control what the WebBrowser Control does during drag-and-drop operations. The easiest way to hook up an implementation of IDocHostUIHandler is to hook up the ICustomDoc interface and all its SetUIHandler method (see http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/advhost.asp ). This method has memory leak though. Another method is to skip Windows Form's webbrowser class and use the ActiveX host support directly .
