box2d: bigger clickable/touchable area

I'm using Box2D on my iPhone app using Cocos2D. I'm using mouse joint to drag objects by touch. The touch event is handled to find the corresponding Box2D body using AABB queries. I would want to extend the area of Box2D bodies. In this way, I can touch approximately my body and still respond. Does it exist any way to do this? Thanks!
