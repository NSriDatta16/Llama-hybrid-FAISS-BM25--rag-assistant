The goal of much research is not to reach a final conclusion, but just to obtain a little more evidence to incrementally push the community's sense of a question in one direction . Bayesian statistics are indispensable when what you need is to evaluate a decision or conclusion in light of the available evidence. Quality control would be impossible without Bayesian statistics. Any procedure where you need to take some data and then act on it (robotics, machine learning, business decision making) benefits from Bayesian statistics. But a lot of researchers are not doing that. They are running some experiments, collecting some data, and then saying "The data points this way", without really worrying too much about whether that's the best conclusion given all the evidence others have gathered so far. Science can be a slow process, and a statement like "The probability that this model is correct is 72%!" is often premature or unnecessary. This is appropriate in a simple mathematical way, too, because frequentist statistics often turn out to be mathematically the same as the update-step of a Bayesian statistic. In other words, while Bayesian statistics is (Prior Model, Evidence) â†’ New Model, frequentist statistics is just Evidence, and leaves it to others to fill in the other two parts.
