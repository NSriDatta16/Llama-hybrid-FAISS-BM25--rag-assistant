I write VB.NET and C# interchangeably (about 50/50) in the apps I manage, and I've always had a slight preference for VB.NET (I've been programming in BASIC-lineage languages for 25 years, since I was 9, but only about 15 years in C-based languages). That said, I find C# is a better language for libraries. This has nothing to do with VB.NET's limitations and everything to do with C#'s. I want my libraries to be easy to call from both VB.NET and C# code. When I write in C#, I tend pay attention to things that matter when calling the code from C#. Two examples of this are C#'s case sensitivity and its lack of optional parameters. But when I write library code in VB.NET, I'm not as tuned-in on issues that could make my API less friendly to C# callers.
