I always have a separate test project for each project. Part of it is simply I like the organization of it, but I've also often run into situations where I've decide to break a library out into it's own solution so that it can be reused by other solutions. In those cases, having the library project have it's own separate test project (rather than all the tests in a single project) makes it much easier to break that library out.
