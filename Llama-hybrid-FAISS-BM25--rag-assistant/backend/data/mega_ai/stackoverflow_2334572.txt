How to hunt down HTTP request?

Trying to optimize one web project. It uses asp.net (webforms), bunch of jquery plugins and whatnot. Problem: there's unnecessary HTTP request to localhost/undefined and that makes every request take ~1s longer than needed. Question: is there any tactic to find guilty code? Clue: undefined makes me think that there's JS involved. Firebug log: GET /undefined HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:17817 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; lv; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 Accept: image/png,image/ ;q=0.8, / ;q=0.5 Accept-Language: lv,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-13,utf-8;q=0.7, ;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://localhost:17817/Default.aspx if you right click a line in the code, it gives you a conditional breakpoint. Check the name of the variable that has the URL value, and set a condition when typeof URL === 'undefined' or url === 'undefined' and look at the stack Just set breakproint at line 3400 (with no conditions). It does not go through there. 3397 ajax: function( s ) { 3398 // Extend the settings, but re-extend 's' so that it can be 3399 // checked again later (in the test suite, specifically) 3400 s = jQuery.extend(true, s, jQuery.extend(true, {}, jQuery.ajaxSettings, s)); Narrowed issue down a bit => commented out 1 ascx controller that renders some images and uses gallerific jquery plugin and magic request dissapeared. Problem was with galleriffic plugin initialization. It couldn't find anchor and it's href for creating thumbnails when there were no images or something. It's cool now...
