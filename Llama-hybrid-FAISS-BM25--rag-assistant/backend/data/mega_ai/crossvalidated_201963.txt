ANOVA / t-test to compare the errors of different models

I have two forecasting models, moving average and single exponential smoothing. The values of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is 5.2%, 5.8%. Since the difference of MAPE between the models are very close, I am quite confused which model to choose. Can we perform a t-test or ANOVA on Absolute Percentage Error (APE) data sets of two different models to check whether the difference is significant? If the difference is significant can we choose the model with low MAPE?
