I don't know if there is a way to tie in to the method generated by the timer to invoke the server action. However you can gain a reference to the javascript component and start/stop or change the interval. With this in mind, you can do some nasty hacking to get the functionality you want. For instance: Gain a reference to your timer. (something like: $find(‘ ’); ) Stop the timer. Create a new timer with the same interval. Execute your timer and cause the condition. Depending on the return value of your condition.. you can set the server generated timer interval to ~0 and start/stop. This is not an elegant solution, but I can't say i've ever worked with built in asp.net timers so I can't offer too much insight.
