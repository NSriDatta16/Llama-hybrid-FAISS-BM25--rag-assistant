K Fold Cross Validation in Python

I am trying to compare 2 classifying methods (SVC vs Random Forest) in order to do that I am using the cross_val_score function. It is posible to use the same folds in both methods? In order to obtain a more accurate comparison code: cross_val_score(SVC(gamma='auto'), x, y,cv=10) cross_val_score(RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=40),x, y,cv=10) Thanks!!
