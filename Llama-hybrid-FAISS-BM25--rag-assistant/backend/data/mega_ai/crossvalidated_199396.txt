Can a linear regression output a Normal Distribution?

If I want to use a linear/multiple regression in order to predict a value, can the output of this regression be a normal distribution, with the mean value being the traditional output, but there being an additional output of the variance/standard deviation? Ideally, what I'd like to do is to be able to know the confidence of my regression. I know this is something more akin to Bayesian inference, though it is a desirable property for my current application. I guess this would make it no longer be a linear regression though, as the output is no longer a line, but a more complex curve. Is there a name for this kind of regression? Is it maybe possible to do a second regression on the residuals to produce a function which encodes the distribution? Or is this possibly unnecessary?
