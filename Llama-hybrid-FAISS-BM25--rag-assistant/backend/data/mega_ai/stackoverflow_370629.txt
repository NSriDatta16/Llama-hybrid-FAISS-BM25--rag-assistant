This is a common problem many companies that send out automated emails face today, overzealous spam filters. I've seen my brokerage and bank simply start off each email with "Please add 'yourstatement@bank.com' to your safe senders list." Keep in mind this brokerage and bank probably have an army of developers and still resort to a reminder to the human recipient :) Most spam filters are based of Bayesian algorithms, and they will never get it 100% right.
