How do you build a model that predicts the total and the total by product so they add up for each client?

Imagine you can buy only 3 distinct products (A, B, C) in a store, so that: $Y_{T} = Y_{A} + Y_{B} + Y_{C}$ I need to predict the total and the total by product for each client, but I need the estimates to add up : $\hat{Y}_{T} = \hat{Y}_{A} + \hat{Y}_{B} + \hat{Y}_{C}$ I have historical transactional and demographic data, so I can build different features for the total and for each family that each client buys. How do you approach this problem with Machine Learning?
