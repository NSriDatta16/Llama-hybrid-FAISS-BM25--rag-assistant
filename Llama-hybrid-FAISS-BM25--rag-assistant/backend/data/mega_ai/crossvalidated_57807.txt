Confusion with Augmented Dickey Fuller test

I am working on the data set electricity available in R package TSA . My aim is to find out if an arima model will be appropriate for this data and eventually fit it. So I proceeded as follows: 1st: Plot the time series which resulted if the following graph: 2nd: I wanted to take log of electricity to stabilize variance and afterward differenced the series as appropriate, but just before doing so, I tested for stationarity on the original data set using the adf (Augmented Dickey Fuller) test and surprisingly, it resulted as follows: Code and Results: adf.test(electricity) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: electricity Dickey-Fuller = -9.6336, Lag order = 7, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Warning message: In adf.test(electricity) : p-value smaller than printed p-value Well, as per my beginner's notion of time series, I suppose it means that the data is stationary (small p-value, reject null hypothesis of non-stationarity). But looking at the ts plot, I find no way that this can be stationary. Does anyone has a valid explanation for this?
