How to combine results from Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for multiple imputed data sets from proc MI in SAS

Endpoint information: We have seizure count collected for every day and therefore there will be some missing for some days. We got average seizure frequency per 28-day, for an interval. That is, (seizure acount for a interval)/ (days with available seizure count during the interval)*28. For example, baseline period (28 days) DB period (99 days). Then the endpoint is percent change from baseline in seizure frequency. (per 28-day seizure frequency during DB - per 28-day seizure frequency during baseline)/(per 28-days seizure frequency during baseline) 100% . We will impute seizure count for each day if it is missing. So we will have m (say 10) imputed seizure count data sets. Q1. After imputation, we plan calculaton the endpoint for each imputed data, is this correct? Can we stack all the 10 data sets and then calculate the endpoint? Q2. Assume we calculate the endpoint for each imputed data. Then do Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. We will have 10 p-values and 10 corresponding 'z' values, etc. How should we combine them together to get one pooled p-value? How should we make inferences based on the 10 imputed data sets? Thanks.
