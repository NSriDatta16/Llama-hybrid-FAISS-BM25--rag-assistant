This is can be done with no problems, i want to tell you that Ubercart as a choice is very good , and more organized than ecommerce, just wanted to tell you that so you know you are on a good track. I hope you are familiar with hooks, and if not , you can understand them easily in no time, in Ubercart there is a hook_order which gives you the ability to add a functionality when the order is being newly added , saved, updated , or any other state , check this link : http://www.ubercart.org/docs/api/hook_order I hope that was helpful enough.
