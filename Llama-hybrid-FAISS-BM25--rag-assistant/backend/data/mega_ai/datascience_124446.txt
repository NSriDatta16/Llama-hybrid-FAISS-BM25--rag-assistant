Very basic but how to understand data statistically for machine learning?

I’m trying to solidify my statistics so I really know how to use them in my analysis/models. However my concept of statistical testing gets completely messed up by context. I’m unsure defining exactly what is a population vs a sample to even begin with in real cases. This is rather very embarrassing to write but I need help as a rookie. For instance, let’s say I want to predict a value for some business case. If I use my customer base, is that technically the population? Or is it a sample of all potential customers? I'm unsure on defining exactly what is an is not a population, and if it is data of an entire population, how does that affect the training process/metrics? And when I am training a model, if I'm using a subset (train set), then that would then be considered a sample? I’m not sure if I’m explaining it well, but hopefully someone can see what I’m not understanding when it comes to relating statistics to ML datasets, training or use cases. :’)
