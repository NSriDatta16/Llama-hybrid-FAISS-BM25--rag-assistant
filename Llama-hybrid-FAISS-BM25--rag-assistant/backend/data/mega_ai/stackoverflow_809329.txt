On the couple of occasions where I've had a similar need to work cross-domain I've sidestepped it by using an embedded borderless iframe of the same color as the embedding page. It's an old technique, predating widespread AJAX use and is often overlooked nowadays because of the 'we'll use AJAX' mindset. you can however do quite a lot with this approach and it might suffice if you are truly stuck. Certainly you can code some quite complex interactions between the embedded and main pages which can give, to some extent, a similar user experience to an AJAX-enabled page. One obvious thought that does occur though, and one I have never tried - is it possible to embed an iframe for the second domain inside the main page (i.e. the first domain) and communicate from the main page to the second domain via the embedded iframe?
