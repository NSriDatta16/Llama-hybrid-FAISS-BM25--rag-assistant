Not necessarily. You might have high Cronbach's alpha while items are weakly correlated. The reason is that Cronbach's alpha does not only depend on the correlation/covariance of the items, but also the number of items. If the number of items are high enough (which is probably the case in your analysis), you will have high Cronbach's alpha, even though the items are weakly correlated. As a quick example, we can look at the formula of the standardized alpha : $$\alpha_\text{standardized} = \frac{K \bar r}{1 + (K - 1)\bar r}$$ Where $K$ is the number of items and $\bar r$ is the mean correlation among the items. If you have 50 items, an average correlation of 0.15 will give 0.9 alpha. If this is the case, it is not surprising to get poor results from the factor analysis. A critical assessment of Cronbach's alpha: Sijtsma, K., 2009. On the Use, the Misuse, and the Very Limited Usefulness of Cronbach’s Alpha. Psychometrika 74, 107–120.
