Well the answer to the question is probably a matter of preference and depends on whether you want to specialize in some specific field (e.g. reinforcement learning) or you're aiming at having a more in-depth (but not limited to one subfield) view on machine learning. If it's the latter I would recommend you to look at the following two titles (both available online): Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, Kevin P. Murphy Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Christopher M. Bishop
