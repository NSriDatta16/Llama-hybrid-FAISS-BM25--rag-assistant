you can include the sites with only two counts in your analysis. One way is to create a multi-level model, assign prior distributions to all the observables and then use the data to update to the posterior distribution (essentially a bayesian analysis). For guidance, look at (Gelman, Hill 2006) and the tutorials for using STAN. One keyword to look for is "data imputation" to handle missing values.
