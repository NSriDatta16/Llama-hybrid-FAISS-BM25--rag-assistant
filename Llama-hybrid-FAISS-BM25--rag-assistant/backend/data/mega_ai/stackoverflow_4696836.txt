Edited: So we established that patch is not an SVN tool. SVN doesn't have any direct influence on this, unless it created the patch file incorrectly. Are you sure the patchfile was created from the trunk? If so, your copy should be identical to the one that the patch was based on, so there should be no reason for it to fail. The only conclusion I can think of is that there is something wrong with the patch file; it does not match your file. Confirm that dir/file.xml in your working copy really contains starting at line 7. (I'm assuming the code in your question is just an edited copy anyway, because there should be 7 lines there, not 4.) That is, does the content of the file match the content of the patch? Pay particular attention to spacing and line endings. If it does, then there should be no reason why patch would fail that hunk.
