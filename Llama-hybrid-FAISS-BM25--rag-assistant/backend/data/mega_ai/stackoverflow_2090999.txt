That is because you are accessing Google Calendar via your personal port. Whenever you access that specific URL, Google checks to see if you are logged in. If not, it sends a 404. If you are, it outputs the calendar based on the settings you provided. That URL does not specify a specific calendar that it's supposed to pull from the site, and it cannot use the cookies stored on the user's computer because it is being fetched from your server, which will not have any cookies for a calendar. When I try to access that page without logging on, I get a 401 Authorization Required error, which I bet is what PHP is getting and you just don't realize it. You need to go into your Google Calendar settings and find the embedding options to find a URL that is specific to your account so that it will always fetch an XML feed for your calendar.
