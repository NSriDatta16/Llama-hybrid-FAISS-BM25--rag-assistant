Bayesian batting average prior

I wanted to ask a question inspired by an excellent answer to the query about the intuition for the beta distribution. I wanted to get a better understanding of the derivation for the prior distribution for the batting average. It looks like David is backing out the parameters from the mean and the range. Under the assumption that the mean is $0.27$ and the standard deviation is $0.18$, can you back out $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by solving these two equations: \begin{equation} \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}=0.27 \\ \frac{\alpha\cdot\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^2\cdot(\alpha+\beta+1)}=0.18^2 \end{equation}
