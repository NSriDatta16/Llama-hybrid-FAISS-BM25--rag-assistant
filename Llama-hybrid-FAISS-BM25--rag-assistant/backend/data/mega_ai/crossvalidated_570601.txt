Making binary prediction with GPBoost (or MERF)

My question is regarding this post from 1.5 years ago: Modelling clustered data using boosted regression trees My label is a binary variable (yes/no). Is it possible to use GPBoost / MERF in order to make predictions for this binary variable? I wasn't able to find an answer to this question really quick. If no, which multilevel/mixed effects models can do this? I've already found Mixed Effects Logistic Regression. Thanks, Kind regards, Olivier
