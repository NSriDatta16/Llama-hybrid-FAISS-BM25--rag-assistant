Pickle is only meant to write complete (small) objects. Your dictionary is a bit large to even hold in memory, you'd better use a database instead so you can store and retrieve entries one by one instead of all at once. Some good and easily integratable singe-file database formats you can use from Python are SQLite or one of the DBM variants . The last one acts just like a dictionary (i.e. you can read and write key/value-pairs) but uses the disk as storage rather than 1.2 GBs of memory.
