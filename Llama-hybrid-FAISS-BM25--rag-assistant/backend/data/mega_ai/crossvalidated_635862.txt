I must admit that the question is somewhat confusing. Do you have students in schools or tumors in patients ?? Anyway, a linear mixed model seems like a good approach to your problem. Obviously, the dependent Variable is the test scores of the students. As for the other variables, Group is he type of class (language, history/geography, sports). This is a categorical variable. Time is the timing of the test (before, during, after). This is also categorical but can be treated as a continuous variable if the timing is equally spaced. For the random effects, you have students nested within schools, to account for the non-independence of students within the same school, and repeated measures within the same student. In SPSS, go to Analyze > Mixed Models > Linear….. The screen should look like this: Select your dependent variable (test scores). Under “Subjects,” select the variable that identifies your schools. Under “Repeated,” select the variable that identifies your students. For fixed effects, include group, time, and any interaction terms you are interested in (like group*time). For random effects, you can start with random intercepts for schools. You might also consider random slopes if you hypothesize that the effect of time varies by school or student. Specify your covariance structure. A simple starting point is the diagonal structure, but you may need to try different structures based on model fit. Model Checking: After running the model, check the model fit (like -2 Restricted Log Likelihood). Look at residuals to check for normality and homoscedasticity. Consider using information criteria (AIC, BIC) for comparing models if you try different covariance structures or random effects. The fixed effects will tell you about the average effect of the group and time on test scores. Interaction terms (if included) can tell you if the effect of the crash course varies by group. Make sure your data is properly formatted for mixed models. Each row should be a unique student-time observation. Given that LMMs were not covered in your statistics class, you might want to consult additional resources or seek guidance from a statistician. Finally, while SPSS can handle LMMs, it might not be as flexible or informative as some other statistical software packages. If you find SPSS's capabilities limiting, consider seeking access to software like R OR Python (which are free) better community support.
