spaCy - Text Preprocessing - Keeping "Pronouns" in text

I am fairly new to machine learning and NLP in general. I am trying to wrap my head around how to do proper text pre-processing (cleaning the text). I have built a custom text classification model. I have below method that I run on all input text, before serving it to my model. (both in training and testing). The method will remove stopwords, punctuations and lemmatize the text. import spacy from spacy.lang.en.stop_words import STOP_WORDS import string def normalize(text, lowercase, remove_stopwords, remove_punctuation): nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm", disable=['parser', 'tagger', 'ner']) stops = spacy.lang.en.stop_words.STOP_WORDS if lowercase: text = text.lower() text = nlp(text) if remove_punctuation: text = [t for t in text if t.text not in string.punctuation] lemmatized = list() for word in text: lemma = word.lemma_.strip() if lemma: if not remove_stopwords or (remove_stopwords and lemma not in stops): lemmatized.append(lemma) return " ".join(lemmatized) Consider below input string: Input: You're very beautiful! If I clean that text, using my method: test_text = "You're very beautiful!" test_text = normalize(test_text, lowercase=True, remove_stopwords=True, remove_punctuation=True) It will return: -PRON- beautiful Is this a "good" way to clean the text? I notice that -PRON- is kept and therefore also used when training the model (same goes for when testing the model, as I use the same normalize method). Should the -PRON- also be removed from the text? And should I complete even more text preprocessing?
