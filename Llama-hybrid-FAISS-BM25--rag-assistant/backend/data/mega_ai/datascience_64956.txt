Multiply Tensorflow sequential layer by fixed integers

I'm trying to make a simple reinforcement learning model that makes one of three decisions, A , B , or C . However, C will be effectively a "do nothing" decision. Because C will never result in an action, it should always have a value of 0. So all I want to do is multiply the 3 output nodes by 1, 1, 0. That is, I want to do an element-wise multiplication by a [1,1,0] tensor so that the A and B nodes retain their values from the previous layer and the C node always has a value of 0. I see that there's a Multiply layers class, which I think might work, but I'm seeing examples with the functional API. Is there another way to do this with the Sequential API?
