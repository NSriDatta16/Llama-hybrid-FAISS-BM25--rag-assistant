I've never heard of an established documentation standard for web application front-ends. That said, since you've identified the different aspects of your application that you want to track, you could keep this info in a docblock for each event handler, and use the jsdoc toolkit to generate some inline docs. IMHO, I think that since you know what it is that you want to document already, you should feel free to create documentation in whatever format makes the most sense for you, even if its completely unique to your app/organization. 8 hours on stackoverflow with no answers must mean there is no standard answer ;)
