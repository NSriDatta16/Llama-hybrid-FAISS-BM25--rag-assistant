The virtual memory for a process will be different from other process. Every process will get 4GB of virtual address space ( in 32 bit windows machine) and out of which you can use 2GB of user space ( remaining is for kernel). For stack, heap, static data storage and even loading the DLLs. (This is 3GB if you use large address space) Every process will get separate heap, stack independent of other process.
