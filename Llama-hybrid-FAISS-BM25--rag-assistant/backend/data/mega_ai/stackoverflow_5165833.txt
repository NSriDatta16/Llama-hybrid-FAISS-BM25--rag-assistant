Magento File Permissions + Strange errors

I've just done a fresh install of Magento but I'm getting some bizarre errors: For example within the admin area I go into System - Import / Export - Profiles ; then I just get There has been an error processing your request Exception printing is disabled by default for security reasons. Error log record number: 682005239838 I'm getting this pretty much everywhere... So I thought I'd upgrade Magento so went into Connect to do an upgrade: but when trying this I'm get also getting insufficient permission errors. So I'm probably assuming that all of this is related. Can anybody please advise, on what chmod permission I should set and on which folders? and Will this solve all my dramas? Best Regards Shane
