Why isn't there a remove(int position) method in Android's JSONArray?

I started building an Android app that uses a flat file for storage. The app doesn't store more than six records, and I'm familiar with JSON, so I just write out a JSONArray to the file. I just discovered today, though, that the Android JSON API doesn't include a remove() option. Huh? Do I have to dump the array into another collection, remove it, then rebuild the JSONArray ? What's the point?
