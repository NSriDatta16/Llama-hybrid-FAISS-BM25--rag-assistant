Ensemble models in their simplest form are just averaging (regression) or voting (classification) a prediction using multiple models. So for your example you could average the prediction vector of all 5 models. This is a valid ensemble model. This paper has an example of using the package ipred with generic models to improve the performance of an ensemble by using Bagging. You may want to look at Boosting which is the sort of optimization you describe when saying "naiveBayes compensates what KNN lacks".
