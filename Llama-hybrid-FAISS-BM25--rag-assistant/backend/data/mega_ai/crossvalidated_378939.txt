Dealing with singular fit in mixed models

Let's say we have a model mod |z|) (Intercept) 2.49686 0.06909 36.14 Here we observe a singular fit, because the correlation between intercept and x random effects is -1. Now, according to this helpful link one way to deal with this model is to remove higher-order random effects (e.g., X:ConditionB) and see whether that makes a difference when testing for singularity. The other is to use the Bayesian approach, e.g., the blme package to avoid singularity. What is the preferred method and why? I am asking this because using the first or the second one leads to different results - in the first case, I will remove the X:ConditionB random effect and won't be able to estimate the correlation between X and X:ConditionB random effects. On the other hand, using blme allows me to keep X:ConditionB and to estimate the given correlation. I see no reason why I should even use the non-bayesian estimations and remove random effects when singular fits occur when I can estimate everything with the Bayesian approach. Can someone explain to me the benefits and problems using either method to deal with singular fits?
