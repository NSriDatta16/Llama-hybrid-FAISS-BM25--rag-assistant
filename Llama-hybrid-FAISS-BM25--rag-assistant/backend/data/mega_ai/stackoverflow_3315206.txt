You most certainly should see a red error message indicating that the operation failed and why. If you do not see this then there is something hinky with the way you have built your create-user page. Try simply dragging a CreateUserWizard onto a new WebForm and try what you describe. And nick is correct in saying that you really should acknowledge the time and effort people take to help you with your problems by taking 2 seconds and clicking upvote and/or accept. That is the way that stackoverflow works and if you don't get with the program you are going to be ignored.
