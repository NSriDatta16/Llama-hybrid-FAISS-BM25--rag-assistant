Clustering and graphing similarities of sentence subjects

I have a bunch of sentences. Each sentence is given a weight of how "close" it is to a particular subject. Ex. "I love reading math books" Subjects for the above sentence = [Math: 10, Reading: 14, Romance: 1, Leisure: 4] Now I would like to create a graph of nodes, where each node is a sentence and place these nodes at the origin in a 2D plane. Each subject forms the circumference of a circle surrounding the nodes. The "closeness" of the nodes to their respective subjects is represented by their positions in the 2D plane. I figured I could do this by taking each score for a subject of a sentence and apply it as a vector. Then add all the vectors, for all the subjects, together to settle on a final position The resulting plane could look like this The idea here is that we can now bind each sentence node to each other with edges to create a proximity graph. Using a Gabriel graph, we can only bind the closest nodes together The entire goal here is to construct a script from a bunch of sentences where we can flow down the script going from subject to subject without too much discontinuity. As you can see I already have a method that seems to make sense. I was wondering however if there was already a set of methods for doing this kind of thing in data science. I was looking into spectral clustering , and similarity measure. I even looked into bioinformatics and found Needleman–Wunsch algorithm and Smith–Waterman algorithm . But I'm not knowledgable in data science or bioinformatics. Can I get some directions as to where I should be headed to solve this kind of problem. Is there already an established set of tools and methods for accomplishing it?
