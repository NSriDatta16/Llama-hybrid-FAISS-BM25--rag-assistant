Is there someone who worked on french text generation using GPT 2 model? I've seen two such projects: https://github.com/aquadzn/gpt2-french https://medium.com/@timohear/retraining-gpt-2-to-write-love-letters-in-french-92ae938bc452 Is there a pre-trained GPT 2 model on french text? Can we do finetuning on the Standard GPT 2 and obtain good results on french text? I haven't seen any available from scratch. But there are 4 separate (small) GPT2 models obtained by fine-tuning the (English) small GPT-2 model released by OpenAI on 4 different datasets: https://github.com/aquadzn/gpt2-french/releases/ Edit: as a followup, several GPT2 model fine-tuned on French data have been contributed to HuggingFace's Models hub: gpt2-french-small belgpt2 gpt2_french gpt2_french_pre_trained
