This is an interesting question and I did a quick research. The OP asked about regression for continuous data. But the paper cited by @Vikram only works for classification . Lu, Z., Kaye, J., & Leen, T. K. (2009). Hierarchical Fisher Kernels for Longitudinal Data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems . A related paper for regression I found is the following . Technical details can be found in Section 2.3. Seok, K. H., Shim, J., Cho, D., Noh, G. J., & Hwang, C. (2011). Semiparametric mixed-effect least squares support vector machine for analyzing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. Neurocomputing , 74(17), 3412-3419. No public software is found but the authors claimed the ease of use at the end of the paper. The main advantage of the proposed LS-SVM ... is that regression estimators can be easily computed by softwares solving a simple linear equation system. This makes it easier to apply the proposed approach to the analysis of repeated measurement data in practice. To elaborate a bit more, there are two approaches for regression analysis using SVM (support vector machine): support vector regression (SVR) [Drucker, Harris; Burges, Christopher J. C.; Kaufman, Linda; Smola, Alexander J.; and Vapnik, Vladimir N. (1997); "Support Vector Regression Machines", in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 9, NIPS 1996, 155–161] least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) [Suykens, Johan A. K.; Vandewalle, Joos P. L.; Least squares support vector machine classifiers, Neural Processing Letters , vol. 9, no. 3, Jun. 1999, pp. 293–300.] The aforementioned Seol et al. (2011) adopted the LS-VSM approach.
