How to make jQuery UI sortable divs dragged only from an icon?

I've used some jQuery UI sortable plugins but I always found the same problem, I can't select or click inside the sortable DIVs, So, maybe I can find the solution by putting an icon from where you only can drag the div so you can be able to select the other part. How to do that?
