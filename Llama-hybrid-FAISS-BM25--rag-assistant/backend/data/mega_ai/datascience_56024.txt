I suggest you: Lower the size of the kernel filters. The best filter is (3, 3). I think that a (7, 7) is leaving too much information out. If the size of the images is too big, consider the possiblity of rescaling them before training the CNN. If possible, remove one Max-Pool layer. Lower dropout, that looks too high IMHO (but other people might disagree with me on this). I usually set it between 0.1-0.25. The number of output nodes should equal the number of classes.
