I don't see anything in the code that would cause a cross browser issue. My feeling is that it's a problem doesn't lie in the code at all, but in the rendering of the div and/or its contents in Chrome and Opera (i.e. a CSS problem or something along those lines where the innerHTML of the div is updated, but because of styling or positioning you don't get the visual result you were looking for). Have you checked using Dragonfly or some other developer tool to verify that the contents of the target element are in fact unchanged after a successful request? Along those lines have you tried stepping through the code execution in the problem browsers? You could also try adding a error handler to the JQuery.ajax options to see if there is some problem with the request itself, although I don't believe that is where the problem lies. EDIT: I didn't see that last bit below the code block. So you have verified that the success handler isn't being executed. You said that you did try and implement an error handler for the request and got some undefined result, but I don't see it in the code. Could you post the code for the error handler and describe what in the error is undefined?
