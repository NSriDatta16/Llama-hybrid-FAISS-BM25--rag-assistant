At first to access your TextBox while your search is running you should put your search into a BackgroundWorker and put the (intermediate) results with BeginInvoke() into your TextBox. So your GUI doesn't hang while your search is running. Also you should use the TextBox.AppendText() method to add the text to your box. And if you want an auto-scroll use the two liner below after AppendText: textBoxMessages.SelectionStart = textBoxMessages.Text.Length; textBoxMessages.ScrollToCaret(); And if you want to enable/disable autoscroll you can before AppendText check if SelectionStart is equal to Text.Lenght and only if this is true make the above two liner after AppendText Update Ok, to get rid of that flickering there is no real solution within the textbox. When i mentioned right, you can give the RichTextBox a try, because it performs better with these scrolling problems. Last but not least you can use ScintillaNET . I used it already several times and for these purposes it solves all the problems. The only thing you can't do elegant by ScintillaNet (or better with Scintilla) is colorize manually a custom section. You have always to use a lexer which works with pre-defined formatting on a list of keywords.
