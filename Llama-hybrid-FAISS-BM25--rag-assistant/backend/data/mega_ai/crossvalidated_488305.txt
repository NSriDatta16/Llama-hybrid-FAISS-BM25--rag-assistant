What is the difference between `A*B*C` and `A*B + A*C` interaction when running a linear regression?

Let's say I have a response variable Y , and I want to predict it using variables A , B and C using a linear regression model. My problem is that I suspect that A and B might interact as well as A and C , but not B and C . Thus, I think that interaction A*B*C might not be the most appropriate. However, I don't know how to set this type of relationship among explanatory variables. In my real example, my response variable is the activity ( Activity ) of an animal, and my explanatory variables are the hour of the day ( Hour ), the moon illumination ( moon ) and the human presence ( human ). Following what I said in the first paragraph, I know that the moon effect changes depending on the hour of the day since not all the hours have the same type of moon. On the other side, the human presence occurs only at some specific hours of the day, so I also know that the "human presence" effect will depend on the hour of the day. But here, I don't want to consider the interaction between "moon" and "human". So, my doubt is what would be the right way of designing my model considering that Hour interact with Moon and Human but separately. What is the correct way of designing a regression model considering these conditions?. Should I consider it as Hour*Moon*Human or as Hour*Moon + Hour*Human or none of them? Any comment would be of great help
