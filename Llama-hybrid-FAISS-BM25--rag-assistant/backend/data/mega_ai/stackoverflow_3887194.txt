You could place your original query as a sub-query and SUM the records. I could not test this as I don't have the dataset you do, but it should work in theory ;) SELECT SUM(gid)/SUM(weights) AS calculated_average FROM ( SELECT gid, (COUNT(gid) * gid) AS weights FROM infor WHERE id = 4325 GROUP BY gid);
