Here is an idea that connects your binary dependent variable to a continuous, unobserved variable; a connection that may let you leverage the power of time series models for continuous variables. Define: $V_{w,t} = 1$ if violent incident happened in ward $w$ during time period $t$ and 0 otherwise $P_{w,t}$ : Propensity for violence in ward $w$ at time $t$. $P_{w,t}$ is assumed to be a continuous variable that in some sense represents 'pent-up' feelings of the inmates which boil over at some time and results in violence. Following this reasoning, we have: $V_{w,t} = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{if } P_{w,t} \ge \tau \\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}$ where, $\tau$ is an unobserved threshold which triggers a violent act. You can then use a time series model for $P_{w,t}$ and estimate the relevant parameters. For example, you could model $P_{w,t}$ as: $P_{w,t} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 P_{w,t-1} + ... + \alpha_p P_{w,t-p}+ \beta n_{w,t} + \epsilon_t$ where, $n_{w,t}$ is the number of patients in ward $w$ at time $t$. You could see if $\beta$ is significantly different from 0 to test your hypothesis that "more patients lead to an increase in probability of violence". The challenge of the above model specification is that you do not really observe $P_{w,t}$ and thus the above is not your usual time series model. I do not know anything about R so perhaps someone else will chip in if there is a package that would let you estimate models like the above.
