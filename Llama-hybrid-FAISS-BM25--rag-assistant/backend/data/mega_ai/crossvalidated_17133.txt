I think it would be worth exploring exponential smoothing models as well. Exponential smoothing models are a fundamentally different class of models from ARIMA models, and may yield different results on your data. This sounds like a valid approach, and is very similar to the time series cross-validation method proposed by Rob Hyndman . I would aggregate the cross-validation error from each forecast (exponential smoothing, ARIMA, ARMAX) and then use the overall error to compare the 3 methods. You may also want to consider a "grid search" for ARIMA parameters, rather than using auto.arima. In a grid search, you would explore each possible parameter for an arima model, and then select the "best" ones using forecast accuracy.
