Organizing Eclipse plugin/feature/update site project in SVN

I need some recommendation on how to organize Eclipse Plugin/Feature/Update Site projects in SVN. I have following Eclipse projects: Plug-in 1 Feature 1 Plug-in 2 Feature 2 Update Site Here are some additional information: Feature 1 is a feature for Plug-in 1, and so on, obviously. Both plugins are part of one product but can be selectively installed by checking or unchecking the desired feature from the Install New Software dialog. I am wondering if all these project should be under the "trunk" or each one should have a "branch/tag/trunk" under them. Or, perhaps the Eclipse project itself should be organized differently.
