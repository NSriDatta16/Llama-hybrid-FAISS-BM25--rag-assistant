I would offer you to combine predictions, not models. E.g., after you have 50 models, you can apply all of them on the testing data. Then you will get 50 prediction sets. And all this prediction sets you could use as an input to train another classifier/model (could be SVM as well). This is described in more details in the "Practical Machine Learning" course on Coursera from Johns Hopkins University: https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn . There is a "combining predictors" video, and slideset for it is available, for example, here: https://rpubs.com/pr9115/JLeek_025_CombiningPredictors
