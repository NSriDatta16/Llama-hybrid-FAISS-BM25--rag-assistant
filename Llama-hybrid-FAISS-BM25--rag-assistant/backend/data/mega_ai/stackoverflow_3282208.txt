AFAIK, Format-List does not provide such an option. For your particular example this should work: $x | Select-Object A, B | Format-List If the property set is not fixed/known then the procedure will be more tricky with use of Get-Member and some preprocessing making sorted parameter array for Select-Object . EDIT: Here it is (let's use $host instead of $x): $host | Select-Object ([string[]]($host | Get-Member -MemberType Property | %{ $_.Name } | Sort-Object)) | Format-List Christopher is right, Select-Object is not absolutely needed: $host | Format-List ([string[]]($host | Get-Member -MemberType Property | %{ $_.Name } | Sort-Object))
