Cannot drag activities from WPF ListBox into WorkflowView

I'm trying to host the Workflow Designer in a WPF application. The WorkflowView control is hosted under a WindowsFormsHost control. I've managed to load workflows onto the designer which is successfully linked to a PropertyGrid, also hosted in another WindowsFormsHost. WorkflowView workflowView = rootDesigner.GetView(ViewTechnology.Default) as WorkflowView; window.WorkflowViewHost.Child = workflowView; The majority of the rehosting code is the same as in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480213.aspx . I've created a custom Toolbox using a ListBox WPF control bound to a list of ToolboxItems. In the ListBox_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown handler: private void ListBox_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { ListBox parent = (ListBox)sender; UIElement dataContainer; //get the ToolboxItem for the selected item object data = GetObjectDataFromPoint(parent, e.GetPosition(parent), out dataContainer); //if the data is not null then start the drag drop operation if (data != null) { DataObject dataObject = new DataObject(); dataObject.SetData(typeof(ToolboxItem), data); DragDrop.DoDragDrop(parent, dataObject, DragDropEffects.Move | DragDropEffects.Copy); } } With that setup, I'm unable to drag any item from my custom Toolbox onto the designer. The cursor is always displayed as "No" anywhere on the designer. I've been trying to find anything about this on the net for half a day now and I really hope some can help me here. Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you! Carlos
