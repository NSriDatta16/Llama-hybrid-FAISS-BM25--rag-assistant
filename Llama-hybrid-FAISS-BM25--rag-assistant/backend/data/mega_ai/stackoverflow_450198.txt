Generally, Python is much, much more expressive than VB. Things which took many lines of code in VB can be represented more simply in Python. If the VB is truly epic in scale, a manual rewrite may be hard. But maintaining VB6 may be just as hard. If the VB is intimately tied to Windows GUI presentation, any rewrite may be hard. Some VB programs can have a cryptic organization where critical features are buried in the VB code attached to GUI controls. If the VB is not very big and doesn't use mystery features of the GUI controls, it will probably be much simpler to rewrite the program and do a good job of refactoring the legacy code into something leaner and cleaner.
