I really, really doubt this is a virus. Double-check whether that really is the session ID that starts with that string (which would indeed be reason for some concern). My guess would be this is a kid who discovered how to alter the User Agent string in the browser, and you are seeing the results of that, which is entirely harmless. In regards to the increment problem. First, check the auto_increment_increment setting of your mySQL server. Maybe it was set to 2 for some reason? Second, if it's not that, I would look at all DELETE operations that the comment system runs on the table. Do comments recognized as spam get deleted? Can you log deletions for a while, or switch to soft deletions? Also, try to create some subsequent comments yourself. Does the same phenonmenon occur? What if you add records using mySQL manually? Look through the PHP code inserting a submitted comment making really sure there is nothing that could lead to this behaviour. Try moving the comment system to a different server - preferably a local one, maybe freshly set up - to see whether the behaviour persists there.
