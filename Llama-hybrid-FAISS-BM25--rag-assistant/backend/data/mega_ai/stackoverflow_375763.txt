What's the best website for learning HTML Semantically?

Where should I point someone to learn the basics of HTML/CSS? I personally got my start from HTMLGoodies way back in the day, but while I thank Ken Burns for getting me going, I'm loathed to send someone out to that site nowadays as I think it's dated. Obviously there are many sites out there that cumulatively contain all the information needed, but where to send someone new who you don't want to scare off? edit: I honestly thought I'd been missing something by not having used w3schools.com , but I see that within three pages of the tutorial (both html and xhtml) they use . Damned shame they're not encouraging semantics. Anyone know something that gets people off on the right foot?
