Need help in Image Similarity search engine

I need to build a Jewellery Image Similarity engine. As in if the user shows an image of a Golden earring with blue stones, the similar jewellery images should be fetched from our DB. I have a dataset of about 19k images that are totally unlabeled of different jewellery articles like Earrings, Bracelet, etc. Currently I have categorized them using CLIP model by feeding text like "a photo of earring, bracelet,etc" As of now I use the 512 dimension embeddings provided for these images Then I use Spotify Annoy library to get ANN for the embeddings. Which is giving me a decent result. As you can see the ANN search fetches earring with blue stones but it fetches both silver and golden. I think of training a model like resnet18 after labeling the data in stricter classes like " golden earring with blue stone", " silver earring with blue stone". And then using the embeddings. Also I use the standard option of using angular distance with 10 trees option in Spotify Annoy. Can someone suggest how can I build a better search.
