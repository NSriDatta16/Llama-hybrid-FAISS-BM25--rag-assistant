It's a simple task once you know enough about Objective-C and the Cocoa (Cocoa-Touch on iPhone) frameworks. Rather than just searching the net for examples you would be better off looking for references on how to program Objective-C and Cocoa. The steps are: In Xcode, create a controller class that has a method such as this: - (IBAction)playSound:(id)sender; Create the UI using Interface Builder. Place the buttons you want on this interface and configure their labels. For each of the buttons set a numeric tag (you can do this in interface builder). For each of the buttons set the target to be the controller and the action to be the method you created in step 1. (You do this by ctrl dragging the button onto the controller object in Interface Builder) In the controller class, fill out the method by writing a for loop that checks the tag of of the button (which you can get through the 'sender' object and then play a sound based on the tag. Depending on your level of experience with Cocoa, this might not make sense right now, but if you read through the references and tutorials for Objective-C and Cocoa each of these steps will become clearer and you'll be able to complete this simple task yourself.
