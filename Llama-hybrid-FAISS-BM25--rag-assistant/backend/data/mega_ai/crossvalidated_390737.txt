An alternative, perhaps more principled way, of estimating "local" trends is to use structural models "Ã  la Harvey". These are models which can be cast in state-space form and allow explicit consideration of trend and seasonality among other things. They can be supplemented with fixed effects and be made more elaborate as needed. Software is widely available: in R, function StructTS fits several different structural models, and there are packages for multivariate series as well. Aside from the books by Harvey, Durbin and Koopman(2011), Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods, Oxford Univ Press, is a very nice introduction.
