Does your boss have any reasons for his conviction? Other than "a feeling"? What are his real concerns - you won't have much success in changing his mind until you have worked out what his underlying concerns are. Don't be surprised if they turn out to be substantially different to what he's currently saying. He may have an irrational fear of Danes , for example. Do you have any concrete reasons for disagreeing? As a boss, I wouldn't be too swayed by the reasons you list so far: good design/coding practices don't need a framework, recruitment isn't your concern, performance optimisation? Don't do it ? How more proven than CGI? (He might say, not me: I drink the Rails Kool-aid every day). Is he technical in a current sense? I mean, will he be involved in coding the rewrite? If so, might he be open to a challenge? Pick a subset of features, buildable in a day or two and try it both ways. If he's not technical, why does he think your opinion is less valid than his? If he's concerned from a cost/effort perspective, why does he believe that writing less code (and getting thousands of lines of useful, tested framework code for free) is more costly and/or more effortful than otherwise? Someone else has already mentioned "managing up" - I suggest Googling for resources on ways to work on this. Are there other members of a team involved? How do they feel? Martin Fowler famously (in the Agile world at least) said something like "if your organization is not doing what you think it should, you should change your organization". There are at least two ways to read that...
