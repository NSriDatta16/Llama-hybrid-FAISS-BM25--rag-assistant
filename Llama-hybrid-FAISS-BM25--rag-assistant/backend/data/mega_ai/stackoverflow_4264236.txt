deployment strategies, PHP + SVN

i just wanna discuss our deployment strategy and find discrepancies in it. the process goes like this -> Development finishes for a particular release -> All developers commit their files to trunk -> Compare database schemas using TOAD and migrate the changes -> Create a new branch on SVN -> Export using SVN (to remove .svn folder,etc) -> minify the JS, CSS -> upload to staging server -> perform test cycle -> fix bugs on the branch and verify them -> re-minify the JS, CSS [if required] -> upload to production server -> when i say upload, it means uploading files through SSH to /var/www/html folder -> first upload js, css, images -> then upload php files -> during upload exclude directories like user uploaded pictures, etc. -> perform test cycle -> fix bugs and upload again (may need re-minify - few files) -> verify bugs -> verification completes -> commit branch to svn -> merge changes back to the trunk -> commit trunk [during this deployment cycle, no one commits any files to the trunk] the process is really complicated and requires lots of attention. any suggestions on how we can improve it?
