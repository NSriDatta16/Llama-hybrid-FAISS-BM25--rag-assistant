SELECT certain fields based on certain WHERE conditions

I am writing an advanced MySQL query that searches a database and retrieves user information. What I am wondering is can I select certain fields if WHERE condition 1 is met and select other fields if WHERE condition 2 is met? Database: users ------------------------ | user_id | first_name | ------------------------ | 1 | John | ------------------------ | 2 | Chris | ------------------------ | 3 | Sam | ------------------------ | 4 | Megan | ------------------------ Database: friendship -------------------------------------- | user_id_one | user_id_two | status | -------------------------------------- | 2 | 4 | 0 | -------------------------------------- | 4 | 1 | 1 | -------------------------------------- Status 0 = Unconfirmed Status 1 = Confirmed OK, as you can see John & Megan are confirmed friends while Chris & Megan are friends but the relationship is unconfirmed. The query I am trying to write is as follow: Megan(4) searches for new friends I want all of the users except for the ones she is a confirmed friend with to be returned. So, the results should return 2,3. But since a relationship with user_id 2 exists but is not confirmed, I want to also return the status since an entry in the friendship table does exist between the two. If a user exist but there is no connection in the relationship table it still returns that users information but returns status as a NULL or doesn't return status at all since it doesn't exist in that table. I hope this makes since. Ask questions if you need to.
