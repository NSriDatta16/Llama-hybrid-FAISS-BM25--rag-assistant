welcome to SO! They are simply a notation for conditional probabilities. You often see them in Bayesian statistics. How to interpret it: For instance, your example $p(y|x;\theta)$ means what is the probability that you observe $y$, when $x$ and $\theta$ 'holds'. Usually, $x$ stands for some data and $\theta$ parameters of distribution, or a model. It can be the probability of observing something given the dataset $x$ and estimated linear regression coefficients $\theta = (\beta_0,\beta_1)$. Have a look for instance at Wiki page
