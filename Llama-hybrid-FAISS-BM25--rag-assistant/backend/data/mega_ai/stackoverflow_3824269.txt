Detecting touches for layers within a UIScrollView

I have a UIScrollView which contains any number of thumbnails that should detect the touch event, perform 3D transformation on themselves and call a delegate method. The one problem I am unable to overcome is detecting which sublayer is being tapped. I am setting layer.name to an index count and the subclass of the UIScrollView does get the touch event. Now the last remaining obstacle is how to do a hitTest on the sublayers to get the name property and voila! I was thinking of subclassing a UIView as the container of the CALayer and capturing the touch event that way. But I am hoping there might be a more economical way to determine the sublayer being touched. The code I have been trying (in my UIScrollView subclass): -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ([touches count] == 1) { for (UITouch *touch in touches) { CGPoint point = [touch locationInView:[touch view]]; CALayer *alayer = [self.layer hitTest:point]; if (alayer) NSLog(@"layer %@ touched",alayer.name); else NSLog(@"layer not detected"); } } } I am getting two compile errors. first a warning: no hitTest method found. and an error "request for member 'name' is something not a structure or union".
