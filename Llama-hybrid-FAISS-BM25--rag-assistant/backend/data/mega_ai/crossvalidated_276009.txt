7 point Likert scale interpretation

I conducted a verification survey for my thesis with 7 point likert scale. Only one question was used in the survey and 18 participants responded to my survey. The responses received from 18 participants are: 1- Extremely disagree 1- Mostly disagree 2- Some what disagree 1- Neither agree nor disagree 8- Some what agree 5- Mostly agree 0- Extremely agree I calculated weighted average as: ( (1*1)+(1*2)+(2*3)+(1*4)+(8*5)+(5*6)+(0*7) )/18= (83/18) = 4.611 Can someone please help me with the inference (Like what can be concluded from the result)
