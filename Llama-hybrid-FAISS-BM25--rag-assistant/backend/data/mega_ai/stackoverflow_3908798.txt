In general, DataContext s are not thread safe. But they are designed to be cheap to setup and teardown, and are lightweight. You should think of them as units of work. Accordingly, you should use one for each "conversation" with the database (only you can decide what a "conversation" is). Therefore, I would strongly encourage you to not set the lifecycle of the DataContext to be singleton. Further, if you're using it only to do reads, you should set ObjectTrackingEnabled to be disabled (similar to IStatelessSession in NHibernate).
