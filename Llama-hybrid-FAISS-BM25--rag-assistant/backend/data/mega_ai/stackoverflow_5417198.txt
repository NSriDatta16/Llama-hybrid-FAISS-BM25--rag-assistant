You should compile it with: g++ -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include -L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -fPIC -lboost_system -shared -o libagent.so agent.cpp This makes it look for the boost library in /usr/local/lib at runtime, the -L option only makes it look in /usr/local/lib at compile time.
