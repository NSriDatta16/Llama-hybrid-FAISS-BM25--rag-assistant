Unity does not comes with full source. You can request a source license, but the price is negotiated I believe. See bottom of page - https://store.unity3d.com/shop/ I have used both Unity and Torque and find Unity to be much more accessible. While Torque comes with full source, the design, resources, and overall support is lacking with GarageGames. My advice is to choose Unity3D.
