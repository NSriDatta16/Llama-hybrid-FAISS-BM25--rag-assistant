how to 'marry' two strings in python?

What would be a smart way to mix two strings in python? I need something to insert one string into another one with specified (default=1) intervals: >>> aa = 'abcdefghijkl' >>> bb = mix(aa) >>> bb 'a b c d e f g h i j k l ' >>> cc = mix(bb,'\n',8) >>> print cc a b c d e f g h i j k l Is there an elegant way to write the 'mix' code, which will take 1 mandatory parameter (string to work on) and two optional: separator to insert starting from the second position inside the string (could be longer than one character, default is one space), and length of each slice of the originally passed string to insert the separator at (default is 1 -- meaning after each original symbol from the passed string there will be inserted a string which was the second parameter).
