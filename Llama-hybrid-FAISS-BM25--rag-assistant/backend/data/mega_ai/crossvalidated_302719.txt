You have two time series, i.e. two random variables indexed by time. If they co-exist together, e.g. in form of list entries (time, temperature, torque) , they form together a multivariate time-series . As about "cycles", you can check which of the following definitions fits your data the best: A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week). Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period. Hence, seasonal time series are sometimes called periodic time series. A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period. The duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least 2 years. Think of business cycles which usually last several years, but where the length of the current cycle is unknown beforehand.
