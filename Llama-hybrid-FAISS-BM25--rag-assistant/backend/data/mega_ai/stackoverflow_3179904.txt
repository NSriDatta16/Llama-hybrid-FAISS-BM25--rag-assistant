Using multiple cell style types and custom cells in a UITableView

I'm having problems figuring out how to display different cell styles as well as custom cells together within a UITableView. I understand how to set up and put cells together and the construction of a basic UITableView, but just not how to "mix and match" cell within one. The best example I can show you on what I am trying to achieve is with the Tweetie 2 application. The top of the segment there is a block paragraph, then below it there UITableViewCell's with the UITableViewCellStyleValue2 style set. How exactly would I go about achieving this effect? Thanks ahead of time
