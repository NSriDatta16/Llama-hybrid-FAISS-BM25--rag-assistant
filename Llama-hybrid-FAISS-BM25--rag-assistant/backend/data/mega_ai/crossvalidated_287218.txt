PCA forms linear combinations of the variables that preserve as much of the variance as possible, subject to orthogonality. That is, the first PC preserves as much of the variance as possible. The second preserves as much as possible, given that it is orthogonal (uncorrelated) with the first. The third has to be orthogonal to both of the first two. And so on.
