Unfortunately, outside of Windows Media Player, streaming subtitles is definitely not easy: http://wiki.videolan.org/Subtitles even says so. If you have the source video available to you, I think your best bet would be to have alternative media served to platforms other than Windows/IE. You could code Javascript for the browser detection and then request to proper URL (i.e. Streaming Media/Subtitles for Windows, Streaming Media or Streaming Media with embedded subtitles if subtitles are requested). I did a quick search for embedding subtitles and netted this post. It has some links to tools used to embed subtitles in your media: http://mwolk.com/blog/how-to-embed-subtitles-into-videos/ Good luck!
