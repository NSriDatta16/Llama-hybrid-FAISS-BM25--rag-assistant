is it possible to build an app that runs in 32bit in Leopard but 32/64bit universal in Snow Leopard with XCode?

I need to load flashplayer with webkit. but even the latest 'square' flashplayer doesn't support 64bit in Leopard by default. Unless I use the flashplayer-10.6.plugin instead. since webkit use a pluginAgent in Snow Leopard when running in 64bit mode. it does't matter whether my app is 32bit or 64bit. but unfortunately, the pluginAgent is not available in Leopard. i saw some build conditions on this page . but it seems there's no OS condition available. so, i wonder is there any possibility to make it with build settings? or any other way except building two standalone versions. thanks xx
