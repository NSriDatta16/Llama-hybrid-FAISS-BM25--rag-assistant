time series patterns for categorical variable

I have a large database, containing alarm data from a manufacturing cell. Each entry specifies the name of the alarm, and a matching identifying ID number. The alarm variable can only assume a number of pre-defined values, though that number of values is quite large. I assumes this means that alarm name/alarm ID can be modeled as a categorical variable. Each entry also contains a timestamp. I am somewhat new to statistical and machine learning modeling, but have been looking to answer the following two questions: If there is any pattern in the alarms, that is if there is any correlation between the previous alarm and the next one. As an extension of this, I would also like to know if certain alarms are likely to appear in sequential chains. I would like to know if certain alarms are more likely to appear at certain times of the day or at certain points during the week. Perhaps someone here could help me with how to proceed?
