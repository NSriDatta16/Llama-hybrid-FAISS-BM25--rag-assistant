One possibility is a 2-step model. Find a trend/Cycle/seasonality model for the data ignoring businessdays/weekedays Then perform a time series regression with dummy variables indicating the issues above (business days, holidays, ...). Step 2 can be extended to include more predictors. This model is "easy" and I will test its performance.
