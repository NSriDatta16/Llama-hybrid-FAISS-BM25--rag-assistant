It would be a fragile approach, as the connection is used to detect some parameters used for escaping (encoding, standard-conforming string etc). You can have a "manual mogrify" calling psycopg2.extensions.adapt(x).getquoted() on your parameters and then merging them to the query using the regular Python % operator. Currently released psycopg versions (up to 2.3.2) may fail on None -> NULL conversion though. You can either convert these values manually or register an adapter for None: you can see how in this commit .
