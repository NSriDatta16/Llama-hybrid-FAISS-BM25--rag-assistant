There are many ways of wrapping a database table in a C# class; you probably want to investigate a few alternatives before choosing between the one you've linked to and the Entity Framework. There's a software pattern called the "active record pattern" which describes exactly this approach - one C# class for each table, with load/save methods like Customer.GetById(), Customer.Save(), and so on. For ASP.NET 2.0, check out the Castle Project's ActiveRecord implementation and a third-party Visual Studio plugin tool called ActiveWriter that lets you generate class wrappers for your tables using a drag'n'drop interface.
