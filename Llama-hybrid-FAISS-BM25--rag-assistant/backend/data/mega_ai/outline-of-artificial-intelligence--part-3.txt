Asimo (2000 to present) – humanoid robot developed by Honda, capable of walking, running, negotiating through pedestrian traffic, climbing and descending stairs, recognizing speech commands and the faces of specific individuals, among a growing set of capabilities. MIRAGE – A.I. embodied humanoid in an augmented reality environment. Cog – M.I.T. humanoid robot project under the direction of Rodney Brooks. QRIO – Sony's version of a humanoid robot. TOPIO, TOSY's humanoid robot that can play ping-pong with humans. Watson (2011) – computer developed by IBM that played and won the game show Jeopardy! It is now being used to guide nurses in medical procedures. Purpose: Open domain question answering Technologies employed: Natural language processing Information retrieval Knowledge representation Automated reasoning Machine learning Project Debater (2018) – artificially intelligent computer system, designed to make coherent arguments, developed at IBM's lab in Haifa, Israel. Intelligent personal assistants Intelligent personal assistant – Amazon Alexa – Assistant – Braina – Cortana – Google Assistant – Google Now – Mycroft – Siri – Viv – Other applications Artificial life – simulation of natural life through the means of computers, robotics, or biochemistry. Automatic target recognition – Diagnosis (artificial intelligence) – Speech generating device – Vehicle infrastructure integration – Virtual Intelligence – History History of artificial intelligence Progress in artificial intelligence Timeline of artificial intelligence AI effect – as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, the problem is no longer considered by the public to be a part of AI. This phenomenon has occurred in relation to every AI application produced, so far, throughout the history of development of AI. AI winter – a period of disappointment and funding reductions occurring after a wave of high expectations and funding in AI. Such funding cuts occurred in the 1970s, for instance. Moore's law History by subject History of Logic (formal reasoning is an important precursor of AI) History of machine learning (timeline) History of machine translation (timeline) History of natural language processing History of optical character recognition (timeline) Future Artificial general intelligence. An intelligent machine with the versatility to perform any intellectual task. Superintelligence. A machine with a level of intelligence far beyond human intelligence. Chinese room § Strong AI. A machine that has mind, consciousness and understanding. (Also, the philosophical position that any digital computer can have a mind by running the right program.) Technological singularity. The short period of time when an exponentially self-improving computer is able to increase its capabilities to a superintelligent level. Recursive self improvement (aka seed AI) – speculative ability of strong artificial intelligence to reprogram itself to make itself even more intelligent. The more intelligent it got, the more capable it would be of further improving itself, in successively more rapid iterations, potentially resulting in an intelligence explosion leading to the emergence of a superintelligence. Intelligence explosion – through recursive self-improvement and self-replication, the magnitude of intelligent machinery could achieve superintelligence, surpassing human ability to resist it. Singularitarianism Human enhancement – humans may be enhanced, either by the efforts of AI or by merging with it. Transhumanism – philosophy of human transformation Posthumanism – people may survive, but not be recognizable in comparison to present modern-day humans. Cyborgs – Mind uploading – Existential risk from artificial general intelligence Global catastrophic risk § Artificial intelligence AI takeover – point at which humans are no longer the
