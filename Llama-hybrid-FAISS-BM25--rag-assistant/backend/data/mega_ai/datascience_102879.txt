There is no free lunch among Catboost , XGBoost and LightGBM . In my experience, some cases I found that XGBoost outperform other, some cases for LightGBM , and the rest for CatBoost . So there is no exact the best model until you test them all in your dataset with doing hyper parameters tune to your model. The only think clearly better from both CatBoost and LightGBM compare to XGBoost is only the way they deal with categorical features and faster fitting time.
