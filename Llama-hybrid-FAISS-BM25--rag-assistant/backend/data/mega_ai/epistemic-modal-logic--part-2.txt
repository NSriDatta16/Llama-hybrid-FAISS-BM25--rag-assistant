 \Diamond } is to ◻ {\displaystyle \Box } , has no specific symbol, but can be represented by ¬ K a ¬ φ {\displaystyle \neg K_{a}\neg \varphi } , which can be read as " a {\displaystyle a} does not know that not φ {\displaystyle \varphi } " or "It is consistent with a {\displaystyle a} 's knowledge that φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is possible". The statement " a {\displaystyle a} does not know whether or not φ {\displaystyle \varphi } " can be expressed as ¬ K a φ ∧ ¬ K a ¬ φ {\displaystyle \neg K_{a}\varphi \land \neg K_{a}\neg \varphi } . In order to accommodate notions of common knowledge (e.g. in the Muddy Children Puzzle) and distributed knowledge, three other modal operators can be added to the language. These are E G {\displaystyle {\mathit {E}}_{\mathit {G}}} , which reads "every agent in group G knows" (mutual knowledge); C G {\displaystyle {\mathit {C}}_{\mathit {G}}} , which reads "it is common knowledge to every agent in G"; and D G {\displaystyle {\mathit {D}}_{\mathit {G}}} , which reads "it is distributed knowledge to the whole group G." If φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is a formula of our language, then so are E G φ {\displaystyle {\mathit {E}}_{G}\varphi } , C G φ {\displaystyle {\mathit {C}}_{G}\varphi } , and D G φ {\displaystyle {\mathit {D}}_{G}\varphi } . Just as the subscript after K {\displaystyle {\mathit {K}}} can be omitted when there is only one agent, the subscript after the modal operators E {\displaystyle {\mathit {E}}} , C {\displaystyle {\mathit {C}}} , and D {\displaystyle {\mathit {D}}} can be omitted when the group is the set of all agents. Semantics As mentioned above, the logic-based approach is built upon the possible worlds model, the semantics of which are often given definite form in Kripke structures, also known as Kripke models. A Kripke structure M = ⟨ S , π , K 1 , … , K n ⟩ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}=\langle S,\pi ,{\mathcal {K}}_{1},\dots ,{\mathcal {K}}_{n}\rangle } for n agents over Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } , the set of all primitive propositions, is an ( n + 2 ) {\displaystyle (n+2)} -tuple, where S {\displaystyle S} is a nonempty set of states or possible worlds, π {\displaystyle \pi } is an interpretation, which associates with each state s ∈ S {\displaystyle s\in S} a truth assignment to the primitive propositions in Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } , and K 1 , . . . , K n {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}_{1},...,{\mathcal {K}}_{n}} are binary relations on S {\displaystyle S} for n numbers of agents. It is important here not to confuse K i {\displaystyle K_{i}} , our modal operator, and K i {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}_{i}} , our accessibility relation. The truth assignment tells us whether or not a proposition p {\displaystyle p} is true or false in a certain state. So π ( s ) ( p ) {\displaystyle \pi (s)(p)} tells us whether p {\displaystyle p} is true in state s {\displaystyle s} in model M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}} . Truth depends not only on the structure, but on the current world as well. Just because something is true in one world does not mean it is true in another. To state that a formula φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is true at a certain world, one writes ( M , s ) ⊨ φ {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},s)\models \varphi } , normally read as " φ {\displaystyle \varphi } is true at ( M , s ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},s)} ," or " ( M , s ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},s)} satisfies φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ". It is useful to think of our binary relation K i {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}_{i}} as a possibility relation, because it is meant to capture what worlds or states agent i considers to be possible; In other words, w K i v {\displaystyle w{\mathcal {K}}_{i}v} if and only if ∀ φ [ ( w ⊨ K i φ ) ⟹ ( v ⊨ φ ) ] {\displaystyle \forall \varphi [(w\models K_{i}\varphi )\implies (v\models \varphi )]} , and such v {\displaystyle v} 's are called epistemic alternatives for agent i. In idealized accounts of knowledge (e.g., describing the epistemic status of perfect reasoners wi
