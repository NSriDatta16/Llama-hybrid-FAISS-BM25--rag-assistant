You give very little information regarding the time series (does it have seasonality for example?). In my opinion, the correct way to assess the impact of the regulation change in your series is to include a dummy variable and remove the date. You can also test for structural breaks in the time series. I believe the CUMSUM test is the most widely used in this case.
