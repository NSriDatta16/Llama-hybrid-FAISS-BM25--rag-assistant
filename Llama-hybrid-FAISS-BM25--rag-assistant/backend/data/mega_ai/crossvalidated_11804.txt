A simple solution is to incorporate the hometown advantage (that is if your data holds this info). This makes it possible to give a definite meaning to your outcome. So if you have that data, it'll likely be a better model and solves your problem: go there! Right now, your outcome's definition depend on the order, but your data doesn't. A possible solution (though I haven't checked this completely) would be to duplicate every record in your data, but change the order and the outcome (so for every observation, both representations are in your dataset), and then do a weighted logistic regression, giving every observation a weight of 1/2 (I think this correctly adjusts your variances, but I'd have to check) Another option is to change your outcome so it is not dependent on the order anymore (i.e.: the alphabetically former team wins or not), or to always code your two teams in a steady order (i.e. make that the alphabetically former team is always in column 1). These things are bound to be a bit harder to interpret, though...
