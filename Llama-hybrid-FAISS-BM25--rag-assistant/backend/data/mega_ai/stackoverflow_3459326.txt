I will answer this assuming that what you are doing is legal and going to add value to the data that is readily available. If that is the case, you can contact the sites in question and speak to them to confirm you screen scraping won't get blocked as a DoS attack. You can give them your IP addresses, etc. and everything will be fine. There are many ways to make sure your process won't time out / use too much information. That just comes down to the design of your system. If the content of your site won't be original, please try to make the solution your own at least :) However if you run into specific issues during your implementation I'm sure you could get answers for focused questions. Edit for clarification My answer to your question is 1) Check with the sites you wish to scrape. If they have no problems they will not block your IP address - you can arrange a way to make sure this does not happen with them. Either use a static IP address. Or if the IP address you use may change, then agree a particular user agent string. 2) Once you've done (1) then start developing a solution. Execution time, etc. shouldn't be a problem, so if you encounter particular issues with your solution as you are coding it, then come back to stack overflow with a question focused on that one issue. To be clear, if you can not or will not contact the sites you wish to scrape please tell us all now.
