I notice you are using the Excel ODBC driver. Have you tried the JET OLEDB Provider with the equivalent connection string? select * from openrowset( 'Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0', 'Data Source=C:\ImportFile.xls;Extended Properties="Excel 8.0;HDR=Yes;IMEX=1"', 'SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$]') EDIT: Sorry, just noticed your last paragraph. Surely the Excel ODBC driver still goes via the JET engine, so what difference would it make? EDIT: I have looked at the KB194124 link, and the registry values it recommends are the default values on my machine, which I have never changed. I have used the above method several times myself without problems. Maybe it's an environmental issue?
