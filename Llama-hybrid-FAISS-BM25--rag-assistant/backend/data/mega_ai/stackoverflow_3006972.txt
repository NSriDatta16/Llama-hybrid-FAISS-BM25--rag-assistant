Order of declaration in an anonymous pl/sql block

I have an anonymous pl/sql block with a procedure declared inside of it as well as a cursor. If I declare the procedure before the cursor it fails. Is there a requirement that cursors be declared prior to procedures? What other rules are there for order of declaration in a pl/sql block? This works: DECLARE cursor cur is select 1 from dual; procedure foo as begin null; end foo; BEGIN null; END; This fails with error PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol "CURSOR" when expecting one of the following: begin function package pragma procedure form DECLARE procedure foo as begin null; end foo; cursor cur is select 1 from dual; BEGIN null; END;
