To piggy-back off of @ Impul3H , I recommend checking out Orange Data Mining Tool . In case you are unfamiliar with Python and think that you'd experience a steep learning curve with scikit learn, then the drag and drop interface from Orange would be a good tool for you. Outside of clustering, I would think that a Naive Bayes classifier may be useful for you; if your data is in categorical form. This would be a supervised learning classification model, and is often one of the first and more easy to implement models on data in this format.
