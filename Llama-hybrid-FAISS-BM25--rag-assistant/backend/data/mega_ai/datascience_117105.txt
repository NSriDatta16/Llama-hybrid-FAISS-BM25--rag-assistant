How to isolate a clear relationship from a subset of data with lots of noise and outliers

I am doing an analysis of aircraft data and I want to see how much fuel is burnt on landing. There are 2 main factors aircraft type and landing time (ie. time elapsed) However there is a cheeky third option which is whether or not the pilot used the engines to brake or just the wheel breaks. Simple plot looks like this As you can see there is a very strong straight line on the left between time and fuel plus there are a bunch of points on the right where we can infer that the engine braking has been used. What I need to do is separate the two events so that for future measurements can say it was an engine break or a wheel break. I've tried k-means clustering but I just get an arbitrary line at about the 40 mark. Is there a way to isolate the strong linear relationship so I can then set a rule that would predict if the engine brake was used or not? Obviously, I can hardcode from the charts, but was interested to know if there was a more elegant way. thanks
