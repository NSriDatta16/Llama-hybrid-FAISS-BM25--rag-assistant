There are several questions here at very different levels. In essence every text on cluster analysis is an answer. You have to keep reading! Variance is at one level just one statistical standard which statistical people find convenient to think about. Roughly, minimising variance encourages -- nay, enforces -- clusters as relatively tight balls. What can be a limitation in much of statistics, the sensitivity of means and variances to squared deviations, can be a virtue in cluster analysis in so far as clusters are tight and compact. But yes, there are many, many other ways of finding clusters, some but not all of which can be posed as minimising or maximising an objective function. For every enthusiastic account of cluster analysis you read, you should try to impute an opposite statistical view, namely that cluster analysis is a vaguely posed problem to which there can be no well-defined answer, and that it is oversold to the desperate and the clueless as a way of finding structure which may or may not exist. (The meta-assumption that data must clump, somehow, cannot be well tested by any method whose very purpose is to identify clusters.) There have been attempts to show that one method of cluster analysis is "the right way", but it's my impression that people never get past arguing about the first principles. If you can give a precise definition of what you desire about a clustering, someone expert can guide you on methods to achieve that.
