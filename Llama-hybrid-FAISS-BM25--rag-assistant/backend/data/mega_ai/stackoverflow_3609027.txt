There are only two major areas in your code which need to be addressed properly to avoid xss issues. before using any user input value in queries, use the database helper functions like mysql_escape_string over the data and then use it in query. It will gurantee xss safety. before displaying user input values back into form input fields, pass them through htmlspecialchars or htmlentities. This will convert all xss prone values into characters that the browser can display without being compromised. Once you have done the above, you are more than 95% safe from xss attacks. Then you can go on and learn advanced techniques from security websites and apply additional security on your site. What most frameworks do is that they discourage you to directly write html form code or do queries in string form, so that using the framework helper functions your code remains clean, while any serious problem can be addressed quickly by just updating one or two lines of code in the framework. You can simply write a little library of your own with common functions and reuse them in all your projects.
