First thing I would check is the association OrganizerDBEntities.Assignments in your EF conceptual model. Does it allow for 0:n relations? From the error message, I am lead to believe it doesn't. You can tweak the cardinality (the min and max possible values) in your EF model. If you select an association between two entities in your EDMX designer surface, the properties window shows both ends of the association. In each of those "End" properties, there's a "Multiplicity" values which defines the cardinality of the association: 0:* , 0..1:* , 1:* and so forth. If you do want to allow a missing value, the multiplicity on the child end of your association needs to be 0..1 (Zero or One) - is it really 0..1 (Zero or One) ? Or is it set to 1 instead?
