An urn contains n unique marbles. I draw k of them with replacement, and get r duplicates (r>0). What is the MLE for n?

What is the MLE for n which is the total number of marbles in the urn? What is the expected value of n? And what if r = 0 (no duplicates were drawn)? Can anything be said about n? A duplicate means that that marble was seen before at least once. The r duplicates could all be the same marble or they could be different ones. It doesn't matter. The r=0 case seems paradoxical to me because one would think that if n2 > n1, then P(r=0 | n2, k)>P(r=0 | n1, k). The more marbles in the urn the more likely you are to not get any duplicates after k draws. However, this means that the pmf defined by f(n) = P(r=0 | n, k) (as a function of n basically) cannot exist because it could never add up to 1. No matter how you assign the probabilities, it seems that since n ranges from let's say 1 to inf, and f(n) is monotonically increasing, it cannot be a pmf. Motivation for question: I was working on a machine learning problem where the solution space was so vast, that I could only sample from the solution space. Enumerating all the possible solutions and trying them one by one would have been too impractical. I noticed that after generating 1500 "candidate solutions", I did not get any duplicates (though my code was not checking for duplicates), so I wondered if there was anything I could say about the size of the solution space based on this. This led me to the statement of the abstract problem above. Generating a "candidate solution" is analogous to drawing from an urn.
