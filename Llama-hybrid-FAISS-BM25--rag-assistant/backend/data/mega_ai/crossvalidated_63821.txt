Why do structure learning for Bayesian networks?

Given a very-large data set, if our goal is to do probabilistic inference, what are the main advantages of learning a Bayesian network from data and then, use the Bayesian network to compute conditional probabilities? I see that we could also approximate these probabilities directly from the data set by counting. Further, if the data set is large enough, one could also try to use the CLT/WLLN to compute some confidence intervals. Why would it be better to construct a Bayesian network (hard optimization problem) and do inference (message passing algorithms)? Some kind of over-fitting argument? Thanks!
