You are trying to search a string which contains the literal bakslash character \ . Double quotes interpolate. Use single quotes instead. use warnings; use strict; my $userInfo = 'firstname\middlename\lastname.'; if ($userInfo =~ m/\\/){ print("Found it"); } else{ print("No match found"); } The warnings pragma would have generated a warning message.
