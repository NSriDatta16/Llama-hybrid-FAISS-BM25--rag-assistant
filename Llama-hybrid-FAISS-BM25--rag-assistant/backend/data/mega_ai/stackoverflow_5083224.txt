git pull while not in a git directory

Let's say I have a directory, /X/Y , which is a git repository. Is it possible to somehow call a command like git pull from inside /X , but targeting the /X/Y directory? EDIT: I guess I was wondering specifically: is it possible to do this using the a git command, but without having to change directories? NOTE: I've accepted VonC's answer as it's much more elegant than previous options. For people running Git older than 1.8.5, please see bstpierre's answer below .
