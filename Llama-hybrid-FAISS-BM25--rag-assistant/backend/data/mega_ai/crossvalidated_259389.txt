QMLE with normal distribution for GARCH - consistent & asymptoticaly normal? (R, fGarch)

In the section Details of the documentation of the garchFit function we find the following statemement: "QMLE stands for Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which assumes normal distribution and uses robust standard errors for inference." But in financial returns modeling we all know that the innovations present fat tails. So, do the GARCH estimation with the garchFit function fail if we assume QMLE as conditional distribution? In the documentation we find then the following statement: "Bollerslev and Wooldridge (1992) proved that if the mean and the volatility equations are correctly specified, the QML estimates are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed." So, if we estimate the GARCH model of a financial time series with the QMLE method, have we a non-efficient BUT consistent and unbiased estimation?
