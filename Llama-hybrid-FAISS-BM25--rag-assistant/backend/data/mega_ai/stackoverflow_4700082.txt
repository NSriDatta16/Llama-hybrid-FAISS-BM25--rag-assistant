vector will hold all of it's storage in a single place. A vector is not even remotely like a linked list. Infact, if I had to pick two data structures that were most unlike each other, it would be vector and list . "At most contiguous" is how a deque operates. Vector: Guaranteed contiguous storage for all elements - will copy or move elements. O(1) access time. O(n) for insert or remove. Iterators invalidated upon insertion or removal of any element. List: No contiguous storage at all - never copies or moves elements. O(n) access time- plus all the nasty cache misses you're gonna get. O(1) insert or remove. Iterators valid as long as that specific element is not removed. As you can see, they behave differently in every data structure use case.
