Small sample, many observations. Is the sample large enough?

I am working on a project regarding the influence of temperature and other variables on the sales of 3 branches of one local bakery. The research goal is to be able to better predict bakery sales (in my city) and to save food in this way. What data do I have? I do have the data of all variables for more than 3 years (>1000 days) and I don't want to know anything about the difference in sales between the different branches but get an average of all 3 branches normalized sales data. What's the question? The goal is to get evidence for the whole population of the bakeries in my city (so far by mainly using multiple linear regression). But since the sample size is not big enough (there are at least 100 branches of bakeries from all bakery companies) and the data is from just 3 branches of one of many companies it's at best a convenience sample for this population. So I was wondering if I can call it a representative sample for all bakeries of the company providing the data (they have 30 branches--out of the 100 in the city--and it's a random sample)? If not so how would you call the sample for the population of all bakeries and the population of the companies bakeries?
