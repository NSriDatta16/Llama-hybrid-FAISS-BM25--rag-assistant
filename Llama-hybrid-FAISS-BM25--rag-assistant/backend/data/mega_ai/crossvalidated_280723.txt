How to determine distribution from Sleep data min/max/mean values in R?

I want to determine the distribution from the EMFIT QS sleep data which gives only min , max and mean values for sleep clasess in R, in order to estimate quartiles. Types of sleep waves in the signal in Fig. 1. I know the thread answer Finding Quartiles in R . Fig. 1 types of possible sleep waves (source Guyton Physiology). Summary of the descriptive statistics given by the manufacturer given for one measurement session lasting 5-14 hours dat.m dat.m Vars Sleep Awake 1 Average 7 12 2 Min 4 5 3 Max 10 15 Current method to estimate the quartiles is manual #https://stackoverflow.com/a/44043313/54964 quartiles OS: Debian 8.7 R: 3.4.0 (backports) Related therad: Why this CSV data complicates with ggplot2 whisker plot?
