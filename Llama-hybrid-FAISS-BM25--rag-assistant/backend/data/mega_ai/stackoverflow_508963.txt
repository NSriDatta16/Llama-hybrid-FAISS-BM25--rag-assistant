I was evaluating its use for offline document storage for a documentation review application that I was working on at a previous company. We did descide to use it but the company got bought out and the projects went off into the void. But currently I know google just started using google gears for gmail. And I will add that I don't think it is a bad move, but I would be concerned about the overall penetration, would you be able to force users to have it installed?
