Read The Elements of Statistical Learning , it is a great compendium on data mining. You can be interested especially in unsupervised algorithms, for example clustering. Assuming that most people do not lie, the biggest cluster is right and the rest is wrong. Mark people accordingly, then apply some bayesian statistics and you'll be done. Of course, most data mining technologies are pretty experimentative, so don't count on that they will be always right... or even in most cases.
