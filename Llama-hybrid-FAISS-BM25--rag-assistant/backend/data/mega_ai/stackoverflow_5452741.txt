One way is to check the user agent, and you can access this via $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] if(preg_match('/MSIE/i',$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) { // Internet Explorer! // header("Location: noie.php"); // exit(); } However this isn't always reliable, so another way is to check to see if your features are available via javascript, such as: if(window.localStorage){ // you can use local storage } else { // you can't } If this seems like a pain(and it is), I'd highly suggest checking out Modernizer to help your feature detection.
