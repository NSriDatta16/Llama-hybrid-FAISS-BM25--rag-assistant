A quick Google search led me to this article: Estimating the Correlation in Bivariate Normal Data With Known Variances and Small Sample Sizes . In this article, they discussed several possible priors: "uniform", "Jeffreys", and "arc-sine". Specifically, take the "uniform" prior for example, it assumes that $\rho$ follows a uniform distribution on $[-1,1]$. This leads to a density of the form: $$ f(\rho | X, Y) \propto \prod\limits_i{P(x_i, y_i | \rho)} $$ If a full Bayesian estimator is desired, then equation $\hat{\rho}^{(6)}$ on page 35 of that article needs to be computed. This can be done using a Monte Carlo integration. Or, if one only needs the MAP estimate of $\rho$, it can be done using Gibbs sampling. I followed one citation of the first article : (Barnard 2000) Modeling Covariance Matrices in terms of Standard Deviations and Correlations, with Application to Shrinkage . In this citation, it is discussed in detail how a uniform prior for $\rho$ is derived out of the Inverse-Wishart distribution for the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and how Gibbs sampling was carried out. (Equation (8)). I also tried searching for other references, but was unable to find possible conjugate priors for $\rho$ and approaches to get the Bayesian estimation of $\rho$ without doing numerical integration or sampling. It is an interesting problem to look at by the way.
