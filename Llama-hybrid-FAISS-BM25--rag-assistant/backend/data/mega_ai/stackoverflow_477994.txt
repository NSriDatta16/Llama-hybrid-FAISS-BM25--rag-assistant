How would I make a draggable Menubar icon for Mac OS X

I am in the process of writing a menubar icon for an app i'm developing. However the NSStatusBar class does not have a method which would make the icon draggable, via cmd+left mouse drag. How do you make your menubar icon draggable with Objective-C code? Thank you :)
