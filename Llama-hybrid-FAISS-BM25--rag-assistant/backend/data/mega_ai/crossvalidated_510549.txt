In Bayesian optimization (BO), one chooses the next sampling point by maximizing the acquisition function $a(x)$ , i.e. \begin{equation} x^* = \arg\max_{x\in\mathcal{X}} a(x). \end{equation} This acquisition function is the key to the balance between exploration and exploitation. There are so many acquisition functions out there but I will list the most common three: the probability of improvement (PI), expected improvement (EI), and upper-confidence bound (UCB). Assuming that you want to solve a maximization problem, let's take UCB acquisition function because it is easy to type: $a(x) = \mu(x) + \kappa \sigma(x)$ . Let's also assume $\kappa$ is a constant for now, e.g. $\kappa = 2$ . Comparing two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ : if their means are the same, then BO will pick the one that has larger $\sigma^2(x)$ . This is called exploration . Comparing two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ : if their variances are the same, then BO will pick the one that has larger $\mu(x)$ . This is called exploitation .
