I would discourage from /FI ( MSDN says it's called /FI . Not sure whether i looked at the right page though), simply because people or yourself reading the files don't notice a header is magically included anyway. You can be sure this will cause much debugging time for someone that wants to figure out where specific macros come from, even though there are no #include lines at the top of the file.
