Imputation (ie 'provided' by moving average') is valid if values are missing at random. If it is an uninterruted period of considerable length, this becomes unlikely. The second part of the question is unclear. Depending on the question, it is considered anything from suboptimal to invalid to use your model for forecasting beyond the scope of your data: eg what if the relationship between the two indices changes in 2012-2014? You could use regression-estimated values (but not directly replacing by the raw values of another index) for the missing datapoints, but this would make sense only if there is a strong relationship between the two indices, and it is critical that these values are clearly marked as estimates. And what do you mean by "corrected the model from all problems"?
