I am using 1D CNNs for EEG/EMG classification as well. One thing that seems to help for me is playing around with the number of filters, and yours seem quite low. I have used up to 80 filters on a layer, at times with good results. Also you may want to reverse how you are doing things and add more filters at the beginning and reduce with each successive layer.
