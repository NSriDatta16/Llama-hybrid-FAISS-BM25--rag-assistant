I wouldn't go out of my way to try and run through a plagiarism checker. Code is code and bad code is bad code. People who can't code (those who are more likely to copy/paste code**) generally don't have good code. Difficulties (and questionable approaches around them) will be easily detectable if you even take a few seconds to check the source. Something just won't match up and it should smack you in the face. **I would argue that adapted code isn't plagiarized unless it violates the authors distribution intent (e.g. violates copyright or license) and would encourage the students to simply document which existing resources, if any, they used as a base and/or incorporated as well as to encourage them to understand and adapt the code to fit their needs (and to make it better, so much code out there is soup). I do this all the time for "real programming work". Of course, it's not my curriculum :-)
