bold and italic tag xml issue in flash with character embedding

I am uploading text in flash as2 from xml and I need to do some text in bold, italic, underline and anchor. Text are visible fine and underline and anchor tags are working fine, but bold and italic tags are not working. If I select character embedding to all then bold and italic tags are not working. If I select do not embed option then it's working fine. But, I have to use character embedding because I have to use text in all languages.
