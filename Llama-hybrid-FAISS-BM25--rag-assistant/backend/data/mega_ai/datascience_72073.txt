Classification/Regression of Dataset taken at different time

I have a dataset with some gait parameters (step length, stride length etc) of 100 people taken 3 times at different time(in every 6 months). Now I have to train my model on this dataset and predict if the person has a disease or not for any new person data that is given. How can I take all this 3 data of parameters in my model for training considering time factor. I checked time series forecasting but it looks like for that the dataset should be dependent on continuous time instances.
