Is it preferred/okay to use structure-initialization ({...}) over memset, etc.?

Code: WINDOWPLACEMENT wplcmt = {sizeof(WINDOWPLACEMENT)}; Looks so much cleaner than: WINDOWPLACEMENT wplcmt; memset(&wplcmt, 0, sizeof(WINDOWPLACEMENT)); wplcmt.length = sizeof(WINDOWPLACEMENT); The assembly output of this thing is also pretty nice, for longer structures MSVC even uses memset instead of xor eax, eax and mov 's. And from standard point of view it also looks ok. But I'm still scared about border cases where the structure is not tightly packed say #pragma pack(128) , and windows suddenly decides to do a memcmp of the structure. So is it good/bad to use such syntax? Is it good practice to use such initializations?
