Methods declared in interfaces are by default both public and abstract. Yet, one could: public interface myInterface{ public abstract void myMethod(); } However, usage of these modifiers is discouraged. So is the abstract modifier applied to the interface declaration. Particularly, regarding your question: "For compatibility with older versions of the Java platform, it is permitted but discouraged, as a matter of style, to redundantly specify the abstract modifier for methods declared in interfaces." source: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/interfaces.doc.html Section 9.4: Abstract method declarations.
