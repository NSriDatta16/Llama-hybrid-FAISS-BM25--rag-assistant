A baseball player's batting average is 0.32 We want to randomly simulate 100 times at bat and find out how many times our player actually hits the ball in this simulation. We want to do this in constant time, meaning do one calculation and not one after the other. If the at-bats are independent trials and the probability at each bat is constant at 0.32, then the number of hits in 100 trials is binomial(100,0.32) Many packages provide both random generation from a binomial and the cdf and inverse cdf. For example, R has all of these. (If you have the incomplete beta function, you can also use the relationship between the beta and the binomial to get tail areas.) If you need to simulate binomial random variates yourself, you can compute the table for the pmf, and use something like a table method (which is very fast) or squaring the histogram; alternatively you could use a suitable multiple of a Gaussian majorizing function, rounded to integer with accept-reject, which would be quite reasonable - e.g. using a normal with a mean of 32 and a variance of 24, the scale factor needed is only 1.057004.
