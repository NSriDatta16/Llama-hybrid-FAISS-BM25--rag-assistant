Recall that the Logistic regression model is a non linear transformation of $\beta^Tx$ Probability of $(Y = 1)$: $p = \frac{e^{\alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2 x_2}}{1 + e^{ \alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2 x_2}}$ Odds of $(Y = 1)$: $ \left( \frac{p}{1-p}\right) = e^{\alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2 x_2}$ Log Odds of $(Y = 1)$: $ \log \left( \frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$ So to answer your question, Logistic regression is indeed non linear in terms of Odds and Probability , however it is linear in terms of Log Odds . A simple example Fitting a logistic regression model on the following toy example gives the coefficients $\alpha = -5.05$ and $\beta = 1.3$ Plotting the probability $P(Y=1)$ as a function of $X$ clearly shows the non linear relationship The Odds of $Y$ being 1 given $X$ is also non linear Finally the log odds of $Y$ being 1 is a linear relationship See here for some more details: Calculating confidence intervals for a logistic regression
