If example.mysite.com/receiveImage.php is your own service, then you may pass SOURCE URL to your PHP script as GET or POST parameter in PHP script, use file_get_contents() function to obtain image by URL, and save it to your storage Otherwise it's impossible by means of HTTP. However, there are some ways to increase files uploading speed a little: If files are huge, you may use two threads: one for downloading (it will store all downloaded data to some buffer) and one for uploading (it will get all available data from buffer and upload it to site). As far as I know, this can't be done easily with PHP, because multi-threading is currently not supported yet. If there are too many files, you may use many threads / processes, which will do download/upload simultaneously. By the way, these means do not eliminate double traffic for your intermediate service.
