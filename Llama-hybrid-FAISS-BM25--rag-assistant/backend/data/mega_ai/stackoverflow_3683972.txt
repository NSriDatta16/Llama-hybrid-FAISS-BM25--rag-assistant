What is the average capacity of a postfix mail server?

I appreciate there is no 'set' answer to this question. I am trying to assess the performance of our dedicated mail server for sending out emails. The server is of the spec below: 2G RAM CPU Xeon 2.80GHz (x2) Currently we're only managing to send out approximately 21,000 emails per hour from this. Which I suspect is massively under-performing. Are there any guidelines as to what capacity can be expected?
