OpenMP: What is the benefit of nesting parallelizations?

From what I understand, #pragma omp parallel and its variations basically execute the following block in a number of concurrent threads, which corresponds to the number of CPUs. When having nested parallelizations - parallel for within parallel for, parallel function within parallel function etc. - what happens on the inner parallelization? I'm new to OpenMP, and the case I have in mind is probably rather trivial - multiplying a vector with a matrix. This is done in two nested for loops. Assuming the number of CPUs is smaller than the number of elements in the vector, is there any benefit in trying to run the inner loop in parallel? Will the total number of threads be larger than the number of CPUs, or will the inner loop be executed sequentially?
