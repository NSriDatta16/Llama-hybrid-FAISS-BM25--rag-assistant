No one has mentioned Orange before: Data mining through visual programming or Python scripting. Components for machine learning. Add-ons for bioinformatics and text mining. Packed with features for data analytics. I don't use it on daily basis, but it's a must-see for anyone who prefers GUI over command line interface. Even if you prefer the latter, Orange is a good thing to be familiar with, since you can easily import pieces of Orange to your Python scripts in case you need some of its functionality.
