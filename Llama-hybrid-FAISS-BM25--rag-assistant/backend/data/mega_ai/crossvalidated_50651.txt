Having had a look at the question you have linked to it appears you need the number of employees the firm has so you can estimate the absenteeism rate. For these purposes I would think the number of staff days divided by the number of days in the month would be the best figure. Effectively, it gives you the average number of employees on any day in that month, and this would seem the appropriate indicator of the average potential absenteeism in that period.
