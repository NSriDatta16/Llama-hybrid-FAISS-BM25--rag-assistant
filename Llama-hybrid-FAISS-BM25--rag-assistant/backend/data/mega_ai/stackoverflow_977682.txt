Flex TileGrid: Why do you default to copying when I drag and drop your items?

Why is it that, when I enable dragging-and-dropping in a TitleGrid, items are copied when they are dragged instead of moved? For example: When either of those items is clicked-and-dragged, it will get copied instead of moved. This is especially confusing because TileList is a decedent of ListBase, which DataGrid also descends from... But DataGrid does the right thing when dragging and dropping items.
