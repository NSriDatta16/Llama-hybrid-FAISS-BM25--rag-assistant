You could easily use blockproc for this: http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/images/ref/blockproc.html But if that isn't working for you, what errors do you get? If you want to do it manually (like extracting the value of the center pixel of each block) you could simply use two loops for this.. but be aware, this is rather an unelegant and not really fast way to do it... image = imread('image.png'); s = size(image); for i=2:3:s(1)-1 for j=2:3:s(2)-1 %% here you have the midpoint of each 3x3 block... %% you could then easily crop the image around it if you %% really need separated blocks... end end This isn't a really fast way though... but it works... Hope that helps...
