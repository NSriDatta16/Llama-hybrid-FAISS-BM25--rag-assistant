Variable importance for SVM regression and averaged neural networks

Is there any way to calculate variable importance in R for SVM regression and averaged neural networks? I've been using caret package, that has varImp function in it > m varImp(m) Error in UseMethod("varImp") : no applicable method for 'varImp' applied to an object of class "svm" According to the developer , this approach wasn't realized for SVM method However, rminer package suggests such function as Importance . Though, it throws an error: VariableImportance = Importance(svmFit, data=descr[rownames(tr[[i]]), 2:ncol(descr)], method="1D-SA") Error in Importance(svmFit, data = descr[rownames(tr[[i]]), 2:ncol(descr)], : duplicate 'switch' defaults: 'lm == func...' and 'NULL'
