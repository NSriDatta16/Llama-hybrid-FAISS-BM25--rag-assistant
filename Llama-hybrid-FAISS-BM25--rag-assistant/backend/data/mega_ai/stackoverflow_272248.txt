There is something new around: http://www.sideralis.org/baobab/ Old and outdated answer. The library is not supported anymore. I used the nstrees library "buggzzy" posted ( http://www.edutech.ch/contribution/nstrees/index.php ) for a project where I had to give the user the possibility to create and edit the organisational chart of his company. I like the " Modified Preorder Tree Traversal " algorithm very much but it seems to me that the nstree library is slow. In my case I have to iterate recursively down the tree. Maybe it's something else in my script which is slow. Anyways I'm also still looking for an alternative and I recently checked the PEAR website and found a tree library there too: http://pear.php.net/package/Tree The PEAR library didn't seem as comprehensive as NSTREE but I assume it could be more performant. An article which helped me a lot with this question: Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database
