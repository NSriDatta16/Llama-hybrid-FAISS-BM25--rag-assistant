General methods to deal with time series data

Sorry I'm new to machine learning and statistics. For time series predictions, do you use RNN or something? For example, the past 2 years' sales of a product. TBH Im pretty much unfamiliar with how statisticians deal with time series data. I'm dealing with some time series problems and I'm not sure if I should put all my trust on RNN or some other DL models. Sorry I'm unable to provide the specific data here, don't know if it will cause vagueness. But the sales data is definitely a topic of interest.
