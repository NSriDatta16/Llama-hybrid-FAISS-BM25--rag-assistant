I would rather not suggest this course of action since, all chains starting from the very same point, $X^{(2000)}$ say, these chains need run long enough to cancel the dependence on that starting point and recover simulations from the target. For instance, if one removes some burnin part (20%? 50%?) from all 10 parallel chains, this would come closer to a set of 10 independent MCMC samples run under the stationary distribution. But the pooled outcome of the ten chains cannot be deemed as an iid sample for (a) the intra-chain dependence and (b) the possible omission of one part of the target by all chains (in case of non-geometric convergence). starting at iteration one with 10 parallel chains and a highly dispersed stating distribution would provide more realisations and henceopen the possibility of subsampling with wider gaps towards a better approximation of iid sampling.
