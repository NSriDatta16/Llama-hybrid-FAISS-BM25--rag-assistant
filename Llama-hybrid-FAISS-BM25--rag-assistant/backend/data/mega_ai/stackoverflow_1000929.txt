Refactoring Really Seems to Have Vanished from my Xcode

I've read the similar (ok, almost identical) thread here as well as on the Apple iPhone Dev forums. I've looked carefullly at the referenced links. I have tried everything but nothing I do has brought refactoring back to life in XCode. Sigh. I took a working, 100% Cocoa Touch project (ie, Pragmatic Programmers - Coding in Objective-C 2.0 - Movie Player) and tried to select and refactor an ivar. Nothing. Nada. This is very odd, since about a month ago it was working. In fact, on a project that mixed C++ with Obj-C. Should I resort to reinstalling XCode? Seems a bit like overkill, no? Anyway, very frustrating. Any guidance would be most appreciated. Cheers, Doug
