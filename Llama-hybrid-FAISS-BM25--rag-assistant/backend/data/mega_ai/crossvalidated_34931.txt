I will supply some cautious answers and some further suggestions. For question 1 I would probably use a binomial model instead of a Poisson model. This is under an assumption tha a patient gets a DDD on a certain day or not, so that the the outcome variable is betweeen 0 and 100. But I would urge a lot of caution here. One problem is that daily medication is not independent on a day level at all. I would really look carefully at the distribution here and go from there. Try to think carefully about interdependence of your data and the underlying processes. Look at the data. Plot the data. I would also use a hierachical model to properly model the differences on the hospital model and the differences on the patient level. Generally a good reading suggestion for this would Data Analysis using Regression and Multilevel/Hierachical Models from Gelman & Hill. Your approach to question 2 seems workable. You could improve it a lot if you know over what amount of data each hospital has aggregated and model this in a bayesian hierachical model. The additional amount of learning required might not be practicable to you. Section 5.5. of Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd Edition) from Gelman et al would be a good ressource for this.
