The performance of any model is data-dependent, so the exact empirical performance is unknown until the model is trained. In general, for regression tasks, neural networks may perform slightly better because of the rigidity of tree models compared to neural networks. I think depending on how much computational power you have available, most of the models are quite lightweight, so I would try all of them; all of the models are used in different contexts.
