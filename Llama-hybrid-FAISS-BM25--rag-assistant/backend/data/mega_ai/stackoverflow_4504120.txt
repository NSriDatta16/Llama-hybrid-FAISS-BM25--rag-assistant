You can require files in PHP just as you could without Magento, so you can actually use require_once if need be. If you want to keep your code cleaner, you may want to put it into the /lib folder in Magento since it is a system library. I am not sure if this is in the default include path, so you may have to fiddle with the require. For cleanliness, you may also want to make a wrapper around this code and use Magento models/helpers to manipulate them. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
