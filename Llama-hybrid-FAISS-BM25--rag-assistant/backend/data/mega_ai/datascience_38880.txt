Use cross validation. It's where you split the data in K subsets, and train and test K times on all of the data using a different subset of the data for validation each time. The average cross validation score is generally a better estimate of the model's performance on unseen data than the standard 80/10/10 splitting that you'd use when training, validating, and testing your final model. Many machine learning libraries, such as Python's scikit-learn, have a module for this.
