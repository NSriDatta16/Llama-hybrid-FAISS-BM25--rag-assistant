TODO/FIXME plugin for Eclipse

In my project there are large no. of FIXME / TODO which are to addressed at some point of time. Actually there about 480 which can be seen from 'TASKS' list but not organised. I googled and found the Task Tag Decorator plugin. But unfortunately this is not working. Can anyone suggest a plugin for FIXME/TODO apart from this. I would also wanted to hear from all how these situations are usually managed
