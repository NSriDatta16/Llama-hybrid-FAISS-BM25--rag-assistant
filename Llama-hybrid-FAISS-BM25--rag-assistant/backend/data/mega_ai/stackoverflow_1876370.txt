Sounds like you need an array of numbers (not hard) and an array of strings (easy) or an array of characters (not hard). You then get two index variables. The first indexes for the city (c) and the second indexes for the temperature (t). You then setup a loop for the city. Set the index (c) to your language's array starting point (in most languages this is 0). Read the city name and store it in the name array indexed to 0. Next you want to setup a loop for the temperature. Again, start (t) at the beginning index. Now the fun begins. You need to read the temperature and store it in the array at the position [t + c* MaxTemps]. (MaxTemps should be 7 in your case). Read in all the temps increasing the index as you go. Then increase the city index and read in the next city name. If you are using an array of strings, just put the next city name in the second position. If instead you are using an array of characters, you will need to have an array that is [maxChars * maxCities] long. You will then need to put the second name in the [c * maxChars] spot. Now you should reset the temperature index and read in the temperatures for the next city. Continue looping until all data has been read. Output is similar to input. To get the average of the city read the data from [t + c * MaxTemps] ... [MaxTemps -1 + c*MaxTemps]. To get the average of each day, read the data from [t + c*maxTemps] ...[t + (maxCities -1) * MaxTemps] Good luck.
