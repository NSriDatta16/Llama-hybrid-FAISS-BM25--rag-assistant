PCA for tangent space approximation

Given samples on an $m$ -dimensional manifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ( $m ) defined by $C(x)=0$ (not known) where $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ . I would like to perform PCA to approximate the tangent space at $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ using samples in its neighborhood (e.g., all points that satisfy $\|x-x_i\|_2 ). However, in some cases the number of samples $k$ is smaller than the dimensionality $n$ . Thus, the covariance matrix is singular. Is there a way to estimate a full-rank covariance matrix with the given $k$ samples and some assumption on the dimensionality of the manifold that will provide the best PCS approximation?
