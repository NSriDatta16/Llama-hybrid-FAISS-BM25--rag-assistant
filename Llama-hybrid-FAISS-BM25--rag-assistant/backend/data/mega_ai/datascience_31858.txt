Neural networks are best trained with stochastic gradient descent (with minibatches), not with conjugate gradient descent or other optimization methods. I recommend using a framework designed for this, like Keras or Tensorflow. Separately: I recommend using a convolutional network for this particular task, not a fully connected network.
