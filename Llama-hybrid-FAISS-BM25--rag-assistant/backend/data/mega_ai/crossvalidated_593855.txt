Using SVM for subsets

Let's say I have a set of 20 data points. However, for certain unexplained reasons, I can only perform SVM on 4 of those data points at a time. Is there any way I can do SVM for each subset of 4 points for the 20-point dataset and then combine those vectors/planes/hyperplanes to get a more accurate result?
