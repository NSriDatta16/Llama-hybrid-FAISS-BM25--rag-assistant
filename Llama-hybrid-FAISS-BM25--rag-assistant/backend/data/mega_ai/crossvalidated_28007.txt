Some real life examples I had to hand as an addition to @Michael Lew's very good answer. First, the two time series plots below show monthly visitor arrivals to New Zealand, available from Statistics New Zealand . Both plots have their purpose, but I find the one with the vertical axis on a logarithmic scale spectacularly useful for many more purposes than the first one. For example, you can see that the seasonality in arrivals stays roughly proportional to the scale of the arrivals; and you can see the significant changes in growth rate (eg during the second world war) which are just invisible on the original scale. Second, the plots below show total trip-related spend by tourists to New Zealand, compared to the spend while they are actually in New Zealand. The source is the International Visitors Survey by Ministry of Economic Development. The difference is pre-trip expenditure, eg hotels or packages paid in advance. The first plot, on the original scale, can be used for few purposes other than a very crude (but important) impression of the data being grouped in the bottom left corner. The second plot sacrifices some immediate interpretability, particularly for non-statisticians (because of this, I would normally now actually use a logarithmic scale on the axes, rather than transform the data and have the scale showing the logarithmic value), but gives a lot more visual differentiation. For example, you can clearly spot the few outliers (which turned out to be data editing errors) where total spend was less than spend in New Zealand. Perhaps more importantly, you could use this graph with different colors or faceting to show how different market countries or purpose of visit (eg holiday v. visiting friends and family) occupy different parts of the expenditure "space" - something that would just be invisible on the original axes. Turning this plot into something useful would involve somehow dealing with the high density data (eg by adding some transparency to the points, or replacing points with hexagonal bins colored according to density) but any useful visual solution will almost certainly involve logarithmic axes. edit / addition Another plot to illustrate what I meant by the hexagonal bins, using color to represent density when there is a large dataset (in this case, about 12000 respondents to a survey about Rugby World Cup experiences in New Zealand). Note again this is another example where I've used a logarithmic scale for expenditure.
