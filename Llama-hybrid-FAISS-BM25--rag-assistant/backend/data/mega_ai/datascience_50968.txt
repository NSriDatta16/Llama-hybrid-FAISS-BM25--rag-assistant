Thesis on avalanche prediction using One Class SVM

I'm doing my thesis on avalanche prediction using machine learning. For my input features I'm using avalanche accidents with features like slope, altitude, facing direction of the slope, combined with according weather data from the day the avalanche occurred. I want to predict an avalanche when certain variables combine and create a deadly avalanche situation. So 1: the avalanche occurs. 0: The avalanche does not occur. The only data in my database are occurred avalanches, I got around 200 samples. So I don't have any data of a non deadly avalanche situation, which is mostly the case. My question is if a One Class SVM is a good approach to take on this classification?
