Since distribution of classification errors is a binary distribution (either there is misclassifcation or there is none) --- I'd say that using Chi-squared is not sensible. Also only comparing efficiences of classifiers that work on the same datasets is sensible --- 'No free lunch theorem' states that all models have the same average efficiency over all datasets, so that which model will appear better will depend only on what datasets were choosen to train them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization . If you are comparing efficiency of models A and B over dataset D i think that average efficiency + mean is enough to make a choice. Moreover if one has many models that have resonable efficiency (and are lineary independent of each other) I'd rather build ensemble model than just choose best model.
