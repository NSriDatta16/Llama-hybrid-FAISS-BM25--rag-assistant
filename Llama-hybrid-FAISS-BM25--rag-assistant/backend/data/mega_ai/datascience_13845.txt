Well, it is quite hard to do data science without using the computer. Unless you can do Random Forests by hand :) But if you mean raw programming, then anything you will be using (in 'everyday' DS) is already implemented in R, Python etc. Regarding the skills, I think R is the best choice - very intuitive, made to be easy to use, although at the expense of speed. Python is becoming the new standard but is script language and takes little more to learn. There is also Eviews for instance that is not really programming at all and is straightforward to use.
