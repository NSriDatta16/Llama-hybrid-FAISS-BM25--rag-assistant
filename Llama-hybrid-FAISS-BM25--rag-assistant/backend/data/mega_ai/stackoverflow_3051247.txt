Using SQL Server Database View for populating DataGridView and modifying data in DB

Using SQL Server Database View for populating DataGridView and modifying data in DB I want to know that how this will be done and if this is not a good solution, then please elaborate if any other good solution is possible . 1) Initially I want to use a Database View for populating different DataGridViews . 2) Multiple joins from multiple tables are required for the data-retrieval for each individual DataGridView . 3) The values from these DataGridViews are then populated in Controls (i.e. Textboxes/Combo-boxes) (For reference please see the images at this link: link text ). 4) When the User changes the values in Controls , and clicks Save , the data earlier retrieved from DataGridView (via View ) is to be updated in the Database . NOTE:I am working on C-Sharp Windows Application and using SQL Server 2005.
