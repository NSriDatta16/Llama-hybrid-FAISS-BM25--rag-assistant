I would consider the same as ehudokai. If you are roughly familiar with XML, then try to use the graphical layout just to control if everything is working es expected. In case you don't know how to create what you need in XML drag it to somewhere and cut & paste the code to the correct possition. I think the graphical layout is quite good for editing the properties, so you see directly what you are changing.
