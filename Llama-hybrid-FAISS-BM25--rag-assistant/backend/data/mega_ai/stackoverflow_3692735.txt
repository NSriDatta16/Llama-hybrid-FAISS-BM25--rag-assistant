It isn't going to be an elegant process to do what you are looking at, especially if you need to handle multiple page events, but in theory it is fully possible from within the Global.asax to setup handlers that you need for each and every page. The trick here is to add your code to the global.asax in the PreRequestHandlerExecute method, from here you can get access to the HttpApplication object, get access to the page from there, and then register your events. This process is necessary as a new page instance is created for every page that is processed. Now, other options as you know are far more elegant, but this should get to where you need to be. One helpful tutorial I found although around Themeing shows you the whole process here . EDIT: After seeing your comment, yes, you can simply do what I'm stating above, in a custom HttpModule. The article I linked even shows you that process :)
