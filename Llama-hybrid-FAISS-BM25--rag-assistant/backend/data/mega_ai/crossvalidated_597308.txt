Predicting World Cup - Using Poisson distribution

I have come across a code that predicted the winner of the World Cup using the Poisson distribution . Does this have any logic? is it reasonable? Searching the internet I have not found any reliable reference site that could support this theory. the code does the following: Here comes a part of Data Engineering that is not relevant where you collect data. At the end it has a dataframe with countries and their strengths (It is basically his average number of goals scored per conceded) country GoalsScored GoalsConceded Spain 1.69 1.1 Germany 1.89 0.98 Argentina 1.44 1.323 2. Predict the points o each match using poisson. def predict_points(home, away): #1 lambda for home and for away. lamb_home = df_team_strength.at[home, 'GoalsScored'] * df_team_strength.at[away, 'GoalsConceded'] lamb_away = df_team_strength.at[away, 'GoalsScored'] * df_team_strength.at[home, 'GoalsConceded'] #2 calculates the possibilite of 100 outcomes (0-0) (0-1)...(10-0) prob_home, prob_away, prob_draw = 0, 0, 0 for goals_home in range(0, 11): for goals_away in range(0, 11): p = poisson.pmf(goals_home, lamb_home) * poisson.pmf(goals_away, lamb_away) if goals_home == goals_away: prob_draw += p elif goals_home > goals_away: prob_home += p else: prob_away += p points_home = 3 * prob_home + prob_draw points_away = 3 * prob_away + prob_draw return (points_home, points_away) Example. pretict_points("Argentina", "Mexico") (2.455, 1.223) Makes the prediction with all the matchs of all the groups using the formula above. Take the first 2 or each group and simulate the knockout, quarter, semi and final. notebook github :
