Finding the position of the global optimum with Pytorch

I have a dataset with 22 parameters and I did a PolynomialFeatures = 2 to find the influence of interaction. This was then fitted to an Artificial Neural Network with the lowest loss being around 0.02. Now I want to find the position of the global optimum, which is the negative of the global minimum. How do I find the position of the global optimum with PyTorch?
