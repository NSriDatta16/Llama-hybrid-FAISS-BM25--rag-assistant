Must say I agree with that the most elegant solution to this is using boost::lexical_cast. You can then catch the bad_lexical_cast that might occure, and do something when it fails, instead of getting 0.0 which atof gives. #include #include int main() { std::string str = "3.14"; double strVal; try { strVal = boost::lexical_cast (str); } catch(bad_lexical_cast&) { //Do your errormagic } return 0; }
