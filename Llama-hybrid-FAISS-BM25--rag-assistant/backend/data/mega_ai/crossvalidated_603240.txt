Questionable statistic - conflict between chi square stat / relative risk reported

A recent high profile paper claimed to have found signals of harm from a particular intervention, which to avoid bias I'll refrain from identifying. The methodology is unusual and result controversial for several reasons, but to be fair I was interested in taking the results the authors reported at face value just to check them. So their rate-standardised reported data is as follows: Intervention group side-effects : 67.5 per 10,000 Placebo group side-effects : 49.5 per 10,000 From this, the authors claim a relative risk of 1.36 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.02 - 1.83, and they conclude the intervention is more harmful than the placebo, as the risk ratio does not go through unity. I've done a bit of work in the past on result fragility, and did a $\chi^2$ test on their figure, just to check. But in this case, using their reported rate data, you get $\chi^2 \approx 2.76, p \approx 0.0965$ , not significant at 5%. If I calculate their 95% confidence interval with this rate data, using $95\% \space CI = 1.36 \space \pm\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{67.5} - \frac{1}{10000}\right) +\left(\frac{1}{49.5} - \frac{1}{10000}\right)} = 1.36 \space \pm \space 0.37 $ and in total I get the 95% confidence interval crossing unity (0.99- 1.73) which to me seems consistent with the $\chi^2$ test not being significant at 5%. This to my mind looks like a nothing result. I wrote to the journal to voice this concern, and all I've got is a dismissal that their statistician disagrees. I asked to see this working, but nothing yet. My suspicion is that the authors, while reporting rate data for rare events, used the raw numbers for those calculations. With about 19,000 in each group however, these results will doubtlessly be significant even at marginal differences, which would be misleading without effect size data. Am I correct in believing that this reported result is likely an artefact, or am I missing something? Any thoughts welcome of course!
