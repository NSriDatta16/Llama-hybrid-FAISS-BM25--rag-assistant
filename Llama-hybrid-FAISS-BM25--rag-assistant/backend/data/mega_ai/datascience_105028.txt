UMAP has a transform method that can achieve this. Note that this is a somewhat expensive computation, and not almost instant as it can be with, for example, PCA. See the UMAP documentation for more details. If you need a very fast transform method for new data then I would encourage you to look at Parametric UMAP which uses a neural network to learn a direct mapping from input space to the embedding space and provides very efficient transforms.
