What is asymptotic error?

Ng, A.Y., and Jordan, M.I. (2001). On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes . Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 14 , pp. 841-8, MIT Press. In the above paper, the authors mentioned "asymptotic error". Can anyone explain a bit about this? For example, the abstract of the paper includes: Discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its higher asymptotic error much faster. What is the exact definition of "Asymptotic Error"?
