Repeated password prompt with Maven deploy-file to scp repository

I'm trying to deploy an artifact to a remote repository accessible via scp and having a problem with repeated password prompts. My settings.xml contains this fragment: example.com myusername mypassword 664 775 The command line interaction looks like this: $ mvn deploy:deploy-file -Dfile=ojdbc6.jar -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc6 -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=11.2.0.1.0 -DrepositoryId=example.com -Durl=scp://example.com/maven2/ [INFO] Scanning for projects... [INFO] Searching repository for plugin with prefix: 'deploy'.

How can I configure maven so it either uses a password from settings.xml or asks me once without echoing my password to the screen? Edit: This was on Ubuntu linux, a collegue just reproduced the same problem on Windows XP. As mounting the repository to a local path is not an option on Windows, I'm still looking for a solution.
