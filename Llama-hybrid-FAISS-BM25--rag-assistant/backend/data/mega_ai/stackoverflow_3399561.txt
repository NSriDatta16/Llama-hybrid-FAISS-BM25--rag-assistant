Remember me in Spring security to remember only user-name

I am using Spring security in my application and wish to know if there is a way to "ask" spring to only remember the user-name of the user that comes to the application (by means of the remember-me checkbox). What I could gather from the reference documentation is that Spring is able to save the userName and the password of the user, and directly log him/her in the next time. But what I want is that user be taken to the login page each time he comes back, but with his user-name already typed in. Ofcourse if Spring doesn't have a way to do this, I would need to implement some cookie storage logic to take care of this requirement. Many thanks for your answers as always.
