Not entirely my field, but maybe build a neural network with several layers - earlier layers to guess the splitting of the words into sequential syllables, the later layers to guess the pronounciation of the said syllables. Setting up a ANFIS-learning neural network is fairly straightforward for numerical data, for literal/phonetic data the task is undoubtedly several orders more complex.
