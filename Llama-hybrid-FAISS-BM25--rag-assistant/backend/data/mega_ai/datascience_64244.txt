If most of your data and machine learning pipeline is in Python, then Dask project for Python is a very good candidate. It allows you to scale (certain types of) data-frame operations to datasets more than memory. The good thing about Dask is that it is also easy to scale down if required. Most of the code stays in Python, you don't pay the serialization overhead (which is paid in PySpark for Python -> JVM).
