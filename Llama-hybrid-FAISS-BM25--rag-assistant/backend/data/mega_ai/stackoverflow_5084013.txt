No, for "websites" Microsoft does not currently force you to write code in a very Azure specific way - a web role is essentially just a website. So if you are sticking to just web roles and you are just using SQL Azure for storage, then currently your Azure code would be very portable. However, if you start to include: - worker roles - table, blob or queue storage - advanced Azure configuration - Azure diagnostics - Azure management (e.g. for scaling or for deployment) then you will start to include Azure specific functionality. Also, as a personal opinion, I don't think Microsoft "jacking up" the price is likely to be the problem - but competitors coming along with cheaper or more functional solutions might be an issue.
