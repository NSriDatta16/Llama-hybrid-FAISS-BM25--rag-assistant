As far as I know (and see), sklearn random forest library doesn't have such an option, (i.e. use this feature only once). It also constructs many decision trees, instead of one, using different subsets of your features (as well as samples) every time, then aggregate their outputs to make decisions. So, you won't be able to extract a simple set of rules after you've trained your model if it is among your purposes. Other than that, I believe that monotonicity of $X_4$ will be somehow reflected in the random forest itself.
