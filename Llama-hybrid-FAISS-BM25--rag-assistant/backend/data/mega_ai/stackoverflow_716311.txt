what languages get IEEE 754 right?

I just spend my week messing with the subject, and found no language that get the IEEE 754 spec right. Even GCC doesn't respect the relevant C99 part (it ignores the FENV_ACCESS pragma, and I've been told than my working examples were sheer luck). It is impossible (AFAIK) to respect the spec with library functions, you need support from the language because some common optimizations are forbidden when you play with flags or rounding. So here is my real question: are there languages out there (appart from C/C++ or raw assembly) that give me access to rounding modes, exception flags and calculus ?
