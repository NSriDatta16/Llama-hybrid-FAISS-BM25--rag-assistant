Are certain source models better suited for particular tasks?

I have the task of classifying medical images in a binary fashion. I plan on using transfer learning on a CNN but don't know what source model would be best to fine tune for this task. Are certain source models better suited for particular tasks? If so, how would I go about determining which source model would be best for my particular task? I have a test set of around 2,500 labeled image.
