Example open source client-server code projects

What are some open source client-server projects which might be best to look at and mimic their code organization style? Java is preferred but not required. Related: I'm still trying to determine an answer to my question from a few minutes ago, "Should client-server code be written in one 'project' or two?" and I think it would benefit me to see how other projects organize their code (and hopefully deduce the pros and cons of why they chose to do it that way).
