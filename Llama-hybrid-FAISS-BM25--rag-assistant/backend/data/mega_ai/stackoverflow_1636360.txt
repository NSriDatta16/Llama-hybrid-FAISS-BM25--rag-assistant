LINQ use with XML

We have a project in which access the DB layer (MS SQL) with LINQ. Can we now change our DB layer to XML file and still access it with the same LINQ? We want add possibility to store data in a single XML file or a set of XML files. Current LINQ to SQL code looks like: result = (from e in db.Organizations where e.Id == idOrganization select e).SingleOrDefault(); or result = (from e in db.Organizations where e.Name.Trim().ToUpper() == organizationName.Trim().ToUpper() && e.Id!=idCurrentOrganization select e).Count()>0;
