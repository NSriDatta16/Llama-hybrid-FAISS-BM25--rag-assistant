Strategy to start supporting other browsers

We have a web application that only supports IE6 and above. It is an old application and majority of the user base was using IE. At the time of development no one paid attention to cross-browser support. If you open the site in Firefox, the UI is all skewed. We are planning to start supporting Firefox now. What is the strategy we should follow to accomplish the task? What are the things we should keep in mind so that in future we can support any other browser with little effort?
