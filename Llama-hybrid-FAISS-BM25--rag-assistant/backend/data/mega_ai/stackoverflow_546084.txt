Have you tried the NetStreamInfo class (accessible via NetStream.info)? audioBytesPerSecond Specifies the rate at which the NetStream audio buffer is filled in bytes per second. The value is calculated as a smooth average for the audio data received in the last second. playbackBytesPerSecond Returns the stream playback rate in bytes per second. The playback buffer can contain content of various playlists. This property provides the playback rate that closely matches the bit rate of the currently playing stream. Looks like there's lots of useful info in there.
