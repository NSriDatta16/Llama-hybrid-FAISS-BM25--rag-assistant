As mentioned in the comments, the question is a bit vague so it is hard to make sure I actually answer it. If your property X is the mean of twenty measurements, then you can compute a standard deviation from that sample, say σ. If you believe that measurements are independent , the standard deviation of X is σ / √20. Then the question is whether m is a constant or if you actually want to estimate it from your data. If it is a constant, then the standard deviation of Y is m σ / √20. If you actually have a regression problem, like trying to fit m and b and then use that model to predict Y from X, it is probably better to use all your data points (no averaging). Then the variation is much larger and will depend on the value of X. If X is Gaussian you can look up the formula from Wikipedia at the paragraph "Normality assumption". To my knowledge there is no general method to propagate uncertainty, which means you'll have to work your way through each problem. To convince you I will use a pathological case. If X has a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 (variance 1/12), then tan(π(X - 1/2)) has a Cauchy distribution and thus an infinite variance.
