Logistic Regression or Linear Regression

Say I have the following hypothetical scenario: I have a material that I can freely configure, starting with 10 different strength properties. MTRL = 1.4:0.2:3.2; Next, pretend that I've smashed them 5 times each and recorded the % of the material that was damaged, giving me a vector of smash results that is 50-by-1 (5 multiplied by 10). Let's say the range of % damaged is between 40-100%. I'd like to do a logistic regression (in case it is non-linear) to find a strength level corresponding to the 75% damage point except that % damage is not categorical which gives me an error in MATLAB. Is logistic regression still appropriate or would a GLM work better?
