How to handle empty feature values in Random Forest

I have a question about Random Forest and features. I have put down a table below with an example that should describe the problem I wonder about. I have 2 Features(SUN and CLOUDS) that are always has a value TRUE/FALSE. The problem now is that sometimes it can RAIN but I don't want to know if it RAINS or not but IF it RAINS, I want to know about the feature: john is here and has an UMBRELLA Because the problem is that "john" must in the first place be here in order to know if he has en UMBRELLA or not. So if we put TRUE or FALSE in the empty field it will be wrong because first he has to be here to see if he has an UMBRELLA or not because of the RAIN. This means that sometimes we will have empty fields for those 2 Features as seen on the first row. How can we handle this correctly because I need to have values there for the Random Forest to work? Thanks!
