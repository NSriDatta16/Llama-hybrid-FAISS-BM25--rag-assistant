A few years ago, I asked a question about computing Bayesian credible intervals (roughly speaking, the Bayesian equivalent of confidence intervals) for interaction terms in logistic regressions. The answer is directed to a Bayesian setting, but I think the reasoning is valid for a frequentist analysis. The reference I provided was Computing interaction effects and standard errors in logit and probit models . You can also take a look at a similar paper by the same authors at Economic Letters . I'd take a look at a paper by Gelman on the subject and also this blog post . Unfortunately, I don't have time right now to explain in detail my view on the matter. I'll try to update my answer later if I find some time (though I doubt that!).
