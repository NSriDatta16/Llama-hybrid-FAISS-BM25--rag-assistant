How to index attributes from associations?

When I'm indexing objects in my application (using hibernate search and lucene) I would like to store in the index some of the attributes of the object's associations. I need to store them in the index because I need a fast retrieval of those attributes. What is the best approach for doing this? Store the object relationships in lucene. This seems like the easiest and fastest approach. Store the object relationships in db Store the object relationships in something separate like a fast key-value store Any other ideas on how I can store a set of attributes from a subset of objects from my app's object graph? Which solution should I use?
