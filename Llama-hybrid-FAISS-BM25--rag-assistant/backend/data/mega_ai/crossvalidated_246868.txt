Once you've fitted the model, it will be what it will be, so I think the difference is prior to that. That is, the models / parameters are fitted differently between the Bayesian and Frequentist approaches. More specifically, the fitted Bayesian parameters will incorporate additional information outside of what is in the data. If you know something about what the parameters are likely to be (and you aren't wrong), that could boost the model's performance. Even if you use an 'uninformative' prior, you will typically find the fitted Bayesian parameters will be shrunk to some degree towards $0$ relative to the fitted Frequentist parameters.
