I disagree that FP cannot be used for web applications. I know that Paul Grahm and Robert Morris started Viaweb that used Lisp to deliver web applications. I think as you go closer to hardware (device drivers, kernel etc), one wants to use as low level language as possible. This is because if more abstractions are used then its harder to debug in case of errors. Have a look at article "The Law of Leaky abstraction" by Joel Spolsky.
