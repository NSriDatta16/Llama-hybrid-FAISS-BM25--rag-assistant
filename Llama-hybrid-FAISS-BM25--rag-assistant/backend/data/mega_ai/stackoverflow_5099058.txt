MVVM / User Controls & View = ViewModel convention

Laurent of MVVM Light fame introduced me to MVVM, and the convention of one view has one view model. So what is the rule of thumb for user controls? One ViewModel for each user control? When creating a View leveraging more than one user control, do you create another viewmodel to aggregate the user control view models? Thanks in advance for the input. Richard
