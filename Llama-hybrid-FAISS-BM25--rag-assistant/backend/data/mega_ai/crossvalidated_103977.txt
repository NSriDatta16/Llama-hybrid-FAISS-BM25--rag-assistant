You could run a MANOVA, with nutrient treatment, time and their interaction as independent variables. You could try time as a categorical variable if you really want individual post-hoc comparisons, or as a covariate. It sounds like you are familiar with MANOVA, but in case not (and for other readers who aren't), here's a brief intro: http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/manova/manovanewest.htm However, it is likely that your dependent variables are correlated, because increasing nutrient could increase all the abundance of all species, or because of ecological interactions between species. How many ponds do you have? I might be tempted to play around with doing something like a PCA or NMDS on the species data and see whether they cluster by treatment and/or time (this would also show you how the abundances of different species correlate).
