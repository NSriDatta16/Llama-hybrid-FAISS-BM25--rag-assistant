Problem setting class properties

I keep getting a null exception at the ; below. The ApiUsername & ApiPassword have values so I don't undestand if I just set this up wrong or what. The Credentials property is a certain type which has the Username and Password properties that need to be set. So I have the auto-propery defined: public CustomSecurityHeaderType SoapCallCredentials { get; private set; } Then whenever this is hit, I get a null exception and can't figure out why. private void SetApiCredentials() { SoapCallCredentials = new CustomSecurityHeaderType { Credentials = { Username = PayPalConfig.CurrentConfiguration.ApiUserName, Password = PayPalConfig.CurrentConfiguration.ApiPassword } }; UrlEndPoint = PayPalConfig.CurrentConfiguration.ExpressCheckoutSoapApiEndPoint; }
