Introduce Delay after keyReleased() event

So, I'm working with swing and I need to find a clean (non-CPU-hogging-way) to introduce a delay on a text field. Basically, users will enter a number into this field and the keyReleased() event checks that the input fits a few parameters and then assigns the value to a data storage element in the program. If the data is invalid, it displays a message. Since the routine is called every time they type a letter (unless they type VERY fast), the input process becomes quite annoying (as in general one or two characters of data are not going to fit the allowed parameters). I've tried setting up a timer object and a timer task for it, however it doesn't seem to work very well (because it delays the thread the program is running on). The option to just wait until the data reaches a certain length is also not possible since (as state before) the input can vary in length. Anyone got any ideas? Thanks!
