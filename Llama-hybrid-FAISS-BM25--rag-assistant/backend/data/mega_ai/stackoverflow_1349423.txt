We have 3 Timer classes in NET (Timers.Timer, Threading.Timer and Windows.Forms.Timer) but only the Windows.Forms one has a Tick event. When used normally (ie dragged to the Form in Design-Time or created in some Form Code) the event is running on the Main thread and your problem should not occur. It is therefore most likely that you create the Timer object in another thread, you should probably Edit your question to show us how/where you create it and tell us if it is on another Thread on purpose.
