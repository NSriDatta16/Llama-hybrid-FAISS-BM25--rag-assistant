How to generate WSDL from class (not webservice)

I'm working on my diploma thesis based on multi agent systems and I need to generate WSDL from ontology (i.e. from class that is not webservice, no [WebService] or [ServiceContract] annotation). Information that I have: List of classes that represents operations (I can't change them) How to generate own WSDL without stuff like a classes with annotation [WebService] or [ServiceContract] ? Note: I can't use anotations because the whole solution is something like a Gateway between Agents in Multi-Agent systems and webservices. Each new agent in Multi-Agent system can be accessbile through SOAP (webservice). I've already implemented IHTTPHandler that is responsible for serialization SOAP messages to objects. So solution looks like a webservice but inside is my own IHTTPHandler.
