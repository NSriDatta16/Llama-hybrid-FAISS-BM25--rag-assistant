Find date ranges from a collection of dates C#

Simple question. I have an ordered collection of dates. They are UK dates btw 01/01/10 01/02/10 01/03/10 01/04/10 02/04/10 03/04/10 04/04/10 And I want to convert this into a collection of date ranges 01/01/10 -> 01/01/10 01/02/10 -> 01/02/10 01/03/10 -> 01/03/10 01/04/10 -> 04/04/10 Just to clarify, I'm trying to convert any consecutive dates into a range. so the first 3 dates are stand alone and the last 4 get converted into a range 1st of April to 4th of April. Now I can do this using loops but it's not very elegant. Does any one have any solutions out there that are? Thanks
