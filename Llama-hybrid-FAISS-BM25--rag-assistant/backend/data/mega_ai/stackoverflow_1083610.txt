In that case you have few options, because event handlers cannot be shared in VBA/VB6 Option 1: Use a central handling function which is called from every event handler. Sub Control1_ChangeEvent() CommonChangeEvent // Just call the common handler, parameters as needed End Sub Sub Control2_ChangeEvent() CommonChangeEvent End Sub ... Sub CommonChangeEvent(/* Add necessary parameters */) //Do the heavy lifting here End Sub Option 2: Organize your controls in control arrays. Sub TextBox_ChangeEvent(Index As Integer) CommonChangeEvent End Sub Sub OtherControlType_ChangeEvent(Index As Integer) CommonChangeEvent End Sub Combining both options your total event handler count will shrink considerably and the remaining handlers are just brainless stubs for the one true event handler.
