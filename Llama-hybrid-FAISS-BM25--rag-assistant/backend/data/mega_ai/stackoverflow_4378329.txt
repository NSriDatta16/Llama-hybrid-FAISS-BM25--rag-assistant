Create a new Block in Magento

I asked this question yesterday Static block on home page in Magento , which answered my question about hooking a cms/block to an existing block (content, in that example). But now I would like to know how to create my own block. I have this in my .phtml template: getChildHtml('home_flash') ?> And this in my cms.xml file home-page-flash But this is not working. I have also tried to create my own block type, (by copying the breadcrumbs declaration) in the page.xml file: That file exists but isn't being rendered. However when I reference the block like this: It renders my home block template, but the original cms/block is not attached to it. Hope all the different cases show what is happening and highlight the gap in my knowledge well enough for someone to answer, do I have to "register" my new "home_block" type somewhere?
