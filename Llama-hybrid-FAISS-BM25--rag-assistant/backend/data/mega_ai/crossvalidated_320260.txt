Yes, you can examine multivariate Granger causality. You can examine causality from multiple series to one series, from one series to multiple series, and from multiple series to multiple series. The idea of the test remains the same: restrict the lags of the series that supposedly causes the other and test whether the restriction holds in population. If you cannot reject the restriction, then you cannot reject the absence of Granger causality. The $F$-test should be valid. Read more in Lütkepohl "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis" Section 2.3.1 p. 42, starting with The deﬁnition [of Granger causality] extends immediately to the case where $z_t$ and $x_t$ are $M$- and $N$-dimensional processes, respectively. ...
