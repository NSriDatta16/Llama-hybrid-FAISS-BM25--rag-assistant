I have to agree with the above posters. If you're not using a framework when programming in PHP you're really programming with your hands tied behind your back. I personally recommend CodeIgniter . It's the fastest framework around, it's very easy to learn, and has a very active community. All of your questions will be answered by the framework: * How your folders are designed CodeIgniter (or any framework for that matter) separates your logic into views, models, and controllers, each with their own folder. * Do you have a standard way of dealing with CRUD, pagination, or any other common tasks? CI has a pagination library, and it has 3rd party libraries like DataMapper for wrapping your CRUD calls in an object oriented way (ORM). * What are ways in which you can make your code more elegant? The seperation of the model, view, and controller make for very elegant code. (The 2 questions I didn't answer are pretty much implied when using the framework)
