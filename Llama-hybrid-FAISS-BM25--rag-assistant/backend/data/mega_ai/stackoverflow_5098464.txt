Lift: how make these relations polymorphic?

I got a Entry it should be related to one of three "Lists" call them ListA ListB ListC i couldnt figure out how to do this with LongMappedMapper. So how could i do this? I wanted to let the List have multiple entries without having to specify a listX relation for each kind of list. So not : class Entry ...{ object listA extends LongMappedMapper(this,ListA) object listB extends LongMappedMapper(this,ListB) ... } I want something like: class Entry ...{ object list extends PolyLongMappedMapper(this,ListA,ListB,ListC) //PolyLongMappedMapper i the example mapper what i want ... } or: class Entry ...{ object list extends PolyLongMappedMapper(this,BaseListTrait) //where BaseListTrait is a Trait shared by all List classes //PolyLongMappedMapper i the example mapper what i want ... } Is somewere something in the Lift framework what does what i want? what is comparable to the PolyLongMappedMapper? Or is there an elegant way to solve this problem?
