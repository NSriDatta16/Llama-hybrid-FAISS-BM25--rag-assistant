From wikipedia : In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is larger than can be represented within the available storage space. For instance, adding 1 to the largest value that can be represented constitutes an integer overflow. The most common result in these cases is for the least significant representable bits of the result to be stored (the result is said to wrap). You should care about it especially when choosing the appropriate data types for your program or you might get very subtle bugs.
