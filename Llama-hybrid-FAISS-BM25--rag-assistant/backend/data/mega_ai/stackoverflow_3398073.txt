Taking a quick look, the above config will override a block with the grouped class name of udropship/adminhtml_shipment_view My_Bshipment_Block_Adminhtml_Shipment_View However, Magento never creates a block with this grouped class name. It creates a class with the grouped class name adminhtml/sales_order_shipment_view Have your config rewrite the above groupd class name, and then define your class to extend Unirgy_Dropship_Block_Adminhtml_Shipment_View
