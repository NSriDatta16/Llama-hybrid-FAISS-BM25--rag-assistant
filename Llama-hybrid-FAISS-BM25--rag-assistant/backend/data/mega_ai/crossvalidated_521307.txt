Why are ARCH/GARCH discussed like they predict the time series value itself instead of residuals?

I am fairly new to time-series analysis, I am trying to learn ARCH/GARCH models. My understanding is that ARCH/GARCH models try to predict the residuals (difference between an observed value from DGP and a predicted value from a model fit earlier), as illustrated in this video . However it is sometimes discussed like they predict the time series value itself instead of the residuals . For example, in this video and also this slide (page 7) (Shouldn't the $r_{t}$ be a residual instead of the return value itself?). Why are they discussed differently? I am confused.
