Per definition, PCA removes correlation among variables. It is used before classification because not all classifiers can deal well with high dimensional data (but neural nets can) and not all classifiers can deal well with correlated variables (but neural nets can). Especially with images, you typically do not want to remove correlation and you also want multiple layers such that neighboring pixels can be aggregated into image features. Your experimental results reflect the poor choice of this technique for this particular task.
