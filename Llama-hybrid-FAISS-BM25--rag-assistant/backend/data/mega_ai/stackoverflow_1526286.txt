The floating point etc figures from a CPU are less subjective than a web page / webservice etc. to make a fair comparison between languages will be difficult and often the problem is how it is written, not the language itself. It would be difficult to accurately compare languages, although not impossible. The easiest analogy for me is the database TPC scoring mechanisms are well known and do provide performance figures on the database side but when does the average developer even go look at them? Unless you are not working at an extreme level they are not your guiding factor (and even then, the DB's include optimiser shortcuts to make the TPC scores better.) TPC made a non-profit business out of it, but it takes significant buy in from the competing products - if MS / Oracle / IBM along with the hardware vendors did not buy into it, it would not of got very far. Could it be done? possibly, never say never, but it wouldn't be trivial at all and requires buy-in from multiple language vendors, h/w vendors etc. It's more about sales and marketting than technology at that point.
