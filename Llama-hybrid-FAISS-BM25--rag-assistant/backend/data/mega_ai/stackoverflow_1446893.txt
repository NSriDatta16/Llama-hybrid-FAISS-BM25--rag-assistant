I wouldn't say that they're discouraged, per se. With both CakePHP and Rails, the data integrity that foreign keys offer is handled by the framework. That said, it's only true if you do everything the "right" way. If you're writing your own SQL, operating in a non-standard manner or accessing/manipulating the data through any other means, then foreign keys are definitely a good idea, in my opinion. I've never used migration tools for CakePHP, but in my limited Rails work, I've always applied the keys in the migration using SQL. That way you get all of the inherent benefits of both. You have your migration and you get your domain constraints in case you ever skirt the framework to achieve some particular result.
