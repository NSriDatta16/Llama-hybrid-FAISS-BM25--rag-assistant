Remove the zoom: 1 from the #mainContent . I know you added that to work around IE bugs in the first place, but you're going to have to find another way to do that if you also want the main content to wrap around the float. Perhaps you can add it to select elements inside the main content. See the paragraph titled " Elements next to floats " in the famous article " On having layout ".
