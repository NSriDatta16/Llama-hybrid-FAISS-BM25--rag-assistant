How to check stored procedure return value elegantly

Here is my current implementation of a stored procedure which returns Order status for a given Order ID. There are two situations, there is matched Order ID and I will retrieve the related status, there is no matched Order ID (i.e. non-existing Order ID). My confusion is, how to implement the two functions elegantly/efficiently in one stored procedure, so that I return matched Order ID for situation 1 and also indicate client no matched Order ID in situation 2? I am using VSTS 2008 + C# + ADO.Net + .Net 3.5 as client, and using SQL Server 2008 as server. CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetStatus] @ID [nvarchar](256), @Status [int] output AS BEGIN -- SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from -- interfering with SELECT statements. SET NOCOUNT ON; -- Insert statements for procedure here SELECT @Status = [Status] FROM [dbo].[OrderStatus] WHERE (@ID = [ID]); END thanks in advance, George
