It is true that you cannot alter the splash screen, but you can present a view with whatever you want in it. Don't include a Default.png image in the bundle. Then in your app delegate, instantiate a view controller and add it's view as a subview to self.window. Then you need to dismiss this view, either based on a timer, or the completion of your startup processing, or a user tap, etc. It is worth noting that Apple discourages using a splash screen, and recommends that you just get the UI up and working as fast as possible. If you must have a splash screen, you can display something that looks like your working app to create the illusion of a responsive UI, and remove that as soon as your UI really is responding.
