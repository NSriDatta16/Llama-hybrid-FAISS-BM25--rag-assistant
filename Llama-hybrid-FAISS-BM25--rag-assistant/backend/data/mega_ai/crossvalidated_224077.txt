Request for reference of cheat-sheet of paper concerning preprocessing and learning algorithms

Is there a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps that are highly recommended when using the classical learning algorithms (see below for a list of the families)? Is there a cheat-sheet or a cook-book of when a certain preprocessing step is strongly recommended before applying the learning algorithms? Is there one with recommendations which preprocessing rather not to do - as likely information is lost? With preprocessing steps I think mainly of the classical ones in the context of numerical features (centering, scaling, PCA, BoxCox, outlier detection). With learning algorithms I speak about the rather classical families as covered e.g. in Elements of Statistical Learning (families of tree methods, SVM, neural neworks and boosted models) or in Applied Predictive Modelling (p 550). There various preprocessing steps are already suggested. Nevertheless discussing them would be of interest.
