Vertically translated depreciation curve: Update the exponential regression coefficient

I have an exponential regression equation that I use to predict the condition of roads . The equation can be found on page 53 of the original master's thesis: Development of a Flexible Framework for Deterioration Modelling in Infrastructure Asset Management From page 53: The equation has some IF statements which deal with specific roads-related scenarios. For the purpose of this question, I'll boil it down to it's simplest form: condition = 21 - EXP(0.072*age) Question: The equation was developed for my organization back in 2012 . At that time, the roads had only been inspected once. Now, fast-forward to 2017 , and we have a lot more data to work with . So, I think it would be wise to update the equation. If we were able to redo the analysis with the new data, I suspect we'd be able to predict the future condition of roads more accurately. However, as non-stats guy, I'm finding this to be rather difficult. How can I update the coefficient in the exponential regression equation?
