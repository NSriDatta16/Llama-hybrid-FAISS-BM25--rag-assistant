Changes in the pre vs. post-treatment behavior of control group

I have survey data that tracks self-reported emotions at the individual-level for observations in two groups before and after a targeted cash distribution program is introduced. The measure of interest is a categorical variable dividing emotions into: positive, neutral, or negative. I am interested in testing whether the self-reported emotions, particularly negative emotions, change for the treatment group once they receive a randomized cash distribution program, relative to the control group The daily average monthly pre-treatment share of negative emotions amongst the two groups as is follows, where the two groups have a relative similar share of reported negative emotions: emotion average_share group negative 70% treatment negative 69% control The post-treatment shows a noticeable decline in the share of negative self-reported posts amongst the treatment group (i.e. declining from 70% to a monthly average of 62%) and it's statistically significant at the 0.05 p-value level. However, one concern I have is that the control group's share of negative emotions rises post-treatment, which might be because some individuals in our survey were aware that we randomized the cash distribution program and were thus frustrated for not receiving a cash benefit like their treatment group counterparts. I wonder if this concern would make the control group invalid in this case, i.e. assuming that the two groups are otherwise similar in their characteristics. emotion average_share group negative 62% treatment negative 73% control
