I know i'm a couple months late, but i just encountered this issue.. Besides this post, I also found this jqueryui ticket while searching on the web... In the ticket a work-around is suggested: $( ".draggable-class-name").draggable({ connectToSortable: ".sortable-class-name", // other options here start: function(event, ui) { $( ".sortable-class-name" ).sortable("refresh"); } }); The work-around seems to work ok. This should help a bit, at least until the jqueryui team gets to solving it. Hope this is useful
