Back Dating - being given an end date and then told what needs to get done Inverse QA Coverage - QA focuses on the non-essential items (because that's all they know how to test) Environmental Alignment Issues - the various environments (Dev, Test, Staging, Production) are not in sync for code and data - therefore any testing prior to production is invalid Delivery Date Detachment - no one believes in the end date because: it was made up to begin with and 100% of prior projects never met their delivery dates Old Grumpy Code - old code is feared because there's no desire to refactor the evil pm triangle (scope, cost, resources and/or quality) - to adjust the project you need to add people, reduce quality, reduce scope, etc....once a project is in motion, most changes (even reduction in scope) will increase time and cost and reduce quality..once the train tracks are down, it's tough just hanging a left turn
