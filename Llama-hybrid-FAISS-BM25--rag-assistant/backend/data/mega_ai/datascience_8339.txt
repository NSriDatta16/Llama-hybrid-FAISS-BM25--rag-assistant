Voting combined results from different classifiers gave bad accuracy

I used following classifiers along with their accuracies: Random forest - 85 % SVM - 78 % Adaboost - 82% Logistic regression - 80% When I used voting from above classifiers for final classification, I got lesser accuracy than the case when I used Random forest alone. How is this possible? All classifiers are giving more or less same accuracies when used individually, then how does Random Forest outperform their combined result ?
