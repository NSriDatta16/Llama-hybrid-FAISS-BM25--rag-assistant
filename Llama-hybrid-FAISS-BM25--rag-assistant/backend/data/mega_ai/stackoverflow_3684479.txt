static means a variable will be globally known only in this file. extern means a global variable defined in another file will also be known in this file, and is also used for accessing functions defined in other files. A local variable defined in a function can also be declared as static . This causes the same behaviour as if it was defined as a global variable, but is only visible inside the function. This means you get a local variable whose storage is permanent and thus retain its value between calls to that function. I'm no C expert so I might be wrong about this, but that's how I've understood static and extern . Hopefully someone more knowledgable will be able to provide you with a better answer. EDIT: Corrected answer according to comment provided by JeremyP.
