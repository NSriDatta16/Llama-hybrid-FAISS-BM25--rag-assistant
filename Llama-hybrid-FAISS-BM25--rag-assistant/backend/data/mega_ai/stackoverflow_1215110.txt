Resig to the rescue: You can also inline script: "> Quick tip: Embedding scripts in your page that have a unknown content-type (such is the case here - the browser doesn't know how to execute a text/html script) are simply ignored by the browser - and by search engines and screenreaders. It's a perfect cloaking device for sneaking templates into your page. I like to use this technique for quick-and-dirty cases where I just need a little template or two on the page and want something light and fast. and you would use it from script like so: var results = document.getElementById("results"); results.innerHTML = tmpl("item_tmpl", dataObject);
