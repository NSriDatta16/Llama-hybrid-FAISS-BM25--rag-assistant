You don't have a hypothesis anywhere here. Don't test anything unless you do have a suitable hypothesis; this must NOT be based on things you find in the sample. What are you collecting data for? What were you trying to find out? Is this t-test appropriate because the sampling distribution is normally distributed even though the original sample isn't? (i) The sampling distribution of the mean is not normal; the average of 14 non-normally distributed quantities (even if some other typically assumed conditions were reasonable) is not normally distributed. (ii) the derivation of the ratio in a t-statistic being t-distributed relies on more than the distribution of the numerator. (iii) nevertheless, it's pretty likely that a suitable t-statistic would have a distribution close enough to the t-distribution that the significance level of the test would be very nearly what you selected $\alpha$ to be (quite possibly even at $n=14$ ). The power would be somewhat reduced compared to a better choice of distributional model, but in many situations probably not enough to worry you. Would Î¼ simply be my original sample mean of 0.18? No. If you didn't have a $\mu$ before you saw any data, you didn't have a hypothesis to test Where do I define how comfortable I am with the mean being off. I don't know the term for that; what I mean to say is. I'm comfortable with an error margin of +/- 0.05. It's unclear what you mean. Are you here trying to specify a margin of error for the estimate of the mean, as if you were creating a confidence interval for the mean? Do I then perform a t-test on each bootstrapped mean to find if it is significantly different from the sample mean? No. You do not compare means of simple bootstrap resamples to the sample mean. That doesn't test anything. If you were to have a suitable hypothesis, and you specifically wanted a non-parametric test of the mean (not simply that you didn't just want to use an ordinary one-sample t-test), I'd be suggesting a permutation test. But you don't have a hypothesis. There's literally nothing to test. I will, of course, be extending this to a sample size calculation (using R). You're going to have to be a lot clearer about your aim. You don't have a test, so no sample size calculation on that basis. You could specify a margin of error for a CI and get a sample size that way but you haven't really been very clear that this is actually what you want. "(it's percent vegetation cover, which I think follows a beta distribution?)" No, the beta distribution is one potentially plausible model for a continuous proportion like vegetation cover, but don't confuse the model for the real thing: - Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful. $-$ George Box If you believe the beta model would be a pretty good model (and it might, as long as none of your proportions are actually 0 or 1), why would you not directly use the beta model as the basis for a test, confidence interval, or whatever else? ... Ideally you should have dealt with these issues in detail before gathering even the pilot sample, but at least you're doing it before you collect the main sample, which is important.
