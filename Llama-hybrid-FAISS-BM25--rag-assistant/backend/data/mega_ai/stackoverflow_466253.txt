FlexBuilder has been well worth the investment for me personally; it's probably paid for itself tenfold or more. No, far more. Easily. A few key fetures I've most enjoyed: Intellisense/code-hinting: Especially if you're new to Flex, this'll speed your learning process along surprisingly well; The Profiler: The live memory/app profiler really helps keep an eye on what's happening inside the box; The Debugger: It's tough to beat being able to set breakpoints, trace the stack, watch variables, etc. -- great stuff here; Eclipse: Eclipse is just an excellent IDE, and Adobe has extended it beautifully for Flex and AIR. Incidentally, I don't do any drag-and-drop stuff, myself; I code everything manually, and I still can't recommend FlexBuilder enough. If you can part with the cash, chances are you'll be happy with the product.
