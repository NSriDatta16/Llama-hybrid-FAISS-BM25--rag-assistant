Simulate an AR(1) process that approximates gamma-like distribution

I’d like to simulate an AR(1) time series that approximates a gamma distribution rather than a normal distribution. I’d like the result to have a specified rate and shape along with a AR(1) process with a given phi . I have seen this post and understand that a strict gamma simulation is problematic, but I'd be satisfied with a result that approximates the shape and rate. Some crude adjustment of shape and rate as a function of phi is likely enough for my needs. Any idea? E.g., n
