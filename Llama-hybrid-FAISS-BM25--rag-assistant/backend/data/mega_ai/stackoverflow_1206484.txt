I use TFS (VSTS 2005) and MS Project for all my projects. The only limitation so far in the current version is that you can only associate an MS project with one TFS project. This could be ok depending on what classification you have chosen for your TFS projects. I have so far organized TFS project by major functional groupings. E.g. - shared enterprise services - major functionality X (e.g. loan origination system) - major functionality Y (e.g. public web site) - major functionality X (e.g. underwriting sytem) In this situation if I need to create a workplan for an IT project impacting 2 TFS projects, what I have done so far is: a) create an MS project for each of the 2 TFS projects - each associated with its TFS counterpart b) expose milestones at each of the 2 MS projects level c) create an overall summary MS project linking milestones from the subprojects. I do not map/connect this overall project to any TFS project This has worked reasonably well over the past couple years.
