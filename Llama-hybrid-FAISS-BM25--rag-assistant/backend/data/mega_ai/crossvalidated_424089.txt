AutoGrad Hessian in custom loss function in XGboost takes very long time

I am using the autograd package and generating the hessian of my loss function using that package as part of my custom loss function XGB model. However, it takes an extremely long time to iterate through the gradient descent model. I am unable to do an analytical version of my loss function due to various reasons but is there any other way to make the model train faster ?
