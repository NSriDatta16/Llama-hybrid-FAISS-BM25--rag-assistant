Why I am having odd results with this neural network model

I am kind of new to neural networks, so I was doing some practice with iris data set. But the results are weird. Because I am running the network with the same data (not randomly chosen) and huge number of epochs (500 times), but results are sometimes 0,25 sometimes 1,0 or 0,95. The only thing that random is biases and weights. I think training the network with 500 epochs should remove this randomness at the end. But it seems like it doesn't or there is some another problem that I am not noticed yet. If you help me about this I will be thankful. (PS: If you give me an advice about making the question better I will edit it, I am new at forum) import tensorflow as tf import pandas as pd import numpy as np from tqdm import tqdm def to_one_hot(label_data): one_hot = [] for item in label_data: temp = [] for i in range(3): if(i == item): temp.append(1) else: temp.append(0) one_hot.append(temp) return one_hot def read_data(n): df_data = pd.read_csv('iris.csv') x = [] y = [] species_dict = {'Iris-setosa' : 0, 'Iris-versicolor' : 1, 'Iris-virginica' : 2} for i in range(len(df_data['Id'])): temp_item = [] temp_item.append(df_data['SepalLengthCm'][i]) temp_item.append(df_data['SepalWidthCm'][i]) temp_item.append(df_data['PetalLengthCm'][i]) temp_item.append(df_data['PetalWidthCm'][i]) x.append(temp_item) y.append(species_dict[df_data['Species'][i]]) y = to_one_hot(y) x_train = [] y_train = [] x_test = [] y_test = [] for i in range(50): if (i
