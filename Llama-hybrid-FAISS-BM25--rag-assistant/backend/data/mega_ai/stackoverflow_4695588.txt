Here's a fragment of some ExtendScript I use to launch other scripts; I've used it in After Effects, but it probably work in InDesign, too: var theScriptFile = new File("/path/to/file.jsx"); var oldCurrentFolder = Folder.current; Folder.current = theScriptFile.parent; theScriptFile.open(); var theScriptContents = theScriptFile.read(); theScriptFile.close(); gCurrentScriptFile = theScriptFile; if(doDebug) debugger; // You have entered the debugger in Launcher... // to debug the script you've launched, step // into the eval() function below. // eval( "{" + theScriptContents + "}" ); Folder.current = oldCurrentFolder; gCurrentScriptFile = ""; The approach is to read the file and eval it. (P.S. another good tag would be ExtendScript, here.) Also see: http://omino.com/pixelblog/2007/11/15/binary-files-in-extendscript/
