Why is sampling useful in machine learning?

I have met that question online and I wanted to know where sampling can simulate complex processes and why? Why is sampling useful in machine learning? Sampling can increase the accuracy of the model Sampling can simulate complex processes Sampling is lower cost Sampling can save lots of time I can select multiple ones. As far as I know, sampling is lower cost and can save lots of time but, can it simulate complex processes?
