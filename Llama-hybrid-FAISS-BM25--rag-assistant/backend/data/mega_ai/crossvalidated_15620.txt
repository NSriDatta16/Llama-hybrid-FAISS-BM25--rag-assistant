x per y is a ratio. It's not a mean of any sort. But taking the mean of ratios is dangerous in many situations. For example if you travel 240 miles at 60 miles per hour (x per y) and 240 miles at 40 miles per hour, your average speed is not 50 miles per hour. The first trip takes you 4 hours the second trip takes you 6 hours; total time is 10 hours, total distance is 480 miles, average speed is 48 mph. So, please explain what you are trying to do.
