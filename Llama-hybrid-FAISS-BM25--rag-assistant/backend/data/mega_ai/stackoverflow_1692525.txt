If you know the exact text of the element, and you know it's the last element of its kind in the fragment, you have more than enough information to match it with a regex. I suspect you're using a regex like this: / Announcements /s ...and the .* is matching everything between the of the first anchor tag and the >Announcements of the second one. Switching to a non-greedy quantifier: / Announcements /s ...doesn't help; a reluctant quantifier stops matching as soon as possible, but the problem here is that it starts matching too soon. You need to replace the .* with something more specific, something that can only match whatever comes between the opening and closing > of a single tag: / ]+>Announcements / Now, when it reaches the end of the first tag and doesn't see Announcements it will abort that match attempt, move along and start fresh at the second tag.
