Problems with iOS app quitting with no debug info and no log messages

I have an app here that could be boiled down to uiscrollviews with images that you can flick through. I'm experiencing something really strange here though. When flicking through each image (have roughly 60 of them in total), at some point the app just quits. I'm running it in XCode 4 (GM seed 2), and I'm getting no debug info, and no messages in the console at all. Turned on NSZombieEnabled, but that didn't change anything. I'm not even getting a crash log on the device. I've run it through instruments, and it doesn't report any leaks, and my memory usage goes between 700 and 1100KB when run on the device. I even checked each of my "pages" (the ones you flick through) and added messages at init and dealloc, and I can confirm that they're all getting deallocated properly (only keep the current and the pages on each side loaded). Now, this seem to mostly happen at the same point in the app when I just start at the beginning and flick through each page going right, plus or minus a few pages, all pointing toward a memory issue, I do get a memory warning from the device, but there is absolutely nothing pointing to me using a lot of memory at all, nor that there are any leaks. I got this from the console on the device when the app quits: Mar 8 14:13:37 unknown configd[26] : jetsam: kernel memory event (92), free: 451, active: 2894, inactive: 2267, purgeable: 0, wired: 16709 Mar 8 14:13:37 unknown configd[26] : jetsam: kernel termination snapshot being created Mar 8 14:13:37 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (com.apple.AOSNotification) Exited: Killed: 9 Mar 8 14:13:37 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.apple.mobilemail[0xc2ee]) Exited: Killed: 9 Mar 8 14:13:37 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:no.NRC.NRCMag[0x3c6c]) Exited: Killed: 9 Mar 8 14:13:37 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (com.apple.dataaccess.dataaccessd) Exited: Killed: 9 Mar 8 14:13:37 unknown SpringBoard[30] : Received memory warning.

And why am I getting memory warnings when Instruments (and a thorough look at my code) says that I'm not using much memory, nor leaking? Help! EDIT: Got 3.2.6 up and running here and the console now gives me this: Program received signal: “0”. Data Formatters temporarily unavailable, will re-try after a 'continue'.
