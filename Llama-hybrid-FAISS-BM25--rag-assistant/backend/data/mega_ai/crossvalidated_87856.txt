How can a t-test be statistically significant if the mean difference is almost 0?

I am trying to compare data from 2 populations to tell if the difference between the treatments is statistically significant. The data sets appear to be normally distributed with very little difference between the two sets. The average difference is 0.00017. I performed a paired t-test, expecting that I would fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the means, however, my calculated t-value is much higher then my critical t-value.
