ng neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing to improve their systems. Applications of AI in cyber security include: Network protection: Machine learning improves intrusion detection systems by broadening the search beyond previously identified threats. Endpoint protection: Attacks such as ransomware can be thwarted by learning typical malware behaviors. AI-related cyber security application cases vary in both benefit and complexity. Security features such as Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) and Extended Endpoint Detection and Response (XDR) offer significant benefits for businesses, but require significant integration and adaptation efforts. Application security: can help counterattacks such as server-side request forgery, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and distributed denial-of-service. AI technology can also be utilized to improve system security and safeguard our privacy. Randrianasolo (2012) suggested a security system based on artificial intelligence that can recognize intrusions and adapt to perform better. In order to improve cloud computing security, Sahil (2015) created a user profile system for the cloud environment with AI techniques. Suspect user behavior: Machine learning can identify fraud or compromised applications as they occur. Transportation and logistics Automotive and public transit Transportation's complexity means that in most cases, training an AI in a real-world driving environment is impractical, and is achieved through simulator-based testing. AI-based systems control functions such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. AI-based fuzzy logic controllers operate gearboxes. AI-based driver-assist systems include features such as self-parking and adaptive cruise control. Some autonomous vehicles do not allow human drivers (they have no steering wheels or pedals). There are prototypes of autonomous automotive public transport vehicles such as autonomous rail transport in operation, electric mini-buses, and autonomous delivery vehicles, including delivery robots. Autonomous trucks are in the testing phase. The UK government passed legislation to begin testing of autonomous truck platoons in 2018. A group of autonomous trucks follow closely behind each other. German corporation Daimler is testing its Freightliner Inspiration. AI has been used to optimize traffic management, which can reduce wait times, energy use, and emissions. Military Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated. AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can fly independently or in swarms. AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS, which is a rule-based expert system using information from TF-30 documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the F-111C. The system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers. Speech recognition allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to drones. Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft, or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule-based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective. NASA In 2003 a Dryden Flight Research Center project created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to c
