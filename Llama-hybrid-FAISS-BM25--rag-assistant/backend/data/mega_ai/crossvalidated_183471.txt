Ancillary statistics:Beta distribution is free of $\beta$?

I am reading Robert V. Hogg Introduction to Mathematical Statistics 6th Version page 409, second paragraph. $X_1, X_2$ is a random sample from a Gamma $\text{G}(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution with known parameter $\alpha>0$ and unknown parameter $\beta$. The ratio $$Z=\dfrac{X_1}{X_1+X_2}$$ has a Beta $\text{B}(\alpha,\alpha)$ distribution that is free of $\theta$. Therefore $Z$ is a ancillary statistic. My question is: why $Z$ is free of $\beta$? In the book p155, the authors showed that the pdf of $Z$ is $$f(z)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}z^{\alpha-1}(1-z)^{\beta-1},\quad 0 one . This is the pdf for the Beta $\text{B}(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution but the $\beta$ or $\theta $ is still there, why $Z$ is free of $\beta$ then?.
