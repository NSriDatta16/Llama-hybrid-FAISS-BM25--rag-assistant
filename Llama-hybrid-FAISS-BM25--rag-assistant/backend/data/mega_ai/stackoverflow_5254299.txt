output garbage from windbg heap summary

First, My English is not good. So sorry. I'm not living English area. I have a question. I'm working memory fragmentation of Windows server program. Because of out of memory cannot run more than a week. May be problem it is. So, I used to heap memory analysis by windbg to '.heap -s address(heap handle) command. But I don't understand this report. Look at it. 0:023> !heap -s 0x01490000 Walking the heap 0000000001490000 ........... 0: Heap 0000000001490000 -- Omitted -- Flags 00001002 - HEAP_GROWABLE Reserved memory in segments 1047616 (k) Commited memory in segments 617812 (k) Virtual bytes (correction for large UCR) 188152 (k) Free space 549 (k) (25 blocks) External fragmentation 0% (25 free blocks) Virtual address fragmentation 1254577998% (3 uncommited ranges) Virtual blocks 32 - total 0 KBytes Lock contention 1 Segments 11 Virtual address fragmentation have garbage value. what's the problem?? Is it right value?? I have planned. Tried to verify performance improvement. Also, determine if there are problems. But cannot be, because this problem. I tried search many kind of article. but I could not get useful information. Please help me. First, Why did it happen? Second, Is way approach for more effective using memory? May be, you read my post is difficult. I know. so really really sorry. Thank you for reading my post.
