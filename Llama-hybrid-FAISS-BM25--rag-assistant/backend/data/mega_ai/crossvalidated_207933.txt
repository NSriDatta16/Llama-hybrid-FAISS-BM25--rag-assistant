White test confirms heteroskedasticity while Breusch-Pagan test doesn't

I'm using SAS in order to create a model for a cars datasets. The response variable y, is the price of the car. By the way I'm using the PROC MODEL statement in order to check heteroskedasticity. This is the output: Test di eteroschedasticitÃ  Equazione Test Statistica DF Pr > ChiQuadr Variabili price Test di White 56.32 27 0.0008 Cross of all vars Breusch-Pagan 11.43 7 0.1208 1, normalized_losses, height, bore, stroke, compression_ratio, simbol, peak_rpm Questions: Is there heteroskedasticity? Breusch-Pagan accepts the null hypothesis, while White doesn't. I couldn't put in the proc model statement all my variables, because some of them were qualitative. Could this be a (or maybe "THE") problem?
