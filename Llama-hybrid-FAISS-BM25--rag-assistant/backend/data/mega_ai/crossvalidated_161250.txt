When you first approach the clustering task you must answer to one biggest question which will influence all your subsequent actions - which distance measure to use. Distance measure describes 'how far away from each other 2 points'. In your setting the points are customers and they are described by lots of dimensions. You need to decide how you can compare 'similarity' between 2 users and either use some standard distance measure or create your own function for distance measures. After that you could try to cluster your data with different algorithms and check the results. To choose the algorithm you will need to spend some time on trial and errors but having good distance measure you will be able to evaluate your result. For further reading I would suggest a 'Mahout in action' book. Though it focused on Mahout library it has very good coverage of theoretical part and provides examples of real-world clustering problems and even the way of using custom distance measures.
