Ruby On Rails ActiveRecord SQL view into schema

I created a view and was able to successfully access it through rails by creating the view through a migration with execute sql. The problem with this is that the view is not entered into the schema. So when I need to create my test database to run my tests against the view is not created. I then need to create it by running the sql statement. Is there a way to implement SQL views elegantly in ruby on rails? My environment: Ruby on Rails 3.0.3 PostgreSQL 8.3
