It's kind of an odd question. If I may take the liberty to rephrase it... Why am I spending so much time fixing my own mistakes? Focus your energy on not making them in the first place. There are many things you can do to minimize mistakes: Be clear ahead of time what the inputs, outputs, and side effects of your methods are. Break down your problem into small, easy-to-write functions and methods. Write lots of tests. Write testable methods. Proofread your code before you hit that compile/run button. Have someone else proofread. As you gain experience, you'll find that the easy mistakes become less frequent and the hard ones (usually resulting from poor design or unknown behaviors in libraries) start consuming more of your time.
