Calling Property Methods from the e.PropertyName property

void TheSettings_PropertyChanged(object sender, System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventArgs e) { var settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings[StorageSettings] as Dictionary ; settings[e.PropertyName]= //call the method that has the same property // name to get what the value is LoadData(); } Here is What I am trying to do. This is for a Windows Phone 7 series App. I am trying to determine what values got changed when the user changes the settings on the settings page and just save that.
