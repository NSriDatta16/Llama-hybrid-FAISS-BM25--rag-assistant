You don't want to use mysql_query, that takes away all of the advantages of Doctrine. http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/dbal/2.0/en/reference/data-retrieval-and-manipulation.html shows all of the methods you can call through Doctrine and still handles plain old SQL. That's probably your best bet.
