Timeseries Charts data every 5 Seconds?? Worried about Performance

We have Time Series data for every 5 Seconds . Now you can assume what will be the Data for a single day ?? We have a requirement of showing a graph/ chart for a Whole Month . (For example a user selects a Month from Jan 1st 2011 to Jan 31st 2011 ) The data loaded might be too heavy and it may degrade the applications performance or make it Out of Memory . How can we handle this requirement ?? The Flotr API uses this method to draw the Charts , which requires the data to be already loaded . summaryGraph: function (data, bounds) { var p = Flotr.draw( $('summaryGraph'), [data], { } ) } please suggest any inputs for this .Thank you .
