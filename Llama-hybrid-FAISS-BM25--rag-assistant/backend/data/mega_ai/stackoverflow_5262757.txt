The position and groupings of files, frameworks, media etc in the Files and Groups panel has nothing to do with the location of the items on disk or their inclusion or linkage to other pieces of code. The Files and Groups panel is purely an organizational convenience for the programmer. The only part that has functional relevance is the target. Items included in a target build show up within the target. Otherwise the organization is arbitrary. You include objects from one header in another by importing the first header into the second. In you case it would be: in myappViewController.h #import "MainView.h" ... now objects defined in MainView.h are known to myappViewController.
