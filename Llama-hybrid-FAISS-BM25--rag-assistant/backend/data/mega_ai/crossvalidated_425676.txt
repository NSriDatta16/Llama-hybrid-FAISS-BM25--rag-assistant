Is interrupted time series analysis appropriate with these data?

The aim of my study is to investigate the effect of a change in legislation on violent behavior. The same intervention was introduced at different times in different countries. For my analysis, I am looking at 6 different countries that have adopted a change in legislation at very different points in time, so I have conducted one ITS analysis for every country. Derived from theory, I have proposed a step-change model for all countries, as the intervention is identical. The dependent variable was measured yearly. Unfortunately, the quality of the data varies strongly between countries and the observation time frames are of different length. For country 1 for example, I have a nearly equal amount of pre- and post-intervention data points and the data show a visible increasing slope with little variance, so my results make sense and are easy to interpret. For country 2 however, the variance in the data is much greater and I feel like the predicted trend does not really represent the data. For country 3, although in theory the step change model (red) makes the most sense, a step & slope change model (green) represents the data much better. Please find some exemplary graphs attached. From the above mentioned problems I derive the following questions: 1. Considering country 2 and looking at the data, would it even be appropriate to conduct a ITS analysis? How can I tell if the criteria are actually met and is it okay to interpret the data accordingly? 2. Looking at country 3, is there any justification to propose a different model for one country than for the other 5? Obviously, the results obtained from using the step change model seem wrong to me. I also have 2 more general question: 3. Does it make sense to correct for seasonality in my case? As I am looking at yearly data I cannot think of obvious seasonal influences on my DV like I would with monthly data. 4. When I add a slope-change component to my model, do I interpret the coefficients in the same way as in a step change only model? Because when looking at country 3, although the “step” seems to have become smaller, the effect according to the coefficients has increased. Thank you very much for taking your time to read this; I would really appreciate your help!
