I'll have a try. Since we don't use all samples as timesteps in RNN, we learn "patterns" from history and make prediction based on recent timesteps. The predition won't be really bad even we use naive history average method, not to speak of RNN. I don't know whether the pattern will change after you adopt the new heating system, if so, the last year's data is somehow useless no matter what method you use. From my experience, you can try to train a model to predict and iterate its version if you have new system's data to have better performance.
