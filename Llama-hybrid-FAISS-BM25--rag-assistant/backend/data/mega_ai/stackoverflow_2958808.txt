How to check whether a CGPoint is inside a UIImageView?

In touchesBegan: CGPoint touch_point = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self.view]; There are tens of UIImageView around, stored in a NSMutableArray images . I'd like to know is there a built-in function to check if a CGPoint (touch_point) is inside one of the images, e.g.: for (UIImageView *image in images) { // how to test if touch_point is tapped on a image? } Thanks Follow up: For unknown reason, pointInside never returns true. Here is the full code. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; touch_point = [touch locationInView:self.view]; for (UIImageView *image in piece_images) { if ([image pointInside:touch_point withEvent:event]) { image.hidden = YES; } else { image.hidden = NO; } NSLog(@"image %.0f %.0f touch %.0f %.0f", image.center.x, image.center.y, touch_point.x, touch_point.y); } } although I can see the two points are sometimes identical in the NSLog output. I also tried: if ([image pointInside:touch_point withEvent:nil]) the result is the same. never returns a true. To eliminate the chance of anything goes with with the images. I tried the following: if (YES or [image pointInside:touch_point withEvent:event]) all images are hidden after the first click on screen. EDIT 2: Really weird. Even I hard coded this: point.x = image.center.x; point.y = image.center.y; the code becomes: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point; // = [touch locationInView:self.view]; for (UIImageView *image in piece_images) { point.x = image.center.x; point.y = image.center.y; if ([image pointInside:point withEvent:event]) { image.hidden = YES; NSLog(@"YES"); } else { image.hidden = NO; NSLog(@"NO"); } NSLog(@"image %.0f %.0f touch %.0f %.0f", image.center.x, image.center.y, point.x, point.y); } } pointInside always returns false ...
