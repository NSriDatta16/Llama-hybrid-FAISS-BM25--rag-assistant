How to test methods in service layer calling a stored proc in java?

I am working on a legacy code where there are several methods with calls to Stored procedures from the service layer itself as opposed to hibernate. Is it possible to test those methods in any manner so that my code coverage can increase ? I am using java 1.5 and sql server 2005.
