I would argue that a standard Bayesian solution would make them directly incomparable, but I could be wrong. Consider two posteriors $$\pi(\theta|X_1)$$ and $$\pi(\theta|X_2).$$ Each posterior is optimal, given its observations and prior. It differs from a Frequentist method which optimal on average. To give you a thought experiment as to why you cannot compare them directly, consider a school where you are going to split the students into two samples by tossing a fair coin. Your concern is estimating average height. Ignore the preposterousness of the setup for a moment. Assume you are in group one if the coin comes up heads. Sample one’s estimators were $\bar{x}_1=36 in$ and $s^2_1=9in^2$ . Sample two’s estimators were $\bar{x}_2=36.1$ and $s^2_2=8.9in^2$ . What about flipping the coin, the intervention, caused students to be taller or the sample variability narrower when the coin came up tails? If nothing, then if you repeated this, say 1000 times, you could discuss the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the sample space, but that is about it. You could construct the sampling distribution of the posterior means, medians, and modes or just one of them as they should be somewhat predictable. You can compare them indirectly as part of a distribution, but not directly because the difference is randomness. A Frequentist process, of course, is built around the sample space rather than the parameter space and well understood analytic properties exist. While the Bayesian solution would be analytic under a conjugate prior, you will lack things such as the guaranteed minimum level against false positives. Bayes factors will not help you here as there can be technical issues with Bayes factors you probably want to avoid. What I would do, if it were me, is that I would marginalize out the parameters leaving only a model parameter (Model 1, Model 2, etc.). That would give you an understanding of the impact of the sampling distribution on the trustworthiness of the posterior. I have not looked, but as this is just a linear model, I would guess there is a paper on the Frequentist properties of Bayesian conjugate linear models. If it isn’t conjugate, there won’t be an analytic solution. Do note that your prior must be a proper prior, you will not be able to use a flat prior, because once your independent variables exceed 3, then a flat prior will prevent the posterior from integrating to unity and you may get spurious results. Still, it could have such a wide prior variance that it is effectively a flat line such as a standard deviation of one million centimeters over $\mu$ to measure the average size of a pea. Surely the size of the pea will be withing $\pm{3,000,000}cm$ of your prior estimate of 1 cm. Because the difference is a coin toss, there can be no direct comparison. You can discuss the impact of the sample space on the sampling distribution of the parameters and some estimator of the likelihood function such as its supremum.
