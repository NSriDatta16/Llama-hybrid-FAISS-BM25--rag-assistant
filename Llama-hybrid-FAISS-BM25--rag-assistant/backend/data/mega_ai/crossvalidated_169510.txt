A good description of the random forests method

Can anyone suggest a good book or article describing the random forests method of classification? I'm not satisfied with the way the subject is treated in "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R " by Tibshirani & Co and would like to have a more or less rigorous but comprehensible description.
