adding .live to click functions in jquery

We have an app that uses a lot of jquery stuff and we're adding up all our scripts in an init.js file which has a lot of .live("click"), .live("hover") etc, stuff plus some if($(".classname").length) etc. I have a suspicion it MIGHT be slowing down our pages unnecessarily(some pages don't need some scripts). But what is a more elegant solution to this? We certainly won't like a separate file for each page that needs it, that's a pain to maintain. Is there any other way to achieve this?
