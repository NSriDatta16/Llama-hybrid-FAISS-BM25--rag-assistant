C99 introduced snprintf and possibly vsnprintf as well. There are several portable open source implementations of (v)snprintf such as this one . The latter also implements vasprintf which dynamically allocates storage. Also consider the C++ Format library which provides a safe printf implementation similar to Boost Format, but much faster.
