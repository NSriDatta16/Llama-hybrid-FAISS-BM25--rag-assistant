Formulate a MDP for a problem given below

Can someone help me to formulate an MDP for the below problem ?. Problem Definition Bunny wakes up in a strange room with 2 doors; one on the left, and one on the right. In front of him is a map of the building, laying out clearly what lies behind each door. Behind one of the doors is a room with the way outside, and behind the other one a room with a hungry tiger. Bunny does not like tigers. Especially hungry ones. Consider the control problem where the current state is specified by the current room Bunny is in, and the actions Bunny can take are to move through a door to another room. Assume that there are 2 doors in the starting room, each leading to its own room, and that one of these other rooms (specifically the one on the left) has a single door that leads to the exit, while the other one (specifically the one on the right) has a tiger in it. Moreover, assume that Bunny has full knowledge of these details but that there is a 10% chance that when trying to move through one of the doors, he gets confused and goes through the other door instead. Lastly, assume that the episode does not end when Bunny enters the room with the tiger. Questions Formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the problem of con- trolling Bunnyâ€™s actions in order to avoid the tiger and exit the building. (Give the transition and reward functions in tabular format, or give the transition graph with rewards). I would like to know, is there any procedures or rules, that needs to be considered before formulating an MDP for a problem What i have done so far State A - Starting room State B - Room with an exit door State C - Room that has a tiger in it I don't know how to proceed further.
