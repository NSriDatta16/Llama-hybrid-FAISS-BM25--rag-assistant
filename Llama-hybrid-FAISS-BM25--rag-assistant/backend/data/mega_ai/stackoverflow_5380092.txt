I'd be surprised if you can find a direct comparison as they are different types of database. SQLite is an RDBMS, while terling is an object (or document) database. They are designed to work in different ways and serve different purposes. The one which is more appropriate to you will likely not be based solely on performance. Update As an RDBMS, SQLite is better suited to entities which have a relationship and or would be better off being stored in a normalised form. SQLite is cross platform and will allow you to work on multiple platforms more easily. Sterling is specifically designed to work in Silverlight/IsolatedStorage.
