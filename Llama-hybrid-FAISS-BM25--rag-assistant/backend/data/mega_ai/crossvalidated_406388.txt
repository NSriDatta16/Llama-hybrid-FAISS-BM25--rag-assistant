software for one class classification with a Bayesian Network

I'm looking for a software package that would allow to do a one class classification with a Bayesian Network (anomaly detection). I was planning to use bnlearn but so far I'm unable to find out if the library supports it. Basically all I need is to get a measure of probability of an unseen data to belong to the distribution represented by the Bayesian Network. All libraries I found so far only allow to query for some unknown variable given partial evidence. Does someone know about a library that would support such a query? (The ideal case would be one that also supports Laplace smoothing)
