How to explain the new features after a PCA?

Let's say I made a PCA in which I reduced from 10 dimensions to 3. And it clusters the classes correctly, but how do I explain which dimensions are better to predict? It is obvious that the 3 dimensions are going to predict correctly and I can order those 3 to know which one is more useful to predict, but I don't know what are those 3 dimensions, they are just new dimensions, how could I explain which original features are the best? I use scikit learn PCA btw. I'llbe gratefull if anyone can answer me.
