What is $p(y|x)$ given $X=Y+Z$, $Z$ is a standard normal, and $Y$ is a random variable

We have $X=Y+Z$ where $Z$ is a standard normal and $Y$ is a random variable with $p(y)$ as its density. $Y$ and $Z$ are independent. The conditional probability $p(x|y)$ is obvious to be $\mathcal N_x(y, 1)$ , a normal with mean y and deviation one. My question is what is $p(y|x)$ ? According to $Y=X-Z$ , $p(y|x)$ should be $\mathcal N_y(x,1)$ . According to the Bayesian equation, we have $p(y|x)=p(x|y)\times p(y)/p(x)$ , which means that $p(y|x)$ is proportional to the product of $p(x|y)$ and $p(y)$ and not necessarily a normal. Which one is correct? I tend to believe the Bayesian equation but cannot formally prove that $Y=X-Z$ does not hold.
