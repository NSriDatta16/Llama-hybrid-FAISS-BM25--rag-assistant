What you are looking for is two features: geocoding of Location data and a (Google) map display of the result. Usually Geocoding is done at node creation time, or using some kind of cron job. While map display is done on node view (teaser, full page, views, etc.). Both features should be provided by the Gmap project's modules. The OpenLayers and OpenLayers Geocoder projects should also provide them. Finally the Google Map Tool s may be a third alternative. All projects provide some kind of Views integration that allow you to build map(s) for your nodes using familiar tools. For geocoding (and storage) of the coordinates, there is also the Geo and Geocode projects. But it seems Geocode doesn't support Location fields.
