You should expose a ContentProvider . " Content providers store and retrieve data and make it accessible to all applications. They're the only way to share data across applications; there's no common storage area that all Android packages can access. " Content providers implement a common interface for querying the provider and returning results. It is not hard to implement, but maybe the official documentation is not the best to get started with it.
