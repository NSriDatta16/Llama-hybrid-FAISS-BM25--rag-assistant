Problem with Netbeans IDE when putting swing components in a jFrame

I`m making a GUI for my java program using Swing Components and Netbeans IDE. My problem is that I can't easily put the components on where ever I like in the jFrame. When I drag and drop a component on the frame, other components of the frame start changing their positions and even sizes! Have anybody else face such problem? Should I edit or configure anything? Thanks in advance
