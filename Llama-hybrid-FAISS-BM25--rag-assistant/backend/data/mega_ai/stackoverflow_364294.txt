FSAs are great data structures to understand because any chance you have to implement them, you're working at the lowest level of computational complexity on the Chomsky hierarchy. A great example is in word morphology (how parts of words come together). A lot of work has been done to show that even the most severe cases can be analyzed in this extremely fast analytical framework. Take a look at Karttunnen and Beesley's work out of PARC. FSAs are also a great place to start learning about machine learning concepts like hidden markov models, because in many ways, the problem can be broken down using the same ideas and vocabulary.
