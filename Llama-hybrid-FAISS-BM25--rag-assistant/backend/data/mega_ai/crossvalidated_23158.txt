Use of robust spread measures such median average deviation and median filters for time series

I have a time series where I need to detect gross anomalies due to coding errors, not small shifts in the structure of the series. I am interested in the most recent data points, not historical data so I don't need to filter everything. What is the best way to use moving means and averages in combination with spread estimators to find these points?
