Why Are Bell Curves Used for Performance Appraisals?

Why do organizations that stack-rank employees force-fit employee rankings to a bell curve? Is there any theoretical or emperical evidence to support a normal or near-normal distribution of performance. My personal experience, which is obviously biased, suggests that if at all there's a general trend in employee performance, it's closer to a power law distribution. Note: Asking here instead of SO Workplace because I'm looking for any kind of research: papers, books, studies on the topic.
