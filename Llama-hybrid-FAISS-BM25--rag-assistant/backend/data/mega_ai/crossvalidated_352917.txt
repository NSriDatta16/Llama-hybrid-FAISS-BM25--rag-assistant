Extracting Factor Scores of Latent Variables after CFA in AMOS

I plan to extract the latent variables' factor scores after conducting Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). I will use these factor scores as explanatory variables for my next statistical procedure - multinomial logistic regression. I learned that I can get the factor scores through data imputation (see: https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21600240 ). I was planning to use the Bartlett Method. However, the only options available in AMOS are Regression imputation, Stochastic regression imputation, and Bayesian imputation. Questions Is there a way to obtain the factor scores in AMOS by using the Bartlett method? How? If it is not possible, will the factor scores produced by the different data imputation methods vary significantly among each other? Can you please provide me with some reading materials regarding this topic?
