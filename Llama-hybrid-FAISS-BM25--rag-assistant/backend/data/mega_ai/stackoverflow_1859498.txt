To avoid drag & drop you can take a look at SqlMetal.exe . However, it sounds like you really are requesting Persistence Ignorance, and I'm not sure that this is possible with L2S - it certainly isn't possible with LINQ to Entities until .NET 4... I once wrote a blog post on using SqlMetal.exe and subsequently modifying the generated schema - perhaps you will find it useful, although it has a different underlying motivation.
