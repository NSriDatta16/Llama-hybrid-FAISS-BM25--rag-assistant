Are there any open source/free LOGO implementations that support dynaturtles?

I'm looking for an implementation of the LOGO programming language that supports 'dynaturtles' - animated turtles that can programmatically change shape, speed and direction as well as detect collisions with each other or other objects in the environment. Back in the mists of time when the earth was new and 8 bit micros ruled supreme, Atari LOGO did this famously well. One could create all sorts of small games and simulated environments using this technique very easily as that implementation of the language had a very well thought out, elegant syntax. I know about LCSI's Microworlds but I'm looking for something I can use to get some friends and their kids involved in programming without breaking my budget.
