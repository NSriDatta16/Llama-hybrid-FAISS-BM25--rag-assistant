This is screwing up because you've got: unsigned long long answer = 0; int size; and you call printf with: std::printf("current last: %d sieve size: %ld\n", answer, size); Both of your format strings are wrong: You're passing answer to printf and formatting it %d , but it should be %lld , since it's declared unsigned long long . You're passing size with %d instead of %ld . Since size is and int , it should be %d . When those args get passed to printf, it's printing the first 32 bits of answer for the first %d and the second 32 bits (or more, past the end!) of answer for the %ld . This is not what you want. If you compile with -Wall your compiler should warn you about this kind of thing. Pay very close attention to the warnings!
