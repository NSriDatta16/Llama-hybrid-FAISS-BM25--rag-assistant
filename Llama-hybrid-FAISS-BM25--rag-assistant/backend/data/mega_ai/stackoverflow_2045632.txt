News Feed Database Design Efficiency

Greetings All, I've seen similar questions asked before with no conclusive or tested answers. I'm designing a News Feed system using PHP/MySQL similar to facebooks. Seeing as this table could grow to be quite large -- any inefficiency could result in a significant bottleneck. Example Notifications: (Items in bold are linked objects) User_A and USER_B commented on User_C's new album . User_A added a new Vehicle to [his/her] garage. Initially, I implemented this using excessive columns for Obj1:Type1 | Obj2:Type2 | etc.. It works but I fear it's not nearly scalable enough, now I'm looking to object serialization. So, for example my new database is set up like so: News_ID | User_ID | News_Desc | Timestamp 2643 904 {User904} and {User890} commented on SomeTimestamp {User222}'s new {Album724}. Anything inside {'s represents data that would be serialized using JSON. Is this a smart (efficient / scalable) way to move forward? Will it be difficult to separate the serialized data from the rest of the string using regular expressions?
