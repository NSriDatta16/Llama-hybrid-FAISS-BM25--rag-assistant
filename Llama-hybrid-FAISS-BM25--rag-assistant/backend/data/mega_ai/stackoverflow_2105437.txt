Just try it out. Use firebug or a similar tool and run memcache with a bit of RAM allocation (e.g. 64mb) on the test server. Mark your average loading results seen in firebug without memcache, then turn caching on and mark new results. That's done as easy as it said. The results usually shocks people, because the perfomance raises up very nicely.
