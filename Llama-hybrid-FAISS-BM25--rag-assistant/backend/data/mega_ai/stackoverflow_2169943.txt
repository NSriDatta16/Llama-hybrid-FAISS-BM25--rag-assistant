Disclaimer : I have never worked with Perl or Python. If you are willing to "step up" from Macros and VBA to using the Visual Studio Office Tools (VSTO) which have been available in .NET for some time now, you have several powerful new options to handle Office interop : Using the COM API's as exposed via PIA's (Primary Interop Assemblies) usable from C# and other .NET languages : lots of code examples available here on SO or on CodeProject for doing all the things you describe. Suggest you search on "C# Office Interop" "C# Outlook Interop" "C# Excel Interop" "C# Office Automation." Or search on other .NET languages from VB.NET to F#. With the latest .NET tools you have UI-designers that let you create Add-Ins for Excel or Outlook, etc. I'm working on an Excel add-in in 2010 right now, and it is quite a pleasure to be able to drag and drop WinForms controls onto a WorkSheet and create event handlers, and edit properties, at design-time in the same way I would work in WinForms. Of course, 2010 beta Office has some "rough edges," as you might expect. VSTO forum on Microsoft : VSTO Forum for Office 2003, 2007 Good "portal" for Office Automation via VSTO : Getting Started (Visual Studio Tools for Office) VSTO forum on Microsoft for Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 : 2010 beta Be sure and open the drop-down panel under "Announcements" titled "Office Development with Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 Resources" Microsoft Office 2010 beta forum : Office 2010 In Visual Studio 2010 beta 2, using the Office 2010 beta, you have no less than six project types related to interop with Excel alone : Excel 2007 Add-In, Excel 2010 Add-In, Excel 2007 Template, Excel 2010 Template, Excel 2007 Workbook, Excel 2010 Workbook : For Outlook : Outlook 2007 Add-In, Outlook 2010 Add-In This SO thread Beginning VSTO ? may have some value to you, and I suggest you do searches here on SO on "VSTO Excel" and "VSTO Outlook"
