Where does the silverlight 3 toolkit MSI put the DLL files?

Just downloaded the Silverlight 3 Toolkit and executed the MSI file. Now I need to reference the Microsoft.Windows.Controls.dll file but don't know where MSI unpacked it. Can't find it at C:\ or in C:\Program Files. Where might it be? ok, this post says that all the components should be in the toolbox, e.g. DockPanel, they are for Visual Studio 2008 Professional but not for Visual Web Developer 2008 Express (it has some controls but not DockPanel for instance) Answer: Ok, the answer is: reboot and restart everything (until then Silverlight got a AG_E_PARSER_BAD_TYPE error, and brought down both Visual Studio versions and Firefox). After restarting everything, it works fine: the controls are automatically in the toolbox so you just have to drag them in, no need referencing the dll anymore as in Silverlight 2 .
