Start at Wikipedia: git . Basically version control systems help you manage and organise software projects, by tracking the various files. They allow you to "step backwards in time" and retreive on-demand any older version of a file, create multiple parallel "branches" for things like bug fixing, feature development, and so on. They're awesome, and git seems to be an awesome example of a version control system.
