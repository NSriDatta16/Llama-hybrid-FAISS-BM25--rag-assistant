I would say that a freeware JNLP application is pretty much the opposite of what Linux distributions would tend to include. Firstly, JNLP will not work with the native package management solution. If you wanted to get an application included in a distribution it would need to be package in the native format and updated in the standard way. Secondly, most distributions will favour open source packages and many will not include non open source packages in their default repositories. Some distributions may have specical non-free repositories. Up until OpenJDK you may not even Java itself would be in these repositories. In my opinion you would be better trying to build a user base on your own as you then have complete control over releases etc.
