How to elegantly group subjects?

I want to conduct an experiment to find out whether the CO2-production of soil changes with high amounts of rainfall. Therefore, I want to group 8 soil samples into two different groups. One group is control, one group is treatment. Due to time, space and money restrictions, I can only have four replicates for each group. I have some pre-experiment CO2-production rates of these 8 samples that I would like to use to group the subjects. The two groups should be as similar as possible before the treatment starts (equal mean and variance). How can I programmatically determine the "best" division into groups? Data of pre-test CO2 production are below. Any direct help or linkage to other websites/posts is greatly appreciated. Please let me know if and how I can improve the question. Some google-fu was to no avail. #### Data: y1-y8 are the soil samples, the values are CO2 procution rates y1
