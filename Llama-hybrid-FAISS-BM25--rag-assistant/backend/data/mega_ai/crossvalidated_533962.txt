The score may improve as you add more data, especially if it's not overfitting in the first place. In terms of overfitting, the final accuracies at the right end of the curves of the first two plots are quite close for test and training sets. I don't see a strong (or even weak) signal of overfitting in Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models. The Random Forest needs some attention since the performances are not that close for the two sets. Apart from everything, I'd also advise you to review this when considering performance metrics.
