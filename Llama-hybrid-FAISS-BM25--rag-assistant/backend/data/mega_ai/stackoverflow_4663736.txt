Java webstart heap dump

I have been trying to get webstart to dump to a heap dump when it runs out of memory. I know the jmap/jconsole way of doing it, but what I really want to do is add the option to jnlp file and have tried the following options. j2se version="1.6+" java-vm-args="-server +HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError" max-heap-size="768M" j2se version="1.6+" java-vm-args="-server -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError" max-heap-size="768M"
