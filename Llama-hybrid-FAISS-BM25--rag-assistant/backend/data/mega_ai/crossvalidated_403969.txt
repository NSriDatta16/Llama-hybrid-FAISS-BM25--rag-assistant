Are there any other image classification methods besides using neural networks?

When reading about image classification, the only occurring terms are "neural networks", "deep learning" and "CNN". It seems like there are no other methods for this task. I have worked with neural networks and see why it works so well, but I am just curious whether there are other methods used for this task as well? Are there any other (efficient) methods for image classification besides using neural networks?
