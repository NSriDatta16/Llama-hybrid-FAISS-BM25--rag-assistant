You've just described the matrix factorization model, which works well. In fact, it even works without explicit features; i.e., any properties of the items. But you can introduce prior information by augmenting the feature vectors, e.g., with the document embedding, as you describe. I do not see any reason why it should not work, esp. since I've seen it done.
