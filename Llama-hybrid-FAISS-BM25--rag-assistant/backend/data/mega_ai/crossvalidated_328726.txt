1) Yes. Both forms always admit a solution, but it's not necessarily unique. The constrained form (your second formulation) is a bit easier to analyze. As you note, the constraint set $\mathcal{C} = \{x : \|x\|_0 \leq K\}$ is not bounded, so it's not entirely obvious that there will be a minimum. (More precisely, it's not compact so we don't get the usual "easy" guarantees that a minimum exists and is obtained.) However, in this case, we can guarantee that a solution exists just by considering the problem directly. The 'trick' is in the structure of the constraint set. Note that it can be written as the union of simpler sets - for example, if $K = 4$, then $\begin{aligned}\{x: \|x\|_0 \leq K\} =&\phantom{\cup+}\{x: (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in \mathbb{R}, (x_5, \dots, x_n) = 0 \} \\ &\cup \{x: (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_5) \in \mathbb{R}, (x_4, x_6, \dots, x_n) = 0 \} \\ &\cup \{x: (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_6) \in \mathbb{R}, (x_4, x_5, x_7, \dots, x_n) = 0 \} \\ &\cup \dots\ \\ =&\bigcup_{S \text{ is a set of 4 integers $\leq N$}} \underbrace{\{x: x_i = 0 \quad \forall i \notin S\}}_{\mathcal{C}_S}\end{aligned} $ This is a union over a finite set of convex sets, so we can solve the original problem by simply solving $\min_{x \in \mathcal{C}_i} \|Ax - b\|_2^2$ and then taking the minimum over all the solutions and using that as our global solution. In symbols: $\begin{aligned} \min_{x \in \mathcal{C}} \|Ax-b\|_2^2 = \min_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \min_{x \in S} \|Ax-b\|_2^2\end{aligned}$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of (distinct) $K$-tuples. A bit less formally, we can always solve the $K$-sparse problem, by finding the best possible solution for every sets of at most $K$ columns of $A$ and then just taking the 'best of the best' as our global solution. This 'brute force' approach is slow when $K$ is bigger than 2 or 3 (since we have to solve $\sum_{i=0}^K \binom{n}{i}$ OLS problems), but if you're clever and have a big computer and some time to burn, it's doable up to $n \approx 1000$. [1] gives the gory details and [2] provides an R package implementing the approach in [1]. If $K$ is large or if there is redundancy among columns of $A$ (the formal condition is $\text{rank}(A) 2) No. They aren't quite equivalent, but it is true that if you have a solution to (1) for a given $\lambda$, you can pick a $K$ such that it is a solution to (2). You can't always find $K$ such that a solution to (1) that matches a given solution to (2) however. This phenomenon is noted in Section 1.3 of [3], but it's not discussed at length. [1] D.
