I assume that you'd like to fit a four parameter logistic model extended to multiple independent variables. I think this essentially means that you'd like to do a logistic regression with a floor and ceiling. 4PL: $$y = d + \frac{a-d}{1 + (\frac{x}{c})^b}$$ In this context, each of the parameters has a specific interpretation. It doesn't exactly work when you add more independent variables. I couldn't find any specific references on how to extend the 4PL, so this is how I would accomplish your goal: Typical Logistic Regression: $$ln\left(\frac{y}{1-y}\right) = X\beta$$ $$y = \frac{e^{X\beta}}{1+e^{X\beta}}$$ Logistic Regression with a floor and ceiling: $$y = a + (d - a)\frac{e^{X\beta}}{1+e^{X\beta}}$$ You can fit this with a non-linear least squares approach: set.seed(25401) # Simulate Data f $Forest500, X$ km, 0.2, 0.75) + rnorm(nrow(X), 0, 0.01) min(Patch_Richness) max(Patch_Richness) plot(X $Forest500, Patch_Richness) plot(X$ km, Patch_Richness) nls(Patch_Richness ~ a + (d - a) * exp(beta0 + beta1 * Forest500 + beta2 * km) / (1 + exp(beta0 + beta1 * Forest500 + beta2 * km)), data = X, start = list(a = 0.1, d = 0.9, beta0 = 0.1, beta1 = 0.1, beta2 = 0.1)) ```
