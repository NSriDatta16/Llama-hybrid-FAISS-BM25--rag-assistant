Given the assumption that all observations are independent, that is within the subjects and between the subjects, then a simple t-test can be used to solve this - assuming all the assumptions of the t-test are valid (your data is not really continuous so they might not hold, but it might be a good approximation). Otherwise an equivalent non-parametric test might work better. Your goal is to determine whether test A is harder than test B, or to put it differently if the frequency of test A is higher than that of test B. Given that you only have aggregated data, the results are interpreted on the frequencies of students which passed, rather than say the average score. So for ex. you might find that the expected frequency for test A is 67, while the expected frequency for test B is 54. If the standard error is small enough you would find that the difference is statistically significant. If, however, there is a relation between the exams, then you can use a paired t-test. If there is a relation within the students, then a linear mixed model can be used.
