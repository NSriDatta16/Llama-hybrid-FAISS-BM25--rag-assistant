"Anyway, I have noticed that the messages never get deleted, our client definately never explictly deletes them, and I can look in computer management and see the messages back to when the server was last rebooted." Sounds like the messages are Express if there are none around from before the last reboot. Express messages are only stored in RAM and not persisted to disk so restarting the MSMQ service will destroy them. This is probably why the volume of messages has never reached a critical level. As MSMQ uses kernel memory and disk space for memory storage, eventually one of the two would give out and cause you server stablity issues so your plan to have a cleanup process is a good one.
