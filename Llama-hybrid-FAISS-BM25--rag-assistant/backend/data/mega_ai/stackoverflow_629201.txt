don't use any modal plugins, create your own. modal { position: absolute; top: 200px; left: 200px; z-index: 12; width: 200px; height: 100px; background: red; color: blue; } Then you can have some javascript on it, I recommend jquery's draggable, and then put some element that you can click on it so it disappears. Voil√†!!!
