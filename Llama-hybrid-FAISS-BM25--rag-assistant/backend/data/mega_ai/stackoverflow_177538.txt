Any chances to imitate times() Ruby method in C#?

Every time I need to do something N times inside an algorithm using C# I write this code for (int i = 0; i Studying Ruby I have learned about method times() which can be used with the same semantics like this N.times do ... end Code fragment in C# looks more complex and we should declare useless variable i . I tried to write extension method which returns IEnumerable , but I am not satisfied with the result because again I have to declare a cycle variable i . public static class IntExtender { public static IEnumerable Times(this int times) { for (int i = 0; i Is it possible using some new C# 3.0 language features to make N times cycle more elegant?
