Demos, samples and proof-of-concept code in D

I've been looking at the D programming language recently and I'm curious if there are any demos, sample applications, or proof-of-concept code written in it. I want some code that demonstrates situations where D is particularly elegant or advantageous. There's dsource.org of course, but the projects hosted there are full-on applications. I'm looking for more "documentation-like" examples.
