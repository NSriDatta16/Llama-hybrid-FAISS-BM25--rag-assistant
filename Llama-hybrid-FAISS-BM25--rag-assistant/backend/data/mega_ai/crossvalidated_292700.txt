Overfitting in neural network

I am a newbie to neural network. i am using TensorFlow + Keras to model my neural network for classification of 12 logos. The model has 5 convolution layers. I have trained a neural network model and got the following results. with training, loss = 0.0877 accuracy = 0.9780 with test data loss = 0.0976 accuracy = 0.9646 Is this model good or does it overfits the data? And how can i find out whether the model overfits the data or not? after some help from replies i managed to draw two graphs from tensorboard data. and what funny is that, val_acc is higher than training_acc val_loss is lower than training_loss
