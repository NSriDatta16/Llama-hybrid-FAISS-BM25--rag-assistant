The "direct replication" you mention is an issue; whatever parameter is being assessed in Study A is also there in Study B, so it makes no sense to say an effect is e.g. positive in one and negative in the other, or zero in one and not the other, or whatever - meaning non-replication can not happen in Bayesian analyses, because of coherence. Of course, if you are not in the situation where both studies have already been conducted (and most people planning replication are not) then it's perfectly possible to have a decision based on Study A's data be later contradicted by Study B, and this is true whether one is Bayesian or not. Also, with different parameters in Study A and Study B, Bayesians can easily end up concluding that they differ, even if the prior information pointed elsewhere.
