This is a convention defined in RFC 2045 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies . Private [subtype] values (starting with "X-") may be defined bilaterally between two cooperating agents without outside registration or standardization. Such values cannot be registered or standardized. New standard values should be registered with IANA as described in RFC 2048 . A similar restriction applies to the top-level type. From the same source, If another top-level type is to be used for any reason, it must be given a name starting with "X-" to indicate its non-standard status and to avoid a potential conflict with a future official name. (Note that per RFC 2045, "[m]atching of media type and subtype is ALWAYS case-insensitive", so there's no difference between the interpretation of 'X-' and 'x-'.) So it's fair to guess that "application/x-foo" was used before the IANA defined "application/foo". And it still might be used by folks who aren't aware of the IANA token assignment. As Chris Hanson said MIME types are controlled by the IANA. This is detailed in RFC 2048 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures . According to RFC 3778 , which is cited by the IANA as the definition for "application/pdf", The application/pdf media type was first registered in 1993 by Paul Lindner for use by the gopher protocol; the registration was subsequently updated in 1994 by Steve Zilles. The type "application/pdf" has been around for well over a decade. So it seems to me that wherever "application/x-pdf" has been used in new apps, the decision may not have been deliberate.
