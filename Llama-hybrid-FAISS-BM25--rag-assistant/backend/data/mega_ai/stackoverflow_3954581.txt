When you have to store huge loads of data and mantain accessibility, sometimes the most useful solution is to use data store and management system like database. Database (MySQL for example) can store a lots of typical data types and of course binary data too. Maybe you can store your object to database (directly or by programming business object model) and get it when you need to. This solution sometimes can solve many problems with data managing (moving, backup, searching, updating...), and storage (data layer) - and it's location independent - mayby this point of view can help you.
