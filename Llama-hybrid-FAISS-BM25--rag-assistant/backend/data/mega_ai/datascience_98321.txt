I guess there is no universal solution for that. But I can explain my roadmap as NLP scientist. Firstly, I try to find the most common dataset for my task (NER in your case). Then, I search for the leaderboard which shows the best papers/models for that dataset. Finally, I try to figure out which makes their models best in the leaderboard. For example, here is the text summarization leaderboard: http://nlpprogress.com/english/summarization.html I hope it is helpful for you.
