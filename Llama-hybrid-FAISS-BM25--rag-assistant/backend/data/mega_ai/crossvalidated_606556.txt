How to calculate avg # of inputs needed for an outcome if different outcomes change the probability?

I'm not sure if I worded the question well or not, but here's my situation. I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the average number of instances needed to reach state 3, starting at state 0. State 0 65% chance of staying at state 0 15.75% chance of moving to state 1 10.5% chance of moving to state 2 8.75% chance of moving to state 3 State 1 65% chance of staying at state 1 26.25% chance of moving to state 2 8.75% chance of moving to state 3 State 2 65% chance of staying at state 2 35% chance of moving to state 3 I'm using this for a random chance to get different tiers of treasure upon clearing a level, and I want to make sure that you don't have to clear levels a ridiculous number of times, and avoid frustration from getting a treasure worse or equal to what you already have. I tried to find a calculator or simulator for this, but I can't find anything anywhere, and I don't know how to calculate this myself. Thank you!
