In clojure, is (= 'a 'a) referring to the 'same atom'?

In some implementations of Common LISP we can say that for the following expression (eq 'a 'a) Is true because 'a and 'a are the "same atom". This may be implementation dependent, but it seems the phrase (used in a popular LISP teaching book) assumes that atoms of the same value are stored in the same location in memory. In Java, two interned strings of the same value are stored in the same location in memory. Now Clojure on the JVM inherits Java's legacy, but is it true to say that two atoms in Clojure (on JVM) having the same value are the same atom? (ie how does Clojure's atom storage mechanism work?)
