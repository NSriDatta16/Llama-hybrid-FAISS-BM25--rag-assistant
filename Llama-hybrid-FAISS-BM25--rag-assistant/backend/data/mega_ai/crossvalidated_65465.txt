A time series model is usually used when the data used are ordered after then the observation occured. The most common time series models regress on their own previous values (autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA)) or previous value of itself and previous values of other time series variables (vector autoregression (VAR)). Time series model work in the same way any other regression work, when there is a relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. But there are some point to what you are saying, I think you will find it interesting to look up 'the Lucas Critique'.
