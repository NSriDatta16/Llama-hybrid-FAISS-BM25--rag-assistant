How to check if a value in a time series is significantly different from other values?

I have a time series containing n values (numbers) $t = v1, v2, v3... vn$. For example, the time series could be: $50,6,7,8,90,10,25$ For a value $v_i$ ($1 \leq v_i \leq n$) from the time series, I would like to know if that value is significantly greater than the other values in the time series. For example, is the value 90 significantly greater than the other values? I have thought about a simple solution which is to check if the value v_i is greater than the sum of the average plus the standard deviation. This solution tell me that a value is quite large compare to the other values. But it does not tell me if this is statistically significant. Thus, my question is which statistical tests or statistical method could be used to determine if a value is significantly greater than other values?
