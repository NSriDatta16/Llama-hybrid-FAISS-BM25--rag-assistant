OK -- There are a few things going on here: 1) You mention that the Tomcat server is pre-installed on the machine, but yet you have the directory specified in your target directory. This is not a good idea as that will get wiped out after a mvn clean . 2) For pre-installed Tomcat you are not setting the type to existing inside the deployer configuration. 3) Where is your context definition? Do you have a context fragment file or are you using a tomcat.xml file inside the WEB-INF directory in the WAR? Bottom line a combination of configuration errors are holding you back. Post an updated Maven configuration and addition details about the XML context definition and I can help you further.
