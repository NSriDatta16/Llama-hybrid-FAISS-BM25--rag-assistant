Appropriate problems for different type of ML classifiers

I have learned several classifiers in Machine learning - Decision tree, Neural network, SVM, Bayesian classifier, K-NN, Markov process...etc. Can anyone please help to understand when I should prefer one of the classifier over other - for example - in which situation(nature of data sets, etc) I should prefer decision tree over neural net OR which situation SVM might work better than Bayesian OR what types of problems are appropriate to apply decision tree, neural net, k-nn, markov processs or SVM or bayesian ?? Thanks.
