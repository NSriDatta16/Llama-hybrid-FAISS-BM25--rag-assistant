If you have your relationship set up correctly there should be accessors for the object: $user->getAgenciesAndUsers(); There shouldnt be a reason to query the AgenciesAndUsers separately. In fact if you use a JOIN in your query you should only need to hit the DB once. Also if you havent gone to far with this i would rename everything to it is singular ie. AgencyAndUser (or more rightly UserAgency ), and User .
