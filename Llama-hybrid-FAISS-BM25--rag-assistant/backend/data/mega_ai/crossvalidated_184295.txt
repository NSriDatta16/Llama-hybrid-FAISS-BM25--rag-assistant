meaning of 'Monte Carlo' in this sentence

This is from a paper 'Algorithms for Inverse Reinforcement Learning' by Ng, Russell (2001) We assume that we have the ability to simulate trajectories in the MDP (from the initial state $s_0$) under the optimal policy, or under any policy of our choice. For each policy $\pi$ that we will consider (including the optimal one), we will need a way of estimating $V^{\pi}(s_0)$ for any setting of the $\alpha_i$'s. To do this, we first execute $m$ $\underline{\text{Monte Carlo}}$ trajectories under $\pi$. Sorry for the long quote. What is the meaning of 'Monte Carlo' in the last sentence? My first thought would be to just run the simulation again and again $m$ times. But rethinking it, I might be very wrong.
