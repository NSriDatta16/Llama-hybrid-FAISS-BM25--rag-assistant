Slow SQLite access on iPhone

I have a quite slow data retrieval from a sqlite database on my iPhone and perhaps someone have an alternative idea to explain this. From what I tracked down so far sqlite3_step(statement) is sometimes unusually slow. While retrieving e.g. 50 rows from the database to execute this step takes normally some milliseconds but sometimes it takes several seconds. My database is not small (80MB) and my theory is that the reason is paging. But can someone else think of an other reason for this?
