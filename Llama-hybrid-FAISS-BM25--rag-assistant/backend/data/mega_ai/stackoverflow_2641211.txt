emacs: interactively search open buffers

Is there a way to search all the open buffers for a particular pattern? C-s interactively searches current buffer. Similarly, is there something that searches all the open buffers? I know I can use "occur", but "Occur" brings a new buffer and changes/messes with the buffer organization.
