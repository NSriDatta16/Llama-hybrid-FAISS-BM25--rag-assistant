In principle, you are right to worry that the response is bounded. In practice, with this kind of data, you are unlikely to get predictions beyond the observed range of the data. This won't be your fault, but just the effect of the high degree of unpredictability with firm-level data. Put it this way: The worst you can get is that no predictors really help, in which case the model will predict the average rank for every firm, at least to a good first approximation. In practice, you hope you can do better, but there is little reason to expect that predictions will be outside the observed range. (Or is there?) But why predict rank at all? Why not try to predict some performance measure, and then rank the predictions, and then compare with the expert's ranks? That sounds much less problematic.
