Check the related question asking about logistic regression . The quotes you posted sound confusing, but what they are saying is that $Y_1,Y_2,\dots,Y_n$ are independent, but not identically distributed, since they have different means $$ Y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2) $$ where $\mu_i$ is defined in terms of functional relationship $\mu_i = \alpha + \beta X_i$, what is equivalent of saying that $$ \begin{align} \varepsilon_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \\ Y_i &= \alpha + \beta X_i + \varepsilon_i \end{align} $$ so $Y_1,Y_2,\dots,Y_n$ are random samples, but they are not i.i.d. Since they are random variables, we can define a likelihood function for the model describing their joint distribution $$ L(\alpha,\beta,\sigma^2 \mid Y) = \prod_{i=1}^n \mathcal{N}(y_i; \alpha + \beta x_i, \; \sigma^2) $$ so we can estimate the parameters based on it (using MLE , or Bayesian estimation). You can also check the answers and comments in this thread for extended discussion and this thread for more formal discussion of somehow similar question.
