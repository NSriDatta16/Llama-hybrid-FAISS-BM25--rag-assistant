Yes. Microsoft discusses the SortedDictionary here . A couple quotes from that page that indicate that sorting is taking place automatically: "The SortedDictionary )>) generic class is a binary search tree with O(log n) retrieval, where n is the number of elements in the dictionary." O(log n) lookup indicates (typically) that we're in some tree looking for a match via a binary search. and "SortedDictionary )>) has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data: O(log n) as opposed to O(n) for SortedList )>)." Again, O(log n) for the insertion, since it has to iterate through the structure to find the insertion point. Good fun.
