Capturing network traffic on Linux

Question: I have one Windows laptop, one Linux laptop and a wireless router. Now I want to "investigate" the hotmail/windows live protocol. What I want to do is route network traffic from the windows laptop via ethernet to the linux laptop, capture it on the Linux computer, forward it wirelessly to the router, receive the hotmail response from the router on the linux computer and forward it to the windows computer. How do I do that? In essence, switching the Linux laptop between the Windows laptop and the router, to capture network traffic ? Which program is best for capturing/analysing ? Please note that for whatever reason, packet capturing with winpcap on the windows computer doesn't work...
