where is evaluated before the columns are. Therefore, when where is evaluated, there doesn't exist a status column. You will have to put your case statement or conditions in the where clause: where CASE WHEN date_due = 0 AND date_sent = 0 THEN "opened" WHEN date_sent > 0 AND (CURRENT_DATE - date_due) More pragmatically, though, you'll want to do this: where date_sent > 0 and (CURRENT_DATE - date_due) The only clause that can use aliased column names is the order by clause (across databases--some DB's, like MySQL, allow you to use them in group by ).
