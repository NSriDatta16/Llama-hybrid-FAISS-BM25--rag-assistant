How to make Bayesian-style inference for a Poisson process?

I am working on a fleet management software recently. Normally, the arrival of merchant request is a Poisson process. That is to say, on average we have a new merchant request every 10 minutes, but sometimes we could have 2 merchant requests coming within 10 minutes, sometimes only 0. I am thinking about building an inference model based on the arrival rates of the merchant requests: if they keep coming within short interval, that means the zip-code is busy, if they keep coming within long interval, that means the zip-code is not busy. This looks like Bayesian inference from my perspective: $$p(\text{isBusy}|\text{observedInterval}) = \frac{p(\text{observedInterval}|\text{isBusy})\cdotp(\text{isBusy})}{p(\text{observedInterval})}$$ However, $p(\text{observedInterval}|\text{isBusy})$ is a Poisson process as I described above. So I am not sure if this can really be modeled in a Bayesian fashion. Can anyone give me any insight here?
