Bayesian Regression Estimates

Hi I am new to Bayesian Regression, I wanted to understand why would the Bayesian regression give exactly the same results as the priors supplied? I tried running a bayesian model on 10% of the data without using priors, and the resulting betas I got, I used as prior for the rest of the data(20% from remaining data). However, I am getting the same betas as prior on rest of the data as well. Below is the function I am using: bmod1 prior1 Here rawdb3 is the latter 20% data and the prior values are based on the results from bmod1. However, the results from bmod2 are just same as bmod1. I am really confused here, it would be very helpful if someone could help me. Thanks in advance.
