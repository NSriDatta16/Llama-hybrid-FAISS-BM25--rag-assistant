Double-quoted strings are more elegant because you don't have to break up your string every time you need to insert a variable (like you must do with single-quoted strings). However, if you need to insert the return value of a function, this cannot be inserted into a double-quoted string--even if you surround it with braces! //syntax error!! //$s = "Hello {trim($world)}!" //the only option $s = "Hello " . trim($world) . "!";
