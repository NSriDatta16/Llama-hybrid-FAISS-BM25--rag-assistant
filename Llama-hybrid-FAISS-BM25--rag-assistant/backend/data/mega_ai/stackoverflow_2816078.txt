Does it make sense to fragment cache static partials

I have my views and layouts split into multiple partials, some of them are static partials i.e, no data from the database being displayed here. Does it make sense to cache these to prevent the erb templating system from generating the html each time or it only makes sense to cache in situations where something needs to be retrieved from the db each time. thanks, ash
