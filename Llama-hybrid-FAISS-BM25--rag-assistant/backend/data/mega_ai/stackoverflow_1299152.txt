Problem with Master pages event order

I have a simple setup with the master page housing some controls used by all child pages. I found when moving to new pages the master page page loads event fires as a non post back and read the solution was to store it's current values somewhere for retrieval. Ok all done. The child page uses these values to run a report. When I switch to a new report, all is well. If I change the values in the master page the master page and the sub page load events fire. The load event for the sub page fires first, picks up the values from the master page which are still the old values and then finally the master page events fire and all the new values are stored. The report hasn't changed as it still ran from the old values. I can't really see a way around this. All you ever hear is that master pages are a saving grace but I swear i've never jumped through so many hoops to get a page to load correctly. And now this! Anyone see a plan to resolve it?
