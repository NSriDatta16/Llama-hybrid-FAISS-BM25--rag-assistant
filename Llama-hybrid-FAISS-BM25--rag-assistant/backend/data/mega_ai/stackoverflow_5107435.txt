Updating Reef parts on the fly

I'm starting to dig into Reef and I'm stumbling upon something I really don't know how to solve... I have a RETextField and a REButton, and I want the text field's contents to get updated when the button is pressed, so here's what I'm trying: initializeContents self add: ((RETextField new) id: 'myTextField'; on: #textFieldContents of: self). self add: ((REButton new) label: 'Try me!'; callback: [ self triggerThenDo: [ textFieldContents := textFieldContents , ' and something else']). This doesn't work, as I should tell the text field to get updated, so I tried: initializeContents self add: ((RETextField new) id: 'myTextField'; on: #textFieldContents of: self). self add: ((REButton new) label: 'Try me!'; callback: [ self triggerThenDo: [ textFieldContents := textFieldContents , ' and something else'. (self canvas jQuery: '#myTextField') load html: [ :h | h text: textFieldContents ] ] ]) But it didn't work either... also tried self canvas jQuery ajax script: etc. without luck. I'm guessing Reef has its own elegant way of doing this, but I can't find it anywhere... someone? :)
