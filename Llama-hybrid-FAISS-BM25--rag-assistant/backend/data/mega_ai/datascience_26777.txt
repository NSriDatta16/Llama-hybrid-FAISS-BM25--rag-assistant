Can you tell by an accuracy score? A general notion of gauging an overfit or an underfit is via validation curves . How can we do this? Not just a decision tree, (almost) every ML algorithm is prone to overfitting. One needs to pay special attention to the parameters of the algorithms in sklearn(or any ML library) to understand how each of them could contribute to overfitting, like in case of decision trees it can be the depth, the number of leaves, etc. I am aware that using random forests may prevent it Just a pointer that the concept of ensembling helps with better generalization of the model (which helps keep overfit in check).
