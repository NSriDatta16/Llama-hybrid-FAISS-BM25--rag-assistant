A tough situation. Factors 6, 4, and 7 seem fairly robustly measured, but not the others, and I bet internal consistency is going to be low for factors 1, 3, and 5. Is it at all possible to assess reliability through some other method, such as interrater rel.? Or to assess validity through some other method than construct validity via factor analysis? Even if different scales (or individual items) get validated in different ways--sometimes you need to take whatever you can. At any rate, I could see using v6 and v17 individually. Why force them into some multi-item scale when the loadings and correlations look like this. And even given what I said above about coverage implying validity, I agree that you want to keep your eventual regression predictors pretty much unidimensional--especially since you have a large number of predictors, as with multidimensional variables the waters will get very, very muddy. This is particularly relevant since you seem to be adopting much more of an explanatory than a purely predictive mode (you care about causality).
