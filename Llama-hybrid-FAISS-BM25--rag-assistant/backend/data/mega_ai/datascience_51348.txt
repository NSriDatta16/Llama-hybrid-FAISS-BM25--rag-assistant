Splitting train/test sets by an identifier?

I know sklearn has train_test_split() to split a train and test set. But I read that, even with setting a random seed, if your actual dataset is updated regularly, the random seed will reset with each updated dataset and take a different train/test split. Doing this, your ML algos will eventually cover the whole dataset, defeating the purpose of the train/test split because it'll eventually train on too much of the whole dataset over time. The book I'm reading (Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow) gives this code to split train/test by id: # Function to check test set's identifier. def test_set_check(identifier, test_ratio): return crc32(np.int64(identifier)) & 0xffffffff And it says when there's no ID column given, to create one either by indexing the rows or creating a unique index from one of the variables. My questions are: What is the 3rd line doing: crc32(np.int64(identifier)) & 0xffffffff What is the anonymous function doing in the 2nd to last line? lambda id_: test_set_check(id_, test_ratio) In practice, do you commonly split datasets by id in this manner? Thanks, Greg
