There has, as you suggest, been quite a lot of discussion in various communities surrounding this point. The crux of the problem is that when you have a relatively rare event (the probability that even the most murderous person commits a murder on a given day has to be quite small- naively, for someone who commits murders on 36 days a year, it would be only ~.1 for a given day) evaluating the value of that prediction presents significant challenges. A correct prediction that the probability is .1 still only results in a 10 percent chance of the event occuring. Luckily, there are many branches of inquiry which concentrate on rare events. Meterology, for example, consists almost entirely of predicting relatively rare events. In this paper (1) , Marzban evaluates several metrics for evaluating models similarly in terms of the propensity of those metrics to induce the forecaster to over- or underestimate the likelihood of a given rare event. While there are many specific model variations that are discussed in more detail in the paper, the general approaches are: Some combination of the false alarm rate ( 0 results classified as 1 predictions) and the probability of detection ( 1 results classified as 0 predictions) Critical Success Index Skill scores Custom angle metrics (Marzban 754-55) The general results we see for a model is that some models encourage over-predicting the rare event in question and some encourage under-predicting the event. In this case, the police chief would want to make a decision on which metric to employ to evaluate the results of the statistician's model informed by the way in which the prediction would be used. If it was, as you mention, in Minority Report , going to be used to preemtively imprison people, presumably we would want to encourage the statistician to under-predict the rare events (or, in a more authoritarian state, over-predict them into near-oblivion).
