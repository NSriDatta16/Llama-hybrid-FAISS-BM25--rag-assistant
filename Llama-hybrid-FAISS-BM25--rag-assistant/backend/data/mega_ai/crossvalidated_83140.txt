LibSVM weights of support vectors

I am using LibSVM classifier in my Java code and I am getting correct results as I verified that with weka GUI, however, when I want to get the weights of the support vectors, I get an empty string. This is a snapshot of my code: LibSVM svm = new LibSVM(); svm.buildClassifier(train_data); Evaluation evaluation = null; evaluation = new Evaluation (train_data); evaluation.crossValidateModel(svm, train_data, 10, new Random(1)); System.out.println("weights = "+ svm.getWeights()); So, I am wondering if there is any missing step that I should do in using the LibSVM so that I get the weights? Thanks for your help.
