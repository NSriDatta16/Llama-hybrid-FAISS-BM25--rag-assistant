In contemporary usage the p-value refers to the cumulative probability of the data given the null hypothesis being at or greater than some threshold. I.e. $P(D|H_0)\le\alpha$. I think that $H_0$ tends to be a hypothesis of 'no effect' usually proxied by a comparison to the probability to a satisfactorily unlikely random result in some number of trials. Dependent on the field it varies from 5% down to 0.1% or less. However, $H_0$ does not have to be a comparison to random. It implies that 1/20 results may reject the null when they should not have. If science based it's conclusion on single experiments then the statement would be defensible. Otherwise, if experiments were repeatable it would imply that 19/20 would not be rejected. The moral of the story is that experiments should be repeatable. Science is a tradition grounded in "objectivity" so "objective probability" naturally appeals. Recall that experiments are suppose to demonstrate a high degree of control often employing block design and randomisation to control for factors outside of study. Thus, comparison to random does make sense because all other factors are supposed to be controlled for except for the ones under study. These techniques were highly successful in agriculture and industry prior to being ported to science. I'm not sure if a lack of information was ever really the problem. It's notable that for many in the non-mathematical sciences that statistics is just a box to tick. I'd suggest a general read about decision theory which unites the two frameworks. It simply comes down to using as much information as you have. Frequentist statistics assume parameters in models have unknown values from fixed distributions. Bayesians assume parameters in models come from distributions conditioned by what we know. If there is enough information to form a prior and enough information to update it to an accurate posterior then that's great. If there isn't then you may end up with worse results.
