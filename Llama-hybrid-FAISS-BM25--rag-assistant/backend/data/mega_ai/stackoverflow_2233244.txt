I would feel like something had gone really badly wrong if I had to serve up more than one version of any given library site-wide. So far I've been successful in avoiding that, even for a very (VERY) large web application. When it's time to upgrade, you upgrade. When it's not, you stick with a back-rev library. That's the way things work in general in any professional software project I'm familiar with. I'm sure there are exceptions, but I would say that keeping and serving multiple copies/versions is never a desirable situation. [edit] by the way this really isn't that different from similar issues with multi-component server-side systems, or old-school client-server systems. [another edit] Note that your clients will have to maintain separate copies of your library in their browser caches, and as they hop from page to page they'll be pulling down new copies all the time when they visit after a long absence (and the cache is old, in other words). With just one copy, they only have to download it at most once per visit, and it's even better if you leverage something like Google for jQuery, or whatever.
