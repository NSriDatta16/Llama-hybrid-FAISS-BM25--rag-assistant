The UIPanGestureRecognizer will continue to call its action methods whenever the finger moves. You use the state to determine how to change the current view. This code sample assumes that the view's view controller handles the gesture. - (void)handlePanGesture:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)panGesture //Your action method { switch(panGesture.state) { case UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged: CGPoint translation = [panGesture translationInView:self.view]; // Rotate the globe by the amount in translation // Fall through to began so that the next call is relative to this one case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan: [panGesture setTranslation:CGPointZero inView:self.view]; break; case UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded: CGPoint velocity = [panGesture velocityInView:self.view]; // The user lifted their fingers. Optionally use the velocity to continue rotating the globe automatically break; default: // Something else happened. Do any cleanup you need to. } }
