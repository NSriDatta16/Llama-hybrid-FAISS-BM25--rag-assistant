Why do we need to scale the variables in a Bayesian model?

In a Bayesian MMM model using pymc3 the variables are scaled. It is said that scaling helps in improving the efficiency of the MCMC algorithm. Also, it is stated that setting priors for the non-scaled data becomes difficult. What is the intuition behind these claims? Why do we need to scale the variables in the data set for the Bayesian model ?
