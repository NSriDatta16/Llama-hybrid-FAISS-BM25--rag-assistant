Batch Normalization and Input Normalization in CNN

I build my CNN on Keras, normally in the ImageDataGenerator I saw the rescale = 1. / 255 used to normalize input data (pixel value) from [0-255] to [0-1]. Then I read about Batch Normalization Layer, I wonder if they are mutually-exclusive or can they be used together in the same network? I have tried to adapted the BN Layer to my network (BN after every activation Layer) but the loss fluctuates more than without using BN.
