Well the example at Infragistics definitly shows that the control was built to be reused like this. They aren't using a Repeater of course but it all works the same in the end. I would look into how the UltraGridColumn is working with the WebDateChooser to display the dropdown. Of course, this won't help with the more general problem. For that I would do as the others say and create one control and use javascript to display it where it is needed, when it is needed. If you really don't want to write any javascript yourself you can take advantage of the toolkits. You could create an instance of whatever calendar (not the dropdown version) and use the AjaxControlToolkit's modalpopup, Infragistic's WebDialogWindow or something similar (perhaps with less dialogy more floaty) to display it. In the end all the options have one thing in common. They create a single calendar outside of the repeater and display that instance of the calendar on demand.
