I use time series for projecting future results. Primarily exponential smoothing models. I was manually modifying future projections to deal with covid, but I found these models have already adjusted for the unusual data (better than my modifications anyhow). One suggestion is to use data you think would have been the correct numbers without the intervention (the COVID impact). I don't think there is any agreed on solution, however, partially because time series is more ad hoc than theoretical anyhow in practice. One possibility is to predict the next six months with various methods and see what works. Of course the problem is that the impact of covid may be gone by then and you will over correct.
