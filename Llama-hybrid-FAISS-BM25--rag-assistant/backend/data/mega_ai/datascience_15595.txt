Intuition Behind Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)

I went through Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course on Coursera and also through introduction to restricted boltzmann machines , still I didn't understand the intuition behind RBMs. Why do we need to compute energy in this machine? And what is the use of the probability in this machine? I also saw this video . In the video, he just wrote the probability and energy equations before the computation steps and didn't appear to use it anywhere. Adding to the above, I am not sure what the likelihood function is for?
