Every iPhone application has at its disposal the ability to read/write name/value pairs which can be very, very useful for storing small information like user preferences. These preferences can also be edited by the user of your application (if you choose). Another option you have which is more robust than trying to do text file storage and retrieval (I never liked this option, especially with the crappy XML parsing support on the iPhone) is sqlite. sqlite is a really light-weight relational database engine that is included with every iPhone and iPod touch.
