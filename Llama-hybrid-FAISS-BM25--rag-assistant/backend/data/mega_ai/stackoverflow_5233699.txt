You need to consider the fact that an Area in MVC isn't really a physical folder-structure like it would seem in the URL (or your project). I would simply organize it something like this: /Content/Public/Css /Content/Public/Images /Scripts/Public/ and /Content/BackEnd/Css /Content/BackEnd/Images /Scripts/BackEnd UPDATE To clarify what I mean that Area isn't a physical folder-structure: If you have the Area Admin in your project, The Default RouteURL is /Admin/{controller}/{action}, not /Areas/Admin/{controller}/{action} (though you're free to setup your routes like that, of course) This means that if you add a Content-folder under your /Areas/Admin folder, and place your CSS-file within that - Visual Studio wont interpret that correctly if you simply drag and drop the file into your markup. The HTML will be generated as: whereas the Url to the Admin-area is simply www.mysite.com/Admin/ This causes a bit of confusion as to what is the correct url to the Stylesheet? www.mysite.com/Admin/Content/stylesheet1.css or www.mysite.com/Areas/Admin/Content/stylesheet1.css ? Just a matter of opinion, but that's mine anyway :)
