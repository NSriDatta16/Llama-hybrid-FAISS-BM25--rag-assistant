Variance term in ARIMA time series errors model

I'm working with the regARIMA class in Matlab which generates an ARIMA time series error model. One of the parameters which is necessary when you specify the model is the "Variance" which is defined as "variance of the model innovations $\varepsilon_t$". Is there a simple explanation as to what this is?
