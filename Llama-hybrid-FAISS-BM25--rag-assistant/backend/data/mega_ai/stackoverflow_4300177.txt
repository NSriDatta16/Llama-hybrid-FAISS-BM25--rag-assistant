The main reason is probably that there are many different DBMS (Database Management Systems) out there (e.g. MySQL, MSSQL, etc.), each produced by a different company or organization with different style and ideas about the right way to do things. Additionally, for each DBMS there may be one or more different drivers to choose from for connecting to them, depending on what language you're using and other factors. If you want them all to be standardized, you're going to have to get all the creators of both DBMS and drivers to agree on a standard form, which is pretty unlikely.
