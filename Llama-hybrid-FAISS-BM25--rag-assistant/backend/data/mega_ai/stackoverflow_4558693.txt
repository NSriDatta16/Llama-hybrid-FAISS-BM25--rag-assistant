Please refer to the lengthy Terms of Service :) EDIT: As @yc pointed out, this is a question toward the the API (thanks btw). While I don't think my original answer is totally correct, I think it is worth mentioning the "Privacy" paragraph in the "Regular" Analytics TOS: PRIVACY . You will not (and will not allow any third party to) use the Service to track or collect personally identifiable information of Internet users, nor will You (or will You allow any third party to) associate any data gathered from Your website(s) (or such third parties' website(s)) with any personally identifying information from any source as part of Your use (or such third parties' use) of the Service. You will have and abide by an appropriate privacy policy and will comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection of information from visitors to Your websites. You must post a privacy policy and that policy must provide notice of your use of a cookie that collects anonymous traffic data. I am by no means a lawyer, but just want to point out that you need to be careful about what data you collect. Especially when using Event Tracking and Custom Variables .
