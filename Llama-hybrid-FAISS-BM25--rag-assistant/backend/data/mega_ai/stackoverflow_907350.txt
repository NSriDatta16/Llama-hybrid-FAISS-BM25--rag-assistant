Both tags have a different purpose. p indicates a paragraph, usually for organising content (text and images,mostly) div on the other hand is a rectangular space on the canvas, usually for layout purposes. Example: You would put your navigation panel in a div, making it easy to move it from the left to the right of the page, or switching to a 3 column layout. The different sections in your navigation (first the general site navigation, next specific hotlinks to the most recent blog post or whatever) could be seperated by putting them in defferent paragraphs. (I know, bad example, because the navigation is better represented by unordered lists, but what the hey). In direct answer to your question, they give you the advantage of differentiating between organising your layout and organising your content, in a way that becomes clear in the HTML source.
