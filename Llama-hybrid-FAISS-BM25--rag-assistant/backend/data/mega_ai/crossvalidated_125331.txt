Your problem can be profitably solved with a Markov model; estimate the distribution of the next location by the previous $k$ places. Relevant papers include: Prediction in wireless networks by Markov chains A Comparison of First- and Second-Order HMMs in the Task of Predicting the Next Locations of Mobile Individuals Predicting Future Locations with Hidden Markov Models Learning and detecting activities from movement trajectories using the hierarchical hidden Markov model Growing Hidden Markov Models: An Incremental Tool for Learning and Predicting Human and Vehicle Motion or Incremental Learning of Statistical Motion Patterns With Growing Hidden Markov Models If you need inspiration for extracting the places from the mobility trace, see Extracting places from traces of locations Extracting Places and Activities from GPS Traces Using Hierarchical Conditional Random Fields Discovering Personally Meaningful Places: An Interactive Clustering Approach Using GPS to Learn Significant Locations and Predict Movement Across Multiple Users A Clustering-Based Approach for Discovering Interesting Places in Trajectories Scalable Analysis of Movement Data for Extracting and Exploring Significant Places Identifying Meaningful Places: The Non-parametric Way Supervised semantic labeling of places using information extracted from sensor data Eigenplaces: Segmenting Space through Digital Signatures The Places of Our Lives: Visiting Patterns and Automatic Labeling from Longitudinal Smartphone Data It's basically a spatio-temporal clustering problem. Let me know if you get stuck on any of the papers.
