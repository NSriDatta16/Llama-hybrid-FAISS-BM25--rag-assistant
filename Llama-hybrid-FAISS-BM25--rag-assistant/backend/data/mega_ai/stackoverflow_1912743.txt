How to use python, PyLab, NumPy, etc for my Physics lab class over excel

I took a scientific programming course this semester that I really enjoyed and experimented with a lot. We used python, and all the related modules. I am taking a physics lab next semester and I just wanted to hear from some of you how python can help me in ways that excel can't or in ways that are better than excel's capabilities. I use Mathematica for symbolic stuff so I would use python for data purposes. Off the top of my head, here are the related things I can do: All of the things you would expect in a intro course (loops, arrays, slicing arrays, etc). Reading data from a text file. Plotting scatter, line, and bar graphs. Learning how to plot linear regression but haven't totally figured it out. I have done 7 of the problems on Project Euler (nothing to brag about, but it might give you a better idea of where I stand in skills). Looking forward to hearing from some of you. You don't have to explain how to use the things you mention, I could look up the documentation.
