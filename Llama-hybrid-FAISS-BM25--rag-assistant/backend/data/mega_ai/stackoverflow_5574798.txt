I can't reproduce the behavior you see. I get the right results even if I define the time column as varchar, insert value within single quotes, insert value within double quotes, define the time column as decimal and insert text literals first ('test text') But, like Samuel Neff, I'd still like to see the result of SELECT id, time, typeof(time) FROM table_a; in your database. You know what else might be interesting? The result of select * from table_a order by time; These results are from version 3.7.4, which might not be the current version. sqlite> .dump table_a PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF; BEGIN TRANSACTION; CREATE TABLE "table_a" ("id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, "time" decimal NOT NULL); INSERT INTO "table_a" VALUES(1,0.4); INSERT INTO "table_a" VALUES(2,0.6); INSERT INTO "table_a" VALUES(3,0.0005); INSERT INTO "table_a" VALUES(4,0.0006); INSERT INTO "table_a" VALUES(5,0.0004); COMMIT; sqlite> select * from table_a where time SELECT id, time, typeof(time) FROM table_a; 1|0.4|real 2|0.6|real 3|0.0005|real 4|0.0006|real 5|0.0004|real
