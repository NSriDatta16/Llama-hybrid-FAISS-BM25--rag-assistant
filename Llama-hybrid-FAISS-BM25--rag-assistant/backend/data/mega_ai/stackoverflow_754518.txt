How about an Extension method? You could call it Join in this case. Being an extension method, users should know that it is a static method and might therefore give them a little pause and encourage them to look at the return value. At the same time, you have the usability of an "instance" method. public static ImmutableList Join(this ImmutableList body, T tail) { // add robust error checking in case either is null... return new ImmutableList (body, tail); } and then later on... var list = new ImmutableList ().Join("Hello") .Join("Extensible") .Join("World"); I don't quite know the accepted behavior on posting multiple answers, but this is an interesting question since I think that nomenclature is a critical step in design and my brain keeps pondering on this one.
