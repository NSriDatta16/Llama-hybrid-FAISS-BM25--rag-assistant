Auto encoders have an input layer, hidden layer, and an output layer. The input is forced to be as identical to the output, so its the hidden layer we are interested in. The hidden layer form a kind of encoding of the input. "The aim of an auto-encoder is to learn a compressed, distributed representation (encoding) for a set of data." If input is a 100 dimensional vector, and you have 60 neurons in the hidden layer, then the auto encoder algorithm will replicate the input as a 100 dimensional vector in the output layer, in the process giving you a 60 dimensional vector that encodes your input. So the purpose of auto encoders is dimensionality reduction , amongst many others.
