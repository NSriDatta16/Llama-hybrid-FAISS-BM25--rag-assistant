Have you checked what MIME type the JavaScript is being served as? You listed text/javascript in the list of types to gzip, but sometimes JavaScript isn't served under that MIME type; it may be served under text/ecmascript , application/x-javascript , or might be getting a default type like text/plain . Browsers don't generally care what type is sent in the Content-Type , as it's the type listed in the tag that they pay attention to, so the content type for your JavaScript files might be something odd.
