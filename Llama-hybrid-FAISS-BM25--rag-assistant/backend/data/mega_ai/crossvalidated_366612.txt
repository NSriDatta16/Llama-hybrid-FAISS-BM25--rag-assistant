cluster analysis in R

This is (a piece of) my data frame time_step V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 1 120.8 139.5 NA 124.9 148 2 NA 139.3 NA 127.5 156.1 3 120.6 139.5 131.9 130.7 159.6 4 NA 139 133.9 135 169.5 5 NA 138.3 138.7 137.4 169.1 6 120 138.9 137 139.8 168.4 7 NA 139.5 135.2 142.1 172.9 8 NA 137.1 135.9 143 176.3 Each column is a curve with values eventually missing inbetween. So I want to use random forest to basically find out how many categories of curves I have to assume. To do this, I thought I would have to fitt each of these curves first using GAMMS with bam() command of R package 'mgcv' and then use cluster analysis to find out the categories. But maybe the curve fitting is not important. Can anybody help and do you think this might work? This is a photo of how I am expecting the data to look like, though I classified the curves myself into three categories: Categories With random forest, I would like to statistically find out a categorization and whether it fits to my impressionistic one or whether empirically it would be better to assume n categories.
