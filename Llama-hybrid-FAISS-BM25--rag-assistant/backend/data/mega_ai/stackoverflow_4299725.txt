Building my JS library, a couple questions

I'm building a library (https://github.com/OscarGodson/storageLocker), a localStorage wrapper to be more exact, but because this is my first try at OO JavaScript I'm still learning and I have a couple questions. I've seen in other libraries that sometimes they wrap them in a anonymous function. Do I, or should I, do that with this? And if so, how without breaking anything? For the internal API (basically, the internal functions) how should I write them? Should add them to the main object e.g. storageLocker.prototype.myInternalFunction() or just myInternalFunction() randomly in my script? I didn't want the functions to be global though... One of the functions for example just checks a bunch of items in the JSON, sees if their objects, and then checks what the object type is (like Date() ) and then converts it. How/where should I add global, to my script, vars? e.g. i have a var called patterns that is something like var patterns = {"date":/\/Date\(([0-9]+)\)\//} how should I add that into my script? Thanks a lot. I want to write my script the right way so im asking you guys. I don't know of any JS guys locally that do any OO JS, they're all old school types...
