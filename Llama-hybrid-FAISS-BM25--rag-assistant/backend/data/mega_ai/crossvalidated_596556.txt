How can we make bernoulli samples when implementing MCMC for SSVS?

I'm implementing Stochastic Search Variable Selection(SSVS) for logistic regression using R. I'm using Spike and Slab prior with indicators $\lambda_{j}$ . Here's my model structure: $Y ∼ Bernoulli(\mu(X))$ $log {μ(X)\over1−μ(X)} = X\beta$ $\beta_{j} \overset{ind}{∼}\lambda_{j}N(0,\sigma_1^2)+(1−λj)N(0,\sigma_2^2) \ for \ j=1,···,10$ $\lambda_{j} \overset{ind}{∼} Bernoulli(1/2)$ $\sigma_1^2 ∼ InverseGamma(1, 20), \ \sigma_2^2 ∼ Gamma(1, 20)$ And I will make $T$ MCMC samples of $\beta_j, \sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2, \lambda_j$ . When ${1\over T}\sum_{i=1}^T \lambda_{j,i} > 0.5$ , predictor $X_j$ is selected. But how can I sample $\lambda$ ? It's Bernoulli random variable, so its value is either 0 or 1. But for Metropolis - Hastings proposal, I need $q(\lambda'|\lambda)$ , which is correlated with last sample. How can I correlate proposal of $\lambda'$ with current $\lambda$ ? Any help should be appreciated.
