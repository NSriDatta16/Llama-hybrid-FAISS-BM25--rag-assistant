No, Currency is not a floating point type. It is a fixed-precision decimal, implemented with integer storage. It can be compared exactly, and does not have the rounding issues of, say, Double. Therefore, if you are seeing inexact values in your Currency variables, the problem is not the Currency type itself, but what you are putting into it. Most likely, you have a floating-point calculation somewhere else in your code. Since you do not show that code, it's hard to be of more help on this question. But the solution, generally speaking, will be to round your floating point numbers to the correct precision before storing in the Currency variable, rather than doing an inexact comparison on the Currency variables.
