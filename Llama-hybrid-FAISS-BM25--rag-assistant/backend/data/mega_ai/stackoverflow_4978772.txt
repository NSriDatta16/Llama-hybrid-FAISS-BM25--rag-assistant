For programming topics on Java , go to the Oracle (Sun) Java site. That's the holy grails of everything regarding Java. For a Wikipedia-style format, just go to wikibooks (as it will have topics on Java and other programming languages, not just OO.) Other than that, a short answer to your question will be simply NO . Programming is too complex a topic for someone to create the type of material that you are asking. If you are seriously interested in programming (and I mean seriously), focus on one language alone and learn it (as opposed to looking for the perfect language or trying to analyze all possible alternatives and falling into "paralysis by analysis".) Again, if you are serious... just pick one of the following: C Python Ruby Scala C would make you face the nitty gritty of computing and people have been successful in learning programming with C as its programming languages (don't let OO and/or Ruby/Python/Java/.NET fanboys tell you otherwise.) Python and Ruby are extremely beautiful languages that will teach to program, and do not force you to make everything into an object (a really retarded idea, more on that below.) Scala is another elegant and effective alternative. Learn The Fundamentals of Programming First, the OO Analysis and Modeling (not the other way around Avoid languages that force you to write everything in objects. That includes Java and C#. I've been working with Java for 12 years now, and it is a reliable platform. But it is a retarded language in that it does not allow you for procedural programming. Not everything is an object nor should be modeled as an object, sometimes not even in complex systems. People are still grappling with how to program correctly using a OO paradigm and they keep failing because they still don't get the capabilities and limitations of OO modeling and analysis. So my suggestion is not to learn programming with Java (or C#). Go with the hard procedural (C) or the elegant, paradigm-agnostic (Python, Ruby or Scala.) Focus on modularity, structured programming and algorithms. Then, later you will be better equipped to truly understand where OO languages fit in. I'm not going to delve into why I chose these 4 options or why I advise against Java and C#. That debate has been discussed a plenty and you can find it easily in stackoverflow and/or google. That's just my suggestion, from my experience (Java and otherwise), a suggestion that I always give to those serious about learning programming. In the end, it doesn't really matter which of those four you pick. Just flip a coin, pick one and stick to it until you are decent with it. Focus on learning proper programming techniques, problem decomposition and algorithms rather than on the language itself. Good luck. edit: I forgot to mention, if you are serious about learning programming, buy books. You won't learn from visiting sites. And you have to put your time in it (we are talking 4hrs a day at least... I don't see anyone learning programming with anything less than that.) Anything less is just make-believe going through the motions of learning.
