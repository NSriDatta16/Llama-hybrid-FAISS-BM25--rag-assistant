k - NN classifier vs logistic regression for the MNIST data set

What would be the difference between using a k-NN classifier and logistic regression for the MNIST data set (large database of handwritten digits)? Edit: I used both methods in python (built-in functions in sklearn). I used iterations to find the k that gave the greatest accuracy. It turned out that k-NN achieved greater accuracy than Logistic Regression. However, I'm not sure as to which method is better in terms of speed, what would be a good method to analyze this?
