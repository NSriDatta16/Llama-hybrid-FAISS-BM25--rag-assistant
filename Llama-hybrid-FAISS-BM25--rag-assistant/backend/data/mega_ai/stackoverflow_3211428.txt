I've been working as a C++ maintenance coder for roundabout 10 years now. Platforms included Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and Linux. Not for a second did I (or any other developer working on the same team) pause to ponder the possibility that we shouldn't because "Linux developers know C". Someone has been sucking up too much of the Linux Kernel Mailing List anti-C++ propaganda.
