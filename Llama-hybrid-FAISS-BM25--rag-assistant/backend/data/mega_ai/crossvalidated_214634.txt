Should I use an average to summarize ordinal data?

I need to work out a "average" (for lack of knowing a better word) of ratings or perhaps I could call them labels. Basically, I have a list of words that have been rated 1 - 3 for difficulty. 1 being easy, 2 moderate and 3 difficult. The list is marked by 5 individuals. I need to use the words that are "mainly" rated as 2. So the individuals did not always agree on the difficulty. If a word had the following "score": 1, 1, 2, 3, 3 then it's safe to say that it's agreeably a 2. If most reviewers rated a word as 3 then it's obviously not on average a 2. Basically, when taking 5 reviewers' rating for a word, what is the average rating? Now it makes sense that I want to add it all up and divide it by 5. This will mostly give me decimal values such as 1.6 or so on. Now my question finally is. If doing so, getting values such as 1.6, what do I make of it? Round it to the nearest integer and take that as the deciding rating? Is it as simple as that?
