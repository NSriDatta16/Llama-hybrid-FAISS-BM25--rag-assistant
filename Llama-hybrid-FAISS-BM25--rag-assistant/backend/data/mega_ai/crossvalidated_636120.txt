The Wilson confidence interval is superior. Among other places it is implemented in the R Hmisc package binconf function. But this whole discussion has focused on binary variables which are coarsened versions of Likert ordinal scales. Even though Likert scales are not really interval-valued it is often best to summarize them with a single mean. Then the job can be converted to one of selecting the best performing bootstrap confidence interval approach to get confidence intervals for population means. "Best performing" means the method that has the two tail non-coverage probabilities closest to 0.025 if computing a 0.95 confidence interval. You can also get estimated means from ordinal regression as discussed here and here .
