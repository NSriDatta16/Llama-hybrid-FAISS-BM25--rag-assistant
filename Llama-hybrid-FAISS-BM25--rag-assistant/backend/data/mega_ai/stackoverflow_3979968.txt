Why do you say "should" ? Of course, your suggested stack layout would be the result of one particular--very obvious--way of implementing automatic variables, but there is nothing that requires it. Thus, no "should" . To force the order of some items in memory so that you can play (behavior unspecified, totally unsafe and unportable!) games with overwriting, use a struct and your compiler's padding #pragma s.
