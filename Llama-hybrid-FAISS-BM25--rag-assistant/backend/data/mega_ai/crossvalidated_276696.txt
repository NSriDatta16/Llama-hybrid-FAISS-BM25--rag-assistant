why does num_boost_round in xgboost influence auc score? it is crazy

I tried to do xgboost native cv function and found that the auc score depends on num_boost_round parameter of cv function. When num_boost_round increases auc score also increases! Why is that? What is the optimal value of num_boost_round and why?
