Gradient boosting still works well when there are few features, and it excels at finding non-linearities in the data. Logistic regression is only able to find nonlinearities when you manually add polynomial terms, and this manual step is not necessary with gradient boosting. In any case, try out multiple algorithms: gradient boosting, random forest, and logistic regression, and see which performs best on cross validation or a holdout set. Literature can only offer guidelines, not guarantees, so you can only truly know by testing yourself.
