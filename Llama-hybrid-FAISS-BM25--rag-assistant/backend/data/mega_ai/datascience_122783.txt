Word embeddings

I m looking into word embedding and I would like to ask if I could train words or sentences in two layers. And if I wanted that one layer is more important, how could I calculate it? For example context should be more important than grammar or syntax and positioning should have another weight. How could I express it? Thank You in advance.
