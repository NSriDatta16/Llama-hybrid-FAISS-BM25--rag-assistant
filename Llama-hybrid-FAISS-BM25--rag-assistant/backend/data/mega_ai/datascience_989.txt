SVM using scikit learn runs endlessly and never completes execution

I am trying to run SVR using scikit-learn (python) on a training dataset that has 595605 rows and 5 columns (features) while the test dataset has 397070 rows. The data has been pre-processed and regularized. I am able to successfully run the test examples, but on executing using my dataset and letting it run for over an hour, I could still not see any output or termination of the program. I tried executing using a different IDE and even from the terminal, but that does not seem to be the issue. I also tried changing the 'C' parameter value from 1 to 1e3. I am facing similar issues with all SVM implementations using scikit. Am I not waiting long enough for it to complete? How much time should this execution take? From my experience, it should not require more than a few minutes. Here is my system configuration: Ubuntu 14.04, 8GB RAM, lots of free memory, 4th gen i7 processor
