There are several (at least two) potentially confusing issues cropping up here. Confusing issue #1: psych::principal() uses varimax rotation by default The principal function is part of the psych package that is mostly focusing on doing factor analysis. Even though the principal function is doing PCA, it is following the FA-style approach. In particular, it applies varimax rotation by default (which I find rather confusing), meaning that the components that you get out of it are not principal components . They are "rotated principal components". You can actually see it directly in the output where they are appropriately called RC1 , RC2 , etc., instead of PC1 , PC2 , etc. Importantly, the result of varimax applied to $k$ PCs is not the same as the result of varimax applied to $k+1$ PCs. See Is PCA followed by a rotation (such as varimax) still PCA? for a lot of details on varimax rotation applied to PCA. If you set rotate="none" input parameter, then no rotation will be performed, you will see PC s and not RC s in the output, and the components will not depend on how many of them are requested. Confusing issue #2: the output of loadings(prcomp()) does not make sense because these are not loadings. What princomp returns as loadings are just eigenvectors of the covariance matrix (scaled to unit length, as is standard). This is not what is known as "loadings" in factor analysis: the latter are eigenvectors scaled by the square roots of the corresponding eigenvalues. (See e.g. Loadings vs eigenvectors in PCA: when to use one or another? and How does "Fundamental Theorem of Factor Analysis" apply to PCA, or how are PCA loadings defined? ) The function loadings() probably assumes that it gets FA loadings as an input and consequently takes their sums of squares as "explained variance". When applied to PCA unit-scaled eigenvectors, this will result in identical explained variance of each component. That's why you get equal numbers in Proportion Var output. This is ridiculously misleading. To get actual explained variances, instead of loadings(a) run summary(a) . See here: What is the difference between summary() and loadings() for princomp() object in R?
