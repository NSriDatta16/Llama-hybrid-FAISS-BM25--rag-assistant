The right join for the right situation?

(Please pardon the pun in the question title.) I'm currently teaching an introductory class to data science. I understand the differences between a left join, a right join, an inner join and a full join. However, I am not sure how to explain to students when a particular join (say an inner join) is the appropriate join for that particular situation. I am looking for three real-life examples: In example A, an inner join is the most appropriate. In example B, a left/right join is the most appropriate. In example C, a full join is the most appropriate. I don't need all the details, but I do want the big picture ideas that show that in that real-life example, this join is most appropriate. Note: I am teaching using the R package dplyr, so I have used the names of the dplyr join functions .
