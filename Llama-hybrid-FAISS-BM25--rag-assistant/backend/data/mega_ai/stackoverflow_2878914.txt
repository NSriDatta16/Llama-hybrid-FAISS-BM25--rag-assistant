JNLP File Association: How do I open the file which was double-clicked on?

I've got the following JNLP: Foo Foo Systems, Inc. Foo Viewer/Editor Application Most everything is working. When I double-click a .wlog file, it opens up my application. However, it doesn't open the correct file. I read somewhere that JNLP was supposed to pass parameters to the main method indicating which file caused the app to be launched, but this is not happening (on OS X 10.6). I get an empty array to my application's main method. Probably unrelated, my splash screen doesn't work :( Any pointers on getting this working?
