Mimicking iPhone user agent in Chrome?

I'm tinkering with a phpbb mod which adds a skin for mobile phones, and to work on it in my computer I want to mimic an iphone. In Firefox I manage to do this using the "user agent switcher" extension which comes with built-in "iphone" feature: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/ However, in Chrome (which I prefer) I cannot make this happen. I downloaded what seemed to be the relevant extension: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/aafciojnlamllgpkpdkbamkfgbofhgcj?hl=he It doesn't come with a built-in iPhone mode, so I added the following user agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543 Safari/419.3" However, this seems to have absolutely no effect - the pages load normally and not in the mobile skin.
