(Update: quite missed the point.) I hope you didn’t really spend all day looking. :( The first result on Google for LWP::UserAgent JavaScript is Handling Javascript with LWP::UserAgent which gives the punchline: it doesn’t support JavaScript. There are a couple of options though. Check Mechanize JavaScript on the CPAN. It leads to WWW::Mechanize::Firefox and WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::JavaScript . There is also scripting with WWW::Selenium which is a bit trickier but will perfectly emulate the browser because it really is running the browser. Upate: forgot about WWW::Scripter which actually relates to Mech::Plugin::JavaScript.
