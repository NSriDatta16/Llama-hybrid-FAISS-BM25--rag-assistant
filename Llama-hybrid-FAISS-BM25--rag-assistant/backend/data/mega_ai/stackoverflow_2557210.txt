The section hierarchy is decided by the order in which the section titles are encountered. This means that there is no way to add paragraphs to the parent section that do not belong to a child section, once the first child section has been added. I recommend restructuring the text (no pun intended) or using footnotes. Literal blocks are another possibility.
