I model thus kind of data all the time. You need to incorporate day-of-the-week holiday effects ( lead , contemporaneous and lag effects ) special days-of-the-month perhaps Friday before a holiday or a Monday after a holiday weekly effects monthly effects ARIMA structure to render the errors white noise; et.al. . The statistical approach is called Transfer Function Modelling with Intervention DEtection. If you want to share your data either privately via dave@autobox.com or preferably via SE , I would be more than glad to actually show you the specifics of a final model and further your ability to do it yourself or at least to help you and others to understand what needs to be done and what can be done. In either case you come out smarter without spending any treasure be it coin or time.You might read some of my other responses to time series questions to learn more.
