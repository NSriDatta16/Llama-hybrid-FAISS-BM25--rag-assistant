scheduling app using constraints for when an event can take place

Ok, what I'm trying to do is build a web app that allows students to visually organize their class calendar using drag and drop. but They have to be able to drag and drop to specific locations (when those classes are available), not just anywhere. This would be a 'fixed week' calendar. I was considering using a table, but was wondering if anyone thought this might be an issue for the drag and drop and if you had suggestions for a better implementation. Would love to hear your thoughts. I'm a very visual thinker and know this sort of app would help me. Alternatively, if you know of something like this already implemented which I can use, Let me know!
