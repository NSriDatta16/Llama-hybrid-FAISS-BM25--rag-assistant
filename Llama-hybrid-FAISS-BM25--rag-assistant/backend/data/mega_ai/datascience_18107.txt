You can use KNN for regression in your case. You can either use fuctions for knn regression like knn.reg or you can implement your own solution. Suppose you have decided to use K=1 then find distances of test point from all known points and put the target variable as closest value. average of three values for k=3 and so on. You can use different parametrics for distance like euclidean, hamming and standarised the dataset before applying operations. Example using knn.reg: library(FNN) data(iris) train_index train y_train test y_predict y_actual rmse
