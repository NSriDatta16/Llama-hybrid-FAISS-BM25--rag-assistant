Moving Averages Model

In an MA model how does one fit a regression line without the help of errors? how does one get the errors without predicting? The 1st order moving average model, denoted by MA(1) is: $x_t = \mu + w_t + \theta_1 w_{t-1}$ how is $w_t$ calculated without $x_t$ predicted? also how does $w_t$ get calculated for future forecast when there is no data to compare?
