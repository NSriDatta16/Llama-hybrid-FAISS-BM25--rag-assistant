this.dragmove() interfering with mouseup event wpf

I have a UserControl in WPF. The UserControl has a MouseLeftMouseButtonUp event. The problem is- the Window has a this.DragMove() method in its MouseDown event which seems to interfere with the MouseLeftMouseButtonUp in the User Control (I need the this.DragMove() method to move the borderless window). Any ideas? Thanks!
