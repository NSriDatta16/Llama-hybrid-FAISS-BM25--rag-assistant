You are simulating a one-dimensional random walk . Basically, imagine yourself standing on a line of integers. You begin at point i=0 . With equal probability you take a step to the right or the left. The random walk has a few cool properties and you've touched on my favourite: Starting at point i=0 , as N gets larger, the probability that you will return to that point approaches 1. As you point out - a zero sum game. However, the expected time it will take you to return there tends to infinity. As you notice, you get some very large swings. Since the average value should be 0 and the variance of N moves is N , then you would expect 95% of your simulations to end in the region: (- 1.96, 1.96)*N^(0.5).
