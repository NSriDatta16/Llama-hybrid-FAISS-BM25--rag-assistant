Fastest data structure for contains() in Java?

What's the data structure in Java that has the fastest operation for contains() ? e.g. i have a set of numbers { 1, 7, 12, 14, 20... } Given another arbitrary number x, what's the fastest way (on average) to generate the boolean value of whether x is contained in the set or not? The probability for !contains() is about 5x higher. Do all the map structures provide o(1) operation? Is HashSet the fastest way to go?
