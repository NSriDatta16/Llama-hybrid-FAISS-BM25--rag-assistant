Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves are not a problem in general. The question is: what do you want to show? Usually you would want the plot to be a visualization of the causal average treatment effect of a grouping variable on the survival probability. If your groups were randomized in a large study, you can go usually go ahead and use the standard Kaplan-Meier curves, since randomization should take care of confounding already. However, if you are analyzing the effect of a non-randomized group (which is always the case in observational studies), it may be very important to adjust for confounders to obtain an unbiased estimate of the treatment-specific survival curves. The literature on causal inference deals with this problem in great detail. Many methods have been proposed to obtain confounder-adjusted survival curves. Which method you want to use depends on your specific situation. In a recent article me and my colleagues give a detailed overview and comparison of those methods which may provide some guidance ( https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9681 ). I also developed the adjustedCurves R package which implements most of the available methods. Here is a very small example on how this package may be used to obtain adjusted survival curves using g-computation : # install the package if needed install.packages("adjustedCurves") # load packages library(adjustedCurves) library(survival) # just used to make the example reproducible set.seed(42) # simulate some example data sim_dat $group group) # outcome model cox_mod More information can be found in the extensive documentation of the package and the article I cited.
