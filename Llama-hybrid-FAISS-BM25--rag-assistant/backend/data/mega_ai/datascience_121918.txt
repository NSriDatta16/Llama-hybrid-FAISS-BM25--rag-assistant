Is this time-series problem more a multi-classification or regression problem?

I have 188 different drilling datasets with two columns temperature and the target column thermal conductivity respectively. The drilling process includes drilling on four different materials on top of each other. Each different material has an unique thermal conductivity, so the target variable can only take one of 4 different values given the four materials. My question is, what kind of machine learning problem is this? Is it a regression or multi-classification problem?
