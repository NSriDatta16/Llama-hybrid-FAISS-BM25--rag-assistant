C# ListView with CheckBoxes, automatic checkbox checked when multi select rows

I'm using a ListView control with multirow and fullrow select on. When I'm selecting multiple rows at once, some of my rows magically become checked. This happens when dragging the mouse over and also when selecting one, and shift clicking another. See image describing issue here: What in the grapefruit is going on? Anyone?
