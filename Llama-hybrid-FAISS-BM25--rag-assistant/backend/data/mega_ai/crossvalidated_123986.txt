They are first-order models in the sense that you can use variables (not random variables!) and predicates to declare your model. This is basically the same as template models (such as dynamic Bayesian networks, but more general). These languages are basically just model description languages, and their semantics are grounded in ordinary propositional PGMs. This means they cannot describe different models, the description is just more concise. The corollary is that, given such a concise description, you can potentially exploit a lot of symmetry in the model for more efficient inference (called lifted inference then).
