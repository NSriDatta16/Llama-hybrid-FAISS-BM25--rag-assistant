Why is odds ratio used when interpreting logistic regression?

I am fairly certain when interpreting logistic regression output, the odds ratio should be used instead of the estimated coefficients; however, I am unable to figure out why this is the case. So my question is, can someone explain why the odds ratio is used instead of the estimated coefficients when interpreting logistic regression output?
