Variable selection in mixed effect models (stepAIC followed by dredge followed by model averaging)

I have simple mixed model of the form: fit i have n=37 environmental variables, six clusters with 30 measurements each for a total of 180 measurements/rows. Outcome is relative abundance of biological species, which are modelled one by one assuming no interaction between them (a bold assumption, i guess). I proceed to select the most important variables with the following, easy to use approach: First, i do a pre-selection with MASS:::stepAIC() (alternatively i could just use the p-values in summary(fit) , which leaves me at 15 predictor variables, then i subject this updated model to MuMIn:::dredge() for an even sparser model, and then do model averaging on the top models based on AICc: fit Does this approach make sense? (I am not an expert on mixed models in any way). Will it identify meaningful variables and will it pass a review process? Also; there is a slight improvement of fit when i apply a spatial correlation structure (delta AIC=1). Shall this go directly into fit , or can i apply it later on the averaged model?
