If you plan on releasing this on the app store, you wont be able to use your library in the way that you would like. As mentioned above, linking to 3rd party libraries is not supported on the phone. I think there is a 'hack' way to make it work, but you'll lose distribution. The best I could come up with was putting all the relevant code in a directory and sharing it that way. I know its not as elegant, but its their limitation ie. out of our control.
