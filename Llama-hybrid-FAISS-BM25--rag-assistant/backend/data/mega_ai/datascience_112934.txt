Are all problems solvable using machine learning?

I am confronted with a relatively original problem which consists in predicting on which floor of a building audio recordings have been made. I have tried many machine learning approaches but none of them seem to give significant and stable results yet despite applying almost every tweak I found online . This makes me wonder whether the problem itself is learnable. This may be a problem with the data available, still the question remains for the general case. I have then two questions. How to know when a problem is not solvable by machine learning? Is there something like a rule of thumb to check at the beginning? How to know when the performances obtained are close to the best ? You can see that in my case, the human level is not very useful because it is close to random for this problem.
