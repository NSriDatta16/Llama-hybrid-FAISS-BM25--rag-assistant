Optimized order of HTML attributes for compression

I read somewhere that organizing HTML attributes in a certain order can improve the rate of compression for the HTML document. (I think I read this from Google or Yahoo recommendation for faster sites). If I recall correctly, the recommendation was to put the most common attributes first (e.g. id , etc.) then put the rest in alphabetical order. I'm a bit confused by this. For example, if id attributes were put right after every p tag, the id would contain unique values. Thus, the duplicated string would be limited to this: (say there were and ). Because the value of id needs to be unique, I see this as actually causing an adverse effect to the compression. Am I wrong? If I needed to go through a static web page with randomly ordered attributes, what logic should I use to organize attributes to achieve maximum compression? NOTE: I'm talking GZIP compression (if that matters): http://www.gzip.org/algorithm.txt
