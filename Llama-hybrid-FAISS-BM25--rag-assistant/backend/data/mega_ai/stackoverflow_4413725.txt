Wrap in tags specific characters in HTML tables with regex & PHP

I have a text... and in it I have paragraphs and tables... I need to replace every X (a single Japanese kanji character to be precise... but it could be any character) which is in one of the tables with X , but only those X that are in the tables, not outside of them. There can be several X in a single table so preg_replace('# (X)#','replacewith',$source) wouldn't work as it replaces only one of the X. Any ideas? Thanks.
