Applying logistic regression with response and expected response

I hope my title is phrased correctly, otherwise feel free to rephrase it. This is my first time working with such a data set and i'm trying to understand if a method i'm using is correct. Here is a breakdown of what kind of data i'm working with. Let's say an experiment is run and you obtain a value x . Now we already know beforehand, of what to expect x to be under a certain condition. So we have three columns. x, our classification of x, expected value of x. You can tell straight away, some values of x are misclassified E.G when x = 12, classification = 0 (as 12 Now I hope I have clearly explained the structure of my data. What I want to do is assess whether dividing the data into x 15 is sensible. My current method is applying a logistic regression model with Classifcation ~ x and then comparing the logistic regressions output with my expected results. I'm not even sure what this achieves, if i'm honest. I'm not sure how to tackle this problem. EDIT: (Context) The goal is to identify which blood samples have lymphoma, with a new technique. We already know which blood samples have lymphoma (Expected column) with an old technique. X is a metric we use to determine if the blood sample is positive or negative of lymphoma. It was found that splitting X into below and above 15, we are able to classify lymphoma. My goal is not to compare whether the new technique is better than the old one. It is to show these thresholds are good enough to classify lymphoma.
