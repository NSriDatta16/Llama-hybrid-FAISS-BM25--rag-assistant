No. Erlang's syntax is very similar to Prolog's, but the semantics are very different. An early version of Erlang was written using Prolog, but today's Erlang can no longer meaningfully be said to be "based on Prolog." Erlang does not include backtracking or other features of Prolog regularly used for logic programming. You can of course implement Prolog atop other languages, and Erlang is an easier choice for this than some others. This can be seen in Robert Virding's "Erlog" project: https://github.com/rvirding/erlog
