How to transform a folder of images in a csv file

I have a folder with a lot of images that I want to use to bild a classificator using a SVM model in python with sklearn. I've always used csv file as train/test set with sklearn, how can I make it? (a csv file with records corrisponding to images and a variable for every pixel)
