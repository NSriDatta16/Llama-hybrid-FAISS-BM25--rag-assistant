Google maps API embedded in iFrame not centering on lat/long

I have used the Google Maps API to create a simple HTML page which I'm then embedding into an iFrame on another page. Page works fine when outside of the iFrame however when within the iFrame, the window position doesn't scroll to center on the marker. An example is here: http://webfe.omega.studiocoast.com.au/epping-club.aspx and click on club location. On reading this I'm wondering why I'm using a iFrame and instead call the API directly from the parent page... But any suggestions as to my first problem would be fantastic :)
