What is the exploration behavior normally used in Policy Search based Reinforcement Learning?

When using Q-learning, we have different options for a behavior policy, for e.g. we can use $\epsilon-$greedy. But I have not seen $\epsilon-$greedy prescribed for policy search/gradient methods. When sampling trajectories in "vanilla" policy gradient, it looks like we only use softmax action selection. Is this claim true? If so, why?
