Which R time/date class and package to use?

I have a limited time series exposure in R. So, I wonder which time/date class (and associated package) would be most appropriate to start with. Among the plethora of packages available at CRAN task view , I so far favor the timeDate , which is a S4 oriented and has nice support for location dependent particularities such as holidays and daylight saving times. The community apparently favors the zoo package. chron is also popular. [edit: Here is a list of time/date implementations which lubridate package refers to: POSIXct, POSIXlt, Date, chron, yearmon, yearqtr, zoo, zooreg, timeDate, xts, its, ti, jul, timeSeries, fts . Also lubridate itself has handy time classes duration , period and interval .] Would really appreciate if somebody with experience with multiple packages would share his opinion on how the available time/date classes compare in terms of usability and extensibility. Some points of interest (in random order): internationalization (holidays, timezones etc) readily available statistical modeling procedures readily available visualization tools ease of use compatibility with builtin date/time-series classes (POSIX,ts) extensibility (S4 is desirable) best to use with lubridate Thanks.
