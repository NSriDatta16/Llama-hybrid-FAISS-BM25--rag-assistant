Session (but it depends a lot of the session configuration) : No database access, or less. Temporary storage : you may lose the information, at least when the session ends. Maybe some security issue, depending on where you store the session information Not shared : you may have issues if you're using a server farm, one server may not have access to the other server session. May not work if the client disabled the cookies. Database : Database traffic for each postback if you need the information on each page. Permanent storage. No information stored with the client (cookies...). Shared : data accessible from any server on a web farm. Please note that you can store Session information in database. That's why I use the word "may" in the Session part. See here some session configuration and possibilities
