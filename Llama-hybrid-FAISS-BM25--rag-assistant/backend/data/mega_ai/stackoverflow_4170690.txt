Have you set up a transfer schedule for the Logs table? That is, all logging gets cached in each instance, and you need to explicitly ask for that data to be persisted in table storage on a periodic basis. Here's a trivial example for WADLogsTable: var dm = DiagnosticMonitor.GetDefaultInitialConfiguration(); dm.Logs.ScheduledTransferPeriod = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5); dm.Logs.ScheduledTransferLogLevelFilter = LogLevel.Verbose; DiagnosticMonitor.Start("DiagnosticsConnectionString", dm); Once this is set up, you should see the WADLogsTable table appear after a while. You'll need to set up the transfer period and filter for each of the other types as well: Event log Diagnostics infrastructure log Directories Performance counters
