Maven cobertura plugin - one report for multimodule project

I'm using maven cobertura plugin to report code coverage in my multimodule project. The problem is that I don't know how to generate one report for all modules in project. So far I have generated separate reports for every module, but it would be nice to have one report for whole project. My parent pom configuration: org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.4 true test-compile clean cobertura
