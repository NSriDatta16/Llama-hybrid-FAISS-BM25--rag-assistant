Output '{' or '}' with string.format(...)

I bet that's an easy question for you, but searching SO or Google with { or } in the search string doesn't work very well. So, let's say i wanna output {Hello World} , how do i do this using string.format(...) ? Edit: looks like this: string hello = "Hello World"; string.format("{0}", '{' + hello + '}'); would do the job, but that doesn't look very elegant to me. Is there a way to escape these characters inside the format string?
