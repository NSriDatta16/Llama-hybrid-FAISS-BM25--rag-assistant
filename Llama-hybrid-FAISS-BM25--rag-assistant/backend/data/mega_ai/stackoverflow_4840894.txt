A good solution for ASP.NET PHP remoting?

I'm about to start a project that requires an ASP.NET application (MVC 2) to talk to a PHP application (on a different server but I have control over them both). Any ideas of a modern, elegant solution of doing that? Edit: Authentication would be nice to include in the solution. Edit 2: Communication is not frequent, once in a while one of the apps have some data changes that it should share with the other.
