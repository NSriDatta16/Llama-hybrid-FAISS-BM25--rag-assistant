You can develop an app that injects the dynamic code into her static site via Javascript. I do that for one of my projects here at work and it seems to be an acceptable solution. A quick HTML sample: Test loader.js: $().ready(function () { $(' ... ').appendTo('head'); $('.contentlib').each(function() { $.getScript($(this).attr('id')+'.js'); }); }); customcontent.js: $().ready(function () { $('#customcontent').html(' ... '); }); This is a bit more complicated than it has to be (the second script load based on the div's id) since I have to support multiple replacement on the same page. Anyway, I could see you using this to inject your app from a 3rd-party website and, as long as you stuck to using AJAX form submissions, the average user would be none the wiser.
