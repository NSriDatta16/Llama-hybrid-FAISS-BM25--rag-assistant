Modern browsers support XSLT out of the box. Take a look at eu.wowarmory.com - they use it extensively. If the server detects a user agent that does not support XSLT, it is rendered at the server side, and a quite verbose HTML is rendered there and sent to the browser. This makes a nice abstraction if you plan to provide an XML webservice similar to the web site.
