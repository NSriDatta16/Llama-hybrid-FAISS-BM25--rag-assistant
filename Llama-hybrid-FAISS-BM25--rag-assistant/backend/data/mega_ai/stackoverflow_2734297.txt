Interview question: Develop an application that can display trial period expires after 30 days without external storage

I saw this question in a forum about how an application can be developed that can keep track of the installation date and show trial period expired after 30 days of usage. The only constraint is not to use the external storage of any kind. Question: How to achieve this? Thanks Bala --Edit I think its easy to figure out the place to insert a question work. Anyway, I will write the question clearly. "external storage" means don't use any kind of storage like file, registry, network or anything. You only have your program.
