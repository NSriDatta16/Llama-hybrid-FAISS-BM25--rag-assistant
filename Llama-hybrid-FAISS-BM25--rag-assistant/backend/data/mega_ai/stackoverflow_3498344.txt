Use a "loophole" in MySQL. The MySQL documentation says : A UNIQUE index creates a constraint such that all values in the index must be distinct. An error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key value that matches an existing row. This constraint does not apply to NULL values except for the BDB storage engine. For other engines, a UNIQUE index permits multiple NULL values for columns that can contain NULL. This means that you can create a boolean column that has two values: true (or 1) and NULL. Create a UNIQUE index over that column + your key. That allows you to only set one record to true, but any number of them can have NULL.
