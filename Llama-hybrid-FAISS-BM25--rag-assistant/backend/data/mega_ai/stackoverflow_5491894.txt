Well, apparently Azure blob storage doesn't support JSONP straightaway, but it can be done. For example, if I store this JSON in an Azure blob: {"Name":"Valeriano","Surname":"Tortola"} And I try: $.getJSON("https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/jsonptests/data?jsoncallback=?", function (data) { alert(data.Name); }); It doesn't work. Well, actually the browser download the data but there is no call back. So, considering how JSONP works, if I save this JSON with the callback function: dataCallback({"Name":"Valeriano","Surname":"Tortola"}) And I do: function dataCallback(data) { alert(data.Name); } Then the dataCallBack get executed :) The disadvantage is that the callback function name has to be harcoded, but it's better than nothing. Happy days, but if anyone has a better way would be great. Cheers.
