I'd suggest the best way of doing it is to reverse the string then compare the first n characters. There's any number of examples of string reversing functions out there (even Joel cites it as a standard interview question) so just implement one of those then step though the reversed strings to compare. EDIT in response to downvotes. OK yes, this approach does require additional CPU or memory to implement, but the questioner does not indicate any such constraints and he explicitly asked for an elegant solution. Reversing the strings then comparing from the front is far more elegant than messing around finding the end of the strings and working backwards. And it's a lot easier for the next programmer along to grasp and maintain too.
