Is it possible to do Normalization before Xgboost?

Currently I am working on a project which uses Xgboost Regression. Before putting data into model, I implemented Normalization, the accuracy significantly increased compared with without Normalization. But I saw someone said that Xgboost doesnâ€™t need Normalization . Did someone meet the same issue as I met ? Thanks in advance.
