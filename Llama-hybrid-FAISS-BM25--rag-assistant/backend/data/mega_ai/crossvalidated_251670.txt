If people can only drop out on the last day of each month, then we decrease by .05 each month and hence after 12 months there will be $.95^{12}$. Now let's assume that the hazard is .05, and that this remains constant. Intuitively, the number of subjects in the trial is decreasing and so is the number dropping out, as the hazard is assumed constant. Mathematically, we can allow dropping out to occur in smaller increments of time, averaging out the decrease. Taking the limit, the number at the end of a month is $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} (1-.05/n)^n = e^{-.05} \approx 0.9512$, and there will be $e^{-.05\cdot12}$ after 12 months.
