Instrument with Positive and Negative Affect

I am planning to use an instrument "GEQ" that contains 16 items, 4 items are grouped into the following categories: a. Positive Affect b. Negative Affect c. Flow d. Challenge scale: 1: strongly agree; 2: Agree; 3:Moderately Agree; 4: Slightly Disagree; 5:Do not agree. My question is whether we need to reverse the coding-scale for "Negative Affect" during data analysis. I plan to combine and average all the response-data of the four categories (dependent var). Thanks
