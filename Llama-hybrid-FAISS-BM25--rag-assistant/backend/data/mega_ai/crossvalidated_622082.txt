Interpretation of impulse response analysis - Cholesky decomposition output in R

I am doing an impulse response analysis involving 3 time series A, B, and C in R. Following Lutkepohl approach, I used the log and diff functions to make them stationary. After creating the VAR model, I did a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix, and I getting this output: A B C A 0.04173162 0.00000000 0.000000000 B 0.01805572 0.22749823 0.000000000 C -0.0098590 0.00092583 0.1752258 If my understanding is correct, this suggests that a shock in time series A has contemporary effects on time series B and C, but the opposite is not true. Is it the correct interpretation? If not please correct me, any insight is very welcome. Please also feel free to point out any other findings I missed. TIA
