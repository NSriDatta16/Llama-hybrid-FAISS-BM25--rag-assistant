How to automatically include a number of images in the SWF file?

i'm trying to include a number of images in my SWF file not by loading them but by embedding them in the SWF itself. I found the following instruction to do that: [Embed(source="../graphics/images/ss0.png")] private var SS0:Class; Basically, i want to embed a different number of images each time. Is there a way to do that automatically (let's say inside a for loop) or do i have to type manually this instruction for each image i want to include?
