in my humble opinion there's no place for code duplication. have a look, for example, at this wikipedia article or, let's refer to Larry Wall's citation: "We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris." it is pretty clear that code duplication has nothing to do with "laziness". haha;)
