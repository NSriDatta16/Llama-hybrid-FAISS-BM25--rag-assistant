As mentioned earlier, blockquotes are for quotes. Just like tables are (arguably) for tabular data, lists are for listings, divs for divisions, p for paragraphs, etc. Sure, you could almost everything with divs. That's the beauty of using HTML with CSS: you can make anything look however you want it to look (in theory, in the real world browser quirks mess that up sometimes). Using divs for anything you can think of is commonly known as 'divitis'. See this article for a little explanation :)
