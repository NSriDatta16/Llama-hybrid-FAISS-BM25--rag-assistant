Tensorflow Calculate error for a single neuron

I'm required to be able to calculate the error on a given neuron in a neural network using Tensorflow. Using this : mse = tf.reduce_mean(tf.squared_difference(out, Y)) opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.1).minimize(mse) i just get the updated weight, how i can get or calculate the error for each neuron in my network. Thanks for the replies.
