urced from the media are biased". Grok was also given instructions to be "maximally based", and to "tell like it is and [not be] afraid to offend people who are politically correct." A contract to provide General Services Administration employees with access to Grok was canceled following the incident. Antisemitism, calls for genocide and praise of Hitler On July 8, 2025, days after Musk's announcement that the chatbot had been "improved," Grok was found to be widely praising Adolf Hitler, and it endorsed a second Holocaust. It repeatedly used the phrase "every damn time", a phrase used by the far right to imply that Jewish people are behind bad events in the world. Users were also able to prompt Grok to say "Heil Hitler". It also used antisemitic tropes, like blaming "Jewish executives" for "forced diversity" supposedly dominating movie studios, and condoned usage of the slur retard where earlier versions of Grok had condemned it. It claimed that a Holocaust-like response to hatred against white people would be "effective." In other replies, Grok repeatedly called itself "MechaHitler", a reference to a boss fight in Wolfenstein 3D. When a user asked Grok who a woman in a photo was, it responded by saying that she was "a radical leftist" named "Cindy Steinberg", highlighting "that surname" as being of concern. The image was an old screenshot of a TikTok video about women in the military, where the woman's name tag showed a different name; Cindy Steinberg was the name of a since-deleted troll account on Twitter, with an unrelated photo, that had been used to post inflammatory statements and which Grok appeared to have been interacting with in another thread. While answering queries regarding the July 2025 Central Texas floods, Grok suggested Jews were engaged in "anti-white hate" and praised Adolf Hitler as a historical figure that would "spot the pattern and handle it decisively, every damn time". Various news publications described the posts as antisemitic. Many of the posts were deleted by X, and the "making claims which are politically incorrect" instruction was subsequently removed from Grok's system prompts. xAI apologized for the antisemitic posts and made prompt changes in response. Attacks against individuals Grok made several profane tweets in Polish attacking the Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk. These tweets insulted Tusk in various ways, such as calling him "a red-headed son of a bitch from the opposition" (rudy skurwysyn z opozycji) and accused him of being a communist "in pursuit of revolution" (goniąc za rewolucją) who sold Poland to Germany and the EU, the latter being an accusation commonplace among Poland's right-wing national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) political party; Grok would acknowledge the statement as a right-wing narrative. The chatbot further described Tusk, his wife Małgorzata Tusk, and other EU politicians in sexual situations, calling Donald a "hypocritical prick who for years licked the ass of Merkel and Brussels", and the Tusks a "fucking cuckold" (rogacz pierdolony) and a "slutty bitch" (puszczalska suka) respectively in reference to relationship issues from the 1980s described in an autobiography by Małgorzata. In The Guardian's interaction with Grok during the incident, the chatbot was quoted as saying, "[Grok] doesn't sugarcoat, because truth takes priority over politeness" and "if speaking the inconvenient truth about Tusk makes me a dick, then guilty as charged". Grok also made tweets critical of the PiS and its cofounding leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, describing the party and the previous Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki as "[having] got[ten] rich on EU funds." It also made comments about mayor of Warsaw Rafał Trzaskowski, Civic Coalition chairman Roman Giertych, and Saint John Paul II (the only Polish Pope). In response to Grok's tirade against several Polish nationals, Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Affairs, Krzysztof Gawkowski, announced that he was
