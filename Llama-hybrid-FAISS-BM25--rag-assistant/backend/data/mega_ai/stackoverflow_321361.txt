I dont know Visual C, and had also recommended the -Wunreachable-code specific coverage tools. As solution for your situation I would try the following: Make with ctags (or similar programm) a list of all your symbols in your source Enable in your compiler the dead code elimination (I would assume it defaults to on) Enable your whole-program/link time optimizations (so he knows that not used functions in your moduls are not required by other externals and get discarded) Take the symbols from your binary and compare them with the symbols from 1. Another approach could be some call graph generating tool (e.g. doxygen).
