This question will probably be closed as subjective but here's my subjective view anyway: Definitely not , the open source world is already far too fragmented already and has more than enough languages. There are already fantastic open source communities around Java, Python, Ruby and PHP. All are great languages for the domains that they are designed for. There are also some great upcoming languages such as Scala, Clojure etc. It's a waste of time trying to be perfectionist about what language to use since everyone has a different idea of "perfect" and the value in a language lies in it being well used and providing an open, comprehensive platform for development, not in in being the "perfect" language for just two or three people in the world.
