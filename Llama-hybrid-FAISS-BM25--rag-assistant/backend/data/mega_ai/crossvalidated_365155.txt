A Gaussian Mixture Model Is a Universal Approximator of Densities

When discussing the concept of mixtures of distributions in my machine learning textbook, the authors state the following: A Gaussian mixture model is a universal approximator of densities, in the sense that any smooth density can be approximated with any specific nonzero amount of error by a Gaussian mixture model with enough components. I only have a basic background in probability and statistics, and I have absolutely no idea what this section is saying. I would greatly appreciate it if people could please take the time to explain this in a way that is more understandable to someone of my level.
