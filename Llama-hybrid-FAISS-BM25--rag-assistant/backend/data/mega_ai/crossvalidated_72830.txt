Deterministic components in covariates/exogenous variables in time series models

Actually, I have read a pair of books about time series analysis, but I am still not sure about how to treat deterministic components, like trend and seasonality, in the exogenous variables in a time series model. Do I have to detrend and deseasonalize the covariates before I use them as axplanatory variables in a time series model? I would also be thankful for a reference. Thank you in advance!
