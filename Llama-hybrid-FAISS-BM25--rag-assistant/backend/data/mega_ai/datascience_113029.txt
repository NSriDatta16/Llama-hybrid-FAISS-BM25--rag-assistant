You should try paperspace gradient notebooks. You can get access to them for as low as 8$/month (pro version) and also get access to unlimited A4000 GPU which is really powerful. Also, unlike colab it doesn't disconnect after 12 hours. Also, you get larger RAM/storage and various other perks. I used it for a large-scale deep learning project and it gave me far fewer headaches as compared to kaggle or colab. https://gradient.run/ Check it out!
