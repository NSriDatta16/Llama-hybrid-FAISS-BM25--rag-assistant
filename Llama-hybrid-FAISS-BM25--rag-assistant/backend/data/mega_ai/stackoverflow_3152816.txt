As it turns out, the above code I wrote up in my original question was not what i was working with, I actually had foo() called like so: makeAllDragable = function () { $(".test-table").draggable({ start: function (event, ui) { $(this).click(); }, stop: function (event, ui) { foo() } }).click(function () { foo(); /*difference here*/ }); } For whatever reason dragging it raises the click() function repeatedly when the function is also present in the stop() event. At least that's what appears to be happening on the surface at least.
