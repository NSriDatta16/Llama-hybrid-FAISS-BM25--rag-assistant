Do deep neural networks learn slower with the addition of more hidden layers?

The number of hidden layers increases the number of weights, also increases the terms in the back-propagation algorithm, i.e. more derivatives, hence more computation. Can we say that neural networks learns slower with the addition of more hidden layers?
