The point, that Canavar & John Saumders are trying to make, is that you need to understand the distinction between ASP.NET and client side UI code. Whilst it's true that ASP.NET Webforms do use a certain amount of client-side code to do their work, this is mostly related to communicating UI events to the server-side , so that they can be processed. If your drag-drop operation results in some server-side data manipulation (And this is highly likely) then you would also need to communicate the appropriate information to the server-side. The concepts involved are fairly straightforward, but tying them all together can be slighlty tricky - and depends heavily on your underlying webforms and application architecture. Could you rpvide further explanation of the application functionality, what you'd expect to happen when an image is dragged from one place to another, and if/how you expect the image position to be remembered.
