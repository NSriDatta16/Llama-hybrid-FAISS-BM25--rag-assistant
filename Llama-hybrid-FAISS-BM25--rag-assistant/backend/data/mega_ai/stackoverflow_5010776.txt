CAShapeLayer Slow User Interaction

I have a CAShapeLayer and it has to do a simple task of moving on the screen, guided by the user's finger. The problem is that the movement is too slow. The layer does move, but there is a lag and it feels slow. I have another test app where an UIImage is moved and there is no lag at all and the image moves instantly. What can I do to overcome this? -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { currentPoint = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { CGPoint activePoint = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; CGPoint newPoint = CGPointMake(activePoint.x - currentPoint.x,activePoint.y - currentPoint.y); curLayer.position = CGPointMake(shapeLayer.position.x+newPoint.x,shapeLayer.position.y+newPoint.y); currentPoint = activePoint; } Thanks!
