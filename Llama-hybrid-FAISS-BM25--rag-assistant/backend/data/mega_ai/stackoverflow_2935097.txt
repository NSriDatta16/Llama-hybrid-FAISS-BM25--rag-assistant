I like it - nice little game A few suggestions (purely in the spirit of improving it!): When placing towers for the first time it's a bit hard to see where you can / cannot place them. Maybe show a ghost version of the tower when you are hovering over a spot? Suggestion to make it really pretty - why not put a momentum / drag factor in the creeps speed? This would make it look even more fluid and dynamic, and you could create lots more interesting tower dynamics (e.g. some creeps would take a lot of time to get up to speed if you stopped them dead) Suggest restructuring the user interface panel - in particular I found it a little unintuitive to have the sub-panel for the tower appear where you have to press "X" to escape back to see your money and lives etc.
