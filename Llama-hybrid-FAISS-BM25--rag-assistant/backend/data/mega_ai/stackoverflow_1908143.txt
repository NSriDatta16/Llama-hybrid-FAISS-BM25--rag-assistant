Are switch case statements flexible?

I have created the following code so when a user chooses a department (Sales, Billing, Marketing, Finance, etc) and uses the contact form I created, the e-mail is sent to the proper person in the company. Use Back - Enter valid e-mail \n"; $badinput = " Feedback was NOT submitted \n"; echo $badinput; die ("Go back! ! "); } if(empty($visitor) || empty($visitormail) || empty($notes )) { echo " Use Back - fill in all fields \n"; die ("Use back! ! "); } $todayis = date("l, F j, Y, g:i a") ; $attention = $attention ; $subject = $attention; $notes = stripcslashes($notes); $message = " $todayis [EST] \n Attention: $attn \n From: $visitor ($visitormail)\n Please contact me by: $contact \n Phone Number: $phone \n Subject: $subject \n Message: $notes \n Additional Info : IP = $ip \n Browser Info: $httpagent \n Referral : $httpref \n "; $from = "From: $visitormail\r\n"; switch ($attention) { case "Residential": mail("mike@company.com", $subject, $message, $from); break; case "Billing": mail("mike@company.com", $subject, $message, $from); break; case "Service": mail("service@company.com", $subject, $message, $from); break; case "Technical": mail("service@company.com", $subject, $message, $from); break; } ?> When the client receives the email the from: field states the sender's email, which is fine for all departments except the Technical-Support department. This department needs to know the sender's email before hand and thus I need to code it so when technical option is chosen and they receive an email, the address is a default one (i.e. technical@company.com). Not sure how to do this and if this can be done using the switch/case statement?
