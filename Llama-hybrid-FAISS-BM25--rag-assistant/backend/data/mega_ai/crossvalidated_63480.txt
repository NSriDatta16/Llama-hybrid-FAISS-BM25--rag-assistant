Machine learning idea : you could train a binary or one-class classifier of your choice to recognize what patterns in CPRD data indicate a hospitalization. You can use the HES data to label positive patterns in the CPRD data (e.g. those patterns that signify a hospitalization). I assume you could also use HES data to label negatives, if not, you'll need a one-class technique.
