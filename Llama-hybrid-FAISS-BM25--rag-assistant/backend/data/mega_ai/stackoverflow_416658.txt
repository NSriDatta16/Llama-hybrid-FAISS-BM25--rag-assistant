The Oracle at Delphi Pros: accuracy is superb Cons: if you can interpret the messages, which many people fail to do (often seeing what they want to see). Also requires supplication, which can get messy (contrary to popular opinion, your hecatomb need not be 100 of the same type of livestock). Psychics Pros: accurate to a point. Cons: rare. Prone to mental instability, highly vulnerable to eldritch beings, and might attract unwanted attention from them. Also, it takes experience to sort through the mystery that is the human mind to get to desired information. And sometimes you still need to probe subjects while they're actually doing the thing they need help with, since users lie. Plant a mole Pros: New gadgets. New Poisons! Plans within plans within plans. Baby's a freak show. You might learn all sorts of fascinating things in addition to the information you need to help the user. Cons: Expensive. Chances remain that the agent will turn on you, or fail to learn anything you couldn't learn more simply. If discovered, organization will likely turn or liquidate the asset, which represents a huge investment of resources. Organization might reciprocate. Guess Pros: Take a group of people with average to great imaginations and problem solving skills, give them some booze and inspire them with some quotes from Ghostbusters, Big Trouble in Little China, or The Big Lewbowski. Who knows where it will go, but it'll be fun and they might produce something interesting/useful. Cons: Chances of meeting user's needs are higher than you think, but not that good. Ask the user Pros: users feel empowered as part of the process. cons: until they have to decide on anything, at which point you are on your own. Unless the user is a very experienced user, in which case they probably have a good idea of what the want. There's only like 4 experienced users on the planet though, and nobody ever knows anyone who gets to do a job for them. They may be mythical beasts. Pretend you care and ask the user (even though you don't really), and then observe them doing whatever key workflow/process/etc is involved and pay attention to what they do. Pros: you trick the users into thinking their opinion matters, which empowers them but doesn't deliver any other baggage. Since users lie - no purposefully or maliciously mind - you actually get to see them in action and get a better grasp of what the problem is, thus giving you a better foundation for building a solution. Also, you avoid the psychic route, and thus avoid a long and winding road that begins with promise but ends with you and the psychic being eaten by some monstrous, unspeakable thing that is not of this world. Observing the process is like totally Zen, which is good for your Developer Mystique. Cons: No road trip to the Oracle (which would be EPIC). Spies are much sexier; chicks dig spies. Ghostbusters|Big Trouble in Little China|The Big Lewboski probably aren't involved. Feels more like work than the rest of the options.
