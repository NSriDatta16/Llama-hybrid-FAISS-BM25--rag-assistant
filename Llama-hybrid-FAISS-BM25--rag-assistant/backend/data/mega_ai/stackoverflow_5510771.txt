Looking for wrong fragment class with Android compatibility library

I am trying to inflate a layout containing a Fragment using the backwards compatibility package and SDK level 10. I took the jar file and placed it in the libs folder of my project. I extended FragmentActivity. It all works perfectly when I run at API level 11 on an XLarge screen device. When I drop back to compiling against level 10, and running on a normal sized screen, I get failure at the point where it create a new Activity and inflate the fragment in it. Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: android.view.fragment in loader dalvik.system.PathClassLoader[/data/app/com.motoappsummitagenda-1.apk] 04-01 01:07:14.311 2870 2870 E AndroidRuntime: at dalvik.system.PathClassLoader.findClass(PathClassLoader.java:243) So it looks like something, somewhere is looking for android.view.fragment, and not the compatibility version, android.support.v4.app.Fragment. Of course, android.view.fragment won't be found on API level 10. But where is that android.view.fragment coming from? The XML that is being inflated is The code for it starts: package com.motorapp; import java.util.List; import java.util.ListIterator; import android.content.Intent; import android.net.Uri; import android.os.Bundle; import android.support.v4.app.Fragment; import android.view.LayoutInflater; import android.view.View; import android.view.View.OnClickListener; import android.view.ViewGroup; import android.widget.LinearLayout; import android.widget.ScrollView; import android.widget.TextView; import android.support.v4.app.*; import android.support.v4.util.*; import android.support.v4.*; import android.support.v4.widget.*; public class SessionFragment extends android.support.v4.app.Fragment { The symptoms are similar to this problem, but I don't have those mistakes inflating fragments with compatibility package android The android.compatibility.v4.android-support-v4 jar file is on my build path in Eclipse under Project > Properties > Java build path I have in the manifest (and I have tried different variations of the name). In getting started with fragments, I first used API 11 on a honeycomb device, and that all works perfectly. It is in getting the same code (modified to use the slightly different compatibility API) working with the compatibility library that I have this problem. Any ideas would be very welcome. Thanks, Peter
