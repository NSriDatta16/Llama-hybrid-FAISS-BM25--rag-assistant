How to find the dependent variables from a dataset?

I am stuck at where how can I get the most dependent variables based on the mean I have this dataset and when I try to: df.groupby('left').mean() It gives the output: And one of my friends said, from that graph the dependent variables for the attribute left will be 1.Satisfaction Level 2.Average Monthly Hours 3.Promotion Last 5 Years I am wondering How could someone guess that ?
