You will need to rebuild form at the end of processing form1_submit, this will keep the previously submitted values intact. This is some what a scenario of multistep forms, but a bit different from the way it was done in Drupal 5. function mymoduel_test_form1_submit($form, &$form_state) { $form_state['storage']['test_1'] = 'test 1'; drupal_set_message(t('@message', array('@message' => $form_state['storage']['test_1']))); $form_state["rebuild"] = TRUE; } Hope this helps, Sarfaraz
