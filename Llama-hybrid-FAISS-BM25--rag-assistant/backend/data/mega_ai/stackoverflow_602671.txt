I'd start by looking at the latest c# enhancements. Also, it really depends on what type of job it is as there are a lot of things an ASP.Net developer won't know about Winforms and vice versa. Assuming asp.net, I've been asked the following in interviews over the past 18 months: Page Life Cycle Generics Interfaces / basic OO design SQL; e.g. joins, updates, inserts, etc. Also, how to use DataReader and sqlcommand. LINQ syntax; not because anyone is really using this, rather because they read about it. Web Services ( asmx and wcf ) basic html / css Session strategies for single server / load balanced Differences between gridview, repeater, etc. What I've found is that most .net "web" dev's don't know diddly about sql or html. If you can prove you know more than just how to "drag and drop" controls on a web form then you're already better than 90% of the guys you'll run into.
