Jquery UI Tabs add class

Below is my HTML set up for the tabs which all works fine, i want to extend it a bit by changing the class of the outer containing div (id=tab-wrap class=bike) to whatever tab is showing. The idea is to change the background image based on the tab. Battery Finder Choose Your Application then find your battery Bike ATV UTV Snow Water Bike content ATV content UTV content Snow content Water content So if i select the tab "water" i'd like to change the class from: to An elegant fade in/out change would be good. My jquery is as follows $(document).ready(function() { $("#tabs").tabs({ fx: { height: 'toggle', opacity: 'toggle' } }); }); Appreciate the help Thanks
