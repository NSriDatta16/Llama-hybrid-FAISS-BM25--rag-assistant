I encounter this quite frequently when dealing with customer daily time series data. It appears that many accounting systems IGNORE daily data that didn't occur i.e. no transactions were recorded for that day (time interval/bucket) and don't fill in a '0" number . Since time series analysis require a reading for every interval/bucket we need to inject a "0" for the omitted observation. Intervention Detection is essentially a scheme to detect the anomaly and replace it with an expected value based on an identified profile/signal/prediction. If there are many of these 'missing values" the system can break down The problem becomes a little more complex when there is strong day-of-the-week profile in the historical data and a "sequential patch of values" are not recorded, suggesting that replacement values be obtained by computing local daily averages as a precursor to fine-tuning these values.
