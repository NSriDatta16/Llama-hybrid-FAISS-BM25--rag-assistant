iPhone: How to Tell Which Scrollview Calls the Delegate Methods?

The answer to this is probably right under my nose, but I am not seeing it. Maybe someone here could help. I have a scrollView that allows for vertical scrolling. I set it up: [clefScrollView addSubview:clefView]; [clefScrollView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(clefView.frame.size.width, clefView.frame.size.height)]; clefScrollView.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = YES; clefScrollView.showsHorizontalScrollIndicator = NO; clefScrollView.delegate = self; I have the following methods included in the same file, in order to support the UIScrollViewDelegate protocol: - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate { NSLog(@"%f %f", scrollView.contentOffset.y, scrollView.contentSize.height); } - (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { NSLog(@"scrollViewDidEndDecelerating"); } - (void)scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { NSLog(@"scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation"); } - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { NSLog(@"scrollViewDidScroll"); } In addition, the .h file for my class includes the protocol: @interface ClefNotesViewController : UIViewController { The problem is that no matter what, the following two are never called: -scrollViewDidEndDecelerating -scrollViewDidScroll The other two methods do get called in response to different events. Given that two of the protocol methods are getting called, I assume that I have correctly set the delegate to my self. So, what is the problem? Thanks! Update: I found the problem, although haven't still figured out how to resolve it. My class spans two files. In the second file, a different scrollView is implementing -scrollViewDidEndDecelerating -scrollViewDidScroll THe question is, how can I define two different sets of methods for two different UIScrollViews, in the same class? I could try to handle two scrollViews with the same delegate methods, but that's ugly since I won't be able to keep each set of delegates with the scrollView's file. I could also split my class. Is there another way?
