Some of this will depend on your familiarity with Objective-C and it's API's. Having said that, the Hilleglass Cocoa book and the Dave Mark book are both excellent (especially the Dave Mark book). I haven't read the Big Nerd Ranch book yet, but these two are 'must haves'. Dave Mark's book puts every other book on programming for the iPhone to shame. In addition to those you probably want to take a hard look at 'Cocoa Design Patterns' by Erik Buck and 'Programming in Objective-C 2.0' by Stephen Kochan. The Cocoa API's are heavily influenced by Design Patterns and understanding how to use them as well as the language semantics will go a long way. You may want to add a couple of specific books on some of the Cocoa API's as well, specifically Core Data and Core Animation. Understanding Core Data very well will change your coding abilities forever. The best book on that subject is the Pragmatic one by Marcus Zarra. Having more then a couple of books is always a good thing... ;-)
