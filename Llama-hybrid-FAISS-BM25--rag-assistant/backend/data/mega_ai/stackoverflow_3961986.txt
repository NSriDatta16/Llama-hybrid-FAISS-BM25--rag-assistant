JqGrid: Trying to add a + button to the right of a "add" form field (using elmsuffix)

I can get the icon to show up, and it fires a simple alert if I place the javascript line in the href but I cannot attach a dialog object to the link id. I am using "elmsuffix" to get the html there: This works: {name:'name',index:'name',width:100, editable: true, formoptions:{elmsuffix: " "}}, This does not: $("#companysearch").click(function(){ alert('yay it worked!'); }); {name:'name',index:'name',width:100, editable: true, formoptions:{elmsuffix: " "}}, Its almost like the scopes are preventing the objects to work with each other (or am I just plain, approaching it wrongly) Thanks Andrew Finegan
