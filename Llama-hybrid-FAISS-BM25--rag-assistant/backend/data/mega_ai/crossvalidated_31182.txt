$$\text{Var}\bigg(\sum_{i=1}^m X_i\bigg) = \sum_{i=1}^m \text{Var}(X_i) + 2\sum_{i\lt j} \text{Cov}(X_i,X_j).$$ So, if the covariances average to $0$, which would be a consequence if the variables are pairwise uncorrelated or if they are independent, then the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. An example where this is not true: Let $\text{Var}(X_1)=1$. Let $X_2 = X_1$. Then $\text{Var}(X_1 + X_2) = \text{Var}(2X_1)=4$.
