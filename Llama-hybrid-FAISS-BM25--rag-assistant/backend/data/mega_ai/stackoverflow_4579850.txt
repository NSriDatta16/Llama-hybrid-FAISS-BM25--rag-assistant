It can happen that you have not created your provisioning profile for the same application id. The easiest is to create a provisioning profile for the app id "*" (in case you are not using special things, like push) - and you can use this provisioning profile for every application of yours. Also - you can delete your provisioning profile from the apple developer website and your xcode organizer, and you click on the refresh button in organizer then xcode will talk to the apple dev website and download a new one for you. Hope this helps, Moszi
