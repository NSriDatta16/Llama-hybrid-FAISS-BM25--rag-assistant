Yes it makes sense, and all employees should be considered (up to the time they leave) I think you are slightly confusing the time to failure analysis: Probability of failing in each time period is independent of what happened before. However, a basic model with no time dependence fitted to eg up to 5 year employees will sooner or later churn, so your 20 year employee is unlikely to occur... But there is no reason that you can't add eg time dependence in your model ( eg probability of churning in each 3 month period decays linearly with time period), and you can add arbitrary nonlinear functions of time too. Treat as discrete time survival analysis Use a probabilistic classifier such as logistic regression or xgboost to predict churn in each 3 month period for each employee (add all the variables you want, time or employee.. ) Then you have 2 small issues. A) generate person period data set B) generate survival time profile by chaining survival probability of each period. IE prob survival in 9 months = product of probability of survival of each 3 month period. https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-can-i-convert-from-person-level-to-person-period/
