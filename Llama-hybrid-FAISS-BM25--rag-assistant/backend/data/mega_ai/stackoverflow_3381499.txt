Is it possible to make our site's content at least accessible in all conditions? Yes it is. What makes HTML well designed for this is that the proper use of semantic mark-up means that you don't have to think about individually all those cases that you listed. I find it useful to consider the most difficult cases. If the user has failing sight and hearing and needs or wants to use a Braille device to browse the web , can they use your web site? If the user is quadriplegic and needs to navigate web pages using a sip-and-puff input device , can they use your web site? In each case, does your web site provide them with the best experience that they are capable of receiving? Cover those cases, add a few basics like ensuring adequate colour contrast, make your web site as functionally rich and attractive as you wish for your average users, and you should find that support for the cases you list can be left to the devices themselves to provide appropriate accessibility support. Read, understand and use WCAG 2.0 and WAI-ARIA. You will gain a much better understanding of the techniques you need than by asking individual questions on SO.
