Assorted list of what's new in Delphi [Language, RTL, VCL]?

As someone who's been stuck at the older versions of Delphi and upgraded to D2010 lately, I figure I still use the language, RTL and VCL features from the D5 era and refrain from using these new features as the documents on those are somewhat decentralized around the blogosphere. So I'd like to ask if there was an assorted list like what's new docs of Python's - clear and concise to the point. Btw, please no screencasts. They seem to be quite abundant lately (probably because of CodeRages) but I find them very unintuitive to learn from. Let's leave that docs in video format thing to RoR community, shall we :).
