I am having this problem too, and think I can see what is happening. The "column" block with the massive (5678 pixel) margin and padding makes that block very tall. In browsers other than Firefox, the positive and negative values cancel each other out, but FF really does make it that tall - kind of. FF also knows the two cancel each other out, but seems to look at the 5678px padding and decides the column block is poking out the bottom of the #wrapper block. This is overflow - and with overflow set to auto on #wrapper, you see the true size of #wrapper with a scroll-bar down the side. With overflow set to hidden, FF takes away the scrollbar, but still seems to scroll the contents of #wrapper so that the item the fragment points to is at the top of the page. This is normal behaviour for fragment links in scrollable blocks, but since there is no scrollbar, you cannot scroll the content back down again, hence it looks like the layout has been effected by the fragment. So in short, I suspect that FF is operating an invisible scrollbar in this example. That could be considered a bug, but it is probably correct behaviour. Being able to scroll the content up and down inside a non-overflowed fixed-sized block using URL fragments, is a technique that can be used effectively to implement image "sliders" that work even in the absence of JavaScript. Hope that helps. This has been puzzling me for years, and this explanation suddenly struck me out the blue. My current workaround for this is to use jQuery "scroll to" plugin to scroll the whole page down to the fragment, as this seems to prevent the contents of #wrapper from scrolling internally. You can also take "display: hidden" off #wrapper, but your page then ends up half a mile long.
