I'm quite happy to do my first stackoverflow post here - cause you are discussing my article :-) I think this construction (leverage of both builder and fluent interface: fluent builder) greatly improves code readability. What is more (and not getting into discussion around design patterns) it proves its value when we need immutable objects. Simply, by making constructor private and removing all the setters, we gain a very powerful tool for an elegant and readable, yet powerful way of building immutable objects. Finally, the whole post was supposed to be more about smart usage of templates to generate repeatable code - but I pretty like the discussion.
