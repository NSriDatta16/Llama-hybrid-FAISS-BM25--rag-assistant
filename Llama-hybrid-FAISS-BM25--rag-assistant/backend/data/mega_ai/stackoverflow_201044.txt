It can be done without programming, but there is one bit of information you need to add in order for this to make sense - the date or sequence number for each entry. Then you will be able to plot: salary code: the series date or sequence number: the x-axis In Time: the value / y-axis The easiest way is with the PivotChart Wizard: select the (now) 3 columns and choose "Data | PivotTable and PivotChart Report.." select PivotChart type click through the wizard to completion ... you should end up the raw chart page right-click chart are, choose "chart type" and change to "line" type from the "PivotTable Field List", choose: date or sequence number - add to "Category Axis" salary code - add to the series axis in time - add to the data area By default, it will plot "Count of In Time": need to change this right-click the "Count of In Time" field button widget choose "Format PivotChart Field" change to sum, average, max or min (anything that represents the actual data - it only applies to the one value so aggregate functions are fine) Now your chart lines should be OK, but the y-axis is just a meaningless value. right-click the y-axis and choose "format axis" go to the "Number" tab and change the format to "Time" Voila! Lines for each salary code, plotting the "in time" trend day by day
