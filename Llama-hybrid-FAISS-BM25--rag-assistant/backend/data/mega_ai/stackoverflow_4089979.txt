SQL Server 2005 SSIS padding TAB-delimited results

When I execute a simple SELECT * FROM... query (seven columns) in Management Studio and then save the results as a TAB-delimited text file, the resulting file is generated and delimited properly, but when I run the same query in SSIS to produce the same text file, it insists on right-padding all varchar columns with spaces. It delimits properly, but column values take up their full column width of space, similar to a fixed-width format. I tried setting the text file data connection to ragged-right instead of delimited, but in that case it doesn't allow me to specify TAB as the delimiter. I'm trying to figure out what is different in the way SSIS formats the output from the output from Management Studio.
