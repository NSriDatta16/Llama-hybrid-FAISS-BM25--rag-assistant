Maximum likelihood estimation with unknown distribution

I want to fit a model to some data using structural time series modeling and Kalman filtering. The hyperparameters need to be tuned using maximum likelihood estimation. I am using the Python package statsmodels that does this for me, but nowhere I need to put in which distribution I assume my model follows. Does it automatically use a Gaussian distribution? I am planning to select the right model using BIC. Should I check each one for normality first? And if it's not, what would be a good next step to take?
