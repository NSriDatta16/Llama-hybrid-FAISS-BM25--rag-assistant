Clojure defers memory management to the JVM. While I don't know clojure's codebase deeply, it probably just reassigns the vars with the reloaded code - which will leave the old objects around until the JVM runs the garbage collector. You can hint to the JVM that you want the GC to run using (System/gc), but it's generally not recommended to use. Alternatively, if you know the contraints of your system, you can tinker with the JVM memory flags to encourage the GC to run more frequently (ie - use a lower heap size). But if you have a system that's not really memory constrained, saving a few mbs doesn't matter much.
