You have a classloader leak! You'll generally find that when you deploy an application on any JavaEE application server (including Glassfish), the application server will create a new classloader specifically for your application. When your application is initialized, and as it runs, that class loader will load new classes, which will be placed into permanent memory, referred to as the PermGen region. When the application is undeployed, that classloader is supposed to be garbage-collected, but sometimes that doesn't happen because something is causing the reference to persist. When you redeploy your application, the application server goes through the same motions as before, but now, there is less memory available. For more information on this, take a look at Frank Kieviet 's blog post called Classloader Leaks and the follow-up on How to Fix Classloader Leaks .
