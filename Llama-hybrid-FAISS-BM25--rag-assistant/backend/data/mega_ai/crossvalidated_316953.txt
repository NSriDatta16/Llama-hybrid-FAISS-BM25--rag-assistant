Could you look at the normal Q-Q plot, which sorts your residuals from the lowest (should be negative) to the highest and fits them into normal quantiles?? Carlos, here you may see the tails (leftmost and rightmost) are more extreme than the normal distribution should be (we say heavy-tails), meaning that the model violates the normal assumption. From the residual-fitted plot, it is possible to say that the residuals are non-constant (heteroscedasticity). So, I suggest you, if you are interested in diagnostics, to try also $\bullet$ half-norm plot (check high leverage point) $\bullet$ Bonferroni correction (check outliers)
