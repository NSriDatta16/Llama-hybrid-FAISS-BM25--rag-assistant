Your views, and their controllers can handle a touch using touchesBegan, touchesEnded or touchesMoved. Within touchesBegan as an example you can then choose to pass the event to the next responder in the responder chain. This way each of your views will get a chance to do something based on the touch event. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //do something here and then pass the event on [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; }
