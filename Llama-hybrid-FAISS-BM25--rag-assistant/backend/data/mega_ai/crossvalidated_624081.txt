Is this a dimensionality reduction problem?

I have an interesting (hopefully) data science problem and I want to post it here for discussion. Let's say we have a data set having ONE numerical column and FIVE categorical columns. For categorical columns, they have different number of unique levels. Below provides a sample. A: A1, A2, ..., A5 B: B1, B2, ..., B100 C: C1, C2, C3 D: D1, D2 E: E1, E2, ..., E10 F: numerical column I want to summarize F (e.g., students' score) with different combinations of the categorical columns. However, if certain categorical columns have too many levels (e.g., B has 100 levels in the sample above), then the number of combinations will be huge (e.g., 5 * 100 * 3 * 2 * 10 = 30000 ). In addition, for certain combinations, the cohort (sample) size is super small, and summarizing F with such combination provides little data insight since there is almost no statistical significance. My question is how can we automatically select categorical columns to summarize F ? Can we treat it as a dimensionality reduction problem? Any input is appreciated. Appendix Here I want to elaborate more on summarizing F . For now, I want to calculate summary statistics of F , such as mean and median. Below I provide a sample SQL code. SELECT A, B, C, D, E, AVG(F) FROM data.frame GROUP BY A, B, C, D, E
