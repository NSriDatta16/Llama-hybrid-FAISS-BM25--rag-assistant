A1 - Using a Javaagent redefineClasses works within JIT, but puts limitations on the changes that can be made. Obviously this is not the same mechanism as JVMTI but underneith they are both using the same API so I would expect you will see the same result. A2 - I have never used anything other than the thread that the JVM gave me. Since the changes affect the ClassLoaders I see no reason why it won't work but that does not help you know for sure.
