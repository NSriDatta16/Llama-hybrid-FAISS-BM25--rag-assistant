A friend of mine told me about his team that had the Zucchini of Doom. Anyone breaking the nightly build had to display the ZoD on their desk. This vegetable was in a fairly advanced state of decomposition, which sent out the message quite clearly that a broken build was not something to be tolerated. If the team isn't motivated enough to keep the nightlies building then this is something that should be enforced/encouraged by the managers.
