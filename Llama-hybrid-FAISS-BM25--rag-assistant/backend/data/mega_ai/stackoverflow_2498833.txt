Isn't a shopping cart a user bundle by definition? You can save the order information and create bundled items from that Create an administration module that parses the information from orders and chooses automatically the most selected group of packages and creates automatically a product based on that. If you want to involve the user that is more work for the CRM than for Magento, allowing the user to create bundle products and save them. Update From your comments I see 2 ways of solving this issue with the help of the checkout and order object - when a selection is saved. without any connection with the checkout process you'll build a frontend module that will save independently a bunch of products and will transform the selection into a backend bundle product that will be later available to all users. Steps to do towards this approach build the interface to let the user select several products make a save action that will grab the currently selected products from a cookie or somewhere and tranform that in the background in a product. save the product and reindex the site to have the product available
