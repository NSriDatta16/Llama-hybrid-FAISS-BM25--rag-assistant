Negative value in CI after bootstrap

I performed bootstrap (10 000 samples) in boot package for R (multivariate model, binary logistic regression with FirthÂ´s correction). One variable in the model has after bootstrap negative value in confidence interval, i.e. CI 95% = (-0,403, 1,103). Can someone explain please what does it mean and how to interpret it? The variable is birth weighth and the model should estimate predictors for mortality. Thanks!
