Coder collaboration best practices using Git

I'm having some troubles in understanding Git team-working principles. Consider a team of two programmers: A and B . They are working on a Project . Also, there is a remote server with a repo on it. A and B are collaborating remotely. There are some code in the repo already. I have a favour to ask you for help on organizing their step-by-step workflow on Git. 1. Have they to create their own local branches? 2. How they could upload working code on a production server? rsync ? Any help will be appreciated.
