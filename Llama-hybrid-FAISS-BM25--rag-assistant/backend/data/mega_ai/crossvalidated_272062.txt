How to create data agreeing with study results?

I'm teaching hypothesis testing at a high school and came across this "study" on "Chocolate causes weight loss". I'd really like to look at it in class with my students and not only discuss its maths but also what the problems of this study (and many more, but probably less intentional) is. Unfortunately, the study does not contain the raw data of the participants and since the participants are all identifiable now (appeared on a TV documentary), the author cannot make the data public. I'd like to recreate more or less realistic data (just for the weight) for the three groups (low-carb, chocolate, control) such that it roughly matches the result given in the study. The study only shows two figures picturing daily weight development by group and cumulated change of weight by group. It is known that there were 15 participants starting with an average weight of 81.5kg. The weight change after 21 days was documented to be -3.1% (low-carb), -3.2% (chocolate) and +0.7% (control). Lastly, they state "the weight reduction of this (chocolate) group exceeded the results of the low-carb group by 10% after only three weeks (p = 0.04)". Question: What would be the easiest way to recreate such data? Ideally, this method also works for very different data, so I can reuse it to create further exercises in the future. In other topics of maths, it is rather easy to "start from the solution" and create an exercise, but in statistics, I usually end up just using some numbers, hoping for the best and correcting until it works.
