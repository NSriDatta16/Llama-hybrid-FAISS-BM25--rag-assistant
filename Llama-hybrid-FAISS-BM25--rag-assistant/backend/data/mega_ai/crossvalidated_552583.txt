Generalized difference-in-difference: pre-period & pre-trend

In this post @Thomas Bilach provides a clear explanation that in a difference-in-difference setting, a difference in outcome levels is allowed, but their time variation as exhibited by the trends should be reasonably similar pre-shock. However, I have three questions about this concept based on a generalized difference-in-difference setting used in the paper by (Dottling, 2020) . First question : In table 3 on page 46 the author provides OLS regressions results of the different periods in the sample (including a separate OLS regression for the pre-period) to complement the difference-in-difference results. The author shows that in the pre-period High-ESG funds have relatively higher flows compared to average-ESG funds. My question is about the interpretation of these results. Do these additional OLS regression showcase that High-ESG funds have higher absolute levels of flows in the pre-period or does it tell something about the pre-trends ? Second question : How can you formally test the parallel trend assumption in a generalized difference-in-difference setting like this, where you have weekly-panel-data and the crisis affects all groups however with different intensities? Third question: Do the higher flows in the High-ESG class during the pre-period (as indicated in question 1) cause problems when you try to formally test this (with for example an event-study)?
