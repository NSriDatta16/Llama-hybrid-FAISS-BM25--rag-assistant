Would you take a bayesian answer? You get a credible interval instead of a confidence interval, which is a different beast. But on the plus side it's very natural to have a prior that only has support from 0 to 1, then model each observation as coming from a truncated normal centered around the characteristic mean purity. If these seem like reasonable assumptions given your knowledge about crystals then the posterior will be a similarly good summary for talking about the crystal purity.
