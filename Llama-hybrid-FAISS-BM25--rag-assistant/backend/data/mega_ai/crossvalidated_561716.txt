Sure, you can get causal inference form cross-sectional data. But simply regressing $Y$ on $X$ is not sufficient. First, the causal problem must be well-defined, where simply looking for an association is not enough. Second, certain assumptions about the assignment mechanism (i.e., the mechanism that assigns certain unit to being treated, and other to being not treated) must hold (e.g., unconfoundedness , common support ). Regression usually allows us to causally infer if we rely on the potential outcomes framework (see Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974; Imbens and Rubin, 2015). The idea is to postulate two potential outcomes $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ , where the former denotes the outcome that a unit experiences if she does not receive the treatment, and similarly for the latter. Then, the causal effect is simply $Y(1) - Y(0)$ . We usually focus on some expectation of this difference, such as the Average Treatment Effect ( ATE ), which is often obtaning via a linear regression. Although a disagreement exists on this, for the problem to be well-defined we must have some control on the $X$ variable believed to cause $Y$ . For instance, a well-defined causal question may be whether a certain training program raises the salary for those who attend the program. By contrast, some researchers believe that gender cannot be the focus of a causal study, since we cannot control it (see Holland, 1986, where variables that cannot considered as cause are called "attributes"). Even if someone changes gender, that would not result in a modification of a characteristic of that person, just in the unit being considered a new unit. Again, this is debatable. Sorry for the long digression. Anyway, going back to your question, if you are able to well-define a causal question regarding the effect of brain atrophy on slow walking in the sense mentioned above, and you have access to a sample of observations satisfying certain assumptions, then yes, you can get causal conclusions, often obtained by running the following linear regression: $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{slow walking} = \beta_0 + \delta\, \text{brain atrophy} + \beta X + \epsilon$ Under the conditions stated above, $\delta$ corresponds to the ATE , and $\hat{\delta}$ is your estimated average effect. However, there may be some problems of endogeneity , such as reverse causality , where it may be that $Y$ causes $X$ , and not viceversa. If the problem is ill-defined, we just get correlations about variables, and reverse causality is a real issuem while if the problem is well-defined, then we feel sort of safe. That being said, as far as I know causality is not a relevant concept in some fields such as medicine or biology, while it is vital in economics and other social sciences. So, it may be that you are not at all interested in all this stuff, and being able to predict your $Y$ given some $X$ is all you care about. But be aware of not talking about causality then. BONUS Linear regression under completely randomized experiment (where unconfoundedness and common support are satisfied by definition) ensures that all the technical econometric assumptions needed for the finite-sample unbiasedeness and the consistency of the OLS estimates hold by definition! So, linear regression in completely randomized experiments gives you a "good" estimate of the ATE (see Imbens and Rubin, 2015, something arounf chapter 6 or 7).
