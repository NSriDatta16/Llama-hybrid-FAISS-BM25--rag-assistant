Firefox 4 iframe issues

I'm having some weird iframe problems with firefox. I'm using 4.0.1. I'm embedding a gcal. Here's the code And this gcal works perfectly in chrome and opera, just doesn't display at all in firefox. The html isn't called at all, and it just displays an empty iframe with empty and elements. Funny thing is if I put two of the same iframe consecutively, the second iframe will appear correctly. I tried doing and to my utter suprise this does what I want it to. This is super juke-y though and I don't want to leave it at that. WHY DOESN'T IFRAME WORK IN FIREFOX? //edit Another thing: the iframe appears correctly on the google page, where they provide you with the code to embed. That leads me to believe that my own site is the problem, but I have no idea why that would be the case, because I have no css or javascript targeting iframes or the div containing it. It also doesn't explain why it only happens in firefox. I also tried flushing the cache and clearing cookies and everything.
