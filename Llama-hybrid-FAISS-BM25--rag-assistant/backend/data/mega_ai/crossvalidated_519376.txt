I assume the 5 columns are parameters for CUF then there should be a mathematical formula or model for CUF. Anyway since there is a variation in data you need Time-Series data prediction and I think the only way to do it is to build neural network model that you can train and has five inputs (Tchg,Tcold,Pchg,Qchg..) and CUF as output layer. Tensorflow and pytorch are all good starting point for building CNN check here: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv1D and also hybrid approach (quasi-recurrent neural networks, QRNN) as discussed by Bradbury et al (2016) https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576
