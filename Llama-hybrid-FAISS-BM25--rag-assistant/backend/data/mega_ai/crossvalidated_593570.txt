How to take sample of data from very unbalanced DataFrame so as to not lose too many '1' for Machine Learning in Python?

I have DataFrame in Python Pandas like below with ID and Target variable (for machine learning model). My DataFrame is really large and unbalanced. I need to make sampling on my DataFrame because it is really large Balancing the DataFrame looks like this: 99.60% - 0 0.40 % - 1 ID TARGET 111 1 222 1 333 0 444 1 ... ... My question is: How to sample the data, so as not to lose too many ones (target = 1), which are very rare anyway, in the next step, of course, I will add the remaining variables and perform over sampling, nevertheless at the begining i need to take smample of data. How can I do that in Python ?
