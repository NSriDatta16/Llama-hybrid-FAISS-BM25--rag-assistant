Pre-Load Multiple Videos in Flash? In Flex?

I'm doing a project where we play multiple videos back to back, and if we load them the normal way by providing a stream url, there is a load delay each time we start the next video. I've looked through Adobe's docs for both Flash and Flex, and I can't find a way to pre-load the videos. Embedding them is not workable in this application. Ideally we would pre-load them, display a progress bar or other short video in the meanwhile, and only start the video playback when all the videos have loaded. I'm not used to asking questions of others for programming, I RTFM, but I find the Adobe docs to be lacking, and googling flash/flex problems is tough. There's a lot to sift through, and I can't find the relevant technique/solution. As to Flex/Flash I'm interested in the solution for either, or both. Perhaps it is the same, as it is actionscript?
