As Kniganapolke says, you want a hook theme implementation to call a template; Something like; function twtevents_theme(){ return array( 'template' => 'twtevents_gallery_gingerbread', 'arguments' => array() ); } Then place your template code into a file called twtevents_gallery_gingerbread.tpl.php in your module folder. Then update your page callback to call the theme function like this; function twtevents_gallery_gingerbread(){ return theme('twtevents_gallery_gingerbread'); } Now here is the important bit - once you've added the theme hook to your module you must clear your Drupal cache, otherwise it won't find your new template.
