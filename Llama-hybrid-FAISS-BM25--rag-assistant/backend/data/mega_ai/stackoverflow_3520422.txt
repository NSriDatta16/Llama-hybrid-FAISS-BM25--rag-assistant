Ethical Dilemma: Should I still cater for IE6 as a web-developer

Possible Duplicates: IE6: To support or not to support. Should we support IE6 anymore? I'd hate to (HATE TO) admit it, but there are some people still using this browser. A client of mine is facing an issue where the "transparency" area of a png comes out a light grey - ONLY on IE6. I know it's an unsupported browser, but some people STILL use it. I'd love to have a little discussion about whether or not I should choose to support it. One point pro-support of IE6 is that often in large organisations, the update of systems is often unimportant to their IT department, so theres a large proportion of people working in these organisations that still use IE6. Schools are the same. One point con-support of IE6 is that Microsoft no longer offer support for it, and it is considered a defunct browser, so why should I waste my time catering for it. It is a little bit of a dilemma. I'd love to hear other peoples responses to this.
