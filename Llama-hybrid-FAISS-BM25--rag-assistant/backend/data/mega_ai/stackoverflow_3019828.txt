Is it reasonable to use OpenGL for desktop applications?

I've been writing a small desktop gadget-type application that displays scrolling text along the bottom of the screen (Similar to the old CNN news ticker), however the performance of GDI is just unsatisfactory (As high as 8-12% on a quad core and 20% on a single core) even after I've attempted to clean out bottlenecks. I was considering using OpenGL instead to render everything, but I don't know if that is a reasonable option to require users to have hardware acceleration for a tiny app like this. Does anybody have any input on this?
