dynamically running a DLL at a remote Windows box?

Is there a way of dynamically running a DLL at a remote Windows box? Say a user wants to send a his own DLL file to a remote server and run a function in that DLL at the remote site. The user may be able to provide function entry points as well as required parameters, but no more. (e.g. no header file) I am thinking of setting up an agent executable at the remote site that can (1) dynamically load and bind a unknown DLL and (2) run a function with parameters. Is this a good a approach, or is such an executable possible?
