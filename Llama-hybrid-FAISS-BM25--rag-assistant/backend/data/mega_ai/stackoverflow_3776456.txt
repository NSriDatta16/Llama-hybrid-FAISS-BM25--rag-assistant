Mootools and repeated js execution

How do you make javascript codes execute repeatedly? Say I have a DIV with id='box' and with innerHTML of 1. Then, say we have a link "add me up", which when you click and hold your mouse, the function will repeatedly increment the inner html by 1 until you let go of the mouse? dragging mootools into the scenario, how can i run the code repeatedly in 2 second delay each?
