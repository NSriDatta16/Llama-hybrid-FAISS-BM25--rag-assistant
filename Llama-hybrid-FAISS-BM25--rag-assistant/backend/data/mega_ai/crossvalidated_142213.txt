The question asks if there are other problems than type I error inflation that come with fishing expeditions. A type I error occurs when you reject the null hypothesis (typically of no effect) when it is true. A generalization, related to type I errors but not quite the same, is that even when the null is false (i.e., there is some effect) fishing expeditions will lead to overestimates of the size (and hence importance) of the effects found. In other words, when you aren't looking at a particular variable, but look at everything and focus your attention on whatever is the largest effect, the effects you find may not be $0$, but are biased to appear larger than they are. An example of this can be seen in my answer to: Algorithms for automatic model selection .
