Not sure exactly what you mean; Form.ShowDialog is only modal with respect to the parent, not the application, unless the application is single threaded. For example, I made an app to test this which was organized like the following: mainform: 2 buttons, each of which begins a thread that creates a frmDialog1 and calls ShowDialog frmDialog1: single button which creates a frmDialog2 and calls ShowDialog on it. frmDialog2: does nothing (ie. blank) when they were all running I could access/drag mainform. I could also do the same with frmDialog1 (both versions) only if I hadn't clicked the button that shows dialog 2.
