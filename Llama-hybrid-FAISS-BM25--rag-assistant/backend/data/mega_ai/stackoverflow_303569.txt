A property should map, intuitively if not exactly, to some storage mechanism of your class - be it an ivar declared in your @interface or something synthesized by the runtime. The act of calling a method such as canBecomeFirstResponder need not necessarily query the class for a storage mechanism which holds a trivial BOOL but rather causes some chain of events to fire off that queries the responder tree. That is to say that there is no firstResponder ivar as the value of any of those methods cannot be stored in a cache and must be determined at the time of their execution.
