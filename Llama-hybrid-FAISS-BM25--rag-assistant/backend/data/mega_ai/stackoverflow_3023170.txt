As said, for short code, which doesn't call outside the local scope and doesn't acquire any other locks, you can use critical sections via SyncObjs.TCriticalSection , for longer/more complicated code you may use SyncObjs.TMutex , which is waitable (with timeout), doesn't stall if the owning thread dies and can be shared by-name with another processes. Using these wrappers makes changes to the synchronization layer easier. In all cases, beware of dragons here: my answer to Difference between the WaitFor function for TMutex delphi and the equivalent in win32 API
