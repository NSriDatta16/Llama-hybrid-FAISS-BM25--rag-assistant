Conditional Poisson with Same Variable

Let $T$ be the amount of time needed for two cars to show up at a stop sign. The average rate of car showing up is 1 car per 10 minutes. Given that $T>5$ , what is the probability of $T>15$ ? I'm trying to do this problem with conditional probability but am tempted to think that I should just calculate for $P(T>15)$ but then that doesn't take into account of the conditional probability. If I do Baye's rule: $P(T>15,T>5)/ P(T>5)$ then the $P(T>15,T>5)$ doesn't make much sense either (Probability of T>15 and T>5). Does the top $P(T>15,T>5)$ collapse into $P(T>15)$ ? Or should I parse the timeline?
