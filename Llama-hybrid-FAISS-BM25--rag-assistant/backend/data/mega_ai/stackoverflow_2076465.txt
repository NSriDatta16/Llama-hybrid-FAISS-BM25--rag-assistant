Displaying images in AIR app

I want to display an image located in the app-storage directory of my AIR application. This image has to be displayed in an html text area where the html text is coming in from a local embedded sqlite database. When I put in the following code: imageTest.htmlText = ' '; nothing is displayed. But when instead of the app-storage path, I put in the absolute url of an image on the web, like below: imageTest.htmlText = ' '; the image is displayed correctly. Also, I checked that the app-storage method is able to locate the image, but it just does not display in an htmlText container. For example, the following code displays the image: imageTest.location = 'app-storage:/demo.jpg'; Any suggestions what I should do to get the image to display? I am using Adobe Flex Builder 3 as the IDE. Thanks Vinayak
