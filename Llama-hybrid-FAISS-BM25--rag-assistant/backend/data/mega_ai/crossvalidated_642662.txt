Does white noise guarantee that $X_{t-1}$ is uncorrelated with $u_t$?

I have a question about the properties of white noise in a time series context. Specifically, I want to know: If we assume that the error term $u_t$ in a time series model is white noise, does this guarantee that the lagged variable $X_{t-1}$ is uncorrelated with the current error term $u_t$ ? In other words, does the white noise assumption for the error term imply that $\text{Cov}(X_{t-1}, u_t) = 0$ ?
