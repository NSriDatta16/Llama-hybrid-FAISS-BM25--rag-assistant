Assuming that each observation is independent, then maybe we can model this using Bernoulli. The Bayesian approach would be that, Let $X$ be number of observation that doesn't belong to the 4 species you mentioned. Assume that, $$X \sim Bin(n,p)$$ $$p_{prior} \sim Beta(1, 1)$$ prior distribution of p is uniform here, i.e. any probability is equally possible. Then posterior probability of $p$ would be $$p_{posterior} \sim Beta(1+n_{success}\ , 1+n_{failure})$$ In your case posterior p has distribution of $Beta(1, 154)$. Expectation of probability of seeing a "new species" in the next observation should be $1/155$. And if you failed to observe a new species in your next observation, you can update this distribution to $Beta(1, 155)$ and the expectation of this distribution becomes $1/156$.
