Perhaps some of these suggestions might help. You can re-parent a control in the designer without having to do cut-and-paste. View the structure pane, and simply drag the visual control to the node of another parent in the structure pane. If you have things in a flowpanel, drag everything out of the flow panel and drag them back in the order that you want them to be. (You can re-parent ANY visual control this way, without changing anything other than its parent. I highly recommend doing it this way.) You can view the form as text, and move the declaration order around in there -- but obviously you'll need to be careful when editing the "resource" file directly. You can set tab order in the designer, so you could make a different control based on tab order that works as you want. You can right click on the form and change the creation order of the non-visual controls, but that doesn't work with visual controls.
