Measure precision

This is used in information retrieval. I have an algorithm that uses a sample set to predict a yes / no. I think the correct term is binomial. Yes this document is about sports or no this document is not about sports. I need to represent the effectiveness of the algorithm with that population and that question. Can I just compare the output from algorithm to the sample set. Clearly I need remove that item from the sample set to fairly evaluate the prediction. If I have a sample set of 1000 and as reviewed by an expert exactly 700 were about sports. If I go through the sample set one at a time and remove that item from the sample set and predict and compare the prediction to the actual value is that a fair measure of precision. If the prediction was correct on 990 of the items can I say the precision is 99%? I think it is silly to have have to get another X samples to test the prediction. If I remove that item from the sample set then can I not pretend it was the test of the sample set / algorithm? The sample set is random. I also use the sample set to estimate the number in the total population. I get that if I tweak the algorithm for conformance to the sample set then I cannot use that as a measure of precision. At that point I would need to test against a blind sample.
