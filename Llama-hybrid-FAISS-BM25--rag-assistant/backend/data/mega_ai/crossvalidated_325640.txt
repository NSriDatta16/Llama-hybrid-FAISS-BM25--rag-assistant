Possible alternatives: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop : I don't like the book's notation systems, but I heard the graphical model chapter is good Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy : like a dictionary, describe various of pre-deep-learning-era machine learning methods Deep Learning Book : Newer, covering more about deep learning part Dive into Deep Learning : Possibly newest deep learning book so far Also, try some course notes: CS229T: Statistical Learning Theory CS 228: Probabilistic Graphical Models CS 236: Deep Generative Models
