Look up the very basics (how to define a function, how to define a variable), then start coding C# in a real project. Look stuff up once you get stuck (or try the automatic converters mentioned in another answer). The differences are not large, so it will not delay your project significantly. Since there is (almost) a 1:1 correspondence between VB.NET and C# code, it's usually okay to "think VB.NET" and then write your code in C#. After you are familiar with the syntax, google for the differences between VB.NET and C# (i.e. what can you do in C# that won't work in VB.NET -- e.g. anonymous methods) and rework those things where C# allows for a more elegant solution.
