Where and how to store functions in asp.net.vb

I am using visual studio 2008, asp.net.vb I have various functions; 1 that calculates totals, 1 that calculates averages, 1 that calculates percentages etc. The data they act upon is different depending on the particular web page, but all my pages use these functions. So I want to know how I can store these functions in a single place so that all of my web pages can access the routines. At the moment all I know how to do is to write seperate functions in the code-behind for each individual web page. Obviously that is just so long winded and inefficient, but try as I might I can't figure out how to do it better. Please can anyone help. Many thanks.
