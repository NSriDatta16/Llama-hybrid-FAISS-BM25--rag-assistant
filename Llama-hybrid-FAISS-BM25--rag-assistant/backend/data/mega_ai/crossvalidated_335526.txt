For an eigenvector v, is it always true that v^tv =1?

I am reading this link PCA which is a very insightful tutorial however, in this tutorial, the author mentioned a constraint on PCA: $C^{T}C=1$ when we look at eigenvalue/eigenvector definition $Av=v\lambda$ there is no requirement for $v^{T}v=I$ I am quite a bit confused here. Can anyone tell me where I got it wrong?
