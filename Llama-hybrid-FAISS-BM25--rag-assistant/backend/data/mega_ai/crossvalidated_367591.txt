Correct autocorrelation when using reg3 in Stata

I'm running a simultaneous equation model (three equations) on a time series dataset using reg3 in Stata. Some colleagues are concerned that the problem of autocorrelation may be present. After running reg3 , I used lmareg3 to test autocorrelation and obtained the following results, My questions are 1) does the above result suggest that autocorrelation is present? 2) how to correct autocorrelation when using reg3 (like vce(robust) when using xtreg )?
