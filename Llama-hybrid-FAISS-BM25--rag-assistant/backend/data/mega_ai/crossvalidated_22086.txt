Just take partial derivatives. If you increase $x_1$ by one unit, then the expected value of $y$ increases by $\beta_1 + 2\beta_2 x_1$ units. Note that this effect depends upon the level of $x_1$. If you increase $x_3$ by one unit, then the expected value of $y$ increases by $\beta_3$ units. Note that this effect does not depend upon the level of $x_3$. As someone else mentioned, $\beta_0$ is the average value of $y$ when $x_1$ and $x_3$ are 0. I like to interpret the intercept as putting the regression through the point of means, the combination of the average $x_1$, the average $x_1^2$ ( not the (average of $x_1$)-quantity squared), the average $x_3$, and the average $y$.
