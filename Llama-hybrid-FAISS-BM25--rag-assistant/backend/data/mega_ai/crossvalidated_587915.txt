Using normal distribution to approximate t distribution in importance sampling

The question is Exercises 6 and 7 regarding importance sampling on page 273 of Bayesian Data Analysis 3 http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf . Exercise 6 approximate a normal distribution with a t distribution ( $t_3$ ) and exercise 7 does the opposite. I do not get why the authors claim that the importance weights are well behaved when you use $t_3$ to approximate normal but they become too variable when you use normal to approximate $t_3$ because based on the output of my R code (attached below), the histogram, the effective sample size (ess) and ESS are similar in these two situations. Can someone see what the authors mean? My second question is that exercise 7 asks to explain why the estimates of $var(\theta)$ are systematically low. I did observe this from the results. However I can not see the reason. #BDA3 10.6 S ```
