Bootstrapped confidence intervals for predicted probabilities seem too small (using glmer in lme4)

I am using logistic regression to examine factors affecting female reproductive status (0=inactive, 1=active) in a rodent species. My top model includes the fixed effect of "year" and a random effect "PitTag" to account for the repeated measures of individuals. I would like to generate a predicted probability of a female being reproductively active in each of the years as well as a 95% confidence interval for this prediction. The code and output for this model are: FSY1 |z|) (Intercept) -3.788 1.039 -3.646 0.000267 *** Year2009 5.907 1.167 5.060 4.19e-07 *** Year2010 2.421 1.102 2.196 0.028074 * Year2011 4.335 1.110 3.906 9.40e-05 *** Year2012 4.378 1.114 3.930 8.51e-05 *** Year2013 2.744 1.146 2.394 0.016672 * Year2014 6.058 1.318 4.595 4.32e-06 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 I am using this question as a template, because the situation described is very similar. As such, I am using code modified from the example to generate CIs using bootstrapping. The confidence intervals that I have generated seem suspiciously small! Can anyone provide some insight as to what I might be doing wrong?
