Unable to clone jQueryUI dialogs

I've got page on which a user is adding and editing a list of books. You can move them around, add new books, edit books already there... To add or edit each individual book, a dialog pops up containing a form with several input fields: title, author, genre, etc. I also have the Watermark plugin putting default text into each of these fields. Rather than iterate over and resetting each of these fields AFTER each book is saved back to the master list and the dialog is closed, in order to get the form ready for the next book, I'm thinking it'd be easier merely to use a clone of the form each time and then merely throw out the clone after each save: $( "#addEditBook" ).click(function() { $("#bookForm").clone().removeAttr("id").attr("id", "clonedBookForm").insertAfter("#bookForm"); $( "#clonedBookForm" ).dialog( "open" ); return false; }); In FireBug, I can see #clonedBookForm being created. And it's identical to the #bookForm below it. But that next line, .dialog( "open" ); throws this error: uncaught exception: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open' Note: I know the $( "#clonedBookForm" ).dialog({ autoOpen: false, modal: true, resizable: false, draggable: false, etc., etc. ...works because it works fine with the original #bookForm . Something about the events not being cloned? I'd love to get this sorted out, because I'd imagine throw-away clones of things would be a real time-saver... Thanks in advance!
