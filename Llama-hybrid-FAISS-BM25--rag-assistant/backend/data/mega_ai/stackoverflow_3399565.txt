Jquery: Count node separation in xml

I'm loading an xml document using JavaScript (Jquery $.ajax ). I need to be able to count the number of branches (b) separating 2 text nodes (s). E.g. Archaea Cyanobacteria Spirochaete Red rags Calliblepharis Liverwort Moss Bracken fern Scots pine Ginko Welwitschia So, how many branches is 'Scots pine' away from 'Calliblepharis', for example. In this case, the answer would be 4 (Seed plants > Land plants > Archaea > Eubacteria > Seaweeds). I also need to calculate the 'closest common ancestor' between 2 elements. For example, between 'Scots pine' and 'Ginko' it would be 'Bracken fern' (because Bracken fern is the closest species to the branch that contains 'Scots pine' and 'Ginko'). I'm really not sure how this would work when the 2 elements are very far from each other in different branches. Sorry if I'm using the wrong language here. Hope it makes sense.
