Alert generation on unseen data using deep learning

I am new in neural network and deep learning, trying to create a deep learning model to classify images. While reading blogs and videos, a question comes in my mind and not able to find the correct answer on internet. So that's the main reason to post question here. My question is how can i generate alert on unseen data? E.g. My trained model is able to classify following objects in the image: Truck Car Bike etc. But i want to generate an alert for given bicycle image to trained model. The point here is to be note that intentionally i am giving bicycle image. The current model predict it as a bike because its most of the features are matching with bike along with probability values for truck and car. Can anyone suggest me how can i implement this in deep learning?
