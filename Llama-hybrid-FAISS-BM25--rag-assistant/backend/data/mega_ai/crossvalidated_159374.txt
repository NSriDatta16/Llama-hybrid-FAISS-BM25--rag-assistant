To be honest, I have only rarely seen the term "incremental learning" come up. However, I have seen the "incremental" modifier used more often to describe specific out of memory implementations of various algorithms (e.g. incremental SVM, incremental decision trees) fairly frequently. It seems that use of "incremental" is used synonymously with "online" or "sequential."
