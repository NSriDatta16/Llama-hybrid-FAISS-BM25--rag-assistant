Multi-threaded access of components in Delphi

Can you suggest an approach when design-time components can be accessed both from general code (VCL or other) and from my own threads? The problem is that when I have full control over my own threads I know exactly when I should access mutexes. In case of design-time elements I have no control at least of the code related to VCL. One of the variants would be to wrap HandleMessage in a mutex access code. The idea behind this is that almost everything related to VCL comes from message processing code (the exception is direct SendMessage handling). But looking at the sources I see no "official" way to wrap message handling in any code fragment.
