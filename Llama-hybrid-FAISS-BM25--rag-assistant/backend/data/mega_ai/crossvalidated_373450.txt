There Be Dragons Here ... if you didn't design your study with intermediate analyses in mind ("stopping rules"), you can make some pretty big statistical mistakes (e.g. see here for an introduction). If you want to be able to use standard inferential tools reliably, you should carry on and perform the study the way it was designed. (I'm not sure exactly what you have in mind, but stopping the study now because the result happens to be statistically significant at the moment is a bad idea .) That said: a rough rule of thumb (which will still hold, more or less, for mixed models) is that your standard errors will be roughly proportional to $\sqrt{N}$ . If you collect 9 times as much data (i.e. sample 171 people in total instead of 19), you can on average expect your standard errors to shrink by approximately a factor of 3, with whatever effects that will have on your conclusions. If you insist on doing a power analysis now, it would be safest to forget the preliminary analysis you've just done and base it on the previously existing literature.
