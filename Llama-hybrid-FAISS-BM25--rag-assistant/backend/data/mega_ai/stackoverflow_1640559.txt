Simply select the and append the to it $("#stuff ul").append(' stuff '); If you actually wanted to copy the last element, change the class then add to the list, then you could do something like this var ul = $("#stuff ul"); ul.append(ul.find('li:last').clone().removeClass().addClass("samurai")); pass true into clone() if you also want to copy event handlers too. The problem with taking a whole chunk of HTML, changing an element and then reinserting is that any event handlers set up on elements that will be replaced when you reinsert the HTML will be lost, so it's more elegant/ and less cumbersome/intrusive to simply manipulate the part of the DOM that you need to.
