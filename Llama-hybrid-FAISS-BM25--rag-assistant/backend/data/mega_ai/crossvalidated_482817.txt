The closest I can get to articulate the point is to replace the wording to reflect what is implied (I use the principal/teacher analogy): "Please (do something) to increase overall test scores in the next semester." Now if you introduce outliers to increase the average, you'd contradict the word "overall", since now you only increase a few persons' scores while the others remain the same.
