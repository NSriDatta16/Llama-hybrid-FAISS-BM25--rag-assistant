How to recieve touches began event inside a subview?

I have a view containing two subviews(plain UIviews). The parent view recognizes touch events like touchesbegan ,ended, etc. but the sub view is not recognizing the touch event. How to make it recognize the touch event. Specifically i need only sub view to recognize touch events and not parent view. Thanks in advance. UserInteractionEnabled is set to YES for the views.
