Is there something like softmax but for top k values?

I have a dataset with binary labels of which exactly k outputs are 1, on which I want to train a neural network. If k=1, softmax can do the job of representing the output distribution. I am interested in k > 1. One approach that comes to mind is to use multiple sigmoid units and pick the top k outputs. With this, however, we cannot force the number of positive outputs to be exactly k. So, I was wondering if there is a better method.
