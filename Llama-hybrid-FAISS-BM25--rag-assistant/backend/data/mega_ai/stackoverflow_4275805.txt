Question about how to become a good software (a website) tester

I am going to look for a job as a software tester (a SDET maybe), especially for website test. I have some vague impression of this area and got a couple of specific questions as below: Among so many documents, such as functional spec, design spec, which should I pay more attention to? How to view them in a tester's view? Any good suggestions about writing test spec? Any attention should be paid to website test? These are just some questions I got now, I'll update with more shortly. I'd like to hear your voice very much. Many thanks.
