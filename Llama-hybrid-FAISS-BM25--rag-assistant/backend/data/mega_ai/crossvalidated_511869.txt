Data analysis with only one independent binary variable in a time series

I have a time series dataset of air pollution with with one discrete dependent variable: nitrogen dioxide and one binary explanatory variable: congestion charge (1=yes, 0=no). The dataset contains several cities with several years. Here is a small exemplary section of the data set (written in R): library(tidyverse) df How can I investigate whether the introduction of the congestion charge actually has an impact on the reduction of nitrogen dioxide? To me, a regression doesn't really make sense with only one dummy variable as the independent variable. Furthermore, it is a time series. How should I include the time in the model? I would very much appreciate a suggestion for a statistical model. Also, a solution written in R would be very helpful. If someone wants to have the original dataset, please add it as a comment. Many thanks in advance!
