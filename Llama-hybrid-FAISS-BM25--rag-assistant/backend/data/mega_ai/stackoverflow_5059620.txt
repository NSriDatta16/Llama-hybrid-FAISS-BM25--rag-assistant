That would be a valid use for namespaces, but I'm not aware of any large-scale effort to rewrite the core library in this way. The SPL provides improved libraries, but uses classes for organization. If you ask me, the core PHP library's main problem isn't performance anyway - most functions are just interfaces to their C or operating system counterparts anyway. What's much more pressing is naming conventions and parameter order (problems which could be however also be solved using a namespace approach)
