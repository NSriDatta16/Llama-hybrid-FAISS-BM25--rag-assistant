Reordering items in mobilesafari

After searching around i still have no clue about the best practice to reorder a set of items in mobile safari. I'm currently using, in the desktop version of my webapplication, jQuery sortable function applied to a set of table rows, with an ajax callback to update items positioning. What would be the best way of doing this in mobile safari through jquery or plain javascript? The table is longer then the screen, so also the normal scrolling should be present. Other approaches that are usable and do not make use of drag and dropping are also welcome. Thanks.
