an important thing you should consider is that if an object O has eventhandlers, i.e. methods that were added as eventhandlers to E, then this also count as a reference ... unless you add the handler with weakreference ... also if you have a closure, whose outer scope contains a reference to O, then this is a reference ... you do not need to remove all references to O, to sign it up for GC either ... the GC also removes circular references ... it removes all "islands" in memory, if you will ... only "peninsulae" connected of the "continent" of builtin objects, i.e. Timers, the display list, I/O layer etc. are not collected ... the last paragraph of another post of mine deals with this topic a little ... so yeah, basically, if O gets GCd, then any event handlers get GCd, unless there is another reference to them ... etc. hope that helped .. :) greetz back2dos
