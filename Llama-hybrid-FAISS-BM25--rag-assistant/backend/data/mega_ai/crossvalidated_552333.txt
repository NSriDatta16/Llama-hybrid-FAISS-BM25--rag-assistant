The way I see it, this is false, and I constructed a counterexample via simulation. set.seed(2021) N I get the inner product of the predictions and residuals of $0.238$ , meaning that the predictions and residuals are not orthogonal. Given that the link function makes a logistic regression nonlinear, this is not surprising.
