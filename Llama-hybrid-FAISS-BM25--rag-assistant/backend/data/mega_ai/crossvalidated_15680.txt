I am still not sure what exactly you are trying to find out. People who buy frozen yogurt are likely to buy ice cream, and vice versa. This is true for both men and women, and the correlations are about the same. Fine. If that is what you wanted to know, you know it. You could look at a scatterplot of the two variables, with dots coded for sex (red for women, blue for men, or whatever). You would probably want to jitter the points a bit to avoid overlap. If you are trying to predict the purchase of one of the products, then you want ordinal logistic regression, not correlation. If you want to know how much yogurt and ice cream people buy, you want univariate statistics. If you want to know if men buy a different amount of these products than women do, you want a t-test or a nonparmetric version.
