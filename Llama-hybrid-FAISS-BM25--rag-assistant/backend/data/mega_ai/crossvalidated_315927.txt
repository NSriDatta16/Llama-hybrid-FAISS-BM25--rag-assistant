MLE for Markov Chains - intuitive explanation

could anyone please give me intuitive explanation what does below mean ? Let say I have sequence: a, b, a, b, b, b, a, b, b, a By applying Markov Chains with MLE method in R package on below I get transition matrix and log likelihood as per below: a b a 0.0 1.0 b 0.5 0.5 log likelihood of -4.158883 I understand how to compute transition matrix. But I don't seem to understand log likelihood. Could somebody please intuitively explain to me what this represents on above example ? Many thanks.
