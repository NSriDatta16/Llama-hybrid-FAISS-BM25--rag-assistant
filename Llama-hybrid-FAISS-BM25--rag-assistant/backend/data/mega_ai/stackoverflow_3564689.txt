JavaScript and draggable images - can I optimise it?

I'm working on a web application where we have a very large image (4000 * 2000 pixels) that can be dragged about the place, zoomed in/out. When the image isn't zoomed in or out, it can be dragged about very fast and it looks great. As soon as i change the size of the image by some factor, the dragging becomes dreadfully slow. I have just noticed that I have a height attribute on the image, but don't have a width attribute. This behaviour is similar in both IE and Firefox, for obvious reasons, it works slightly faster in FireFox. I have been looking at the GoogleMaps where they also have a very smooth draggable images. What sort of optimisation I can do to achieve a similar result? Thank you
