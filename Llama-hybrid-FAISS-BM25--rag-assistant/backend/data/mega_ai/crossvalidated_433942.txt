it's not true that deep learning models outperforms the traditional machine learning or even statistical models. It all depends on the problem, what kind of data you have, how many, what's the dimensional etc. In general, DL might outperform other models in situations where you have a lot of data (10k, 100k, 1m) and when the model is very nonlinear such as in computer vision applications. In other settings DL models are not necessarily as great. For example in time series forecasting competition, Makridakis et al. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194889 the best machine learning model including LSTM was worse than the worst statistical model.
