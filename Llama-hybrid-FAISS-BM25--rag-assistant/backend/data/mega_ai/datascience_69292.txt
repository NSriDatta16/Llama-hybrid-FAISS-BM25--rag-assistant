CoCalc provides Jupyter notebooks with realtime collaboration , unlike Colab, Kaggle, etc. You just make a project drag and drop ipynb and data files, add collaborators, and everybody can edit everything simultaneously. You can also share content publicly at the share server . I think CoCalc is currently the overall most mature of the realtime Jupyter collaboration platforms (and it is the only open source one 4 ), but Deepnote is another option that is more focused on data science (but is closed source).
