There are a couple of different ways you can go about this. Here's a simple example. Your Default.aspx page will need to display the message to the user when they've logged out, so you might want a way to distinguish when you want to show the message. You could add a query string param to your redirect, like: Response.Redirect("~/Default.aspx?ShowLogout=true"); Now on your Default.aspx page, you have a number of options. You could simply show a hidden control on the page, or write out some Javascript to show an alert box: if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["ShowLogout"])) ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(this.GetType(), "LogoutMsg", " alert('You have been logged out.'); "); This will simply write out a script tag that runs when the user views the page. From here, you can make it more elegant by showing the user a better dialog box. For example, you could use jQuery to create a nice looking dialog box, and call the Javascript function to show it rather than calling alert in my example.
