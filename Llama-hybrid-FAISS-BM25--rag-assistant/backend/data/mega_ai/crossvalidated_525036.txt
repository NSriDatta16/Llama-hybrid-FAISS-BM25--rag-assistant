To add to the context here, finding significant predictors is easy. If you want a p You want to know "which factors impact the evolution over time of BMI," so say that education is a significant predictor. Do I gain/lose weight because I went to school longer than someone else? Education does not cause weight or height changes that would impact BMI over time, so finding that education is a significant predictor does not mean that education is causing BMI changes over a two year period. If education is significant, then you might have some beliefs about why that is the case. What is being recommended is a model-based approach to statistical thinking. The goal of the model is to simplify the world. In this case, you're simplifying BMI changes into a set of linear predictors that are all only indirectly related to BMI (i.e., it doesn't seem to me that you're collecting data on caloric intake, activity level, genetic predispositions, medications and side effects, etc). At the point at which we are simplifying the world for the sake of building a model, it behooves us to think about what factors would help us recreate the data generation process. In this way of thinking, something like education or region start to make sense as informative about BMI. For example, I might think that people with higher educations have more health literacy and may thus eat healthier, or they may have higher average wages that let them afford better foods. Similarly, people in certain regions may all have similar kinds of diets that would make that a useful way of predicting BMI compared to people from other regions with different diets. Significance of individual predictors is irrelevant if the model is capturing meaningful aspects of the underlying data generation (i.e., the true processes affecting BMI change over a two year interval). You'll just want to guard against violating assumptions (e.g., including a bunch of interactions can sometimes inflate collinearity) and overfitting the model. To avoid overfitting, making very careful a priori statements about what is giving rise to your data (e.g., through DAGs) is important. Just like anyone can get significant predictors, it's not hard to get a "good fitting" model. It's much harder to develop a meaningful model
