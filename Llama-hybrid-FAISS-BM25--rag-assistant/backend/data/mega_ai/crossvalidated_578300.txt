Distribution/estimation of maximum change of a stationary time series

Any help on this would be much appreciated. Let $x_{t} = b x_{t-1} + u_{t}$ , where $u_{t} \sim N(0,1)$ and $\lvert{b}\rvert . What can we say about the distribution of $y_{t} = \max(x_{t+2},x_{t+1}) - x_{t}$ ? What would be a good way to estimate the percentiles of $y_{t}$ ?
