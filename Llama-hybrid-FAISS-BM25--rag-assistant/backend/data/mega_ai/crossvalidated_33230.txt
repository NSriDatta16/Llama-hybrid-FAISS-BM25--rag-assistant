Maximum likelihood: In all Likelihood (Pawitan). Moderately clear book and the most clear (IMO) with respect to books dealing with likelihood only. Also has R code. GLMs: Categorical Data Analysis (Agresti, 2002) is one of the best written stat books I have read (also has R code available). This text will also help with maximum likelihood. The third edition is coming out in a few months. Second on my list for the above two is Collett's Modelling Binary Data . PCA: I find Rencher's writing clear in Methods of multivariate analysis . This is a graduate level text, but it is introductory.
