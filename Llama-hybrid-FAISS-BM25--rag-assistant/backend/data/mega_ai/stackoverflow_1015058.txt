Enum storage in Database field

Is it best to store the enum value or the enum name in a database table field? For example should I store 'TJLeft' as a string or a it's equivalent value in the database? Public Enum TextJustification TJLeft TJCenter TJRight End Enum I'm currently leaning towards the name as some could come along later and explicitly assign a different value. Edit - Some of the enums are under my control but some are from third parties.
