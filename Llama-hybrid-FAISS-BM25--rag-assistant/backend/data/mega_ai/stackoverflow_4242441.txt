Rather than beginning the drag operation in a MouseDown handler, you can save some initial state and instead commit to dragging in a MouseMove handler, where you can check against SystemParameters.MinimumHorizontalDragDistance and SystemParameters.MinimumVerticalDragDistance to see if there has been enough movement to begin a drag operation. You can then include code in a MouseUp handler to either complete the drag operation or, if it never started because the movement was too small, do a select instead.
