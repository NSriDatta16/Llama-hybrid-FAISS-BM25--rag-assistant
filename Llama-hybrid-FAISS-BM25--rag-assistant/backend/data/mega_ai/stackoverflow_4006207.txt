Human-readable cookies I personally believe it's a bit artless to always resort to SESSIONs just because variables are easier to store there with PHP. Session IDs are technically often cookies too, but not human-readable and opaque storage handles. So instead, if it's simple user-preferences (not autorization stuff), I like to send readable cookie names and values, e.g. product_order=desc , or fav_background=orange . Usually I resort to sessions too. But for personal projects where I care about data privacy (meaning user rights ) I put up with all the downsides: More micromanaging overhead for multiple cookies. Validity checking on each cookie separately, because it all becomes user input. Might need to define an additional expiry cookie or otherwise random renewal. (Due to the fact that I find 2038 cookie expiry times likewise dissocial, and only use appropriate times.) Cannot be used for anything authorization-related, but just user and display options. I believe it's important to recognize a semantic difference between real cookies and session cookies. But is it important to take care here, if hardly anyone sees it? However it makes my data privacy brain part happy. And for some use cases it's a simple no-brainer.
