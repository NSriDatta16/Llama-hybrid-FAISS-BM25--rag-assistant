Orchestration, Routing and Transformation. You don't do any of these for technical reasons, at random, or just for fun, you do these because you have some business requirement -- ergo there is business logic involved. The only thing you are missing for a complete business system is calculation and reporting (let us assume you already have security in place!). Except for very low level networking, OS and storage issues almost everything that comprises a computer system is there because the business/government/end users wants it to be there. The choice of 'Business Logic' as terminoligy was very poor and has led to endless distortions of design and architecture. What most good designers/architects mean by business logic is calculation and analysis. If you "%s/Business Logic/Calculation/g" most of the architectural edicts make more sense.
