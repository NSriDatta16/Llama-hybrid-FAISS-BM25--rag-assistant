Non-Compact Domain/Range Machine Learning

What are some machine learning methods that can be applied to non-compact input domain and output range? Neural Networks is clearly not one of them as they well approximate in an interval. I have a problem at hand where I need to identify a function with domain the entire real line. The good thing is I know the asymptotic behavior, which is a finite point. Unfortunately common ML methods diverge immediately outside of training bounds and cannot be hoped to have any asymptotic stability. Polynomials were one idea that came to my mind, but they also diverge asymptotically.
