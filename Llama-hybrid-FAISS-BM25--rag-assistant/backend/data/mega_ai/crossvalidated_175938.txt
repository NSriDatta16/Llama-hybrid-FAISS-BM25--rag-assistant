Conjugate prior is an algebraic convenience and nothing more. It is immediate to calculate the the posterior distribution of a Dirrechlet distribution, when the likelihood function is categorical. Where as, if you assume the prior distribution is, for example, also categorical, you're either in for a world of pain and complexity calculating all those sums/integrals, or you're gonna need simulation techniques (MCMC). Think of the a Conjugate prior as an algorithmic optimization and not as a the true descriptive distribution. And like any other mathematical concept, you first make an assumption, build a model, get the result, and if the result defies your assumption, then it doesn't hold. Same goes for statistics, in practice, you start by assuming the Conjugate prior , and if that does not describe your data well, you throw it away and go for the big guns (MCMC)
