I used Pylons a few years ago. I don't think that there is any web framework in PHP very similar to it. However, I find that Symfony encourages several web development patterns used in Pylons. For example, in ORM, templating, testing, configuration files, MVC, etc. Some other MVC frameworks that can be compared to Pylons are CakePHP (which is inspired in Ruby on Rails) and the Zend Framework (one of the largest, with lots of components to be extended).
