Best practices for custom http user-agent strings?

I'm developing an application that communicates with an internal web service using HTTP. Are there any "best practices" for custom user-agent strings so that I can put a nice one in my app? It's a Python library and the lower transport is Python's own httplib. Should the user-agent string say that or something else?
