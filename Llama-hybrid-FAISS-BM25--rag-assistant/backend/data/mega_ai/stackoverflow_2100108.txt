Good Question. Doesn't seem much on the web about this but i found this Native File Storage Types (Second table down) which shows each native file storage type and what it is recorded in the corresponding host file data type. e.g. float = SQLFLT8 real = SQLFLT4 money = SQLMONEY numeric = SQLNUMERIC Apologies if you have already come across this list.
