Dogbert pretty much nailed it. You can't know exactly how much available memory there is but you can know how potentially large your dataset will be. So, take the size of each object stored in the array, multiply by array dimensions and that's the size of one iteration. Multiply that by the desired number of iterations to see how much space total it will take, and adjust accordingly. Or, inspired by Travis, simply run the pattern in reverse from the last known array. It is deterministic after all.
