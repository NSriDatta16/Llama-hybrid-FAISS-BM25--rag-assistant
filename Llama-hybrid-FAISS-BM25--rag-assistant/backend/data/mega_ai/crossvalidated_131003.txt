Are you sure that you type I error increases? You talk about the specific case where the SSBL=0, but in reality if the true blocking has no effect, the observed SSBL is very unlikely to be exactly 0, so your F statistic will be different. The change in the F statistic and change in the degrees of freedom should cancel each other out to give the same type I error rate (on average). Restricting the blocking sum of squares to be exactly 0 would be like doing a 1 sample t-test and restricting the sample mean to be exactly the same as the hypothesized mean, unlikely to ever be observed and yes that artificial case does effect the type I error. But reality will have a difference in the observed mean/sum of squares. You can test this out by simulation. Generate some data where the blocking has no effect (don't force the sum of squares to 0 though) and analyze it both with and without the blocking factor. Repeat the process a bunch of times to see how often you reject the null. If the null is true then this gives a comparison of type I error rates (if all the other assumptions hold then both should be close to alpha), if the null is false then this will let you compare power and you should see more power by not blocking (you may be surprised by the size of the difference in power).
