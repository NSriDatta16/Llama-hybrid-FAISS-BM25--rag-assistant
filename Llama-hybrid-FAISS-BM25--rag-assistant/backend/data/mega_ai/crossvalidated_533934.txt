keep in mind that the coefficient given by logistic regression models are often "log odds". If you can check what function is used to get the coefficients... and IF the function is the "logit function" then it is definitely "log odds". the problem is that log odds are almost impossible to understand intuitively so you must convert them to "regular odds" if you want the numbers to mean anything to you. you can convert log odds to "regular" odds using exponentiation- e^(-0.5) = 0.61 odds. This means treatment group A has less odds of remission than treatment group B by a factor of .6. you can also find probability with the equation (odds / (1 + odds)). so ( e^(-0.5) / 1 + (e^(-0.5)) ) = probability of 0.378. so treatment group A has a probability of remission of 0.378. and treatment group B has a probability of remission of 0.622.
