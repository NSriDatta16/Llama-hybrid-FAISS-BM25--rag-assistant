Event handler triggered twice instead of once

I am sorry that I have asked two questions in a few minutes. In a html file, I got three child DIV tags in a parent DIV tag: 123 124 125 Now when I click either the three child DIV tags, I will see two alert boxes pop up instead of one: The first alert box will show something like this: frag-123, and the second alert box will show something like this: container I dont know why. I just want to get the ID value of a child DIV, not the one from the parent DIV. $(function() { $("div").click(function() { var imgID = this.id; alert(imgID); }); }); Please help.
