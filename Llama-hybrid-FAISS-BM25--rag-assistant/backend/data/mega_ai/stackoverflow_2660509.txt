Wow, just wow. I finally found an elegant solution to this problem. I can't believe how simple it turns out to be!!! I won't take credit for the solution... I stumbled upon a great blog post that answered this question completely (wasn't even looking anymore!). The article is by a guy name Davy, and he's my new hero . The article is here: http://www.drupalcoder.com/story/667-improving-search-results-when-working-with-node-references-in-drupal He also wrote a follow up article that simplifies the process even more!! http://www.drupalcoder.com/story/696-a-better-alternative-for-improving-search-results-when-working-with-node-references-in-dru It turns out the good folks that wrote CCK had already thought of indexing a referenced node's content. In the Display Fields section of editing a content type, click on the Search option! It lets you determine how the referenced node should be indexed when the parent node is indexed... and you can set it to full node. This will index the full contents of the referenced node as part of indexing the parent node. The only thing left to do (which Davy explains) is to make sure the parent node gets reindexed whenever a referenced node's content changes.
