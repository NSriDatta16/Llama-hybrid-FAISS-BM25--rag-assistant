This MSDN article describes the many conditions that can cause the Program Compatibility Assistant to kick in. I would review the set of scenarios that it describes and see whether any of them apply to your program. I do see causes for PCA dialogs outside of the conditions you ruled out (e.g., attempting to create a new folder under %ProgramFiles% ).
