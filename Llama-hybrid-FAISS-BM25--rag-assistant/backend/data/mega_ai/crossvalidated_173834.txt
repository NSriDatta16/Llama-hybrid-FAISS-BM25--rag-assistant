The trick here for your predictions is to recognize that the Cox regression was done in terms of variables having the form $log(1+x)$. So transform your matrix of $x_1,x_2$ data into that form by adding 1 to each element and then taking the log of each element. The $\beta$ coefficients from your Cox model developed in the $log(1+x)$ scales then are applied to the transformed data matrix. If you instead want log hazard ratios in the original $x_1,x_2$ scales (one possible interpretation of your question) I don't think that there is a simple closed form equation to transform the hazard ratios into those scales. Also, all the confidence interval and similar calculations were performed in the $log(1+x)$ scales. For display in that scale, you could use the procedure in the first paragraph to calculate some examples with $x_1,x_2$ values typical of your data.
