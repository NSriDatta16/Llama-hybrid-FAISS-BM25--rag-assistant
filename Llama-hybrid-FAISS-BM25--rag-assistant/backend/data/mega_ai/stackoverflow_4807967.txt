You're thinking right, but one important thing to remember is that body and html elements need to have width and heigh set on 100% also. Have a look on this example: body, html { height: 100%; width: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; background: gray; } #header { background: red; height: 100px; width: 100%; } #main { background: blue; height: 100%; width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; } If you run it, the only problem you'll see is that a scroll bars appear. Thats because #main div will have the window height and there are more 100px from the header. The solution I suggest is to make the header float over the main div, and then add another div inside #main also absolutely positioned 100px bellow, so you can work inside it without much trouble. The full code is then: body, html { height: 100%; width: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; background: gray; } #header { background: red; height: 100px; width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; z-index: 20; } #main { background: blue; height: 100%; width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; position: relative; z-index: 10; } #main #content { position: absolute; top: 100px; } Paragraph Make sure you use a reset file. Margins like the ones paragraph element has would mess the layout quite a bit. Update: As pointed, the solution brings overflow problems. So here is a better version: Change the 2 css blocks as follows: #main { background: blue; min-height: 100%; /* Changed */ width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; position: relative; z-index: 10; } #main #content { padding-top: 100px; /* Changed */ } And make sure the markup is this way (like the last example): That should do the trick!
