JSON and whitespaces in identifiers

Question: The JavaScript code below: records is JSON serialized data. I can access it right away from JavaScript by using for example alert(records.data[0].Phone); The problem now is that some bright spark used a whitespace in FirstName and LastName, which means I would have to access it like alert(records.data[0].Last Name); Which of course is not possible. Is there any way to access it with the whitespace, like an escape sequence? I already tried omitting the whitespace, or replacing it with underscore. The problem is I get the record, and I have no control over the source. var records = { "data" : [ { "First Name" : "John", "Last Name" : "Doe", "Email" : "nobody@example.com", "Phone" : "(917) 41-6598", }, { "First Name" : "Thomas", "Last Name" : "Brown", "Email" : "somebody@example.com", "Phone" : "(917) 41-2892", }, { "First Name" : "Albert", "Last Name" : "Hansen", "Email" : "someone@example.com", "Phone" : "(917) 41-3769", } ]}; alert(records.data[0].Email); alert(records.data[0].Phone);
