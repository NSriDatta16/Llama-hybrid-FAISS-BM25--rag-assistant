If you know the dates of your changepoints, there are two possibilities: Although you know the dates of the changepoints, you know nothing about the vertical change at each change date. In this case, the best you can do is to discard all the data before the last change date and use only the data since then to forecast out. You can only forecast out until the next change date, because after that, you again know nothing. In addition to the change date , you also know something about the vertical change. In this case, you might be able to learn something from the entire series (e.g., using dummies to mark each "regime"), and you may be able to forecast beyond the next change date, possibly with some post-processing. How exactly to do so depends on what information you have about the vertical change. In the example you give, things seem to be very simple indeed, since the time series is constant in each regime. If this is so in general, the naive forecast (forecast the last observation out) is of course optimal, at least until the next change date.
