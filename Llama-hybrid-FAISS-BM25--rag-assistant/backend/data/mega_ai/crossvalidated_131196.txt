Which statistical test should I use to test results from a genetic algorithm vs. an exact method?

I have a known value from some exact algorithm and I have 200 values which were obtained with 200 runs of a genetic algorithm. Now I want to test if on average the results from the GA come from the same distribution as the exact algorithm. So the hypothesis are: H0: GA == Exact value H1: GA != Exact value Which test should I use z or t test or any other? Thanks for answers in advance
