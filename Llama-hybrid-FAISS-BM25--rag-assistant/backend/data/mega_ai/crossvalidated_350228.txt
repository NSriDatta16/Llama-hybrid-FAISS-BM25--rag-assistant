Logistic regression - High Correlation between Independent Variables

I am running a Logistic regression on 6 independent variables and running chisquare tests shows high degree of association between 4 independent variables. Most of the topics suggest running first uni-variate regression and then keep on adding variables. I havent got any good guide for how to run this. PLease help!
