You could svn up --non-interactive to update and leave everything conflicted then revert everything with a conflict afterwards. If you're on Unix, you can use svn st |gawk '/^C/ {print $2}' to list all conflicting files then svn st |gawk '/^C/ {print $2}' |xargs svn revert or similar (untested) to actually do the revert. If you're on Windows, I can't think of an easy way to do this without grep / sed / awk, sorry. If you do have one of those but not xargs then it's easy to turn a list of filenames into a command line using e.g. the visual studio editor (alt-drag to trim off the Cs then delete at the end of each line to build up a list).
