Regression when both the predictor and outcome variables are proportions

I am using $X$ The estimated pre-game win probability of a sporting team playing on its Home field (estimated according to a certain model) to predict $Y$ Actual proportion of points scored by the Home team in the game (i.e. number of points scored by Home team divided by all points scored in the game). Graphed, the data look like this. Data viewable here . I did a simple linear regression and it produced the parameters $b_{0} = 0.3554$ and $b_{1} = 0.2930$ . Thus even at the maximum possible value of $x$ it doesn't predict the home team will score more than 100% of the points. However, some reading of other questions here indicates that linear regression is generally considered inappropriate for situations in which the outcome variable is a proportion. The question is highly similar to this one , in which a the poster was seeking to predict a team's winning percentage. There it was suggested that the poster should convert the proportion of wins to the number of wins. However, in my question it would not be the same thing for me to use the number of points scored by the team. How inappropriate it is for me to use linear regression here? What analysis should I use, keeping in mind that unlike in the linked question I can't just use the raw number of points scored by the team (since I really am interested in the proportion of points they will score). gung's answer here seems to indicate beta regression if the predictor is a continuous proportion, and logistic regression if it's a count proportion. However, I'm not sure which of those two my predictor is. Does it make any difference that my predictor is also measured as a proportion?
