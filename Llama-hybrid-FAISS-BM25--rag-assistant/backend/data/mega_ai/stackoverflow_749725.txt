Has anyone used "GWT Designer"?

Haven't seen anything about it here but it seems to solve one of the problems with GWT - the fact that you have to write Java code to generate your GUI. Instead this software allows you to design the GUI using drag-and-drop tools - a WYSIWYG interface. I'm not trying to sell the product, by the way. I just want to know whether it works as advertised, is effective, easy to use, etc? Anyone have any experience to answer these questions?
