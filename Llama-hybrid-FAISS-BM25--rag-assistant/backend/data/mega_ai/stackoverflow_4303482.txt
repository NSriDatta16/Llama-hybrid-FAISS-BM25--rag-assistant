Cannot find lg2c

I'm trying to create mex for matlab from some cpp and fortran files. They all compile well and creates the .obj file. But during linking I get the error lg2c not found. I have matlab 2007 installed in win vista. I also have mingw and gnumex installed. The mex -setup in matlab returns 2 compilers lcc and VS 2003 I'm using G77 fortran compiler Followed instructions in http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~pcarbo/Compile_LBFGSB_on_Windows.txt
