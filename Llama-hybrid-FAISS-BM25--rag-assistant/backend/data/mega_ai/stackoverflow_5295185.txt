Note: Perhaps this is not applicable to Magento. I usually view database application upgrades covering two main areas: 1. code 2. database. Code updates are easy to roll back. I usually manage this separately of the applications upgrade/management code. I usually use a the OS's file system to provide me with "instant rollback" functionality. Where database roll-backs are concerned, things get more complicated. One could take a similar approach with the database as well. However, it would only be realistic on a test system. If it's only code rollback that you are concerned with, I'd use something external of the application itself to manage this. It can be thought of as a snapshot I suppose. If Magento doesn't support this out of the box, I don't think it would be wise to tack it on. It seems like quite a core requirement that if not planned and coded for from the start, will be rather tricky to implement.
