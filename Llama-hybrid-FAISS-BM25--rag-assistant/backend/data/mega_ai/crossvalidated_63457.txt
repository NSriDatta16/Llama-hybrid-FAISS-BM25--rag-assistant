As one of the comments stated (guessed), if you sample from the marginal distribution $p(\theta_1\vert x)$ and then use this value to sample from the conditional distribution $p(\theta_2\vert \theta_1,x)$, you will end up with a sample from the joint distribution $p(\theta_1,\theta_2\vert x)$. Take the projection on the second column (simply take the column of samples associated to $\theta_2$), and you get a sample from $\theta_2\vert x$. This obviously provides an answer to 1). This is a common technique in Bayesian statistics. The answer to 2) is "maybe", it depends on the specific target distributions, $P$ and $N$. You will need to conduct an sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the method which will probably be more complicated than using the first approach.
