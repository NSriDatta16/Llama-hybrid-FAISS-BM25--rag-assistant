Can I use glm algorithms to do a multinomial logistic regression?

I am using spotfire (S++) for statistical analysis in my project and I have to run multinomial logistic regression for a large data set. I know best algorithm would have been mlogit, but unfortunately that is not available in s++. However, I have an option of using glm algorithm for this regression. I want to clarify two things here: 1.Is my understanding correct that glm also can be used to run Multinomial Logistic Regression? If answer to previous question is yes, then what parameters should be used in glm algo? Thanks,
