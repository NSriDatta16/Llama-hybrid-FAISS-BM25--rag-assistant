Float Issue in IE

Ok I am making a simulated OS type interface. It should open up windows and have a drag handle. This all works perfectly. Then I added a image for an exit button I floated to the right... this made IE mad and IE screwed with the sizing and positioning =[ I've tried a crap load of things. None of which work. Anyone wana help? website is http://opentech.durhamcollege.ca/~intn2201/brittains/labs/ Thanks Shelby
