If your header file and your compiler are both parts of the same C or C++ implementation, complain to your vendor and ask them to put a suitable #pragma in their header file to silence their compiler. As implementor, they're allowed to play games like that, as long as they provide a conforming implementation. If your header file and your compiler came from two separate C or C++ implementations, you're lucky that things work as well as they do, and you have to solve it yourself.
