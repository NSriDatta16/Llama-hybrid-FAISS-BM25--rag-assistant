SQL Server Service Broker to insert data on a SQL Server 2000

I have two servers, the first one with SQL Server 2005 and the second one with SQL Server 2000. I want to insert data from the 2005 to the 2000 and I want to do it unsync (without distributed transactions because "save transaction" are used). Once the information is inserted in the tables of the 2000 server, some instead-of triggers are fired to process this information. In that scenario I decided to use Service Broker. So I have a Stored Procedure to insert information from one server to the other and it works perfectly. But when I call this procedure from the target queue process message procedure it fails, and I don't know why!! Also, I know it works because when I use the same structure (queues & stored procedures) to copy form one database to another on the same SQL 2005 server. So it fails only between machines, anyone knows why or how to get more information about the cause of the failure? Or how to insert data unsync (I can't to use the SQL Agent because I want insert the information more frequently than 1 minute).
