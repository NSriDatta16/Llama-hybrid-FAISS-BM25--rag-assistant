BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based language model that is trained to predict the next word in a sequence given the context of the previous words. It does this by using a bidirectional encoder to process the input text and generate a fixed-length representation of the input. The decoder is not a part of the BERT architecture because it is not designed to generate text as output. Instead, it is used to encode the input text into a fixed-length representation that can be fed into a downstream task such as question answering or language translation. In a typical language model, the decoder is responsible for generating text as output based on the context provided by the encoder. However, in the case of BERT, the encoder is trained to generate a fixed-length representation of the input text, and this representation is used as input to a downstream task that is responsible for generating text as output. The BERT model itself does not have a decoder component and is not designed to generate text directly.
