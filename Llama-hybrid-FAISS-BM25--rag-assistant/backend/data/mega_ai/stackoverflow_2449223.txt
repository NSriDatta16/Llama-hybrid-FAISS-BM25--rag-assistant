The node-set() function you mention can convert result tree fragments into node-sets, that's correct. But: Your XSLT does not produce a result tree fragment. Your template SetDataPath produces a string, which is then stored into your variable $DataPath . When you do , the XSLT processor chokes on the fact that DataPath does not contain a node-set, but a string. Your entire stylesheet seems to be revolve around the idea of dynamically selecting/evaluating XPath expressions. Drop that thought, it is neither possible nor necessary. Show your XML input and specify the transformation your want to do and I can try to show you a way to do it.
