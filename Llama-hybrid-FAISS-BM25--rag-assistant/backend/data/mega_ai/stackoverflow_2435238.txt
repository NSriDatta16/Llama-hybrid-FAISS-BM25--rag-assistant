Semantic #region usage

What's your opinion about using #region folding using application semantic, instead of folding for "syntax". For example: #region Application Loop #region User Management #region This Kinf of stuffs instead of #region Private Routines #region Public Properties #region ThisRoutine // (Yes, I've seen this also!) In this logic, I'm starting fold even routine bodies. I'm starting to love #region directive (even using #pragma region when using C++!).
