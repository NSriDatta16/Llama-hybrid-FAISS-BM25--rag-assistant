Dragging and dropping a card

I am developing a card game which includes moving one card from one place to another.The cards are dealt/stored in picture boxes.Once the user clicks a card, I want him to be able to drag and drop the card to another picture box(this is where he wil be playing the card). I also want that when user is dragging the item that item should be stuck into the cursor. I mean mouse cursor should have that specific card stuck to it until it's dropped. Can any body plz help me in getting this done. Thanks in advance.
