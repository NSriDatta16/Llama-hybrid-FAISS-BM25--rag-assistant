I use Hg instead of Git but the workflow you just describes more or less what I do. The only thing I'd add is that I got a Windows Live Mesh account since it auto-syncs to the cloud and works on Mac as well (its still Beta but I haven't had much trouble) but there are probably other cloud storage providers. Anyway, I create a core repository inside the Live Mesh folder and then clone from that to a working directory. The code on my Mesh account is always a last known good and I often will have 2 or more working clones of the same project on a given machine where I am trying different approaches to solve the same problem.
