I have tested your JLabel and JEditorPane code in Eclipse using the latest Windows JDK, using several different look-and-feels, but they all work just fine. I know you're using OpenJDK but I can't get hold of a version for Windows. I'm guessing there is a difference in the two implementations. Might I suggest wrapping your text inside a paragraph, such as " Hello world " ?
