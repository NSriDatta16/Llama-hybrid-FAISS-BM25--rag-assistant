I think the first question you may need to ask is what does a "fuzzy decision" in language mean? The objective of language at its base requirement is to convey a clear message that on one scale means something definitive. For example, if you want to express that you are happy, you say "I am happy" and NOT "I may be happy". In language processing, it is even difficult to extract intentions and meanings in a simple form using traditional and sophisticated algorithms. For other domains, there are use cases where fuzzy outcomes are useful. But what does that mean for language? This is one obvious reason you may not see any literature with fuzzy logic applied to NLP.
