Binary + operators are predefined for numeric and string types. For numeric types, + computes the sum of its two operands. When one or both operands are of type string, + concatenates the string representations of the operands. Reference The assignment operator (=) stores the value of its right-hand operand in the storage location, property, or indexer denoted by its left-hand operand and returns the value as its result. The operands must be of the same type (or the right-hand operand must be implicitly convertible to the type of the left-hand operand). Reference
