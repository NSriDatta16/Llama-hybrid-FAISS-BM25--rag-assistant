I have two lists, Status Name (string) Active (yes/no) Task Name (string) Status (Lookup to Status list) I have the following statuses (These can be changed at any time by the client): New, Active = Yes Open, Active = Yes Not Resolved, Active = No Resolved, Active = No I want to create a view for the Tasks list, that shows all active tasks... How would I go about this? Thanks! Albert
