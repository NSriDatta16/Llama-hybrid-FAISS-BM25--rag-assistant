Implementing a linear, binary SVM (support vector machine)

I want to implement a simple SVM classifier, in the case of high-dimensional binary data (text), for which I think a simple linear SVM is best. The reason for implementing it myself is basically that I want to learn how it works, so using a library is not what I want. The problem is that most tutorials go up to an equation that can be solved as a "quadratic problem", but they never show an actual algorithm! So could you point me either to a very simple implementation I could study, or (better) to a tutorial that goes all the way to the implementation details? Thanks a lot!
