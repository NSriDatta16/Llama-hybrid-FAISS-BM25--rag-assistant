NLP approaches to infer Processes from Text

I would like to use NLP techniques to infer a process out of raw text. For example, if I have a sentence like: Recruitment is about attracting and selecting the right person for the job. To get the following process: Attracting the right person. I noticed that a very good strong step forward is to use SpaCy , tokenizing the texts and filtering them for NOUNS. But from this point on, I'm completely blank. Someone suggested to me something named "Semantic Role Labelling" (SRL) and reading about the approach I think it could work here in a good way, perhaps using the AllenNLP module. What I would like to know though (and the whole purpose of this post) are alternatives. Besides SRL, what other approaches could suit and provide a solution to this problem? I obviously don't expect the people who reply to solve the problem, only to make suggestions on approaches that might work so I can dig upon them (as mentioned, my experience on this topic is really short). Thanks in advance!
