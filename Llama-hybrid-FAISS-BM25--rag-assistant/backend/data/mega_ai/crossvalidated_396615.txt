Having 6 data points associated with 3 explanatory variables and trying 8 different models is a classical case of " researcher degrees of freedom " abuse. I would urge you to first read about this topic first (despite not being directly associated with AICc). Two good papers to start are : Simons et al. 2011 " False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant " and " Degrees of Freedom in Planning, Running, Analyzing, and Reporting Psychological Studies: A Checklist to Avoid p-Hacking " . Back to the particulars of this use-case: Shrinkage / Regularisation methods is a great way to circumvent variable selection questions in a data driven way. The classical suggestion would be using something like LASSO . Nevertheless with just 6 data points we should consider employing a fully Bayesian approach using a Bayesian regression model that encapsulates our beliefs about the explanatory variables' effects into the priors of that model. There are many well-meaning rules-of-thumb about the ratio of number of observations over the number of data for regression and/or AIC to be relevant (e.g. see Burnham and Anderson (2004) Model Selection and Multi-Model Inference ) but realistically arguing the use of AIC with 6 data points is irrelevant as the estimate of the underlying likelihood will be highly variable; the fact that AICc suggest the null model as optimal is unsurprising in that sense.
