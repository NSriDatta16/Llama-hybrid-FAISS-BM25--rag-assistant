How to separate two normal distributions which are scores of a machine learning model?

Considering I have a machine learning model that predicts the matching score of two entities. The lower the score is the more different the two entities are and vice versa. Labels : 0 = no match ; 1 = match From the figure, as you can see there is a good overlap between the two normal distributions (score for label 0 and score for label 1). Is there any statistical method / mathematical device / machine learning model that can separate (somewhat) the two distributions so that I can get a better performance metric / Equal error rate? What I want is to transform my current scores so that they are more separable and the error is minimum. At the moment, for the overlapping region, I will predict either label 0 or 1 based on a threshold. If I set a threshold of 0.25, I will be able to correctly predict most of the non-match scenarios but will miss a lot of the matches and vice versa. Note: I have an audio dataset, where I have trained a deep neural network (RawNet) to predict if the two audios match (come from the same source or not). It's a slight variation of the speaker recognition task. The model predicts an embedding and I take the cosine similarity of the embeddings as a score.
