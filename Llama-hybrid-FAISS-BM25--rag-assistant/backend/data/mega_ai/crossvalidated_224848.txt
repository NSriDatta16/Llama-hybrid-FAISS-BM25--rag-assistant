confused about the proof of Markov chain Monte Carlo

This is the proof from notes I'm confused about the $\pi(x_p|x)$ and $\pi(x|x_p)$ Let's say $X\sim $ Bin $(10,0.3)$, so $\pi(x)=\binom{10}{x}0.3^x0.7^{(10-x)}$, so what does $\pi(x_p|x)$ or $\pi(x|x_p)$ mean? It doesn't make any sense, for example what's the value of $\pi(4|3)$? If I got a misunderstanding on $\pi(x)$, could you provide an example with values to show how $\pi(x_p|x)$, $g(x_p|x)$ are meaningful.
