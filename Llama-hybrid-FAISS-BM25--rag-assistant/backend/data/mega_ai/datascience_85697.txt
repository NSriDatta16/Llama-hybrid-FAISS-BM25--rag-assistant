LDA-like algorithm but at the character level?

I have a catalog of products and I'd like to find "topics" in their description. The problem is that you might find in the description things like GraphicsCardVendor10.2 GraphicsCardVendor_10.3 etc. Obviously, for us humans it is simple to unravel the topic "Graphics Cards" Of course, I can do some preprocessing but I'm looking for a more holistic way to deal with that. I know some algorithms (like RNNs) can work on character-level. My end-goal is to find patterns in the data. Sort of, points of interest. Like, "Hey look, I see a lot of graphics cards over here". I'd like to get your suggestions what should be the right model for this problem. Note: The data is currently not labeled.
