How to have autotest and RSpec nicely formatted when comparing long texts (with \t and \n)?

I have a test in RSpec which compares to long text strings. When the test fails, I get a message like this: 'jobs partial should render the correct format for jobs' FAILED expected: "Job {\n\tName = \"name1-etc\"\n\tType = Backup\n\tMessages = Daemon\n\tPool = Default \n\tSchedule = \"schedule1\"\n\tStorage = storage1\n\tClient = \"name1\"\n\tFileset = \"fileset1 \"\n\tMax Wait Time = 5m\n\tWrite Bootstrap = \"/var/lib/bacula/name1-etc.bsr\"\n}\n\n", got: "Job {\n\tName = \"name1-etc\"\n\tType = Backup\n\tMessages = Daemon\n\tPool = Default \n\tSchedule = \"schedule1\"\n\tStorage = storage1\n\tClient = \"name1\"\n\tFileset = \"fileset1 \"\n\tMax Wait Time = 5m\n\tWrite Bootstrap = \"/var/lib/bacula/name1-etc.bsr\"\n}\n\n" (using = =) How do I do to make RSpec and autotest respond a nicely formated diff (if possible, coloring the differences between texts? Something like this expected: Job { Name = "name1-etc" Type = Backup Messages = Daemon Pool = Default Schedule = "schedule1" Storage = storage1 Client = "name1" Fileset = "fileset1"
