An easy (but not the best solution) would be to have separate columns - one for the oldest data, one for the newest data and one for the difference between the newest and the oldest. I am saying this is an easy solution, as you can use it in cases that you have only 2 time points, you can use it in cases you have more than 2, and you can use it when you have only 1 case (newest = oldest; difference = 0). Then run a classifier model like XGBoost.
