Convolutional neural network for time series?

I would like to know if there exists a code to train a convolutional neural net to do time-series classification. I have seen some recent papers ( http://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/KDI-Djalto.pdf ) but I am not sure whether there exists something or if I have do code it by myself.
