Assuming each company ships a different amount of units over time, the historical data can be used to estimate this. If there is Company 1, 2, 3 and data for each month Company Month Gas X Y Z 1 Jan 100 10 20 30 2 Jan 1000 200 150 100 3 Jan 200 20 35 65 1 Feb 120 12 25 31 ... ... Then fit a linear model: $$ G = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Y + \beta_3Z $$ The coefficients of the linear model will represent the Diesel consumption for each unit of each product. For example, $\beta_1$ represents the average Diesel consumption for shipping each unit of Product A. Also, $\beta_0$ represents Diesel consumption not related to shipping products. If there is reason to believe that each company has different amounts of Diesel consumption not related to shipping products, this can be represented by $$ G = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Y + \beta_3Z + \beta_4 C_2 + \beta_5 C_3 $$ where $C_2$ is 1 if that row of data represents company 2 and is 0 otherwise. Now the Diesel consumption not related to shipping products for Company 1 is $\beta_0$ and for Company 2 is $\beta_0 + \beta_4$. If there is reason to believe that Company 1 is more efficient than Company 2 at shipping Product A, look at $$ G = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Y + \beta_3Z + \beta_4 C_2 + \beta_5 C_3 + \beta_6X C_2 + \beta_7 X C_3 $$ Now the Company 1's Diesel Consumption for shipping Product A is $\beta_1$ and Company 2's is $\beta_1 + \beta_6$ Make sure you're comfortable with the linear model's assumptions and you check for the model for a proper fit . There are also ways to determine which of the three nested models is most appropriate .
