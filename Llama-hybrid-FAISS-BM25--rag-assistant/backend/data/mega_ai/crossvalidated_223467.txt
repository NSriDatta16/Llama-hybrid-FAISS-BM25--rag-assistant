If I understand the question correctly, the issue is one of trying to make an exponentially decreasing weight series fit to a discrete uniform (constant weight with cutoff): Clearly either an EWMA decreases quickly (fitting badly at older lags where the ordinary moving average still has high weight) or has a tail much further into the past, fitting the weight-distribution badly where the ordinary moving average has no weight). Exactly which choice of $\alpha$ will do best at matching the results from uniform-weights will depend crucially on how you measure performance and (naturally) on the characteristics of the series (both ordinary moving average and EWMA would only be reasonably suitable for weakly-stationary series for example, but that covers a lot of cases with potentially different relative performance for different $\alpha$ values) The question leaves both of these things vague, so I suspect there's not a lot more to be said than "it depends" - about either the similarity of the conditional mean or the size of the conditional variance, here.
