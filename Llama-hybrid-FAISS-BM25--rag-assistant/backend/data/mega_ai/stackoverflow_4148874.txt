Package Access (Protected Modifier) in Java

Suppose I have a package: package com.g00gle.car and package com.g00gle.car.stereo Is it possible to have a class in com.g00gle.car to access a class member in com.google.car.stereo? (Assuming that class member is labeled protected). The answer is no... (by default) but is there a way to circumvent that? I have an application that I want to cut into distinct chunks... and to do that, I create extensions of the package. What's discouraging is the loss of package private access.
