AS you point out, the article on MySQL Performance Blog is almost 4 years old now. Since then InnoDB was improved a lot. MyISAM was not. Just yesterday MySQL 5.5 was released. It is the first version where InnoDB is the default storage engine. For a reason. Oracle claims as much as 3.5 performance gains for Linux and up to 15 times performance gains for Windows (compared to 5.1 InnoDB).
