Product embeddings

Hei, I have a list of purchase baskets from customers and would like to build embeddings for the products. For example: BASKET1 = ['PRODUCT234', 'PRODUCT214', 'PRODUCT768'] BASKET2 = ['PRODUCT2', 'PRODUCT43', 'PRODUCT7684', 'PRODUCT65'] I was thinking of using something like Word2Vec by using the productIDs composing a basket as words and the baskets themselves would be sentences. The question that I am having at the moment is how to introduce sequentiality to my product basket as, unlike words, I do not have the sequence at which they were added to the basket. Think, for example, about a supermarket basket where items end up being scanned in a random order. One way I was thinking of introducing some artificial sequence was by ordering productIDs but I do not have any rationale to justify such an approach. Would you have any comments regarding this approach? Any suggestion as to an alternative model that would produce the desired embeddings? I would like to use embeddings to recommend similar products or products that occur in the same basket.
