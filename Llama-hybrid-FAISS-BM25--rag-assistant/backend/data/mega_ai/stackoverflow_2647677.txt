Help with enums in Java

Is it possible to have an enum change its value (from inside itself)? Maybe it's easier to understand what I mean with code: enum Rate { VeryBad(1), Bad(2), Average(3), Good(4), Excellent(5); private int rate; private Rate(int rate) { this.rate = rate; } public void increateRating() { //is it possible to make the enum variable increase? //this is, if right now this enum has as value Average, after calling this //method to have it change to Good? } } This is want I wanna achieve: Rate rate = Rate.Average; System.out.println(rate); //prints Average; rate.increaseRating(); System.out.println(rate); //prints Good Thanks
