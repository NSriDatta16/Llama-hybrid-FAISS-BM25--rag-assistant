C# - Communicate between two laptops that are not connected to a LAN

I need to communicate (in C#) between two (or more) laptop computers that are not on a LAN. Here is the scenario: A couple of agents (with laptops) go from region to region working in several offices (at the same time). I need a way for the agents to be able to share and merge files with each other without having to resort to emailing , copying to USB drives and checking-in the files to the central repository. What will be the best (easiest/secure) way to archive this? Bluetooth, AdHoc Mode, Wifi!
