My take on this is, Microsoft should have developed their Backoffice management interfaces based on the DLR, so that top-notch and already proven languages like Python and Ruby in .NET (or any other language built on the DLR) could be leveraged, as opposed to what I think they did in reinventing the wheel with Powershell. Other than its use to manage infrastructure applications, e.g. Exchange, I don't have an incentive to learn Powershell when there are excellent languages already out there. My .02 cents.
