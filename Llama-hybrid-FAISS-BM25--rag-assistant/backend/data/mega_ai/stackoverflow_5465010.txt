Environment for quickly developing routing protocol prototype

I am doing research on routing protocols. Currently I perform simulations written in Python of a new protocol. The next step would be to build a real prototype which can really run on top of a Linux-based operating system (as a routing daemon such as ospfd). What would be a well-suited programming environment/language to quickly build a prototype of a routing protocol? Anyone having experience with building distributed protocol prototypes? I would like to focus as much as possible on high-level protocol logic instead of on low-level machine-related instructions. I am willing to learn new languages (such as Erlang or Haskell), in case they are better adapted for such a task. Alternatively, I have read about the twisted framework available in Python (which would probably allow to re-use some code), but it is unclear to me if this only would help me in case I write client/server-based protocols. Does anyone know about an elegant tutorial or example implementation of a (distributed) protocol implementation?
