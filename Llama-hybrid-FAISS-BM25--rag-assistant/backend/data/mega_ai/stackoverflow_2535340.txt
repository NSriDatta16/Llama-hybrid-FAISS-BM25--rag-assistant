Main benefit i find is it forces the project into a more testable strcuture. This can pretty easily be done with webforms as well (MVP pattern), but requires the developer to have an understanding of this, many dont. Webforms and MVC are both viable tools, both excel in different areas. I personally use web forms as we primarily develop B2B/ LOB apps. But we always do it with an MVP pattern with wich we can achieve 95+% code coverage for our unit tests. This also alows us to automate testing on properties of webcontrols property value is exposed through the view eg bool IMyView.IsAdminSectionVisible{ get{return pnlAdmin.Visible;} get{pnlAdmin.Visible=value;} } ) I dont think this level of testing is as easily achived in MVC, without poluting my model.
