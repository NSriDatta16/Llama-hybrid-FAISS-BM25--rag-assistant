Does PCA's reconstruction error get reduced with more PCs being used?

Say that the raw data is $N$ -dimensional, where $N$ is a large positive integer. If we apply PCA to the dataset, and compute the reconstruction error (in $\ell^2$ -norm) using the first $d \leq N$ components, will the reconstruction error monotonically decrease to $0$ as $d \rightarrow N$ ?
