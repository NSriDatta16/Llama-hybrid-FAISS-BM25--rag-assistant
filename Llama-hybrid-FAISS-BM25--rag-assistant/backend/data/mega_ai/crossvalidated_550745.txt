They are both pieces of the beta-binomial model . In beta-binomial model, the predicted variable $y$ follows the binomial distribution, where the number of samples $n$ is known and we want to learn the "probability of success" $p$ . For this, we are using a Bayesian model, where beta distribution with hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ serves as a prior for $p$ : $$\begin{align} p &\sim \mathsf{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) \\ y &\sim \mathsf{Binomial}(n, p) \end{align}$$ In such a case, due to conjugacy, the posterior distribution for $p$ is also beta distributed . On another hand, the posterior predictive distribution , i.e. the distribution for your predictions of $\hat y$ , is beta-binomial distribution .
