PHP DateTime::modify adding and subtracting months

I've been working a lot with the DateTime class and recently ran into what I thought was a bug when adding months. After a bit of research, it appears that it wasn't a bug, but instead working as intended. According to the documentation found here : Example #2 Beware when adding or subtracting months modify('+1 month'); echo $date->format('Y-m-d') . "\n"; $date->modify('+1 month'); echo $date->format('Y-m-d') . "\n"; ?> The above example will output: 2001-01-31 2001-03-03 Can anyone justify why this isn't considered a bug? Furthermore does anyone have any elegant solutions to correct the issue and make it so +1 month will work as expected instead of as intended?
