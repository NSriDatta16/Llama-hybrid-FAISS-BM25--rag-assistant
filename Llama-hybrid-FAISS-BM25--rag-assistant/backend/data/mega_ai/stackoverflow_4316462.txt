MaxLength property for textbox in code behind?

I am trying to use MaxLength function for the textbox in code behind. How is it possible for textbox txttabname here, which is created dynamically. Any idea? Thanks a lot in advance!! for (int i = 0; i Page Tabs ")); } this.pnlProfilePages.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl(" Tab Name : ")); string txtTabControlID = "txtTabName" + i.ToString(); TextBox txtTab = new TextBox(); txtTab.ID = txtTabControlID; txtTab.Width = 100; txtTab.TabIndex = lastTabIndex++; } }
