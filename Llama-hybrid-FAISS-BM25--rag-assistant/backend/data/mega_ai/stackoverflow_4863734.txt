You can move a view by using touch moved event. There is a sample tutorial MoveMe by Apple which drags a view and after releasing the touch animate the view. Check specially the touch events (touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchesEnded) in MoveMeView.m to get the idea how they have moved placardView. You can move your button just like the placardView.
