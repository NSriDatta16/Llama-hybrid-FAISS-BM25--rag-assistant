You'll need to add an UITapGestureRecogniser and assign it to the view, and then call resign first responder on the textfield on it's selector. The code: In viewDidLoad UITapGestureRecognizer *tap = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(dismissKeyboard)]; [self.view addGestureRecognizer:tap]; In dismissKeyboard: -(void)dismissKeyboard { [aTextField resignFirstResponder]; } (Where aTextField is the textfield that is responsible for the keyboard) OPTION 2 If you can't afford to add a gestureRecognizer then you can try this - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject]; if(touch.phase == UITouchPhaseBegan) { [aTextField resignFirstResponder]; } }
