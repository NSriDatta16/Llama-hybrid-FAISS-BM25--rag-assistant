If I understand your problem correctly, the only solution is to use regression as you need to predict the value of y rather than the class it will fall into. Discretising is rarely a solution, unless you are certain it will bring out some important information. I believe you are misunderstanding the two concepts and the ways they should be used. The fundamental difference between regression and classification problems is the following: The regression wants to learn a continuous target variable while the classification wants to learn a discrete such. This essentially splits the problem in two, as you have pointed out. If you are willing to predict what is the value of your predicted y, then this is a regression problem. In contrast, if you are willing to predict which class y falls into, then you should use classification. Also note that neural networks are not always the most suitable way to go. In summary, it is not the type of the problem that implies the efficiency, its the way you will approach it, once you have established it as a classification or regression one.
