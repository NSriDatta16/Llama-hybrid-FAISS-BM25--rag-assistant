Which statistics method should I use to model events that barely occurs?

I have a dataset with information of different individuals and I want to create a model to predict if the individual will take some action or if he won't (1 or 0). E.g.: the individual will buy a product (event = 1) or if he won't (event = 0). Normally, I would use a decision tree or a logistic regression to predict if the event will happen. However, I'm not sure if this is the case for this dataset, since the number of times the event happened in my historical data is very rare (less than 1% of the time). How can I model this?
