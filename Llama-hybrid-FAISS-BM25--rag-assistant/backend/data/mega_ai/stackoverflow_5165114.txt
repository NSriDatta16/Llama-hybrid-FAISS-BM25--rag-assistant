How do I force revert back so a specific revision number using command line SVN?

I spoke too soon in my previous post about breaking things. I am trying to revert back to revision 1124 using the command svn update -r 1124 but I keep getting an error message as follows: [prague]$ svn update -r1024 U app/webroot/css/group_themes/green.css U app/webroot/css/style.css Skipped 'app/webroot/index.php' svn: Failed to add directory 'app/webroot/images/users': an unversioned directory of the same name already exists We got some stuff back up but still not the exact version which I know I had checked out last night... I thought it would be much easier to just revert back to a specific revision :(
