I don't know if its necessarily an improvement , but it might be more readable, though more verbose: /*[local-name() = 'Result']/*[local-name() = 'row']/@ows_ID There is probably more to the fragment you posted so this XPath query might need a fixup when used against the actual xml result. The function, local-name(), lets you ignore namespaces, which can be both a boon and a curse. :)
