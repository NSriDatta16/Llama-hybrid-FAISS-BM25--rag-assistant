Edit: Watching the video further, I see that they meant something else. I leave my answer anyway as a useful answer for people that land on this question and have a different interpretation of the question. The use of the term 'noisy function' in the article relates to the observed and predicted values being variable. The function itself is not necessarily noisy and can still behave as a straight line. But it is multivalued and describes the output, observation/prediction, as a function rather than a single value (so it is a function that maps $x$ to a function $f(y)$ ) Most of the real-world target functions are noisy. We are trying to learn target functions (in the real world). Overfitting causes the model to fit onto the noise. The real-world target function is not noisy or random. It is a fixed value. For example the distribution of average gold and oil under the ground is a fixed value. If you dig in one single place and measure all the available resources, then you will find a certain specific total amount, and if you dig another time in the same place you wil again find the same total amount. It is not like rolling a dice that the amount of gold and oil is variable each time you dig in the same place. However, the real-world target function is not a pretty and simple function. The amount of gold and oil in the ground varies from place to place and it is not like you can always use a straight line or polynomial to fit it's the distribution. In particular, the amount is probably having an origin in a random process. So it is a function that has in some way a random behaviour. For a linear function, if you find in x-positions 1,2,3,4 the values 11, 19, 33, 41, then for x-position 5 you might extrapolate the underlying function and expect a value that is something around 50. For the amount of gold or oil it may not be like that. Possibly if you find gold or oil in some place, it may have an effect on neighbouring points, but far away it has little effect. The problem is the type of noise that is due to measurement errors. When we measure the amounts of gold and oil in the ground, by taking probes, then there will be either errors due to the measurements being inaccurate, or due to the sample being a bad representation of the average in the area. We could be sitting on top of a rich oil field, but happen to dig oreasure just in a place where there is little. The problem of inference is to find an estimated value for a distribution property that resembles the true properties of the distribution (e.g. the average amount of oil/gold in some area). The true properties may behave like a noisy function, but that is different from the noise that troubles the inference (sampling and measurement). A related concept to study might be a Gaussian process and more specifically 'latent Kriging' as explained here: Wikipedia article: nonlinear mixed effects model; Example: Prediction of oil production curve of shale oil wells at a new location with latent kriging
