Vim: make gq treat '.' as the end of a sentence

Related to vim-how-to-reformat-a-set-of-lines-into-a-single-lines-if-the-line-is-a-single I'd like gq to treat a '.' as the end of a sentence in latex. Combined with a high value of tw , the intention is automatically reformat a paragraph into a list of lines. (FYI, this is a much nicer way to edit latex, if you are wondering)
