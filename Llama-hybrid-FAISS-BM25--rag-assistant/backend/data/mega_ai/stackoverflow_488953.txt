I strongly advise against using plain Win32 because it's pretty hard to make it work OK in all situations, it's pretty dull and tedious work and the Common Controls library isn't that complete. Also, most of the work has been done for you. Every time I end up doing plain Win32 I have to spent at least a couple of hours on the most trivial tasks because I have to look up all the parameters, flags, functions, macros and figure out how to hook them up properly. I'd generally prefer a simple drag-and-drop don't-make-me-use-my-brains type of solution and just slam the thing together in 2 minutes. As a lightweight toolkit I'd suggest omgui which has a clean and pretty API. It doesn't, however, come with any tools. If you need tool support, you'll probably end up wanting to go for either MFC (resource editor built into Visual Studio) or Qt. I don't know if wxWidgets has any tools, but I presume it has. Edit: David Citron mentions that apparently the resource editor in Visual Studio generates Win32 compatible resource files, so that's probably the preferred way to do things if you wanted to keep things simple.
