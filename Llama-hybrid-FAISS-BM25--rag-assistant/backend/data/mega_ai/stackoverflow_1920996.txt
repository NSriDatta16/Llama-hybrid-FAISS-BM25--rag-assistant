You may very well be causing an exception somewhere (probably inside MagicMethod) and because you don't handle the Bgw RunWorkerCompleted event you don't notice it. So, add a RunWorkerCompleted event and check if e.Error != null The completed event is also a convenient and safe place to process the results: dataGridView1.DataSource = dt; See this MSDN example and pay attention to the if/else if/else pattern in the RunWorkerCompleted event.
