Let's consider a finite Markov chain. Suppose we have a closed communicating class of essential states and also suppose that all the states in this class are transient. Now according to Wikipedia: A state i is said to be transient if, given that we start in state i, there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to i. A communicating class is closed if the probability of leaving the class is zero. Now according to the definition of transience, each state in the closed class will be visited finitely many times. This contradicts the infinite nature of the time interval, hence at least one of the states in this class must be recurrent. Since recurrence is a class property (this can be shown) we know that all other states in the closed class will be recurrent. So, in a finite Markov chain, no essential states can be transient.
