I was having the same problem. I managed to do it with Scikit's OneClassSVM ; maybe it can also help in your case. I adjusted some of the parameters you mentioned plus a few more (just in case) including: _dual_coef_ dual_coef_ _intercept_ intercept_ support_ support_vectors_ Ex: For OneClassSVM, if you obtained 10 support vectors (after fitting dataset X) and wanted to prune the last one (index -1) the code would be as follows: model = OneClassSVM() model.fit(X) model._intercept_ = model._intercept_ + temp_model.dual_coef_[0][-1] model.intercept_ = model.intercept_ + temp_model.dual_coef_[0][-1] model._dual_coef_ = np.delete(model._dual_coef_, -1, axis=1) model.dual_coef_ = np.delete(model.dual_coef_, -1, axis=1) model.support_ = np.delete(model.support_, -1, axis=0) model.support_vectors_ = np.delete(model.support_vectors_, -1, axis=0)
