You didn't constrain the output. Without such a constraint, you allow for any real number to be predicted, including numbers that are ridiculous. For instance, logistic regressions constrain the probability predictions to $[0,1]$ by applying a link function that compresses the real line to the unit interval. An alternative might be to fit a log-linked gamma generalized linear model or a log-linked Gaussian generalized linear model. A negative price might make sense, but the interpretation would be that, instead of selling the car, you pay someone to take it off your hands. I could imagine this for someone who has a useless item that is expensive to store, so you hire someone to take it away. It also might be that the year is not a linear predictor of price. I would guess that prices don't just increase by a fixed amount every year. If the price of a car goes up $X\%$ each year (nonlinear), that's different than the price going up $\$Y$ every year (linear).
