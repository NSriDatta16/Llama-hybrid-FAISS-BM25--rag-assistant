Cocoa (and Cocoa Touch) are mostly based on a model-view-controller organization. CALayers are in the view tier. This leads to two questions: What part of your model does your layer present to the user? How do you make that part of the model persist? The answers to those questions are your solution. Nowadays, for a new app, the simplest (certainly most extensible) path to a persistent model is probably Core Data.
