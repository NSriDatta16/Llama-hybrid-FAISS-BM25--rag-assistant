Download file using urllib in Python with the wget -c feature

I am programming a software in Python to download HTTP PDF from a database. Sometimes the download stop with this message : retrieval incomplete: got only 3617232 out of 10689634 bytes How can I ask the download to restart where it stops using the 206 Partial Content HTTP feature ? I can do it using wget -c and it works pretty well, but I would like to implement it directly in my Python software. Any idea ? Thank you
