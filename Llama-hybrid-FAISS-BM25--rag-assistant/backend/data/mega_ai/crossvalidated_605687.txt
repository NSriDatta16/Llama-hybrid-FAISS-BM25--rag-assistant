I have come across this issue before and this is a limitation of the package. However, an easy solution is just to do it manually, since it's easy enough. Just fit the nuisance functions using your method of choice (like 2 logistic regressions), and then just compute the doubly robust scores yourself according to the formula. Then you use your random forest regressor or whatever to fit these scores and estimate the conditional average treatment effect. It is still possible at this step for the algo to produce results outside the range of [-1,1], but it becomes increasingly improbable with larger data size.
