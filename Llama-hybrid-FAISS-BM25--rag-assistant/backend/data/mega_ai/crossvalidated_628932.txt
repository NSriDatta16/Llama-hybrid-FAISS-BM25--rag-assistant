Is it appropriate to present predicted probabilities from emmeans for a mixed-effects binomial logistic regression?

I am trying to understand how to analyze data for a generalized mixed model (GLMM) with a binary response. I am interested in visualizing the predicted probabilities, as well as a measure of effect size (e.g., odds ratios). Synthetic data are presented below. (I will also note that my actual data are skewed and have very few observations for Size >100.) Questions Is the visualization of estimated marginal means appropriate (see below) given the structure of my data and model (i.e., ID as a random effect)? I am not interested in the conditional within-group effects, but I want to account for the repetition of ID in the data. I don't know of a way to account for ID with emmeans (or using predict(), etc.) when ID is a random effect. To obtain odds ratios for a few contrasts, I am a bit confused about the interpretation, particularly because I have used log(Size) and there are various transformations involved. Do the contrasts presented below compare odds ratios for Size 50, 100, and 250, or log(50), log(100), and log(250)? What is a simple, plain-language interpretation? I think the asymptotic CIs obtained from emmeans and confint are Wald CIs. Based on some reading, it seems like many statisticians prefer profile or bootstrapped CIs. Is there a simple way to do that for both the predicted probabilities and ORs? The reprex: Creating the synthetic data # Set seed set.seed(123) # Create a unique ID list unique_ids $Practice Practice) # convert Practice to a factor 1. GLMM and predicted probabilities use_mod I logged Size to deal with the convergence/rescaling warnings, which is also a problem with the actual data. I will also note that I want to use the interaction because it best represents the hypotheses I am testing (i.e., whether or not it's significant is somewhat irrelevant here). Estimated marginal means and visualization of predicted probabilities # Specify the range of values for the continuous variable (Size) size_values $Size), max(synth_data$ Size), by = 1) # Calculate estimated marginal means and save as data frame use_emm 2. Odds ratios # Include key Sizes for the custom contrasts use_emm_v2 (By changing the contrast to by = "Size" I can also obtain comparisons of ORs by Size, rather than by Practice.)
