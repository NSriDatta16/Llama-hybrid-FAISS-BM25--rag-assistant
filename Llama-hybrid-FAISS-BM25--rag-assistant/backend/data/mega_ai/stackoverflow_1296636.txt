Your override is telling FNH that you will manually write the mappings for that class. The error you are getting is because there is nothing being mapped for Organisation (if you look at the generated HBM.xml it will be empty). What exactly are you wanting to write the override for? Edit: In that case, you can do something like this: public class MyAlteration : IAutoMappingAlteration { public void Alter(AutoPersistenceModel model) { model.ForTypesThatDeriveFrom ( map => map.HasMany ( x => x.Children) ); } } And when configuring fluent nhibernate: model.Alteration( a => a.Add ()); Note: This is using the latest codebase of fluent nhibernate (1.0RC).
