Variable Scope issue with if statements (PHP)

Alright I seem to have a misconception with variable scope with PHP, forgive my lack of the subject as I come from a Java, C# background. Thinking I could make variables accessible to functions or if statements simply by placing it outside it. Below is a snippet of what I'm trying to accomplish: foreach ($nm as $row=>$im) { $itm_name = $im; $lnk = $lnk_cty[$row]; if($mode == 'addMenu') { $m = $m_id; //id will be coming from fresh insert of menu_name } else { $m = $_POST['mnu_add'][$row]; echo "MENU_ID: ".$m; } if($mode == 'addCat') { $m = $c_id; //id will be coming from fresh insert of cat_name } else { $m = $_POST['cat_add'][$row]; } //used for testing purposes echo "item name: ".$itm_name ." "; echo "lnk: ".$lnk ." "; echo "m: ".$m ." "; //$m is empty here, because its a new declaration as oppose to accessing $m value from if statement $display_fields .= " ".$itm_name." ".$item." "; $sql_array[] = '("' . $itm_name . '", "' . $lnk . '", ' . $m . ')'; // Add a new entry to the queue } Now what I'm trying to do is make the $m variable values accessible outside the if statements its in to the $m variable used in the $sql_array[] statement. In C# I would simply declare a variable outside the foreach loop and be able to use it. After doing some reading on the matter I found that using the global or GLOBALS keywords would only work if my global scope variable is assign the value before the foreach, and declaring global $m to obtain that value within the loop. But with my current code $m is of a local scope within the if statements and everyone discourages using them. Now, is there a better method of making $m accessible to the $sql_array[] statement?
