The URL makes a bad primary key for a few reasons - one being that every time you insert a new record, your pages will fragment because it has to physically reorganize the entire table and stick the new record where it belongs alphabetically. Index the URL column and you'll get all the lookup performance you need. Rebuilding an index every time you insert is preferable to what is in some ways rebuilding the table. Another (as Josh pointed out) is that URLs are highly similar, so comparisons will be extremely slow (compared to an int that is) - for two items - 2007 and 2008 inside website.com/Type/Car/Country/Usa/Manufacturer/Ford/Year/ you have to cover a lot of ground - 56 characters (plus the three for 200 ) before you hit a unique.
