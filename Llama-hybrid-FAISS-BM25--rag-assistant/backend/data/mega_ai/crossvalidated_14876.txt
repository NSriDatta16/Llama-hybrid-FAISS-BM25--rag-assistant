Interpreting distance from hyperplane in SVM

I have a few doubts in understanding SVMs intuitively. Assume we have trained a SVM model for classification using some standard tool like SVMLight or LibSVM. When we use this model for prediction on test data, the model generates a file having "alpha" values for each test point. If alpha value is positive the test point belongs to Class 1, else it belongs to Class 2. Now, can we say that a test point with greater "alpha" value belongs to corresponding class with "higher" probability? Similar to first question, when we have a SVM trained. The SV's lie very near to the hyper-plane. So does that mean that SV's belong to that class with high probability? Can we relate the probability of a point belonging to a class with it's distance from the "hyperplane"? Does "alpha" value represent distance from "hyperplane"? Thanks for your input.
