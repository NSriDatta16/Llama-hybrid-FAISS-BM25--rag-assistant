The DV is completion of a certain behaviour (Yes, No). Then you should not be doing ANOVA. That's appropriate for continuous outcomes, not binary outcomes like yours. See this web page for guidance on how to choose a statistical test based on the nature of the outcome and predictor variables. You should do a binary regression, with logistic regression being the typical version. You would model the log-odds of a Yes response as a function of your Gender and Relationship predictors, and include an interaction term between them. You don't need to worry about the different numbers in each group, as the errors around the group estimates are assumed to be based on binomial statistics rather than a Gaussian distribution.* This UCLA web page shows how to implement logistic regression in SPSS. *Even if you were doing ANOVA with a continuous outcome, the sample sizes are so close that you wouldn't have to worry. ANOVA is now typically implemented via regression models with interaction terms, analogously to how you will do your logistic regression. The main issue even in classic ANOVA isn't the equality of sample size per se . It's that without (approximately) equal sample sizes you might get into trouble if the variances within each group aren't the same. Quality control of a regression model includes evaluating how well the equal-variance assumption holds.
