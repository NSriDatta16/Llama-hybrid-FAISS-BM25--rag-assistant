Problem understanding the logistic regression link function

I am trying to learn the logistic regression model. I came to know that there is no linear relationship between predictor variables and response variables since response variables are binary (dichotomous). The link function used for logistic regression is logit which is given by $$ \log \frac {p}{1 - p} = \beta X $$ This tells that the log odds is a linear function of input features. Can anyone give me the mathematical interpretation of how the above relation becomes linear i.e. how logistic regression assumes that the log odds are linear function of input features? Since I am poor at statistics, I can't understand complex mathematical answer.
