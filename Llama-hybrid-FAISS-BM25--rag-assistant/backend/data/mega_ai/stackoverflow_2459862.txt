What happens if my server loses power and I'm using the MEMORY engine?

Does the MEMORY storage engine of MySQL ever write to disk the database contents? Meaning, if I'm using the MEMORY storage engine and my database server loses power - do I lose all of my database content or is it backed up to disk?
