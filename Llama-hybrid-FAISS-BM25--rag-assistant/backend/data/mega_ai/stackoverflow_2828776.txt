jQuery: Trouble with draggable across cloned elements

I'm trying to implement: User drags a draggable li to a droppable li . The original li is no longer draggable A new li is cloned from the original li , and is appended to the droppable li . I can't get it to work. function moveToTerm(original_course, helper, term) { var cloned_course = original_course.clone(true); original_course.addClass('already-scheduled'); original_course.draggable('disable'); cloned_course.draggable(); cloned_course.appendTo(term).hide().fadeIn('slow'); } This works fine, except now the cloned_course is not draggable. A droppable li : Fall 2010 Computing Cultures New Media and Society What am I doing wrong?
