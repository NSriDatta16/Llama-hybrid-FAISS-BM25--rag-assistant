Reordering a list of positional items

I have a Request object which contains a list of Approvers. An approver has a name and an approval position. Mathew Mark Luke John Ultimately, a request will move through this chain, starting at Mathew and ended at John. I need to be able to re-order these allowing adds and deletes as outlined below. An approver can be - Added at a certain position - ie. Add Peter at position 3 in which case the new order would be Mathew Mark Peter Luke John Delete - ie. Delete Mark in which case the new order is Mathew Luke John Edited - ie you can change John's position to 1 in which case the new order is John Mathew Mark Luke I have come up with a number of solutions, however none of them is particular elegant. Any help would be much appreciated
