Granger causality to measure causality strength

It is possible to use the Granger causality (GA) test to measure the strength of the causal relation between two time series? More specifically, if we have 3 time series A, B, and C and we have: p-value GA(A, B) = 0.04 p-value GA(A, C) = 0.02 Can we conclude that the causal relation between A and C is twice stronger the causal relation between A and B? If not, why are the p-values not good to measure the strength of the relation and how could we measure the strength of the relation instead?
