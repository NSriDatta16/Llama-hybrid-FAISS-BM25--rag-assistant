You're seeing the side-effect of Automatic Route Metric computation. When multiple addresses have route to an address and Automatic Metrics (in the Advanced... settings under TCP) is enabled, Windows will use try and predict the "fastest" path to that address. I suspect both your interfaces (virtual or otherwise) have the similar route metrics so the choice is non-deterministic. You could encourage it from using your "back-edge" address for by setting a higher route-metric on your .10/ .11 addresses. With automatic metrics disabled you could also prescribe an explicit static route using your 10.10.10.1 address. More detail on TechNet - search on page for Automatic Metrics. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727001.aspx For better or worse. If both interfaces advertise a path with equal metrics - either interface can win. The behavior in the past was nondeterministic - it's changed. The best approach is to use route at the command-line to either create a static persistent TCP route with lower or lowest cost between .1 and .2. Alternately increase the cost of every route on .14 & .15 addresses. I'd use the former since there is less to maintain and less side-effects on other communications.
