Generalized distribution time series moving averages

I'm trying to figure out a pattern that I'm seeing. I have weights generated by an unknown function F F(3) = [-3/9, 2/9, 6/9, 3/9, 1/9] F(4) = [-8/16, -1/16, 5/16, 10/16, 6/17, 3/16, 1/16] F(5) = [-15/25, -6/25, 2/25, 9/25, 15/25, 10/25, 6/25, 3/25, 1/25] ... I understand how the function is generating the series/weights, but I'm wondering if there's any more nuance or theory behind the weight generation. I know that that weights are generated according to some time series manipulation (likely manipulations of moving averages of different lengths). Curious if anyone has seen anything like this and could enlighten me on the theory behind these weights
