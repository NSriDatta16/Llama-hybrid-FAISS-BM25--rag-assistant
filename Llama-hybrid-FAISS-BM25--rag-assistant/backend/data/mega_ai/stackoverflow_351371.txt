jQuery: Creating a circular slider

You may have seen JavaScript sliders before: http://dev.jquery.com/view/tags/ui/1.5b2/demos/ui.slider.html What I'm envisioning is a circular slider. It would consist of a draggable button at one point on the circle -- and that button can be dragged anywhere along the ring. The value depends on what position the button is at (think of a clock).
