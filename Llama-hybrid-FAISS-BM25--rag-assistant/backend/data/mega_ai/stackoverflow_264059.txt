AI is the intellectual project of trying to capture all aspects of human intelligence in computers. A different project, also called AI, seeks to use human-inspired algorithms to approximate conventionally intractable problems. AI could be said to encompass such fields as robotics, planning, reasoning, learning, and natural language understanding. Machine learning is the discipline which attempts to improve on a machine's performance of a task, given examples. It could be considered to be within AI's range of interests, but researchers in machine learning need have no intellectual stakes in AI's overall success. Machine learning has a close overlap with statistical physics and certain signal processing topics, and certain formulations strongly overlap planning, control theory, and dynamic programming. Soft computing involves processes that involve indirect, approximate solutions instead of binary algorithms, widely considered to include such technologies as fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. There is a broad overlap between these techniques and a certain planning and learning subset of AI, control theory, complex systems theory, etc.
