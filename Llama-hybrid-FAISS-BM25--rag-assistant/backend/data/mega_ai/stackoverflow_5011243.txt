Zooming a UIScrollView in MonoTouch

I'm trying to implement zooming functionality using a UIScrollView in MonoTouch but I just can't seem to make it work. I've looked at a few tutorials which talk about setting a Delegate but most of it is in Obj-C which I can't translate over to C#. Basically, I have a UIScrollView in Interface Builder that has an UIImageView as a Subview. I've set the ContentSize of the UIScrollView to be the full size of the image and have also set a min/max zoom scale. Here's my code: UIImage imgMap = new UIImage("img/map.png"); ivMap.Image = imgMap; svMap.MinimumZoomScale = 1.0f; svMap.MaximumZoomScale = 3.0f; svMap.ContentSize = new System.Drawing.SizeF(ivMap.Frame.Width, ivMap.Frame.Height); Any ideas on what I'm missing? EDIT I've created a new .xib file with the code provided by @Geoff but still no luck, the image just scrolls but still doesn't zoom. public override void ViewDidLoad () { base.ViewDidLoad (); UIScrollView sv = new UIScrollView (thisView.Frame); UIImageView iv = new UIImageView(UIImage.FromFile ("img/map.png")); sv.AddSubview (iv); sv.ContentSize = iv.Frame.Size; sv.MinimumZoomScale = 1.0f; sv.MaximumZoomScale = 3.0f; vwMineral.AddSubview(sv); }
