If you consider x to be constant, well the expected value will be x. If you want to look at the evolution of x you cannot make the hypothesis that x is constant. My approach would be different. Suppose now that your x is evolving over time, you have a time series. To guess the expected value you can build a model. This model should include: A trend: x will grow as the typist learns how to type, will decrease as the typist gets older. Periodical effects: Annually as motivation come and go with the weather, Monthly as motivation come and come with the pay, daily as the typist can feel fatigue. And some high variation: sickness if you look at days, loss of attention if you look at hour, typo if you look at minutes. As you can see, taking a mean as an estimator of the future is not enough. You have to build a good estimator. This could be complex as I probably forget some effects (fear of the blank page, a publication to finish ... ) and as it will need lots of x measures. So we can come back to your solution. Suppose the trend is slow. Choose a period wich will keep the periodical effects you need and avoid the others. Build a model for other effects. A simple one can just take the probability of being affected and the loss of speed. You can take the mean on the period mentioned above, and adjust for other effects to have a good estimation of the expected value.
