We have recently started using JSR-330 dependency injection (using Guice from SVN) and found that it was possible to read in a Properties file (or any other map) and bind it inside Guice in the module in the startup code so that the @Inject @Named("key") String value string was injected with the value corresponding to the key when that particular code was called. This is the most elegant way I have ever seen for solving this problem! You do not have to haul configuration objects around your code or sprinkle all kinds of magic method calls in each and every corner of the code to get the values - you just mention to Guice you need it, and it is there. Note: I've had a look at Guice, Weld (Seam-based) and Spring which all provide injection, because we want JSR-330 in our own code, and I like Guice the best currently. I think the reason is because Guice is the clearest in its bindings as opposed to the under-the-hood magic happening with Weld.
