What is the best way to change the cursor in JQuery

I am new to JQuery. I am trying to add some code in my HTML web page to change the cursor, but I am not sure if it is the best way to do it using JQuery alone rather than doing some self-custom declaration in an external CSS. (I don't know if JQuery has got some built-in CSS properties.) Here is the code for my very simple HTML web page: $(document).ready(function(){ $("#replybox").draggable(); $("#closed").mouseover(function(){ $("#closed").css("cursor","pointer"); }); }); Press here to close this box Content: Helloworld Please advise.
