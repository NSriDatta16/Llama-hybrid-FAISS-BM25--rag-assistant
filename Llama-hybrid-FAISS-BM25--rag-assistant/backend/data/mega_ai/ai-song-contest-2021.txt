The 2021 contest was independently organised by John Ashley Burgoyne, Ryan Groves, Anna Huang, Rujing Stacy Huang, Hendrik Vincent Koops, and Rebecca Leger, and it was supported by the technology hubs Wallifornia MusicTech, DeepMusic.ai, and Amsterdam Music Lab. The results of the competition were announced on 6 July 2021 at a virtual conference that was part of the four-day Music & Innovation Summit organised by Wallifornia MusicTech.
