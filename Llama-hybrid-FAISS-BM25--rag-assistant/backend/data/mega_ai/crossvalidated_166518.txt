One way to go would to be to recognize that a Poisson process has exponentially distributed inter-arrival times with a mean parameter the same as the Poisson average rate. I believe the exprnd function in MATLAB can generate such exponentially-distributed data. Just generate a long list of such data, and calculate the cumulative sums to get arrival times.
