I have just looked at the headers that safari issues on the request and you can see an x-purpose: preview value. Check for this header to avoid false positives on visits: GET http://www.yahoo.com/ HTTP/1.1 Host: www.yahoo.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.18.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0 Safari/533.16 X-Purpose: preview Accept: application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Accept-Language: en-US Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Connection: keep-alive Hope this helps!
