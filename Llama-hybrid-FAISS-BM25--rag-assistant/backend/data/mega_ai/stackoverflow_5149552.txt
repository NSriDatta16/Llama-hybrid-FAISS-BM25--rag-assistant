jQuery not closing window

I'm making a form for an e-commerce site for the user to request a PDF about an item. The form works fine and sends the user to the "Thanks" page. On the thanks page I have jQuery set an interval to close the window after 5 seconds. But it does not work, neither does embedding the close command in a link. However, the interval will work if the "Thanks" page opens in a new tab. Here is the code in the php file (gets called after form has been successfully submitted). /* Results rendered as HTML */ $theResults = Thanks $(document).ready(function() { //wait a few seconds and close the window setInterval(function() { window.close(); }, 5000); }); body{ background-color: transparent; margin: auto auto auto auto; border: none; } #general-copy{ background-color: transparent; margin: -5px auto auto 0px; position: absolute; width: 300px; height: 350px; padding: 0px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant:normal; font-weight:100; text-align: justify; z-index: 3; } Thank you for your request. We will email you a pdf all about $item2Field. This window should close itself in 5 seconds. If it doesn't please click here to return to the site. EOD; echo "$theResults"; ?> If you wish to see this running live you can try it out here .
