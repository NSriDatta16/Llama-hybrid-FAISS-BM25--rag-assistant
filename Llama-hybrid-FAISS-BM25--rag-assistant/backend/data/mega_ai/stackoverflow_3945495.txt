Visual Studio 2010 - How to use System Environment Variables?

I'd really appreciate some help or ideas on a very frustrating issue. In my experience it seems that any time I need to organize or update my solutions/projects, I realize how buggy and poor the program actually is. I always end up having to find a hack or run into a nasty trial by failure that forces me start from scratch at least once during the process. Anyways, my issue is that I've been upgrading projects from 2005 to 2008 and the time has come to get 2010 up and running. For my older projects, I decided at one point to use System Environment Variables to set as my output directory. For Example: My Machine: System->Advanced Settings->Environment Variables 3DSMAX_DEV_ROOT_32 = F:/Temp/Rampage/ My Project->General: Output Directory = $(3DSMAX_DEV_ROOT_32) My Project->Linker->General: Output File = $(OutDir)MyPlugin.dll This always worked for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 and I still heavily depend on it. However, for 2010, it just won't work. I'd be surprised if I'm the only one who has dealt with this but I haven't seen anyone else run into it. Others have mentioned Project Environment Variables but I haven't seen anything on the system ones. Anyways, if you have any ideas how to make them work or know why they now seem to completely disregard them, I'd love to hear about it. To make matters worse, I know leading digits are usually a no-no, but my EV's have them and VS's EV's are not allowed to have them. I know of a way I can get around it but I'm on a team of developers and making this change would be a huge pain for everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read. Erik
