I guess there is a misunderstanding here because the output of the decoder network theoretically also corresponds to the mean parameter of the conditional likelihood $p(x|z)$ . And in fact, in practice, as your title mentions, we directly take this predicted mean as an output sample from the network. To really get a feel of what is happening, consider the Continuous Bernoulli VAE ( article ). Here, as opposed to the Gaussian distribution, the parameter $\lambda$ of the CB distribution used as conditional likelihood does not correspond to the mean of the CB distribution, hence the sample is obtained after a further transformation (Equation 8 of the paper).
