Predictor is significant in logistic regression, but not in Mann-Whitney

I have run a logistic regression using several predictor variables (call them $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$ ) to predict a binary dependent variable (call it $y$ ). $p_1$ is a significant predictor of $y$ in the regression. However, a Mann-Whitney test of $p_1$ shows no significant difference by category of $y$ . Is it normal to have a significant logistic regression predictor that doesn't significantly differ by groups, or is there potentially something screwy with the data?
