The problem you have is called 'customer churn'. Look up retention and churn on Wikipedia and Google Scholar articles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_retention Strictly speaking you have a regression problem: you have a few dozen variables (features) and you want to predict a continuous dependent variable, i.e. the number of days while the customer is retained. This will be your target variable, you will regress this. As a start I would recommend trying a Random Forest regressor, a multivariate linear regression using only the numeric features or a SVR (support vector regressor). http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html If you have the actual meaning of the feature values I recommend spending ~80% of your time on feature engineering not on the model. This is a problem where good features are more important than smart algorithms. P.S.: Yes, the distribution of retention periods is very not normal, it's like that in all online services. It's closer to a power law than to a normal distribution.
