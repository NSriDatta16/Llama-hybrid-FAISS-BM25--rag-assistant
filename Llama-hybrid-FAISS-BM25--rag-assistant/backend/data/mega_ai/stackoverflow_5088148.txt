Magento - Capture online from code

often when customers complete and pay their order in our store, the order is set to processing but with the amount due still equal to the grand total and amount paid equal to zero. From the magento backend I can then create an invoice and capture the payment online, which solves this issue. Now I would like to do this automatically. Can anybody help me out with the coding? I do succeed in creating the invoice, but I cannot find the right function to capture the payment.
