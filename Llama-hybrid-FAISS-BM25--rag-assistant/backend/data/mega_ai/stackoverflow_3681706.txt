Lowest common multiple for all pairs in a list

I have some code that calculates the lowest common multiple for a list of numbers. I would like to modify this code to return a list of values that represents the lowest common multiple for each pair in my number list. def lcm(numbers): return reduce(__lcm, numbers) def __lcm(a, b): return ( a * b ) / __gcd(a, b) def __gcd(a, b): a = int(a) b = int(b) while b: a,b = b,a%b return a If the input is [3, 5, 10] the output would be [lcm(5,10)=10, lcm(3,5)=15, lcm(3,10)=30] (sorting not required). I feel like there is some elegant way of calculating this list of lowest common multiples but I'm not able to grasp it without some example.
