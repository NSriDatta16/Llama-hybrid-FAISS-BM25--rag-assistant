Sounds like random forests (using regression trees) are the perfect tool for you. You can use regression trees to build a series of trees, then check the variable importance. I don't know much about SPSS, but if you are willing to use R (come on... you know you want to!), the caret package will be able to do this with the train() function (by specifying importance=TRUE and using rfFuncs in the control function). You can then view the importance of each variable. The varImp() function gives you more control. If you want to see what number of variables give you the best results, you can use rfe(). Caret can be a little difficult to wrap your head around, so if you want to include all your variables, you can use this simpler (but less flexible) code from the randomForest package (included with caret): require(randomForest) df I would do this year by year, rather than include the year as a varibale. Time will no doubt play a role in the regression, but I think it would make more sense to build each model for each year and then look for changes in variable importance over time- though 5 isn't a lot to build a powerful time series with. Others might disagree and I wouldn't mind hearing others' opinions. If you don't want to use R, I would update your question to signal for SPSS users who might know how to implement random forests with variable importance.
