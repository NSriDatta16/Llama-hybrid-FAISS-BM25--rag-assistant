"...the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm proposes a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is (the target distribution we are interested in sampling) and then simulate the Markov chain." This is not correct: $\mathbf H$ is a stochastic matrix associated with a Markov chain which stationary distribution is not $\pi$ . The (different) stationary distribution associated with $\mathbf H$ does not matter, since the proposed state $j$ is potentially rejected with the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability $\alpha_{ij}$ . The total transition matrix is thus made of the elements $$\beta_{ij} = \alpha_{ij} H_{ij} + \sum_{\ell=1}^k(1-\alpha_{i\ell}) H_{i\ell} \mathbb{I}_{i=j}$$
