The sample size of 30 is typically a rule of thumb for how large of a sample size you need for the sample average to be approximatelly normally distributed. This is necessary if you are doing some kind of inference on a population parameter. As another user pointed out, you might need a larger sample size if you want your hypotheses test to have a particular power.
