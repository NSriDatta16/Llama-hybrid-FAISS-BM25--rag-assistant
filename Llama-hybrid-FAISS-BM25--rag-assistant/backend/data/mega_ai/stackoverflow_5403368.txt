I dont know about 2.0 but in 4.0 it would probably be something along the lines of public void VisitPixels(Image image, Action func){ for (int x = 0; x If you want a return value it can get a bit more tricky but you can perhaps think of it like either a Map or a Fold Map Pseudo: public T[][] MapPixels (Image image, Func func){ var ret = new T[image.Width][image.Height]; for (int x = 0; x Fold public T FoldLPixels (Image image, Func func, T acc){ var ret = acc; for (int x = 0; x You could then for example get an average Brightness like: var avgBright = FoldLPixels(image, (a,b)=>a+b.GetBrightness(), 0) / (image.Width+image.Height);
