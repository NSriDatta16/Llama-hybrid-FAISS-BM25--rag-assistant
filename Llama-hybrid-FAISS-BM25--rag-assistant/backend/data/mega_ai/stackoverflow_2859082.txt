Since the problem was due to not being able to resolve the inner reference uo.UserID in the line INNER JOIN UserAddressOrder uo ON ua.UserID = uo.UserID , I replaced the line with a call to a function which accepts the uo.UserID value as a parameter. This doesn't solve the problem elegantly, but it got the job done (although with a slight performance hit).
