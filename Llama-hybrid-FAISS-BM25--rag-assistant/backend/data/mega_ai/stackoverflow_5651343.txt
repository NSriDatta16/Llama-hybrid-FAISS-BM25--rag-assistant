nhibernate transform result in a dictionnary

Hello I would like how to have a specific output in nhibernate var hql = @"select t1.info1, t2.info2 from table1 t1 left outer join t1.table2 t2"; var variable = session.CreateQuery(hql).List(); That query return an object array which contains another array. ie : in the first line, info1 can be retrieved by variable[0][0] and in the same line, info2 can be retrieved by variable[0][1] I know that I can create a new Class like class SpecificQuery { public int info1; public int? info2 } and then call : session.CreateQuery(hql) .SetResultTransformer(new AliasToBeanResultTransformer(typeof(SpecificQuery))).List(); But I don't want to create a specific class each time I want to have a special return. Does someone know a solution to that problem ? For example, a IList >[] In this case, the first line of info1 can be retrieve by variable0 (in case of variable[0][0] Thanks
