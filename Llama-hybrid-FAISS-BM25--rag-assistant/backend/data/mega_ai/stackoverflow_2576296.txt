Using Python tuples as vectors

I need to represent immutable vectors in Python ("vectors" as in linear algebra, not as in programming). The tuple seems like an obvious choice. The trouble is when I need to implement things like addition and scalar multiplication. If a and b are vectors, and c is a number, the best I can think of is this: tuple(map(lambda x,y: x + y, a, b)) # add vectors 'a' and 'b' tuple(map(lambda x: x * c, a)) # multiply vector 'a' by scalar 'c' which seems inelegant; there should be a clearer, simpler way to get this done -- not to mention avoiding the call to tuple , since map returns a list. Is there a better option?
