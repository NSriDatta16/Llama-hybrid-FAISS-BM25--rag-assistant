does r-squared say anything about statistical error?

Can i estimate error bars based on the value of R-squared, when the signal is measured once (no SD)? Normally I do not use statistics but the time has come and i have to calculate error bars.. The instrument measures signal y (once) in the function of x, for each point we get R-squared value. Is it possible to estimate error bars for the measured signal y in this case? I thought I could somehow use 1- R-squared but it only gives me information about the fraction that cannot be described with exact model, isn't it? Shall I in this case simply change the sequence in the way that each point (y) is the average of 3 measurements so as to get error bars or can I use R-squared for this purpose? I would be very grateful for any idea. Raw data for x (magnetic field [Oe]), y (measured magnetic moment[Am^2]) and R-squared below:
