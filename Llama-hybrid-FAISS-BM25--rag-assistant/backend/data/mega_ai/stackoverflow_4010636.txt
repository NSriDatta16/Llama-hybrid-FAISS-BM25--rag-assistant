This can be a really complex problem to solve depending on what you are trying to do. I would suggest fist looking at google analytics or piwik which is some php application you install and use like google analytics. If you need an in house solution then most likely you have to leverage cookies. There are two types of cookies. A simple cookie can be dropped when user is on page foo.com and the application is trying to set a cookie on foo.com. Another type of cookie is when you are viewing foo.com but another application is trying to create a cookie for bar.com. This is called a 3rd party cookie which sometimes is blocked. This is how services like google analytics track users. There are other ways to find unique users. You can use ip address, browser signature, etc... The problem with these solutions are that many companies, universities, or other large companies are usually behind one ip address. You don't want to count a whole department as one person. There other ways you can track users but these are advanced. (localStorage, flash, cache). I would advise to use Google Analytics first. If this is not enough then you can pursue other options.
