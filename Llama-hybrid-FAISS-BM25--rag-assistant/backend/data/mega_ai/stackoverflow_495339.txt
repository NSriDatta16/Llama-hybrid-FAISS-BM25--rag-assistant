Free tools to speed up web development

As a little side project, I am starting to build a new website for a certain organization I am affiliated to, which current site is simply outdated. I am regularly a Java developer, and last time I really did some web development was back in the late 90s, when was still more popular than and Javascript was cutting-edge technology (JQuery is for lazy bums these days :) ). Anyway, I feel really outdated. The website basically is going to be: Django based mostly serve static information pages it will have a dynamic news and updates page (based on Django admin capabilites) and some basic apps I'll develop myself (polls, small registration app, etc...) My problem is designing the whole thing. I found some nice web-based CSS layout generators that got me going, but I still feel I'm wasting my time smoothing out the CSS files and aligning s. Are there any tools - the simpler and faster, the better - that you recommend I can use to speed up the design part of the site so I can concentrate on the real work? I don't need anything fancy, just a nice looking layout and design that I can tweak a bit so the site will look presentable.
