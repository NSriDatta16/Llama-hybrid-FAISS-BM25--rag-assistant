Why so many web pages contain such a strange code snippet in header?

I've noticed for quite a long time that strange domains such like jsev.com, cssxx.com appered in my firefox status bar from time to time, I always wonder why so many web pages contains resources from these strange domains. I googled it, but found nothing. I guess it's some kind of virus which infect the servers and insert the code. Here is a sample taken from page header of http://www.eflorenzano.com/threadexample/blog/ : function getuseragnt() { var agt = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); agt = agt.replace(/ /g, ""); return agt; } document.write(" ") edit: I am on a debian box, only on firefox I see this code, I just tried opera, this code doesn't appear in opera, really strange, never heard of firefox having such problems.
