"I would like to develop a quite complicated and specifically custom-suited back-end application for teachers to interact with individual students, including the design of shared/custom calendars, announcement privileges, etc. I currently have a bit of expertise with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and I could wrap my head around some JavaScript and AJAX stuff if need-be. However, would such a complicated application work with Drupal (in that I could create it to specifically suite my purposes)?" You won't need to do all that work. Just install Views, Calendars, Date, and Organic Groups. That should solve 98% of what you wanted to do.
