the mData field is marked as void because different audio formats have different storage requirements. basically in C a void pointer can point to anything. so you could say mData = (SInt32 *)malloc(sizeof(Sint32) * numElements); and then when you want to use it cast it to the data type you want. Sint32 *myBuffer = (SInt32 *)mData;
