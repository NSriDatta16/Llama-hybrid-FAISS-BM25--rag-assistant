Rails can seem somewhat impenetrable without a good reference book. While there are many on the market, I found the Pragmatic Bookshelf to produce some of the best Ruby and Rails specific ones ( http://www.pragprog.com/titles ). While Ruby is fairly straightforward to understand, Rails can take longer to fully absorb because there are a number of conventions that may be unfamiliar. Depending on your background, you may not have had much experience with a MVC-type design, or with object oriented programming in general, so those aspects can be a bit bewildering at first.
