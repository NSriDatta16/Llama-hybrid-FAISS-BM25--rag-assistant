Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test, P=1?

I'm trying to perform a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test on a bunch of logistic regression models but for some reason the p-value that is returned is 1 on all of the models. Does anybody have a clue on why that is happening? Here's a piece of my R-code: model1 and the output of the tests are: X-squared = 0.35263, df = 8, p-value = 1 X-squared = 0.035221, df = 8, p-value = 1 X-squared = 0.29097, df = 8, p-value = 1
