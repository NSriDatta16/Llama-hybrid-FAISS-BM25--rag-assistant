Regression with a quadratic term of a variable that has both negative and positive values

I am running a linear regression with a quadratic regressor of this form: $$Y_t= \alpha + \beta_0 X_t + \beta_1 X^2_t + \gamma W_t + \eta_t.$$ Since my $X$ variable measures the difference between the rainfall of a given year and the long-term rainfall average, it can take both positive and negative values. I was wondering whether I should enter the quadratic term as it is (therefore containing only positive values) or manually replace the squared values with their negative for the negative X values.
