Time Series Forecast as a Probability

I am looking to create a model that takes in a time series, and outputs the probability that the time series will exceed some threshold over some future time frame (thresholds are pre-determined by me). I would like then to constantly update the model as more data is received so it is constantly updating these probabilities. For example, I observe the temperature every minute from 2am - 8am, what is the the probability that the temperature in the next 5min exceeds X degrees. I am familiar with ARIMA models, but my time series tends to exhibit heteroskedasticity so I don't think those techniques are relevant to this situation (correct me if I am wrong). It's almost like I want a bayesian model that works for time series, but I have never come across such a thing. I see this similar thread but it was kind of vague and not helpful. Any ideas of what kind of models I can look into for this kind of setup?
