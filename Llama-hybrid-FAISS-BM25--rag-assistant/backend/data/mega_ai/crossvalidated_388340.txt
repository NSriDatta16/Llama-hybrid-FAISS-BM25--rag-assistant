Given you have only 40 observations in total, LOOCV would be the best option. Yes, for ex. linear models are not suitable since they cannot be used for p>n problems, unless you apply some sort of regularization, such as LASSO or RIDGE regression (or both ELASTIC NET), ELASTIC NET is probably the best option from linear models. Random forests would be another good option, they should work well on high-dimensional data, in general. First of all, they need to be able to deal with high-dimensional data, second some degree of regularization is required. Feature selection is very recommended, as most algorithms will work terribly if given too many variables, since they will find mostly noise otherwise. A first pass of feature reduction helps greatly. SVM could work, if you find an appropriate kernel to separate your data, not easy in general.
