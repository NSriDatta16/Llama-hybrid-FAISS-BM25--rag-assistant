There's no requirement you use a particular programming language or platform. Have you looked at RIAForge ? If there's no off the shelf ColdFusion client, you could do the legwork and develop one yourself. But then again, ColdFusion is Java based, so you just leverage one of the java packages that supports the Open Graph API. Likewise for twitter, if none of the existing ColdFusion examples suit you, you could always use one of the other libraries .
