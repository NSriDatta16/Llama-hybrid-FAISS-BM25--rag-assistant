As for a simple answer... with PCA, it is always a concern about interpretation. So the better option is to apply PCA on the original variables rather than the residuals. "Size-standardizing": Standardizing is essential if the unit of measurements vary considerably (say 5-10 times). Most PCA algorithms/functions inherently do the standardization.
