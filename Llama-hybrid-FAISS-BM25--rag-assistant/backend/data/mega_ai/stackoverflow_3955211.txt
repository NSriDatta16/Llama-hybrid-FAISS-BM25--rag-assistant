You can calculate the average by taking the sum and dividing it by the number of values. In the case of ratings, it is the sum of all ratings divided by the number of ratings. In the case you site, with ratings 5, 5 and 4, the average is (5+5+4)/3, which is 4.666..., and I'd guess they round to the nearest half yielding 4.5 out of 5.
