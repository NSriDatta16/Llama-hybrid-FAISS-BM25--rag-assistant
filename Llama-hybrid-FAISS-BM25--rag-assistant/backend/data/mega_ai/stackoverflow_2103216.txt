First thing, don't be intimidated by the task. Second, you are a team lead, so your opinion of the people counts; it may be a test, but you should be up to it. Third, if you were doing this informally over a coffee and your boss asked you about someone you would probably have no trouble chatting for a few minutes about your observations of them and what you thought were their strengths and weaknesses. That's what you should write down in your review notes. Ask your boss if there is a standard format - if you are in a large organisation HR might have forms and/or systems in place for these sorts of reviews. Otherwise, just give him a paragraph or two in plain English (or your language of choice) on what you think. You can add colour to your reports by citing work they have done and where they have succeeded or failed. Some golden rules... don't get personal try and be objective and fair don't hide the truth, however uncomfortable Good luck, it's all part of stepping up to be a manager and is fun in a way - your opinion is counting.
