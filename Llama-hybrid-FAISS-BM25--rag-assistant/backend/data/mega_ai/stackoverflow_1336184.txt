Maven has an an extensive site mechanism, it does require you to bend to its will though, so that might rule it out for you. Once configured you get a standard set of reports generated on each build, that can be packaged as a jar if you wish, or deployed directly to your build results site. There are plugins for many of the major reporting tools, such as Cobertura/Emma, Junit, JDepend etc. The maven-site-plugin publishes its own sites if you want to have a look .
