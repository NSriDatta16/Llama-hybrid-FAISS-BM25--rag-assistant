In order for there not to be a potential data integrity conflict, you could make the "ready" column a computed column, or you could make a view which provides this translation service. However, for this particular design, I would put the states into a table and have an IsReady column in the state table. Then you could add different states which are all IsReady. I have used designs like this many times, where certain states are equivalent for some operations, but not for others. Each has a flag. In my particular case, many batches in different states were allowed to be counted as "successful" for average timing/performance purposes, but batches which had completely successfully but were later invalidated were not considered "successful", etc.
