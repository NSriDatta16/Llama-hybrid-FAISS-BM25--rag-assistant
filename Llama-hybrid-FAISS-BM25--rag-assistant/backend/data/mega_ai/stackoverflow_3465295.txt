How to depends of a system command with python/distutils?

I'm looking for the most elegant way to notify users of my library that they need a specific unix command to ensure that it will works... When is the bet time for my lib to raise an error: Installation ? When my app call the command ? At the import of my lib ? both? And also how should you detect that the command is missing ( if not commands.getoutput("which CommandIDependsOn"): raise Exception("you need CommandIDependsOn") ). I need advices.
