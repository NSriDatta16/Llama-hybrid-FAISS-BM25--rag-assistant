Building RNNs on mixed sequential and non-sequential data

I have a data set that is a bunch of windows, for each window I want to perform regression. The windows themselves have four sequential features that span back about 24 time steps. Additionally each window has some meta-data about that window that is relevant to the regression problem. What I would like to do is apply an RNN to do the regression, without the metadata this is relatively straight forward to build. However, I am not really sure what the best way to add non-sequential features to the RNN would be. My initial thought is to add the non-sequential feature to a fully connected layer after the recurrent layers. Is this a reasonable approach, or is there a more sensible way to approach this?
