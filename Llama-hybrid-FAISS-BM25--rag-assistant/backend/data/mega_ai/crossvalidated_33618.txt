Pearson Type V distribution is the inverse-gamma distribution . This question was previously answered in your question Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Inverse Gamma Distribution in R or RPy using the command fitdistr . If you do not trust this estimation, you can try direct optimisation of the likelihood function using the command optim . The folowing code shows how to do this using simulated data. If you post your sample, I can adjust the code and perhaps we can see what is causing trouble in the optimisation step. rm(list=ls()) # Required packages library(MCMCpack) # Simulated data set.seed(1) data = rinvgamma(n=250, shape = 5, scale = 2) + 2 hist(data) # log-likelihood ll = function(par){ if(par[1]>0 & par[2]>0 & par[3] I hope this helps.
