Thanks for including the 'Self Study' tag and showing your thoughts so far. Here is a method that organizes your idea towards a solution: For the triangular distribution of $T = X_1 + X_2,$ which has support $(2\mu - 2, 2\mu + 2),$ find the number $\delta$ such that $$P(2\mu - 2 + \delta \le T \le 2\mu + 2 - \delta) = .95.$$ Draw a picture. Elementary geometry and algebra should suffice. Then $\bar X = T/2,$ so that $$P(\mu - 1 + \delta/2 Finally, solve the inequality of the event so that you have $$P(\bar X -1 + \delta/2 \le \mu \le \bar X + 1 - \delta/2) = .95.$$ This is called 'pivoting'. Finally, a 95% CI for $\mu$ is if the form $(\bar X - 1 +\delta/2, \bar X + 1 - \delta/2).$ Notes: (1) Just to check, I used my $\delta,$ del in the code, to simulate (in R) using $\mu = 5$ to see what proportion of a million such confidence intervals $(L,U)$ actually covers $\mu.$ Answer is consistent with 95%. set.seed(324) mu = 5; del = sqrt(.2) # How to evaluate 'del'? x1 = runif(10^6, mu-1, mu+1) x2 = runif(10^6, mu-1, mu+1) a = (x1 + x2)/2 # mean L = a - 1 + del/2 U = a + 1 - del/2 mean(L mu) ## 0.950169 (2) If $T$ is the sum of, say, $n = 10$ or more observations, then the distribution of $T$ is nearly normal (instead of triangular) with mean and SD that are fairly easy to find. Then you can use an appropriate CI based on a good normal approximation.
