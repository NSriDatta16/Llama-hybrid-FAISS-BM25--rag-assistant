When assigning a PHP.ini Firefox 3.6x is not displaying a response page when there is a php exception

I hope I can be brief and still allow you to understand the actual problem. Here goes: [Environment] Windows 7 Premium 64bit IIS 7.0 PHP 5.3.3 VC9 Nonthread safe ZIP mysql 5 [Description of the Problem] Installed PHP to C:\PHP When no defined "PHP.ini" is set in the C:\PHP folder, Firefox / IE, is able to load PHP files and display PHP exceptions fine. this is displayed when view phpinfo(); Configuration File (php.ini) Path C:\Windows Loaded Configuration File (none) When I modified the PHP.ini-development to PHP.ini -- this is where the problem is. IE 7, 8 displays PHP exceptions just fine Firefox displays PHP pages, but not the exceptions... Where there is an exceptions, it just displays blank page or does not load the page at all. it just looks like the browser is refreshing. this is what phpinfo(); displays: Configuration File (php.ini) Path C:\Windows Loaded Configuration File C:\PHP\php.ini So to reiterate, with PHP.ini loaded, Firefox is not displaying any errors generated by PHP (exceptions and not user generated errors) I've googled and only found one post about this with no solution or any leads to go on. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/244432 attached is my php.ini file if that matters as well as IE8 screen and FF screen. (FF screen is blank which is the problem) [sorry can't post links since i am new] thanks in advance. [update 11/30 @ 19:31 ET] @Viper_SB, you're correct.
