Improving an ARIMA model by eliminating AR/ME terms

I've come over the following two statements to manually improve the fit of an ARIMA model by changing its parameters $p,q$ . If the AR coefficients sum to nearly 1 and suggest a unit root in the AR part of the model, eliminate 1 AR term and difference the model once (more). If the MA coefficients sum to nearly 1 and suggest a unit root in the MA part of the model, eliminate 1 MA term and reduce the order of differencing by 1. (From: Stefan Jansen, Hands-On Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading, 2018) Quote relate (might originate) from Rule 9: https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411arim3.htm I am wondering does the "eliminate 1 _ term" refer to decreasing or increasing the respective hyperparameter? I assume that it means decreasing, but what would be the theoretical justification/practical changes be behind these adjustments to create a more suited model?
