Java : Is there a tool to make code (in a 3rd party JAR) forward compatible (1.4 - 1.6)

I have a 3rd party JAR file that is compiled using Java 1.4. Is there a tool that can make the jar file compatible with Java 1.6? (Something like 'retrotranslator' but what does the reverse of it). I tried decompiling the class files and re compile them in 1.6 but it fails. Here is the issue: My project uses 'rsadapter.jar' for was 5.1 and I had my project setup in Eclipse 2.0 + JDK 1.4 and it used to work fine. Now, I have migrated to Java 1.6 and Eclipse Ganymede (as per the requirements) and the same project (exactly same setup) started complaining about the missing class files in the 'rsadapter.jar'. I put the JAR in classpath explicitly too but it still could not load the classes. Then I changed the Java Compiler version to 1.4 and it started working. Regards, - Ashish
