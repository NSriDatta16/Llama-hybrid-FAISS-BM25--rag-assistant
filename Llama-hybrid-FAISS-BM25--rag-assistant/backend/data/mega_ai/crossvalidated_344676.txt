What are the best metrics for text generation using RNN?

I am experimenting with RNNs to generate automated movie reviews, using this article as a reference. I am using LSTMs to achieve this. The reviews are generated by randomly sampling from the LSTM language model. How can I measure the quality of reviews generated? I have explored metrics like BLEU, METEOR and ROGUE. These metrics are well suited for usecases where we know what kind of text to expect. What metrics can I use for my usecase?
