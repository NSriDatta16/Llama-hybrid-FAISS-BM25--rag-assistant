Edit: This was an incorrect attempt at a solution that I'm keeping for posterity. Look at the upvoted/accepted answers. :-) Ah, I just realized that the syntax needs a little bit of adjustment: $agent->{get_basic_credentials} = _user_agent_get_basic_credentials_patch; Without the {} delimiters it looks like a method invocation (which would not be a valid l-value). I'd still like to know how the instance method gets bound/looked up via this syntax. TIA!
