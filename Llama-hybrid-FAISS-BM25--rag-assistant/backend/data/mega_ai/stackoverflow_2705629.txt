XSL testing empty strings with and sorting

I am having trouble with a template that has to check 3 different nodes and if they are not empty, print the data I am using for each node then doing the output but it is not printing anything. It is like the test returns zero. I have selected the parent node of each node I want to check the length on as the template match but it still doesn't work. Another thing, how do I sort the list using . I tried using this but I get an error about loading the stylesheet. If I take out the sort it works Registered Festival Organisers and Festivals Registered Festival Organisers and Festivals Ordered by the festival date ascending Total number of festival organisers: Total number of festivals: USER ID: NAME: ADDRESS: CITY: COUNTY: POSTCODE: TELEPHONE: MOBILE: EMAIL: mailto: SEX: USERNAME: ACCOUNT TYPE: Normal User Volunteer Organiser Administrator FESTIVAL ID: EVENT NAME: URL: DATE FROM: DATE TO: LOCATION: POSTCODE: LATITUDE: LONGITUDE: NAME: ADDRESS: &#160; CITY: COUNTY: POSTCODE: TELEPHONE: MOBILE: FAX: EMAIL: mailto: And a section of my xml.
