Get names of field schema from Pig

I'm working on a JsonStorage for Pig. Everything works fine, but at least I need to get the names of the fields (i.e. crdate, name, positions) from the pig schema. | A | crdate: bytearray | name: bytearray | positions: bytearray | Actually I extend my class by StoreFunc that provides no function to get the names of the fields. public class PigJsonStorage extends StoreFunc { .. } Can anybody help me :)
