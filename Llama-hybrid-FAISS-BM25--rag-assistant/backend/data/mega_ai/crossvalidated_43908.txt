I do not think there is any real difference between "case-mix adjustment" and "risk adjustment" in this context. I would say the terms are used interchangeably. They refer to adjusting for confounding due to patient ("case") mix, or the patients' risks of the outcome being examined. Funders often want to compare hospitals based on indicators such as 30-day mortality (proportion of patients who die within 30 days of discharge from the hospital). But the hospitals can have quite different types of patients. One hospital may have a nursing home down the road, and treat many older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Another may be located near a major highway and treat many emergency trauma patients from motor vehicle accidents. Any comparison of the hospitals needs to somehow adjust for these differences in case mix. In practice adjustment is usually through some form of logistic regression (generally hierarchical to account for clustering within hospitals), either directly including patient characteristics, or calculating and using a propensity score for how likely a patient is to be treated at a particular hospital.
