PRESS from the hat matrix and numerical stability from statsmodels ols.fit()

Leave one out cross validation in the context of ordinary least squares regression can be done via the hat matrix: The "hat" or projection matrix $$ H = X(X^T X)^{-1} X^T $$ many fit statistics include a term which contains $(1-h_{ii})$ . With the leverage of individual runs as: $$ h_{ii} = diag(H)_i $$ For example the predicted error sum of residuals (PRESS, Montgomery and Vining p43). The PRESS residuals can be calculated as: $$ presiduals = \frac{residuals}{1 - h_{ii}} $$ since the leverage of individual runs can become 1. The presiduals can become infinity for some runs. However, a leave one out cross validation would still give meaningful results in such a case. I did not find any literature on this topic which surprises me. Is this a common issue in OLS regression analysis?
