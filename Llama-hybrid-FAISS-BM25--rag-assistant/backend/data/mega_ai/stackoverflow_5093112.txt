How to tag code in C# XML documentation

I have this function: public static string Join(this IEnumerable strings, string separator) { return string.Join(separator, strings.ToArray()); } which I want to document. I want the tag to say string.Join(separator, strings.ToArray()) since to anyone able to read C# code this says more than a thousand words. However, when I use string.Join(separator, strings.ToArray()) then string.Join(separator, strings.ToArray()) will be formatted as plain text, which makes it almost unreadable. So I tried string.Join(separator, strings.ToArray()) but this always creates a new paragraph... So here's my question: Is there a way to format a piece of text so that it appears as if it were code? I'd be satisfied with a fixed-width font.
