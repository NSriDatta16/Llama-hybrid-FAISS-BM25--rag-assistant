Using a named route in Form.Begin in ASP.NET MVC

Is there a way to force use of a named route in ASP.NET MVC when using Form.Begin. I'm learning more and more about routing and getting scared that it can be very fragile if you just change the order or whether or not parameters have defaults. There does not seem to be an overload for a named route for beginning a form so instead the best I could come up with was this : I'm wondering if this missing overload is an oversight (Beta right now), if there is a reason for it or an alternative way to generate the URL. I tried to use RouteLink and embed it in the Form tag, but RouteLink creates me the full HTML for an tag which is no good. action=" " What alternatives do i have to generate a URL from a named route. Should I report this missing overload as an issue?
