Do average coefficients in k fold cross validation resemble coefficients when trained on entire set?

If you perform, say 10 fold cv with logistic regression and then average the coefficient vectors from each turn, does that average roughly equal the coefficient vector you would get by fitting a logistic regression to the whole dataset? Here is an example using a sklearn logistic regression that performs a random search over C on a very small dataset (1000 obs) with 20% positive cases. There are 5 features. Y axis is coefficient value. One set of red lines are the coefficients on the full set, the others are the coefficients over the folds (it should be clear which are medians).
