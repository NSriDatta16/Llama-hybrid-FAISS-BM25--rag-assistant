The system FileCopy does use memory mapped files. If the file is large you can watch the amount of virtual memory decrease on your system as the mapping takes place. There was a 'feature' in Windows Server recently that would use all of the available virtual RAM to build up the mapping. So... I would use FileCopy (or FileCopyEx) and let the OS decide on the best way to move the data (it is likely to know best). If you do it in a separate thread you can even do it without stopping your program - and it will be a very quick copy as most CPUs will spend most of the time buffing their nails waiting for the disk/network. In your example shouldn't you be CreateFileMapping with PAGE_READONLY and MapViewOfFile with FILE_MAP_READ? The pointer returned (FMappingPtr) should point to valid be visible in the debugger - and it should look like you file.
