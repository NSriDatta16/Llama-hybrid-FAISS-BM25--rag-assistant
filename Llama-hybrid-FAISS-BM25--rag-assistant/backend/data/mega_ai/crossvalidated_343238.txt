Aaron, This is not really a problem of statistics. It is a problem of multiple equations with unknowns. Given a set of Min, x, Median, y, Max. Average is the sum of all of the terms divided by the number of terms: Average = (Min + x + Median + y + Max)/5 Standard Deviation = sqrt of (((Min - Average)^2 + (x- Average)^2 + (Median - Average)^2 + (y - Average)^2 + (Max - Average)^2))/5) Two equations and two unknowns solve for x and y.
