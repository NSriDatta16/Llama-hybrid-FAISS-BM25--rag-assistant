If it's text, use the TEXT storage class and affinity; you can just declare the column as TEXT (among others). Note that SQLite's classes and affinities are not length-specific. So even if you said, VARCHAR(255) , it would still just be TEXT . See the Datatypes page. EDIT: The default maximum string length is a billion characters.
