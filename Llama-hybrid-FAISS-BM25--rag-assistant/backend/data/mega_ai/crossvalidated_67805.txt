Poisson probability question

For part a I think its just the poisson probability of 40 with rate = 48. I'm stuck on b to d. Cars pass checkpoint A in accordance with a Poisson process at an average rate of 24 cars per hour. All cars passing checkpoint A also pass checkpoint B which is located 10 miles down the road. The speed (MPH) of any individual car between A & B is constant and uniformly distributed on (40, 60). The speeds of all cars are mutually independent. Find: a) P(40 cars pass A between noon & 2PM) b) P(between 3 & 6PM, 20 cars pass A at a speed exceeding 55 MPH) c) P(10 cars pass B between noon & 1 PM) d) the probability that 5 cars pass B between 1 PM & 1:10PM, given that exactly 10 cars pass A between 12:30PM & 1 PM.
