MVC Areas and routing

I'd like to have an area called "Products", where I can use routes such as http://localhost/products/foo http://localhost/products/bar I would like to have the views and other assets organized into a folder structure like /areas/products/views/foo/index.aspx /areas/products/views/bar/index.aspx I'd like to keep images, etc specifically related to each product (foo, bar) in their respective /area/products/views/(foo|bar)/ folder. I also do not want to have to add a controller action for each product. If I declare a route like context.MapRoute( "products-show-product" , "Products/{id}" , new { controller = "Products", action = "Index", id=UrlParameter.Optional } ); and request the url http://localhost/products/foo then ProductsController.Index() is called, as I would expect. However, since the view "foo" is not in the views/products or views/shared folder, it isn't being found. How can I do this so that I can keep each product's pages in a separate folder?
