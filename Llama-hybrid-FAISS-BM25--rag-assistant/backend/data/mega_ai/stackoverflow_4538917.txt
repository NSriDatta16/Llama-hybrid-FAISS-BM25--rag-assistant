It doesn't do what task says it should. You read doubles instead of integers, and the decimal equivalent is not what you print out. Decimal equivalent for 1/2 is 0.5. And you print 5. Also, you can pay attention to your code style: variable names are usually written in lowerCamelCase, like that : simpleVariable . Update now it prints what you need. However you do it not in the very right way and your indentation can still be improved.
