as the first two steps for testing the stationarity in variable 1 and variable 2 do not reject the stationary null, in other words, those two variables are stationary. with the definition for stationary data, we could interpret variable 1 and variable 2 have constant mean and variance that follows a random walk. also, there is no trend for anyone of them. you could draw an actual time series graph to double-check and ACF graph as well, but they are not formal methods in detecting stationary. since it failed to pass the first step of the Engle-granger cointegration test, we can not interpret any result or draw any conclusion on the cointegrated relationship on those two variables. the only thing you could do is to analyze the data itself with either ARIMA model or GARCH model to find volatility or moving patterns of the variables.
