Interesting. How are you generating your JSON on the server end? Are you using a library function (such as json_encode in PHP), or are you building the JSON string by hand? The only thing that grabs my attention is the escape apostrophe ( \' ). Seeing as you're using double quotes, as you indeed should, there is no need to escape single quotes. I can't check if that is indeed the cause for your jQuery error, as I haven't updated to version 1.4.1 myself yet.
