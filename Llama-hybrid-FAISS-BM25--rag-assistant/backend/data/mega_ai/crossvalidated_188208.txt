What do fsolve in this machine learning task?

I am reading this book Building Machine Learning Systems with Python and can not understand what function "fsolve" do in eample. In example I have test data data and I built the model. My model is 0.08844*x^2 - 97.31*x + 2.853e+04 . I need find what x when f(y) = 100000. I understand that need find and use inverse function . But in book example they subtract 10000 from model and after use fsolve . Why did the do it?
