I see two potential "wrongness" issues (since you didn't really indicate what you thought was wrong with them). If the problem revolves around saving the group in the user registration method, or saving the user in the group methods, then you should separate these into different methods. (i.e. Register() would call RegisterGroup() or GetGroup() If the problem revolves around saving things before the user really is ready to conceptually save things, then keep track of what they wanted to add and wait until the overall "save" method is called before putting any of this information into storage.
