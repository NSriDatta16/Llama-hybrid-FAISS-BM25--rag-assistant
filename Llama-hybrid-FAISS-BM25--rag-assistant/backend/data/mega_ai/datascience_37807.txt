xgboost gain vs kolmogorov smirnov

After running xgboost model with: objective = 'binary:logistic' eval_metric = 'logloss' I have a group of 3 variables that have the highest values of gain. Now, if I replace each one of the 20 more important variables according to this metric by their mean one by one and calculate the kolmogorov smirnov coefficient (KS), I get that the one that reduces the most the ks is not one of those 3, but one that has a relative low gain. Gain Gain Cover v1 21.5% 2.5% v2 12.9% 4.1% v3 11.1% 1.8% v4 3.5% 3.4% v5 2.7% 1.7% v6 2.4% 2.5% v7 2.3% 2.2% v8 2.2% 1.9% v9 1.9% 4.0% v10 1.9% 2.0% v11 1.9% 0.9% v12 1.6% 4.6% ***** ks of replacing each variable by its mean (one by one) v12 39% ***** the rest 45% How is this explained? Thanks.
