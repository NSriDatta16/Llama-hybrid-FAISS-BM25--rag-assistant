As opposed to trees, where the number of feature-based splits are counted for a heuristic feature importance, in ANN there is no clear heuristic way to perform that. Two very popular approached include: CW - Connection weight algorithm Garson's algorithm Both provide a calculated relative score of each feature's importance. There are many resources debating which is better, including more algorithms of the same family.
