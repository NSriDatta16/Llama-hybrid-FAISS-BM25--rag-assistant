Will Microsoft continue supporting C++/CLI?

I've found C++/CLI to be a very powerful language for wrapping C/C++ libraries with .NET. I believe it's much better than using PInvoke for C for various reasons. However, when I've upgraded my project to Visual Studio 2010, I've found that it has less support for C++/CLI. Examples: Targeting the 3.5 framework with the Visual C++ 2010 compiler is not supported. - Won't be fixed. No coverage highlighting. - Should be fixed in next version. No Intellisense - 501921 , 459187 , 455686 . By Design! Useless CA1811 warning. - Won't be fixed. Uselss CA1806 warning. - Postponed. Microsoft claims: I want to make it clear that while we can't address this issue, we reduced support for C++/CLI only due to time and resource constraints. This is NOT an indication that we are distancing ourselves from the technology. But, C++/CLI never had really good support, and if the current version of VS has less support, what does the future holds?
