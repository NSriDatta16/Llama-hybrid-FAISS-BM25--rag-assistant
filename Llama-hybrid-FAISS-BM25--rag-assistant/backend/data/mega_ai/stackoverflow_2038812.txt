Your question isn't really clear as to what you're trying to do. Page events are defined in the System.Web.UI.Page class, some of which are inherited from System.Web.UI.Control . You don't need to use AutoEventWireUp if you don't want to, and you're free to override all of the Page methods that would normally raise the lifecycle events ( OnInit , OnLoad , OnPreRender , etc.) and then not call the base methods, effectively squelching the events from being raised. You can see some limited discussion around this on this blog post . As Hogan noted, this sounds like a bad idea. Could you expand on what you're trying to accomplish?
