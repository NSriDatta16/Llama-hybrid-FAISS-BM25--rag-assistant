How to process categorical features with many values?

I want to apply machine learning and deep learning. I have categorical data on string. My first option was to perform dummy encoding on the columns ( scikitlearn ). But there are some columns that have thousands of categorical values, if i use dummy encoding, this will expand the dataset enormously. What other alternative do I have? If I simply perform a label encoder and then scale everything between 0 and 1 it could work?
