As soon as you distribute your application, it can be disassembled. So a private key that would be distributed with your application could be extracted and reused. There is no completly secured way of doing what you are trying to do. But there are ways to restrict clients, even if they are not foolproof. The easiest (and least secured) would be to restrict access based on the user agent. But any client can fake the user agent. A certificate / crypto solution is more robust, but as said above the certificate can be extracted from your app. OAuth is used by some applications in the same context as yours. But OAuth was not designed for desktop (or mobile) apps and is also vulnerable to reverse engineering of the app. You could authenticate the user (via a user / password, or other standard method). In this case, you dont restrict based on the plateform. Then, you can close the account of users abusing your service. This is a secured solution, but not exactly the answer to your problem.
