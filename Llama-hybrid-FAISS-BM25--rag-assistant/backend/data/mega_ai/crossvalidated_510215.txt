Forecasting the daily visits when I have the data for other stores

I have the number of people visiting stores for each day, but sometimes one or several store do not send data for a particular day. How can I leverage the data I have for the stores that sent me data to predict the data that was not sent? Here is what my data looks like: day store_a store_b store_c 2021-01-01 100 200 300 2021-01-02 110 220 290 2021-01-03 50 110 170 2021-01-04 110 220 290 2021-01-05 7 16 ?? 2021-01-06 90 ?? ?? These stores are affected by the same external factors: weather, strikes, lock-down measures, holidays, etc. I could fit an estimator to predict the data for all stores, and fill the missing data with my prediction, but I think there has to be some powerful method to use the data that was sent on this particular day. My first goal is to fill daily the missing data for the stores that did not send numbers: "As of 2021-02-19, the store B did not send data for yesterday, 2021-02-18. In light of the previous data and the data other stores sent for this day, I think store B welcomed [XX] customers." Another goal would be to polish the data that I predicted in the past, doing something like "in the light of the data sent in January 2021, I think the store A welcomed [XX] customers on the 2021-01-15"
