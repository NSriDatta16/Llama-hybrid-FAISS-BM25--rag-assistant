My reasons: I've worked for just over a year to climb the ranks of the Cocoa tag as I have time. Many of my comments are along the lines of community etiquette and encouraging questioners to accept answers. Many of my edits are to make sure questions are properly tagged and questions can be understood (in the case of users with poor English-as-a-second-language skills). When I post answers, they usually come with documentation links. When I post wrong or not-entirely-correct answers, I take community feedback into account and adjust (or withdraw) my answers. I enjoy keeping the community a clean and useful resource so it doesn't degenerate like so many before it. I try to discourage outright disrespectful tones from poster to poster and happily remove my own chiding/prodding if and when the disrespectful tone is corrected. In short, I try to fight the good fight without being overbearing. Sometimes I succeed and sometimes I don't. I'd be honored to help the community even more.
