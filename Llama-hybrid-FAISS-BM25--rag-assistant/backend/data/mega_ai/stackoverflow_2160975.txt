How do I patch the Mobile Device Browser File

Nexus One is not currently supported by the Mobile Device Browser File , which leads to the Nexus One being identified as a non mobile device. I know the user agent, and the capabilities are pretty similar to other Android terminals. With this information, how do I patch the MDBF to have the N1 be recognized as a mobile device?
