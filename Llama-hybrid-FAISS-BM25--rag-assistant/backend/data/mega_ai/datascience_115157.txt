Great question, and I'm also very curious, all I can point towards is this mini Weights and Biases report which shows Adam and AdamW outperforming SGD. https://wandb.ai/ap-wt/great-barrier-reef/reports/FasterRCNNs-with-different-optimizers--VmlldzoxNDY0MjI0 I'm under the impression people tend to consider Adam safer / more robust. While proper optimisation of SGD can often squeeze out slightly higher performance. Not sure how much of that applies specifically to FasterRCNN though.
