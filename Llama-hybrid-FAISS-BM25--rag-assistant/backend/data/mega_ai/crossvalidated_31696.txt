Extending on @whuber's comments, I would code this as an extended missing value : recode ... (12 = .d "Don't know") (13 = .r "Refused") /// (1 = .n "Not applicable") (2 = .s "Skipped") ... or something like that. These extended labeled missing values would show up properly in tabulate ..., missing , but would be appropriately excluded from say ordinal logistic regression with father's education as a dependent variable. As far as including these categories in the regression as an explanatory variable, I would probably try to come up with some three-four categories, like "Less than high school", "High school or equivalent", "Some college", "College", "Graduate/professional", may be combining some of these so that you have reasonable 10+% of the data in each category. The missing data, which is probably a small percentage, may go into a separate "Other" category, or, realistically speaking, combined with "Less than high school", because that's what this is likely going to be (at least if you are talking about the US, which you seem to do).
