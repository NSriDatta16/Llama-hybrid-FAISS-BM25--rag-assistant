NLP transformers and classification interpretation

I have an NLP transformer output and build logistic regression on top of it to classify negatives and positives. How can I see how the prediction was made on a large set of data? What if I use a neural network instead of a logistic regression? Iâ€™m curious which words/sequences of words affect the prediction the most.
