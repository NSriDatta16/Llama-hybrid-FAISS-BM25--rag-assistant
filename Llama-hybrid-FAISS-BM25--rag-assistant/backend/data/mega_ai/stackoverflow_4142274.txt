動靜能量's answer is pretty good so I'll just add that if you want to learn some rails check out this free online tutorial that takes you step by step through building a Twitter clone: http://railstutorial.org/book Several books I've read say to learn Rails first (including the above link) but I think this is a horrible idea and really, really bad advice.

It will be MUCH less frustrating and magical seeming. Here are some of my favorite books on Ruby: Programming Ruby 1.9 Metaprogramming Ruby Refactoring: Ruby Edition I love Pragmatic because the authors get a lot more money for their efforts and everyone involved seems to really care about the quality of their products.
