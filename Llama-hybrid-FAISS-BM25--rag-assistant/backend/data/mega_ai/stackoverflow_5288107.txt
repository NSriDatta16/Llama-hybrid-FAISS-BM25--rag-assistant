If these links are to your own pages you can create a robots.txt and put it in your root directory. This is what I use for my personal site: User-agent: * Disallow: /blog Disallow: /dev Disallow: /apps The first line,User-agent designates what kind of search engines/agents are you targeting(in my case ALL search engines). The rest are Disallow rules on which directories/files I tell them NOT to index. More info on robotstxt.org , or Google robots.txt.
