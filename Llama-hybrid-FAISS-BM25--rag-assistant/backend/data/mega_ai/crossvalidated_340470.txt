You have a situation of (quasi-)complete separation, which a problem for logistic regression (it corresponds to infite log-odds for some treatment groups). Standard solutions for this issue include: using exact logistic regression (more or less an extension Fisher's exact test), using Bayesian logistic regression with some appropriate vague, weakly-informative or informative prior, or using Firth's penalized likelihood method (in fact this is Bayesian maximum a-posteriori estimation Jeffreys's prior). The last two methods assume that nothing truly results in an event exactly 0 or 100% of the time, while the first allows confidence intervals for the odds ratio to include 0 or $\infty$.
