How to remove duplicate content from pom.xml for Maven?

I ran into such a situation, when packaging a project using maven, I'd like both the source package and the binary package, and they have the same manifest.mf file. Then I have to write the same entry in both plugin configuration of maven-source-plugin and maven-jar-plugin, like this: maven-source-plugin attach-sources jar ${project.name} ${project.version} ${project.organization.name} Shiva Wu maven-jar-plugin false ${project.name} ${project.version} ${project.organization.name} Shiva Wu It's really not convenient to modify both of them while changing settings. Is there a better way to resolve this? Thanks:)
