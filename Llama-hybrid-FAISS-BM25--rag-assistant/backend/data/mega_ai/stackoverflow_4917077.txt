Assuming the snap monad is from http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/snap-core/0.4.0/doc/html/Snap-Types.html ... Snap is a monad (not a monad transformer), so you cannot run it inside an arbitrary monad. You could use the ReaderT transformer to embed Reader functionality inside Snap, if that's what you want. The type of runSnap is runSnap :: Snap a -> (ByteString -> IO ()) -> (Int -> IO ()) -> Request -> Iteratee ByteString IO (Request, Response) which tells us that it runs in an Iteratee ByteString IO monad. A Reader monad does not let you do IO or iterate over an input stream, so you cannot run a Snap computation in a Reader monad. If you explain what you want to accomplish, someone may be able to suggest a way to achieve it.
