I met the same problem when installing devise in windows. maybe you could checkout this: http://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit and giorgian is correct, pay attention here: ruby version: you must install the "ruby installer" version, but not .zip version or other version. unpack it in the Ruby directory (for instance, C:\Ruby, so that you'll have C:\Ruby\devkit; If you installed ruby from other setup file (which is not ruby-installer), you MUST remove it ,then install ruby with the ruby installer. don't simply overwrite it. no need to install VC6, it won't work with other ruby setup version(which is not ruby- installer) . if you installed it just for setup the ruby-gem, I suggest you remove it. no need to install MinGW , cause dev-kit is based on it. I spent almost 15 hours to solve this problem. and it's now time to say that "ruby-installer" + "dev kit" is our choise to build the native gem.
