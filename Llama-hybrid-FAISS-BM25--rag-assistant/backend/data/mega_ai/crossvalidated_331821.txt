Method for early stopping in a neural network

What is people's method of early stopping? I run my validation data against the trained network and if the error is > the previous low error then I increment a counter. If the error I also continue training if the validation error is better than the training error. Here's my code: NetworkTestResult oResult = testANetwork(voNetwork, oTestData, oTestResults); System.out.println("Validation Error: " + oResult.getError()); // is the validation error greater than our lowest result? if (oResult.getError() > nLowValidationError) { nIncreaseErrorCount++; } else { nIncreaseErrorCount = 0; // reset nLowValidationError = oResult.getError(); } // if validation error is better than training error then carry on training if (oResult.getError() Is this a good method?
