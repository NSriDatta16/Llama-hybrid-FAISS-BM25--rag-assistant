I'm not sure there's a single, correct answer to this. Tags are a paradigm that imply overlap , while categories imply no overlap . Categories (either as a flat list or hierarchy) have historically been most useful for organizing dozens or hundreds of entities. Tags have historically handled hundreds of thousands of entities better. Neither is more correct as a general rule.
