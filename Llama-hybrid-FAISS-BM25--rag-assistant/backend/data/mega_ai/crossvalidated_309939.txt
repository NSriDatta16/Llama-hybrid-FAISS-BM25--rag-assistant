Can I standardize a response variable by group to simplify a mixed model?

Let's say I have measures of a response and covariate from each of several populations. Each population has its own mean for $y_i$ and slope for the $y_i \sim x_i $ relationship. The model looks like this: $$y_{i,j} = \alpha_j + \beta_j \times x_{i,j} + \epsilon_{i,j}$$ $$ \alpha_j\sim N(\mu_\alpha,\sigma^2_\alpha) $$ $$ \beta_j\sim N(\mu_\beta,\sigma^2_\beta) $$ $$ \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2) $$ Now imagine I am simply interested in estimating the average effect of the covariate, $\mu_\beta$, its SE, and its among-population variance, $\sigma^2_\beta$. I am uninterested in the differing means of $ y $ among populations (imagine, for example, they are artifacts of study design). I could center the response by population such that within-population mean=0, and thereby eliminate the need to model this as a random intercept (?). If I'm only interested in the effect of the covariate, is there negative consequences to standardizing the response by population? A simple simulation in R seems to indicate No (see below). Are there other reasons I've not thought of why group-centering could be problematic in more complicated situations? Would this also extend to differing variances by group? i.e., I could standardize the response by group to mean=0, SD=1, and thereby not need to model the differing variances (this could be helpful for users of lme4 package which doesn't currently allow variance-by-group.) Here is R code to simulate the centering problem: require(ggplot2) require(lme4) require(dplyr) require(broom) #set up experimental design n.groups % group_by(pop) %>% mutate(centered_y= scale(y, scale=FALSE)[,1]) %>% ungroup() fit2
