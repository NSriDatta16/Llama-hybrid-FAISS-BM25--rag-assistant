How to select perticular part of image and zoom that part using jquery?

I have two images layered on each other using z-index. I just want to zoom a particular part of those images but this zoom is such that I will select a area using mouse i.e. clicking on a part of image and dragging mouse and releasing the mouse button and that much part will get zoom. So please tell me is such thing is possible in jquery? if yes how could i do that? Please guide me friends! Thank you!
