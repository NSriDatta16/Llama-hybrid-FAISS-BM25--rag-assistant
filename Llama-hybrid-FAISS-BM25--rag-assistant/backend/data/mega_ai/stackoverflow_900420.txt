Elegant way to compare sequences

Does python provide an elegant way to check for "equality" of sequences of different types? The following work, but they seem rather ugly and verbose for python code: def comp1(a, b): if len(a) != len(b): return False for i, v in enumerate(a): if v != b[i]: return False return True The following is a bit shorter, but also less efficient since a third sequence is created: def comp2(a, b): for l, r in map(None, a, b): if l != r: return False return True Shoehorning one of those examples into a list comprehension isn't really what I'm looking for either. Edit: Ideally I am looking for a solution that doesn't create another sequence during the comparison.
