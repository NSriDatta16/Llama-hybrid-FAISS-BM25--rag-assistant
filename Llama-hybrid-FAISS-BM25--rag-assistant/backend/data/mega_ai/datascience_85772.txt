Using BERT for the first time, what are the two columns of my test_results.tsv?

I followed the steps to feed in both dev, test, train.tsv to the model, trained it, then tried to classify test data, and I only have 1 feature, and the classification is binary, 1 or 0. I assumed my test_results.tsv would have just 1 column, representing the estimated classification. Any advice? Here is a picture of my output. I thought it would be a column of 1's and 0's showing me its estimated classification.
