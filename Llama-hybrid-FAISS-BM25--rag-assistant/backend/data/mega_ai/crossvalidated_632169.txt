Is G*Power reliable for logistic regression? It does not seem to account for Hauck-Donner

I've just been introduced to G*Power . The only option I could find for analysing logistic regression is described as: Options: Large sample z-Test, Demidenko (2007) with var corr That seems to refer to this paper , which uses the Wald chi-squared test. It does not discuss the Hauck-Donner effect. Is G*Power a reliable way to calculate power for logistic regression? (The paper has 500 citations, so I feel I must be missing something...)
