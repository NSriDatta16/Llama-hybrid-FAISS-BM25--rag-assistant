Drupal - Individual menus for each type of Organic Group content type

On my site I have set two Content Types as Organic Group nodes. Sports Group Education Group There are also various other content types on the site, set to be standard group posts.To allows users to post content into groups, which then references that group. I have then enabled the Group Details block to show on each group, which then shows create content links to each content types that = standard group post. What I would like to do, whether its done with that block or I create my own is to limit certain content type creation links to certain groups. i.o.w I don't want to allow certain content types to be created in the Sports Group. I think this can be done with a custom menu or block, but unsure of the PHP required.
