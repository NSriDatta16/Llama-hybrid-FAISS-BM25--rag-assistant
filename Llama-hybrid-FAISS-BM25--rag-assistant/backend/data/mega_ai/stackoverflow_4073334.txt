Updating UI With An Internet Access Every Time The Screen is Refreshed

I need to do an internet access to update a field on my UI. I do the internet access in a background thread by extending AsyncTask. Since I need to update my UI every time the screen is refreshed I am executing the AsyncTask in my onResume method: @Override protected void onResume(){ super.onResume(); showDialog(REFRESH_DIALOG); new UpdateAgentStatusTask().execute(); } I dismiss the REFRESH_DIALOG dialog in the onPostExecute() method in the AsyncTask. For testing I rotate the screen to landscape. Things work well. The problem is when I try to rotate again to portrait. I get 'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: no dialog with id 1 was ever shown ...'. id 1 is for the REFRESH_DIALOG. How do I get rid of this error? Is there a better way to do an internet access to update my UI every time the screen is refreshed? Thanks, Prasanna
