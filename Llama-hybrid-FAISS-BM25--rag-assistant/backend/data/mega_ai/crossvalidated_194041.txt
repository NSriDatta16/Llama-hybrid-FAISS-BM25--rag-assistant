You and I are both scientists, and as scientists, are chiefly interested in questions of evidence. For that reason, I think Bayesian approaches, when feasible, are preferable. Bayesian approaches answer our question: What is the strength of evidence for one hypothesis over another? Frequentist approaches, on the other hand, do not: They report only whether the data are weird given one hypothesis. That said, Andrew Gelman, notable Bayesian, seems to espouse the use of p-values (or p-value-like graphical checks) as a check for errors in model specification. You can see an allusion to this approach in this blog post . His approach, as I understand it, is something like a two-step process: First, he asks the Bayesian question of what is the evidence for one model over the other. Second, he asks the Frequentist question of whether the preferred model actually looks at all plausible given the data. It seems like a reasonable hybrid approach to me.
