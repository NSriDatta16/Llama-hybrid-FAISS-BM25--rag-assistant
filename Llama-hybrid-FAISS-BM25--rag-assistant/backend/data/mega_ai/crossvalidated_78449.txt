Multiple measures mediation analysis

I want to know how to do a mediation analysis with repeated measures. Here is a fake experiment that has the same form as the one I plan to do (using a fake one lets me simplify some weird complications I already know how to deal with): For each of 5 targets, 100 participants answer 3 questions: How warm do you find this person? How trustworthy do you find this person? How likely would you be to follow this person's advice. If there were only 1 target, I would know how to do a mediation analysis to (e.g.,) see whether the relationship between (1) and (3) was mediated by (2). However, I don't know how to do it with 5 targets. Clearly, I should not just average together the scores across all 5 scenarios. And I should not treat each case as different (as though I had 500 participants). Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated!
