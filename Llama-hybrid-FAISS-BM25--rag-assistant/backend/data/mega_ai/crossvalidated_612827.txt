$R$ is the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of the slope of the regression of the $y_i$ on the $x_i.$ Because the regression line must go through the point of averages $(\bar x, \bar y),$ adjoining any number of instances of that point to the dataset will not change the sum of squares and therefore will not change the OLS solution, whence $R$ will be unchanged.
