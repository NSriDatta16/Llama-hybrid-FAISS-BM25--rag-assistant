Scale before PCA

I'm using PCA from sckit-learn and I'm getting some results which I'm trying to interpret, so I ran into question - should I subtract the mean (or perform standardization) before using PCA, or is this somehow embedded into sklearn implementation? Moreover, which of the two should I perform, if so, and why is this step needed? Edit: I've read that I should perform scaling if features have different scale. But one things still puts me in doubt - why scale when PCA considers the directions of greatest variance? Aren't I going to break this when standardizing the data before PCA?
