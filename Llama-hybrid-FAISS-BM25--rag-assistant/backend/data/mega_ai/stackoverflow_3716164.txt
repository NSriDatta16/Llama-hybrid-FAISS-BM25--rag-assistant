Issue status (specified, coded, tested, ...) and percentage

After struggling a bit to install it on a shared hosting, I finally discovered the power of Redmine. I must say I'm pretty impressed. However I'm a beginner, and stumbling into the manual and the forums didn't help much for what I'm trying to do, so I ask here. Please forgive me if it's already addressed somewhere. We are doing a software development project, and we are trying to get organized. At the moment, we entered all the developement tasks as features into Redmine. However we would like to enforce that, for a task to be completed, it must have been - specified - coded - tested - some other project specific stuff not relevant here I can't use issue statuses, because that would impose a particular order (like testing after coding, BUT sometimes, we want to be able to write the test before the code, and sometimes not) I don't really know how to achieve that :-( What I tried so far is : for every task, create a subtask, for coding, testing, and so on ... It works well but it's very tedious, and it makes the number of issues a bit overwhelming use custom boolean fields. It's ok but : -I can't make a search filter like "find the tasks which are NOT -I can't setup the completion percentage to depend on the subtasks (e.g : prevent someone from marking a task as 100% completed if it hasn't been tested) I'd like to get some insights from experienced Redmine users, about how to achieve this. I must admit I'm a beginner in both Redmine and project management, so I'm really trying hard to find the best way to deal with that. Any help appreciated Best regards
