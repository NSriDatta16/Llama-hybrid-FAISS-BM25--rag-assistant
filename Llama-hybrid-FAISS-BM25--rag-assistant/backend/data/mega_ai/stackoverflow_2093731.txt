Well, I didn't really get any good answers. In this particular instance that I had the problem, the problem was having an incorrect version of my dependencies configured. That is one of the negatives with having my projects split up as much as they are. I have to pay close attention to which version I'm using in each project. In other cases, it seemed to me that I had issues with a Lucene configuration. In either case, I would prefer to see the stack trace so I can look at it and then, oops, I have a bad jar or something like that. Walter
