Fragment loading spinner/dialog in Honeycomb

When loading data into my Fragments I would would like to have an indeterminate spinner in the middle of the fragment (example in pic below) to show the user that content is loading within that particular pane. What's the best way to do this in Honeycomb? I don't really want to use a spinner in the action bar, it's not immediately obvious where data is loading. Also, I don't want an indeterminate progress dialog because it appears in the center of the entire app and also stops the user from doing anything else until it is dismissed. N.B. FragmentDialogs seem to do this also. Am I going to have to hack around with a custom FrameLayout to get the desired effect for each pane?
