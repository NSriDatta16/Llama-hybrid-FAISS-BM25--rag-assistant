Speed as in bandwidth? Or as in latency? For the latter, just use Net::Ping . For bandwidth, I don't know if there's anything ready made, there's 2 approaches: You can try to leverage ibmonitor Otherwise, to measure download bandwidth find a web site that lets you measure bandwidth by downloading a large file (or find such a large file on high-performance site); start the timer, start downloading that file (e.g. using LWP or any other module you wish - or Net::FTP if your file is on FTP site) - measure how long it takes and divide by the file size. Similar logic for measuring upload bandwidth, but instead of finding large file, you need to find a place on the internet (like a public repository) that'd allow uploading one.
