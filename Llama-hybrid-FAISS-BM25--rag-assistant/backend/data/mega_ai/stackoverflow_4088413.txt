C# chunked array

I need to allocate very large arrays of simple structs (1 GB RAM). After a few allocations/deallocations the memory becomes fragmented and an OutOfMemory exception is thrown. This is under 32 bit. I'd rather not use 64 bit due to the performance penalty I get - the same application runs 30% slower in 64 bit mode. Are you aware of some implementations of IList compatible arrays which allocate memory in chunks and not all at once? That would avoid my memory fragmentation problem.
