Looking for a way to simulate irregularly shaped DIVs

I'm developing a website for a designer who is, shall we say, more oriented towards print designs than for the web. Their page design for this site gives me a content area that is irregular. If this were a hand-coded site I could do the layout (painstakingly) by slicing images and judicious use of floats, absolute positioning, and z-indexes - but the site is being done in Drupal and my content area is what it is (I suppose I could do some serious hacking in node.tpl.php, but even that would be problematic). Here's what I mean - both header and footer have bits that stick out of them which extend into the content area: +--------------------------------------------------+ | | | LOGO/HEADER AREA | | | | +------------------------------------------+ | | HEAD ONE FOR PAGE | | | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur | | | adipiscing elit. Praesent in lectus in | +-------+ lectus tempor volutpat vitae velnunc. | | Duis diam sem, mattis in eleifend nec,vulputate | | ac dolor.Aliquam eleifend, mi non adipiscing | | condimentum, erat nunc consectetur lorem, at | | aliquet arcu purus non sapien. Sed in neque eu | | velit venenatis tincidunt vel in est. | | | | Cras fermentum magna non erat pretium suscipit. | | Proin id leo neque. Aliquam vel metus eget | | libero venenatis consectetur. Aliquam +-----+ | lobortis lacinia eros vel vulputate.Mauris | | | lorem diam, bibendum et fringilla nec ... | | +--------------------------------------------+ | | | | LOGO/FOOTER AREA | +--------------------------------------------------+ Right now my barely workable solution is to put the content-area content into tables, with judicious use of row- and col- spans to avoid the sticking-out areas. Besides being a pain, it defeats the purpose of using a CMS - the HTML in each page has to be fiddled with by hand to make the table-cells work properly within the page constraints. So - I guess my question is this: Is there a pure CSS (or even a CSS/Javascript) way to do this without resorting to fragile, error-prone table-coding in every page? (N.B. I've already told the designer that this is a problem, but the client had already approved the design so, for this project at least, I'm stuck with it)
