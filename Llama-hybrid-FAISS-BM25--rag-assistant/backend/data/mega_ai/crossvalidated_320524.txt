Forecasting many stores sales with optimal reconciliation and regression

I am forecasting many stores sales via the optimal reconciliation approach . The problem is that forecasts are not as accurate as I would like. Edit: Part of the problem is that a small subset of my stores have closed. I would like to constrain their forecasts to be 0. How would I do that with Robert Hyndman's package hts . Solved by removing closed stores. Also, we are aware of other factors, such as holidays and media, that have an impact on sales. Is there a way to do optimal reconciliation then dynamic regression ? It would be nice to not only include a hierarchical forecast of past sales, but also one that includes marketing effects.
