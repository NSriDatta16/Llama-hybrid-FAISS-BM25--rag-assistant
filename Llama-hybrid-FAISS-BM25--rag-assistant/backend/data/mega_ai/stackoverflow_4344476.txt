Determinants of huge matrices in MATLAB

from a simulation problem, I want to calculate complex square matrices on the order of 1000x1000 in MATLAB. Since the values refer to those of Bessel functions, the matrices are not at all sparse. Since I am interested in the change of the determinant with respect to some parameter (the energy of a searched eigenfunction in my case), I overcome the problem at the moment by first searching a rescaling factor for the studied range and then calculate the determinants, result(k) = det(pre_factor*Matrix{k}); Now this is a very awkward solution and only works for matrix dimensions of, say, maximum 500x500. Does anybody know a nice solution to the problem? Interfacing to Mathematica might work in principle but I have my doubts concerning feasibility. Thank you in advance Robert Edit: I did not find a convient solution to the calculation problem since this would require changing to a higher precision. Instead, I used that ln det M = trace ln M which is, when I derive it with respect to k A = trace(inv(M(k))*dM/dk) So I at least had the change of the logarithm of the determinant with respect to k. From the physical background of the problem I could derive constraints on A which in the end gave me a workaround valid for my problem. Unfortunately I do not know if such a workaround could be generalized.
