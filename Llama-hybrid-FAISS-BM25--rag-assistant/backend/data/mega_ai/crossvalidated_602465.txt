Bayesian optimization on a polynomial regression as the surrogate model

My understanding of Bayesian optimization is that it is generally used in conjunction with Gaussian process (GP) as the surrogate model. Because GP inherently produces an uncertainty of estimate, the acquisition function of expected improvement (EI) can take that into account the uncertainity and strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. If we were to use a (2nd order) polynomial regression model as the surrogate, as what is normally used in response surface methodology (RSM), is it possible to still use expected improvement as the acquisition function? If so, what is the method to obtain an uncertainty of estimate at any point from a 2nd order polynomial model in order to calculate the EI?
