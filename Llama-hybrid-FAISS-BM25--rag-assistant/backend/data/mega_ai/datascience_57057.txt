I think you’re confused about what a “batch” is. A batch has a very specific definition in machine learning. In my experience: Dimension 1 = number of bins or number of data points per each time step Dimension 2 = window size, the number of time steps Dimension 3 = batch size, the total number of examples which you’ll feed the network per training batch Looks like this for [4,3,2] : [[[0,1,4,3],[0,8,6,9],[9,6,7,4]],[[6,8,7,0],[1,7,7,9],[1,3,5,8]]] 4 values per time step, 3 total time steps per example, 2 examples in the batch. Where [0,0,0] returns 0 , [3,1,1] returns 9 . Also, one friendly piece of advice - don’t think in terms of time stamps. You’re not dealing with time in an RNN. You’re dealing with steps in a sequence . The sequence can be related to time. Edit: With respect to the tensorflow stuff, a tf.dataset object can contain both the input data and the labels for each example. The point is to make writing code easier, managing data easier etc. The process for training/testing is the same.
