the odd thing is that if I touch the window handle on the jframe (so even a 1px resize) - this seems to force a complete refresh and the component then displays properly, When a frame is resized the components are revalidated and repainted. So somewhere in your code (where ever the table and gannt view are updated) you need to add: customComponent.revalidate(); customComponent.repaint();
