For images I would recommend IMCE - it integrated awesomely with Ckeditor and also the WYSIWYG API module. With IMCE you can assign each user their own private folder, and allocate quota etc. There is also a handy resize feature that lets users create thumbnails for embedding in content. For video, I would recommend either: Using the media embed dialog in Ckeditor (which allows YouTube, vimeo etc code to be pasted into the body) Using the video module - and allowing certain users to create 'video nodes'
