You always need to flatten your pictures when connecting the input to a Dense layer in Keras (Note that this is not the case for CNNs or RNNs). The reason is when the dense layer is built, based on the Dense layer code, the input dim is the last element you pass in the inputs ( input_dim = input_shape[-1] ). Therefore, although you are passing an input of (28,28) keras thinks that the shape is only 28. This also explains why the input of (,784) indeed works. You can check the Dense layer code here
