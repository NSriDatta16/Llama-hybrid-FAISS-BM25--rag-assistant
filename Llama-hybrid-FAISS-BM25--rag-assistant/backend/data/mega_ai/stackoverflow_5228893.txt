Hints: There are three symbols. In decimal (base-10), there are 10 digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. In binary (base-2) there are two digits, 0 and 1. In base-16 there are 16 digits. Since there are three symbols in the alien system, could we make a guess about its organization? 5base10 = 12base3. 9base10 = 100base3. So (9,5) in decimal is the same as (100, 12) in trinary. Can we make a guess about which alien symbols represent which human digits?
