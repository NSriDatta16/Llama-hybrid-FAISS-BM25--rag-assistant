If you're determining paragraphs by a double-newline ("\n\n") then this will do it: open READFILE, " } # slurp-split my $num_paragraphs = scalar @paragraphs; __END__ Otherwise, just change the "\n\n" in the code to use your own paragraph separator. It may even be a good idea to use the pattern \n{2,} , just in case someone went crazy on the enter key. If you are worried about memory consumption, then you may want to do something like this (sorry for the hard-to-read code): my $num_paragraphs; {local $/; $num_paragraphs = @{[ =~ /\n\n/g ]} + 1} Although, if you want to keep using your own code, you can change if($C ne"\n") to if($c eq "\n") .
