If you are interested in relations between three variables, why are you using two pairwise models? Instead, just build a model that estimates the three means for each of the conditions, and compare them. Technically: build a model that estimates the means, take MCMC samples from the models, and calculate the ratios of interest and their distributions from the samples. Thatâ€™s all you need in here.
