as far as i know the ribboncommand in the ribboncontrolslibrary isn't yet in its final version. and I supopse having read, its still going to see some changes before getting production ready. So I wouldnt encourage other peers to use it yet, as it was said to be published for year(s) now! I currently use it in a pre realase app for a customer, but as there are still no news around microsofts "official" wpf ribbon, i will have to switch to the fluent ribbon sooner or later..
