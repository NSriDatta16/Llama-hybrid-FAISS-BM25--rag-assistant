Drag N drop images in a viewbox

I have a usercontrol with 6 viewbox, each can have an image. I have not set the width or height of the usercontrol(not even the viewboxes). At first the viewboxes are empty.I can add the images dynamically. screen 1 screen 2 I want to drag and drop the images from one viewbox to any other empty viewbox. But when the viewbox is empty, it is not visible at all. because it does not have a height or width. So i am not able to drop the image on it. So what will i have to to such that when any one view box has an image all the view box have the same height and width? any other solution is welcome.
