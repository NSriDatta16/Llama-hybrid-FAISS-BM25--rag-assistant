A tree is a data structure where each node has a number of child nodes. By starting at the first node (called the root), one can use a decision algorithm to determine which of the children of the current node is the most appropriate for the next processing or traversal step. Operations on trees include insert , delete , traverse and find . The algorithms for these methods are usually recursive, starting from the root node and recursively calling its left and right child. Below is an example of binary-tree, in which each node has up to two child nodes: Because large portions of the remaining nodes are culled away with each decision, properly balanced trees typical yield logarithmic time lookups, inserts, and deletes when used for storage.
