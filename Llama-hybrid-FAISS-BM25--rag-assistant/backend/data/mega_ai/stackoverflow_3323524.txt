What is the best method to store this small read-only data table in an android phone?

I need to store data to use in my android program. Here are the details about the data: There will be one table. Each "row" of data will have a unique INT identifier. Other then that field, there will be four other INT fields and a text field. The string field will probably be a 2 or 3 sentences long. Each of the 4 INT fields will correspond to the ID of other rows. There will be 100 rows, maybe 200. But all the rows will be read-only, and pre-populated. The data will be read frequently, and non-sequentially. The first answer for storing data is SQLite a lot of times, but given the particulars of the data, another storage method might be more efficient. I'm open to any suggestions, and code examples are always welcome!
