Is Nvidia Jetson product family also suitable for machine learing model training?

I recently came accross these products (Nvidia Jetson) and they are all tagged as "edge", so i think they are designed only for machine learning inference and not model training. They are quite interesting for their low power consumpion and price (eg: Jetson Nano) so i hope they are suitable also for model trainig. So i would ask if someone may clarify this aspect about the focus of the product.
