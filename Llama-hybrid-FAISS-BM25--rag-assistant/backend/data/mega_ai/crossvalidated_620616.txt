Few things in forecasting are guaranteed ... I usually find that reconciliation does improve accuracy, and at least the abstract of this paper says that the point forecast does become more accurate, and what suffers is the error distribution. (I know the authors, they know what they are doing when it comes to forecasting. Not everyone does in this subfield.) As you say, reconciliation adds complexity, and it's always a question whether added accuracy (if any) is worth the increase in accuracy. (And whether any increase in accuracy actually turns into a business benefit.) I would always first try to understand potential drivers and predictors, which is usually a better lever than hierarchical reconciliation. See How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? and Industry vs Kaggle challenges. Is collecting more observations and having access to more variables more important than fancy modelling? .
