Apparently I was looking for a variant of a SGLD or some other MCMC algorithm that takes gradients into consideration to approximate expectation of a function $f(x)$ when $x \sim P(x)$ . I am still not sure how to perform integration when $f(x)$ is complicated, but $P(x)$ is not, I will update the answer when I figure this out.
