I recall at University being ask by a few final year social science students on different occasions (one of them got a 1st) how to work out an average for their project that had had a handful of data points. (So they were not having problem with using software, just with the concept of how to do the maths with a calculator.) They just give me blank looks when I ask them what type of average they wanted. Yet they all felt a need to put some stats in their report, as it was the done thing â€“ I expect they have all read 101 papers that had stats without thinking about what the stats meant if anything. It is clear that the researcher that taught them over the 3 years did not care about the correctness of stats enough to distil any understanding into the students. (I was a computer Sci student at the time. I am posting this as an answer as it is a bit long for a comment.)
