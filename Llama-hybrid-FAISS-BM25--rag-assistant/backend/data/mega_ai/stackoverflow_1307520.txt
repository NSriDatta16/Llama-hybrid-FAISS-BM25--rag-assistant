If you're deploying to a production environement in your own organization, then it's not a security problem. If you're selling your software to other entities, then .pdb file can give someone interested in reverse engineering a leg up - that may or may not be a problem for you. However (to be clear), you don't want your stack traces being displayed to the client - whether or not the .pdbs are available. But if you're just logging the traces and presenting a 'pretty' error page to the client, it's not an issue.
