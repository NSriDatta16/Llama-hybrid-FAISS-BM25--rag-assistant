What does the "dual" parameter in sklearn.svm.LinearSVC and sklearn.svm.LinearSVR do?

While I am more or less familiar with the idea of the SVM, I do not understand the meaning of the dual parameter, which is described in the documentation as: dual : bool, (default=True) Select the algorithm to either solve the dual or primal optimization problem. Prefer dual=False when n_samples > n_features. Can someone explain it, preferably in ELI5 style?
