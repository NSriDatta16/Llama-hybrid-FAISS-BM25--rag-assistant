The brackets means its a list of items. You can iterate: {% for o in order %} {{ o }} {% endfor %} Or use the join filter: {{ order|join:", " }} http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/?from=olddocs#join As for what you want to display, I can't tell without knowing what you want! What do you want it to display instead of StorageItem? What's shown when you simply call {{ o }} in a template is defined in your model __unicode__ method. http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/instances/#unicode If it's specific field, you could just type {{ o.myfield }}
