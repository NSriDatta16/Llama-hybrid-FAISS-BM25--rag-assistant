How to stationarize profit and loss data with an increasing variance and large negative values for time series analysis?

PnL can take large negative values, and its variance increases over time as the firm grows. If we do differencing, an increasing variance remains. If we take log, negative values cannot be defined. How do you stationarize this type of data for time series analysis? Please assume that we cannot decompose PnL into underlying factors such as profits and losses, which can be experessed as positive and modeled separately.
