Error Reading Serialized Object? WP7

I am reading an object from Isolated Storage with the following code: public static T Load (string name) where T : class, new() { T loadedObject = null; using (IsolatedStorageFile storageFile = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) using (IsolatedStorageFileStream storageFileStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(name, System.IO.FileMode.OpenOrCreate, storageFile)) { if (storageFileStream.Length > 0) { DataContractSerializer serializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(T)); loadedObject = serializer.ReadObject(storageFileStream) as T; //####Error Here#### } if (loadedObject == null) { loadedObject = new T(); } } Upon reading my object I am getting a SecurityException which reads "The type 'Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.Song' cannot be deserialized in partial trust because it does not have a public parameterless constructor." My object class being read contains a Song property which is throwing the above error. Is there some way around this? I would like for my Song property to be stored with my object. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
