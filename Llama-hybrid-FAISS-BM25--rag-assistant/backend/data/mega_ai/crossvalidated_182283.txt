One possibility is to collapse the four rare classes down into one, or set up a model to predict those separately. That may change your problem entirely, however, and not be appealing to you. Gary King of Harvard University published an excellent paper ( http://gking.harvard.edu/files/0s.pdf ) on logistic regression for rare events. In this case you oversample the rare events (or collect all rare events) but only a small sample of the more common events. I think this would be a good place to start, but you may ultimately be able to branch out to corrections for multinomial logistic regression. I don't know of resources for rare event multinomial logistic regression, but this may get you started.
