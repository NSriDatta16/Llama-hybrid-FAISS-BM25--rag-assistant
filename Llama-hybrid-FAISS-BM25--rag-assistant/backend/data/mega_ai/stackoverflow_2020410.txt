Looks like the RichTextArea does not support this as yet in the Silverlight 4 beta, although it is possible to populate a RichTextArea with Paragraph elements with a particular TextAlignment in code and XAML you cannot do it on a Selection as this does not expose the "Block" or "Paragraph" element selected just the "Run".
