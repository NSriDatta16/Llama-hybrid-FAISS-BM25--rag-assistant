Below is what i did : I declared in .h file UILabel *sample; and in .m @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *sample; @synthesize sample; sample.font = [UIFont systemFontOfSize:10.0]; In Interface Builder I have connected sample to Sample by dragging from File Owner. Now when I run the code I see no variation to the font size of "Sample"
