Percentage Change values for Prices in a given basked: Gemoetric mean vs arithmetic mean to get "mean" Prices

Lets say i have a Timeseries of data for different goods in a basked. Af first, i do not want to calculate an index value to answer the question "How much more expensive is the basked compared to a reference period". The reason is that the prices in this basked are on vastly different scales. Instead i first want to calculate the percentage change values between successors of each belonging value (in time). Than i want to calculate the "average" percentage change at a given Point in time. So i want to now how much on average the prices changed between periods. Would i need to use the geometric or arithmetic mean? I do know that for the compound percentage change over time i would use the geometric mean. But i am calculating the values at a specific point in time. Is there a better way to answer this question? Example: good this wekk price last week price pct_change good_1 4 5 -0.2 good_2 1 10 -0.9 Would the aritmetric mean of -0.55 descirbe the "average"percentage change better than the geometirc mean of -0.4242in this case? Does this depend on the distribution of the Price values? How to deal with the fact that an negative numbers can not be treated ? Thank you in advance!
