Two or more time series. What is the best way to test whether one of them is leading and by what time period?

I am trying to prove/disprove that one time series is leading trend for the other ones. Two time series are (probably) independent and the movements are caused by some (let's assume unknown) common factors. What method would be most appropriate? I also want to find the leading period? Data is quarterly.
