Not sure this adds anything, but if you view your page in Firefox and then use firebug to hunt down the element, you may notice that an @font-face web fonts are not lined up vertically in the centre of their line-heights. I don't know enough about fonts to know whether this is a font-file issue, but I did all my generation with font-squirrel, which people seem to think is the most reliable option. WORKAROUNDS My font ('Destroy') was lined up very heavily toward the bottom. So if I didn't include enough space for it, it looked chopped off at the bottom. Two solutions worked: If your element is non-breaking: Make the line-height double the font-size. If your element breaks: add padding to the bottom of the element equal to or slightly less than the font-size. Obviously (or maybe not so, sorry), I'm dealing with headers and such. I have no idea if these would work with paragraphs or other multi-lined elements.
