If you use logistic regression instead of random forest, you will be able to associate every individual (churner or otherwise) to a probability of churn. With a separate asymptotic analysis or something similar you may be able to generate a critical threshold for this probability. This is one way to do it, but not the only nor the best (still I think it beats playing a guessing game using precision and recall ). The best way in my humble opinion would be to use a survival model and generate a hazard function on the actual churners. This way you will know when and how likely it is for a non-churner to churn.
