One of the main benefit to program to ISomeInterface instead of FooClass, is that you might probably change your implementation of FooClass. For example, consider a database driven blog application: interface IBlogStorage{ getPosts(); } you then have a class like: class XMLBlogSotrage: IBlogStorage{} and suppose you implement everything to the interface. later on, you think XML is too slow and you want to use RDBMS, then: class MsSQLBlogStorage:IBlogStorage{} In this case, you don't need to change anything in other codes, you just need to create a new class and plug it in! Those already existed codes, doesn't need to bother where is the storage.
