Creating temporary tables perl cgi dbi

I have sql containing 8 table joins which takes time to fetch the data considering the amount of joins in the sql. I could create a temp table and simply the sql which might help speed up the data retrieval process. i am trying to fetch the data using this sql in perl cgi dbi. Does it makes sense to create a temp table on a web application?
