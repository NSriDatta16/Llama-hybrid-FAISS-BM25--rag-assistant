Multiple comparisons and power analysis

I would like to compare 4 different groups for 10 different variables (the biodistribution of a material in different organs). Someone suggested me to use a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc test for each variable. My questions are: I know that Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post-hoc tests have corrections for multiple comparisons, but should I use an extra correction because I would do 10 hypothesis tests for the same 4 groups (but different data)? How can I calculate the minimal group size to detect significance for this type of experiment (power analysis?)? Is there a better method of doing this? Thank you in advance.
