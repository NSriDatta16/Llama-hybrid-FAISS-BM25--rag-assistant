You don't need to use attr_accessor , see neutrino's explanation. You just need to access your virtual column by using the attributes hash. This question is the same as Rails: find_by_sql and virtual column . Sample code for your example: countries = Country.sorted_by_average_score.first.attributes['average_score']
