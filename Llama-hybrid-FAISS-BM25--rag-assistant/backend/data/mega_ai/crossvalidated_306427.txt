What are the statistical properties of average partial effect in nonlinear models?

Using a linear model like OLS, the marginal effects are simply the coefficients given by $\beta = (X'X)^{-1}X'y$. However, in a nonlinear model, it is more difficult to derive marginal effects. For instance, in the logic/probit model, you typically compute the partial effect at the mean or the average partial effect. How can you evaluate these partial effects in a statistical meaningful sense? I mean, which properties will you derive in order to show that these are "true" partial effects? I consider this because I'm trying to derive marginal effects in a highly nonlinear model, and I don't know how to be certain about the estimates.
