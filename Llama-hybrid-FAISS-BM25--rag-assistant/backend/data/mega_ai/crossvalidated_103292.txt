post-hoc test after logistic regression with interaction. Risk higher for type 1 or type 2 error?

I have a large data set (>1000 obs) and i'm performing regressions tests, both linear and logistic, on a series of clinical outcomes. In this test I verify the effect of interactions between two cat variables by creating a dummy interaction variable with the two vars joined in one (with R is done using the interaction() fuction). In the equation are present also other vars for adjustment. After every test I perform a post-hoc to verify if there is difference between every level of this interaction variable. The test is performed via glht() of the multcomp package in R. I believe, (i'm not 100% sure) that the post-hoc is performed using Tukey methodology. Of course applying the post-hoc procedure I loose significance. Often appears that results that were significant in the regression test become not significant. It's ok. I always think that p My question is therefore, when you perform a post hoc of a regression analysis, using Tukey, and with these large numbers, it's still easier to make a type 1 error and accept no real results, or a type 2 error, being too hard on data and loosing interesting results? Or it's impossible to know? (probably this is the correct answer) Thanks!
