Good answers and good examples are already given by others here. The reason DIP is important is because it ensures the OO-principle "loosely coupled design". The objects in your software should NOT get into a hierarchy where some objects are the top-level ones, dependent on low-level objects. Changes in low-level objects will then ripple-through to your top-level objects which makes the software very fragile for change. You want your 'top-level' objects to be very stable and not fragile for change, therefore you need to invert the dependencies.
