Check out the GD functions . Here's a solution of looping through the pixels to find the most common color. However, you could just resize the image to 1 pixel - that should be the average color - right? An example of the 1px method ( now including test page ): Test Image Average Color , , )'> '> Here's some example code for finding the average border color, similar to the first link. For your use this may work better ( I know this code is inefficient, but hopefully it's easy to follow ): Update : I put some more refined code on github . This includes both averaging the border, and averaging the entire image. It should be noted that resizing to 1px is far more resource friendly than scanning every pixel (although I haven't run any real time tests), but the code does show the three different methods.
