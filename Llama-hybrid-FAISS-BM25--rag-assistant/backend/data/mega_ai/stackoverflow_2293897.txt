The Java Jump Loader will allow you to drag files into your browser. Getting them referenced in a MySQL table will be a different job though. You'll have to run that query from the server-side. The Jump Loader documentation even has code examples demonstrating how to move the file once it's uploaded to your permanent location. Inserting the file-reference into the database is a breeze from there. Essentially, you'll just run an INSERT query containing the filepath: $sql = "INSERT INTO files(filepath) VALUES('%s')"; $rst = mysql_query( sprintf($sql, $filepath) ) or die( mysql_error() ); And if you need to you can spit out the newly created ID: print mysql_insert_id(); For a demo of drag-and-drop uploading, visit http://jumploader.com/demo_embedded.html
