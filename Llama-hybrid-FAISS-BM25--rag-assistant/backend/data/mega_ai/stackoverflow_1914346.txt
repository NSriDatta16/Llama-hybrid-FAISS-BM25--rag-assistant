Move outlook mail from one mailbox inbox to different folder in same mailbox

I have several mailboxes which I can see in my Outlook profile. One of the mailboxes, let's call it "Mailbox - HUR" receives messages constantly. presently one of my team goes into the inbox of this mailbox every day and moves (drag and drop) the messages into a subfolder of the inbox called Archive (we're an imaginative lot!) if the messages are greater than 24 hours old. Is there any way that a macro can be set up to do this task? I know my simple way around VBA but have never used it with Outlook and can't figure out the namespace details to point me to the correct mailbox instead of my mailbox. Unfortunately I do not have access to Exchange server, only using outlook client. Any help anyone could give would be great.
