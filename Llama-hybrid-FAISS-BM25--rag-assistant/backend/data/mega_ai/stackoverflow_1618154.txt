data storage limitation issue

I face one problem, one column is i have taken as numeric(38,0) Data stored in this column is going out of range, means it is reach it's storage limitation. i have tried with also bigint , but facing same problem.i can not take it as varchar because i have to use in another calculation so at that time i must need to convert it from varchar to bigint ot numeric(38,0). So, is there any solution to store high range value.
