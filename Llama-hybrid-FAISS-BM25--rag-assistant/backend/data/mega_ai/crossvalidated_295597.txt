I understand that your data points are both real. Assuming dataset does not have temporal dimension regression model is more suitable than classification. If you use classification you -probably- will have to calculate continues values for y . In summary: Use regression if you need exact values of y for all corresponding x values. Use classification if you need just general inferences for y values. For example: Let x be the daylight duration and y be the average temperature. regression for predicting temperature in degrees. classification for predicting temperature as as low , medium or high .
