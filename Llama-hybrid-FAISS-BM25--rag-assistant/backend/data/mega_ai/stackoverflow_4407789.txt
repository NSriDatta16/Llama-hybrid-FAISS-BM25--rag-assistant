Even if code analysis tools might help in searching this properties, you can't rely on code analysis tools completely, because a client code might access a property with reflection. This includes data contracts your client proxies might have in case of WCF, javasript json serialization dependencies and the like. You can try comment out properties suspected to have no usages, but you have not only to make sure it compiles, but also have all the the tests to pass. Hope you have a decent test coverage and intergated test suites in place.
