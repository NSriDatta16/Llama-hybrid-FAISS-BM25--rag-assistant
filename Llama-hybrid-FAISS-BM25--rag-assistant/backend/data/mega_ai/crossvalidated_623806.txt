Family/Link for averaged categorical data

I have categorical data coded 0/1 at the observation level. I have averaged these values across trials, obtaining a probability value between 0 and 1. I am running GLME's in R using family = Gamma(link = identity) (continuous) and family = binomial(link = logit) within the models, however for the averaged categorical data I am struggling. Some averages have a value of 0, meaning I cannot use the gamma family/identity link; whereas since we have more than 2 unique values, we cannot use the binomial family/logit link. I am aware I could run LME's without specifying the family/link, however, I am tied to running GLME's due to pre-registration processes linked with the data. Here's an example of the data and code that I am using datafile depvar.glmer1 = glmer(depvar ~ window*trial_sound + (1+ window*trial_sound|pp) + (1+ window*trial_sound|item),control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa",optCtrl=list(maxfun=20000)), data = datafile, family= Gamma(link = "identity")) Any advice and references/resources that may help me would be very much appreciated!
