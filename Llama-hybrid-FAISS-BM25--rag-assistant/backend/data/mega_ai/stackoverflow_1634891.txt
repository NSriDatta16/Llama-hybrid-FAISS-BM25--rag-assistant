Creating a Cygwin emacs macro

I have been researching how to get Cygwin to work under emacs . I have it working, but now I want to write a macro that will do the following: Launch by typing M-x cygwin Have the script stored in some obvious place (probably my .emacs file) M-x shell Rename the buffer to cygwin (or cygwin1, cygwin2, cygwin3, ... if cygwin exists) probably using M-x rename-buffer M-x ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on M-x set-buffer-process-coding-system 'undecided-unix 'undecided-unix Open and run cygwin It will basically do all of the above steps. I think most of the organization for this little project is done. How do I tie it all together so I can just type M-x cygwin and see a happy new cygwin buffer? What exactly needs to be added to .emacs? Also, where exactly is .emacs in Windows? I still want the ability to run M-x shell for the windows shell for now. I may also make similar macros for MSYS and ssh'ing to my Linux boxes. How do I get started?
