How can I evaluate data mining model?

I will evaluate classification models I made. That's logistic regression and decision tress. 1. What I use standards for comparison? 2. Suppose model selection's standard is ASE. One is high ASE of training data, low ASE of test data, and the other is ASE of training data is low and ASE of test data is high.. If you select a model, which models do you choose?
