Setup second level cahce's for all the entities ( check hibernate documentation for various configuration/mapping details for caching) ,configure query cache and mark them as immutable in the mapping / use read-only sessions, this would make hibernate not check for modifications for these entities when doing "transactional write-behind" and session flushing. This is a very common scenario and this is all you should have to do . You shouldn't have to deal with rolling out your own in memory hashmap cache ( second level caches like echache offer you several storage alternative), that what second level cache would do for you. Transaction less DB access doesn't offer you anything , performance wise , so I wouldn't worry about it and let hibernate deal with it .
