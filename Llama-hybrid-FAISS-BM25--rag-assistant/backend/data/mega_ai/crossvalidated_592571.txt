Time series with seasonality

I am working on time series with seasonality. However, the event that is repeated every year doesn't happen exactly in the same time, it advances by specific period of time. (example an event happened this year on 1st January, next year will take place on 11th January and the year after that 21st January and so on. each time it adds 10days). is there a way to work with such pattern? does it have a great impact on our work?
