Magento products gallery

i don't know if my title is ok, but what i'm trying to do is something like a gallery or at least my client call it this way...lol..... i'm trying to do something like the seach result page but without a search criteria, without a filter, just click in a link and see a list of products, with the same funcionality, change the view mode(Grid, List), select the amount of products to show and a pager, i need some help here, what I've done so far is, i create a new controller with just one action as simple as public function listAction(){ $this->loadLayout(); $this->renderLayout(); } in my xml layout page/1columns.phtml empty 6 one_column 5 two_columns_left 4 two_columns_right 4 three_columns 3 product_list_toolbar three_columns it is almost identical to catalogsearch_result_index block in catalogsearch.xml, when i tried to go to my new page it show me no products, the collection was empty, so, i change the content of funcion _getProductCollection() in app\code\core\Mage\Catalog\Block\Product\List.php for this if (is_null($this->_productCollection)) { $category = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load(5); $productCollection = $category->getProductCollection(); Mage::getModel('catalog/layer')->prepareProductCollection($productCollection); $this->_productCollection = $productCollection->load(); } return $this->_productCollection; i don't like to change the core code, but now i'm trying to make it work, so, when i refresh the page it show me the products, i can change the view mode, i can see the amount of products, but, the pager don't work, when i change the amount of product i whanna show, it do nothing, just change the label 8 Item(s) for Item 1-8 of 8, and doesn't group it, if i pick 5, it should show just 5 items, but i can see the 8 i have in my db, so, what is wrong with my code?, how can i make the pager work?? thanks
