You can do it like this: $("#dialog").dialog({ drag: function() { $.data(this, 'dragged', true); }, open: function() { $.data(this, 'dragged', false); } }); $(window).resize(function() { $(".ui-dialog-content").each(function() { if(!$.data(this, 'dragged')) $(this).dialog('option', 'position', 'center'); }); }); You can try out a demo here , this re-centers the dialog on window.resize only if you haven't dragged it since it was open. When we open, we set a the data for dragged to false , if we drag it, set it to true ...and if it's still false (hasn't been dragged yet), the re-center happens, otherwise we leave it alone in it's current position. Good question/idea on the dragging detection by the way, this would improve an application I'm currently working on, going to use this myself :)
