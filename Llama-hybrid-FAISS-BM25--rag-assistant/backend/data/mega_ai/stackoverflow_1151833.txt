To answer the question, on disk MySql uses 1 + the size that is used in the field to store the data (so if the column was declared varchar(45), and the field was "FooBar" it would use 7 bytes on disk, unless of course you where using a multibyte character set, where it would be using 14 bytes). So, however you declare your columns, it wont make a difference on the storage end (you stated you are worried about disk optimization for a massive table). However, it does make a difference in queries, as VARCHAR's are converted to CHAR's when MySql makes a temporary table (SORT, ORDER, etc) and the more records you can fit into a single page, the less memory and faster your table scans will be.
