Clustering algorithms such as K-means work on distances. By dimensionality reduction, the data is projected from a large amount of components to only a few key components, at the same time, the distance metric that helps differentiate different clusters maximally is retained in dimensionality reduction. Such strategy is not only to reduce the computational efficiency in clustering, but may also reduce the local minima (may not though) and increase the robustness to the initializations.
