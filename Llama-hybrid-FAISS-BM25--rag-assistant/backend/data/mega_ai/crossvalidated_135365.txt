You say you do not want to consider covariables like weekdays and so on, so we omit mention of covariables. You should concentrate on modelling the counts directly, not he percentages/proportions. Number of daily visits is then a time series of counts, so the simplest model to consider is the Poisson distribution. Then we know the variance is equal to the mean, so my first question to you is: Compare your sample mean, and the sample variance. Are they close enough to warrant using a Poisson model? If not, we could try some other counting distribution, like the negative binomial. Next, you should investigate if there is time dependence. Calculate the autocorrelation function, maybe after applying the square-root transformation (which is approximately a variance-stabilizing transformation for the Poisson). Is there time-correlation structure which needs to be modeled? After deciding on a model for the daily visit counts, then the conversions. Focus on the probability $p$ that the visit result in conversion. If the visits process is Poisson with expected number of daily visits $\lambda$, then the conversion process is poisson with expectation (per day) $p\lambda$. But, this assumes $p$ is a constant and does not vary, which must be investigated. So make a plot of conversion percentage versus daily visits. Is there some relationship? This way you can gradually build up a model, which you finally use to get your confidence (better prediction ) interval. Hope this helps! If you would include in your past some reasonable part (say, 100 days) of your data, we could test out some possible models. Also,if this answer is not understandable for you, tel us what is the problem.
