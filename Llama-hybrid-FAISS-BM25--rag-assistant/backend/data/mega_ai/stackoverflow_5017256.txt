This is very implementation-dependent--in fact the differences are exploited to do OS fingerprinting. For example, some Windows systems increment ID, but send the field in host-byte order rather than network-byte order. It doesn't really matter and doesn't cause problems since ID is only used for fragmentation. So as you suggest, if DF is set, you can probably ignore ID, though I would sanity check that frag offset is 0 and total length matches the amount of data received.
