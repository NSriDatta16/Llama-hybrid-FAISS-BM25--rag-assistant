.NET regex captures not in expected order

In .NET, regex is not organizing captures as I would expect. (I won't call this a bug, because obviously someone intended it. However, it's not how I'd expect it to work nor do I find it helpful.) This regex is for recipe ingredients (simplified for sake of example): (? # begin group \s* # optional beginning space or group separator ( (? \d+)| # integer ( (? \d+) # numerator / (? [1-9]\d*) # denominator. 0 not allowed ) ) \s(? [a-zA-Z]+) )+ # end group. can have multiple My string: 3 tbsp 1/2 tsp Resulting groups and captures: [measurement][0]=3 tbsp [measurement][ 1 ]= 1/2 tsp [integer][0]=3 [numtor][ 0 ]=1 [dentor][ 0 ]=2 [unit][0]=tbsp [unit][ 1 ]=tsp Notice how even though 1/2 tsp is in the 2nd Capture, it's parts are in [0] since these spots were previously unused. Is there any way to get all of the parts to have predictable useful indexes without having to re-run each group through the regex again?
