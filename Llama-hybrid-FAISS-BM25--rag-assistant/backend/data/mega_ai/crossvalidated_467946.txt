Bias and Variance term, in regards to bias Neural Network

I have recently been working with ANN, where I have come to the term of bias, which from my understanding is a constant value being added to the summation of weights and activation of previous neurons during training and backpropagation. Previously I have introduced to the term bias and variance , in regards to Linear Regression , where Variance was described as the term, of the different fits from training data and testing data. Whereas low bias , meaning, that the model is not overfitting, and can handle different types of training samples. Am I confusing these terms?
