GlobalAveragePooling2D in inception v3 example

I'm a complete begginer at Keras. In the Inception v3 example at https://keras.io/applications/ # create the base pre-trained model base_model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False) # add a global spatial average pooling layer x = base_model.output x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x) # let's add a fully-connected layer x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x) # and a logistic layer -- let's say we have 200 classes predictions = Dense(200, activation='softmax')(x) As at first step it adds a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer, which is described as: Global average pooling operation for spatial data. What GlobalAveragePooling2D does and why the example uses it instead of something like Flatten? Which information is averaged?
