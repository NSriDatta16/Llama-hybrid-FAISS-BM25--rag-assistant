Settle a bet: Errors in prediction / regression

In my work, I am comparing "predicted" values to "theoretically true" values. To calculate one predicted value, I take some $N_{R_i}$ samples from an area in space, $R_i$ (i.e. the samples are from different locations in a region). I do some calculations on the samples to calculate a predicted value for each sample. Then I average the predictions to calculate an average predicted value for the region. There are around 10 regions in total, so 10 predicted values. The theoretically true values are back-calculated using a very different methodology. Theoretically true values are only available many years after the original samples are taken (that's why we bother to make predictions). There can only be one theoretically true value per region $R_i$. That's why I averaged samples from within each region to compare to the single theoretically true value per region. I hope you are with me so far. So, what I have is a small data set of about 10 predicted and "true" values. The correlation between them is strong. Now, what if we expand into a new region? I can take some new samples and make a prediction for that region. I want to know how to calculate the uncertainty in my prediction. I think I am after "Uncertainty in the mean" since my prediction is an average of $n$ samples. $$ SE_x=\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$ So, I think I can say that if I calculate a predicted value, $x$, there is a 68% chance for the "true value" to be within 1 $SE_x$ of $x$. Is this correct? My colleague thinks we should be interested in the standard error for a predicted value: $$ s_{y_p}=s^2_e\bigg(1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{(x-\overline{x})^2}{\sum(x-\overline{x})^2}\bigg) $$ (she found that equation here: http://courses.ncssm.edu/math/Talks/PDFS/Standard%20Errors%20for%20Regression%20Equations.pdf ) Who is right? Or maybe a better question is: what will the 2nd formula give me that the first will not?
