I've found an elegant solution, and I've just found time to write a blog post about it . What I did was to create an attached property, SynchronizedSelectedItems that you can set on the ListBox (or DataGrid in fact). You databind this to a collection, and then, with a bit of magic, the SelectedItems property on the ListBox and your collection are kept in sync. You can download all the code from my blog post. The "magic" is a class which listens out for CollectionChanged events in either collection, and propagates the changes to the other.
