SLLN applies to last $r_n$ variables?

Let $X_n$ be a sequence of IID random variables with finite mean and first moment, let $S_n = \sum_1^n X_n $ then is it true that \begin{equation} \frac{S_n - S_{n-r_n}}{r_n} \end{equation} converges almost surely to the mean if $\liminf \frac{r_n}{n} > 0$? Basically we're taking the latest $r_n$ variables and averaging them. What's a way to show this? Also, apparently without the condition it fails, even if $\lim r_n = \infty $, I can't think of a counterexample because I can't even show this.
