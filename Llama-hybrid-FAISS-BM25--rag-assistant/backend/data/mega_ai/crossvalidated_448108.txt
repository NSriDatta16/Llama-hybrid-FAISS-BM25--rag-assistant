I'd like to point out that the "exact" solution to this problem in the frequentist sense is the Clopper-Pearson interval . As the author noted, there are a number of nice approximate intervals with different characteristics, and the Wilson score interval is often a good choice. However I thought I would also point out that Bayesian inference with a uniform prior on $p$ yields a very simple formula for the posterior distribution for $p$ $$P(p|N,M) = \frac{(M+1)!}{N!(M-N)!} p^N (1-p)^{M-N}$$ with the following features: $${\rm mode}(p|N,M) = \frac{N}{M}$$ $${\rm mean}(p|N,M) = \frac{N+1}{M+2}$$ $${\rm variance}(p|N,M)= \frac{(N+1) (N+2) }{(M+2)(M+3) } -\frac{(N+1)^2}{(M+2)^2} $$ Using [mean $\pm \sqrt{\rm variance}$ ] gives easy-to-compute 1 $\sigma$ confidence intervals with very nice properties even when $N=0$ or $N=M$ . One can even show that these intervals have descent frequentist coverage properties, especially at larger $M$ , and only undercover when the "true" value of $p$ is unmeasurably close to 0 or 1.
