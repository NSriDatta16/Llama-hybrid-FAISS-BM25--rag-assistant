Denoting a preferred place for a line break

Let's say I have this text that I want to display in an HTML table cell: Honey Nut Cheerios, Wheat Chex, Grape-Nuts, Rice Krispies, Some random cereal with a very long name, Honey Bunches of Oats, Wheaties, Special K, Froot Loops, Apple Jacks and I want the line to break preferentially after one of the commas. Is there a way to tell the HTML renderer to try breaking at some designated spot, and do that first before trying to break after one of the spaces, without using non-breaking spaces? If I use non-breaking spaces then it makes the width larger unconditionally. I want the line break to happen after one of the spaces, if the line-wrapping algorithm has tried it with the commas first and can't get the line to fit. I tried wrapping text fragments in elements but that doesn't seem to do anything helpful. div.box { width: 180px; } table, table td { border: 1px solid; border-collapse: collapse; } lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum Honey Nut Cheerios, Wheat Chex, Grape-Nuts, Rice Krispies, Some random cereal with a very long name, Honey Bunches of Oats, Wheaties, Special K, Froot Loops, Apple Jacks lorem ipsum note: It looks like the CSS3 text-wrap: avoid behavior is what I want, but I can't seem to get it to work.
