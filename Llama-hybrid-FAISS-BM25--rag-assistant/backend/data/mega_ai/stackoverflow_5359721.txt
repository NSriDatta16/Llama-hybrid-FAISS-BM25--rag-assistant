What's the connection string for LDAP?

Here how I need to use it: string tmpDirectory = String.Format("LDAP://ou={0},dc={1},dc={2}", parentOrganizationUnit, domainName, domainExtension ); When I try to run some code using this connection, I get an exception. ( See this question for more information ). I've been told I need to provide the connection string with credentials - a username and a password. What's the connection string like? I need the exact syntax. :) Thanks! I'm using Windows Server 2003 and Active Directory.
