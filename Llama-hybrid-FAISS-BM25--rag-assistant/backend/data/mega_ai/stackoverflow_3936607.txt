I'm afraid you're stuck with: WHERE (FIELD2 LIKE '%value21' OR FIELD2 LIKE '%value22' OR FIELD2 LIKE '%value23' ...) at least in standard SQL (your particular engine might offer some form of full-text indexing that would help). A query like this often indicates a normalization problem in your database design with multiple values stored in a single field value. If that's true in your case and you have any degree of control over the database schema, I advise fixing the problem as soon as possible. Otherwise check your medical coverage to make sure it covers SQL-induced psychosis â€” this can drive you crazy.
