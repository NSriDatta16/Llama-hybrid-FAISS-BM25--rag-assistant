Correctly reference jQuery in ASP.NET MVC

Encountered such problem: I ve created a new blank project of ASP.NET MVC site. Then I m trying to add a reference to jquery-1.3.2.js from Masterpage head. But in this case, page doesn t loading to browser. I ve bee trying and src=" ", all the same. Then I moved the script reference to the end of the , and the page began to load. But i need to use jQuery earlier, in ContentPlaceHolders. What is the problem?
