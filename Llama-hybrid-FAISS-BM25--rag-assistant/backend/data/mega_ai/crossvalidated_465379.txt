PCA handling dimensions of test and train data for NeuralNetworks

I want to apply PCA to a dataset $X_{train}\in R^{n\times m}$ , where $X_{train} = [ x^{(1)}_{train} x^{(2)}_{train} x^{(3)}_{train} x^{(4)}_{train} ...x^{(m)}_{train} ] $ and $x^{(i)}_{train}\in R^{n}$ , such that after applying PCA, $X_{train}$ reduces to $X_{train} \in R^{k,m}$ . If I want to train this new dimension reduced dataset using Neural Networks i have to initialize my training model with input layer having nodes equal to to number of features i.e $k$ .Now it has been advised that we should not use PCA on the testing data. Since there will be a mismatch of dimensions how can I fit/predict testing data of dimensions $x_{test}^{(i)} \in R^{n}$ on a Neural Network model which has only $k$ input nodes without reducing its dimensions? Is it possible to implement NN along with PCA?
