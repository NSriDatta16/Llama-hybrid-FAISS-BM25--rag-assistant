Have you tried adding the following to your message class? The @XmlSeeAlso annotation will let the JAXBContext know about the subclasses. import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso; @XmlRootElement @XmlSeeAlso(RegMessage.class) public abstract class Message { Integer id; } Alternate Strategy: Here is a link to a strategy I have helped people use: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/08/using-xmlanyelement-to-build-generic.html Essentially you have one message object, and multiple individual message payloads. The relationship between the message and payload is handled through a @XmlAnyElement annotation. Note on Transaction Handling I noticed that you are handling your own transactions. Have you considered implementing your JAX-RS service as a session bean and leverage JTA for your transaction handling? For an example see: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/08/creating-restful-web-service-part-45.html
