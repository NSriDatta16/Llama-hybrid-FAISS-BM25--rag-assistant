A starting point for the concept of ITSA is Shadish, Cooke, & Campbell (2002) and a starting palce for the mathematical procedures for ITSA is Glass, Wilson, & Gottman (1975). Some researchers may recommend a dummy code moderator in a multiple regression, where 0 represents no intervention and 1 represents intervention: $$\hat{y}=b_0+b_1(time)+b_2(intervention)$$ This is a simple solution and may work if you do not care about autocorrelation. However, the interrupted time series (ITSA) allows you to include autoregressive and moving average components: $$y_t=z_t=AR+I+MA+a_t$$ where $z_t$ is the observed value of teh DV at time point $t$ , $AR$ is the order of autoregression of the series, $I$ is the order of differencing required to create a stationary series, $MA$ is the order of moving average of the series, and $a_t$ is the error. Alternatively, and more precisely, an ARIMA (p, d, q) process may be modeled by: $$y_t=Δz_t=ϕz_tΔz_{t−1}θzt$$ where $ϕ$ is the autocorrelation coefficient, $θ$ is the moving average coefficient, and $Δzt=zt−zt−d$ when $d>0$ . When $d=0$ , $Δzt=zt−1$ or simply $Δzt$ is ignored, depending on the order of p and q. You can identify $ϕ$ , $θ$ , and $Δ$ using software, such as Rob Hyndman's auto.arima in R. The models are all different given the order of the coefficients and I do not know of any comprehensive source for all possible ITSA or a generalization thereof. Generally, though, there is a level at baseline, $L$ , and a change from that level in the treatment phase, $\delta$ , where the level of the treatment phase is $L+\delta$ . This is similar to the dummy coding solution, but now you are incorporating the ARIMA model. You may need to derive the model yourself, as I did for an ARIMA(1,1,0) in a submitted manuscript where most of this information comes from (Raadt, in-press). Glass, G. V., Willson, V.
