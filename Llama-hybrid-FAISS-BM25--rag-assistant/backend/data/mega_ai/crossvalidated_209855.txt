First order model vs n-order models

Plenty of different research models showed that n-order models give better results than first order models. For example, for location this is work that shows this http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2181199 I am doing location prediction. I implemented and applied Bayesian inference and see that first order models gives ~15% better results than second order model. How come this can be explained? Is it dataset dependent or why this is happening?
