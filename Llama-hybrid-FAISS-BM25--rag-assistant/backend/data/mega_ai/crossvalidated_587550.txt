Trend in exogenous variable in time series

I have a time series of a variable V1 with seasonality and a strong trend. The trend however seems to be closely related to (and caused by) the trend of another time varying variable (V2). As V2 grows i.e shows a positive trend, the trend on V1 declines (see chart). I want to use V2 as an exogenous variable in the time series forecast of V1. I am using prophet for this where I forecast V2 and then use it as an exogenous variable to forecast V1. But, since V2 has a trend that affects the trend of V1 does it make sense to use V2 as an exogenous variable at all? I can simply run a forecast with and without the exogenous variable to see what difference it makes. It might not be much, but I am more interested in knowing if there is a fundamental flaw in using exogenous variables with trends. The question is similar to this one , but it was not very clear to me.
