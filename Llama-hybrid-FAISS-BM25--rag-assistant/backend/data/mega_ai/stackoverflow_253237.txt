I don't think it's a good idea to choose your table's primary key based on the fact that you're using LINQ-to-SQL. In my opinion, it would be much better to use the primary key for its intended purpose - to ensure data integrity by uniquely identifying a particular row. Integer or GUID PKs do not protect you against having duplicate rows in your table (aside from the auto-generated columns, of course). Then again, there's been a big debate raging about the pro's and con's of auto-generated keys :)
