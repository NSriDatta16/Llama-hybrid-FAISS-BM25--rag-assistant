How to assess predictive power of set of categorical predictors of a binary outcome? Calculate probabilities or logistic regression?

I am trying to determine if simple probabilities will work for my problem or if it will be better to use (and learn about) more sophisticated methods like logistic regression. The response variable in this problem is a binary response (0, 1). I have a number of predictor variables that are all categorical and unordered. I am trying to determine which combinations of the predictor variables yield the highest proportion of 1's. Do I need logistic regression? How would it be an advantage to just calculating proportions in my sample set for each combination of the categorical predictors?
