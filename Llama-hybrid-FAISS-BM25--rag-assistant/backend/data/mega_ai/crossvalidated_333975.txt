GLMM using glmer() -- lack of convergence with a TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE

A supposedly simple, textbook example of a binary GLMM using adaptive Gauss-Hermite Quadrature with 5 fixed and 1 random effect is not converging. The example analysis that I'm trying to reproduce is from Hosmer et al (2013: 347). The following code reproduces the problem: install.packages("aplore3") require(aplore3) data("polypharm") polypharm$ID 1 or it's not GHQ family = binomial, data = polypharm) And the result is Warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.339924 (tol = 0.001, component 1) In the help file, the author of glmer() says that up to 25 quadrature points may be used when there's only one random effect. I therefore tried refitting the model with every nAGP value from 1 through 25 (not shown), but none of those models converges either. The model does converge when nAGP is set to 0 but, as I understand it, that method is essentially a cheap shortcut that sacrifices estimation accuracy -- and sure enough, the estimates thus obtained are quite different from those in Hosmer et al's example. Since this dataset was specifically selected by eminent statisticians to serve as a didactic example of GLMMs, it seems hard to believe that convergence should be so hard to attain. The most plausible explanation is that I'm messing something up. But what? I'm not opposed to using other packages either. But the chart on page 131 of this article straightforwardly suggests that GHQ is the way to go, and glmer() seems the default choice for that. References: Hosmer, D. W., Lemeshow, S. & Sturdivant, R.
