Okay, I've solved the specific issue I was having. It was not an issue with the Infragistics components. I was simply forcing the creation of the handles at the incorrect time... I was forcing the handle creating in the construct of each custom Control/Form - after the InitializeComponent() call. This is fine for Forms, but a Control will most likely not have been placed in a parent Control/Form by this stage. It is obviously bad to be forcing the creation of a handle when the Control has no parent to "hold on" to it. So I've changed my rule of thumb for implementing this to: For Forms, force creation of handles after ALL child controls have been added, for the Form itself and any child Controls. I typically continue to do this in the Construct of the Form after the InitializeComponent() call. For Controls, force creation of handles after the Control has been constructed and added to it's parent Contol/Form, for the new Control and all its child Controls (if any). So I presume if you ensure you use this functionality correctly, the only drawback is a potential performance issue (which I haven't really noticed to be honest). I'd welcome a formal description of the cons of using this functionality, and a more technical description of how forcing the creation of handles for a Control before it is placed in it's parent Control causes problems, as my description is a bit brief...
