TensorFlow is specifically for implementing neural networks architectures, i.e. Deep Learning. Imho your objective is too broad, you should focus on some specific type of problem/task for example. It's impossible to compare ML methods in general, because different methods perform differently with different types of problems or different datasets. Among the frameworks you selected: Scikit-Learn is the only for general statistical ML. There are others but not necessarily in Python. Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch are all specialized in neural networks. Anyway in the case of traditional statistical ML, there would be little benefit trying the same algorithm with different frameworks: it's true that there can be differences due to implementation choices, but these are rarely significant.
