Is it possible to statistically test relationships between counts and percentages?

I have counted adult butterfly numbers over 3 areas and would like to compare these counts with the percentage heather cover on each of the 3 areas. Is this possible? My data looks like this (the cover is the average for each area whilst count is the total number of adults observed over 10 days â€“ let me know if this should be an average instead): $$\begin{array}{c|cc}\rm Area&\rm Cover&\rm Count\\\hline \rm Field\ 1& 53.7& 216\\ \rm Field\ 2&19.5& 2\\ \rm Field\ 3&39.8& 6106\end{array}$$ I suspect from looking at these figures that there probably won't be a relationship, but I would still like to test the relationship nonetheless. I know that there are specific statistical tests for proportion data and other tests for count data because of the way both count and percentage data behave, but I wonder if there is one that will analyse both? I am using the R software environment.
