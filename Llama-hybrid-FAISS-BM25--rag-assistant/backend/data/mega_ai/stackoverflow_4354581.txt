Maybe the better thing to do here is to use the MVC/MVVVM patterns and then you get this for free along with a very structured and organized code project. Take a look at this page from Rasmus' blog as a primer to this workflow: http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/38-The-no-framework-PHP-MVC-framework.html If you are willing to let go of the reigns a bit, Zend is very good as a framework and can help you get your site done pretty quickly. It will save you having to rewrite a lot of code yourself and give you some advanced features you probably wouldn't want to have to write on your own anyway. I wholeheartedly agree with you about the size of some frameworks, and you can do this without them. The trade-off is time. Time spent coding and time spent debugging. Like I said, if you're willing to let go of some control you can breeze through your project only having to deal with debugging the 'business logic' of your site and not having to reinvent a lot of already existing code. Hope this is helpful.
