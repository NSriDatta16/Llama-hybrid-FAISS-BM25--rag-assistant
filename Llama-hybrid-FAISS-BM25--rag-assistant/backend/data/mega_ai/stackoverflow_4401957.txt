Detect Chrome browser in HTML

How can I detect the Google Chrome browser? For example, I can detect Internet Explorer with this tag: I have one idea: var is_chrome = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') > -1; But maybe somebody has a better solution? Update: My page shows wrong only with Chrome browser, so i need load (only with chrome) special css file with updates
