How to recognize a two part term when the space is removed? ("bigdata" and "big data")

I'm not a NLP guy and I have this question. I have a text dataset containing terms which go like, "big data" and "bigdata". For my purpose both of them are the same. How can I detect them in NLTK (Python)? Or any other NLP module in Python?
