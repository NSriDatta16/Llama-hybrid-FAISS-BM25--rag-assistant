This is a discrete optimization problem, and eigenvalues will be of little help. PCA solves an optimization problem that is quadratic in its arguments, and that's the reason eigenvalues are relevant for it. You can Entertain a greedy search: at step $k$, include into $S$ the variable $X_k$ that has the highest partial correlation with $Y$ given the variables already in $S$ Entertain the simplex method or some other linear programming method that steps between the vertices of the unit cube, interpreting $Z=\sum_i a_i x_i$, $a_i=1$ if $i\in S$, and $0$ otherwise, and optimizing over $a_i$. Entertain the branch and bound method , although with 4000 entries, it is probably hopeless. Entertain ad hoc stochastic optimization methods, such as simulated annealing or genetic algorithms . I tried working out a similar problem of finding the best subscale for Cronbach's alpha, but have not found anything practical yet.
