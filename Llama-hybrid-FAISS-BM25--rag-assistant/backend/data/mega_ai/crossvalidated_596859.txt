Your situation is discussed in " Too many covariates and too few cases? â€“ a comparative study ," by Chen, Nian, Zhu, Talbot, Griffin and Harrell, Statistics in Medicine 35: 4546-4558 (2016). Firth regression has some disadvantages here, as it penalizes all the predictors, including your predictor of primary interest ( X-ray3 here), and it also penalizes the intercept. Chen et al. suggest ridge regression penalization on all of the covariates except the predictor of primary interest. Standard procedure with ridge regression leaves the intercept unpenalized. The usual rule of thumb for logistic regression to avoid overfitting is one unpenalized predictor per 10-20 cases in the minority class. So your current data (26 cases) should allow fitting your X-ray3 predictor unpenalized along with a (heavily) penalized set of clinical covariates. As you accumulate more cases, you can penalize the clinical covariates less. An alternative would be to use data reduction (without looking at the outcomes) to compress your set of clinical covariates into a small number of unpenalized predictors. Harrell's course notes illustrate that approach in Section 4.7. Omitting variables related to outcome (as needed for your proposed set of 2-variable models) is not a good idea in logistic regression, as there is an inherent omitted-variable bias even if omitted predictors are uncorrelated with those in the model.
