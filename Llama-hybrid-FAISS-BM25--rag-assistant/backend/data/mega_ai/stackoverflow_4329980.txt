Sharing storage between instances

I'm using the Engine Yard AppCloud service. If I want my instances to share storage (e.g. for file uploads/downloads), is my only real option to build S3 integration into my application? At the moment the app expects to use the filsystem but it doesn't look like multiple instances can mount the same EBS volume. Thanks!
