How to treat outliers in a time series dataset?

I've read the following article about how to treat outliers in a dataset: http://napitupulu-jon.appspot.com/posts/outliers-ud120.html Basically, he removes all the y which has a huge difference with the majority: def outlierCleaner(predictions, ages, net_worths): """ clean away the 10% of points that have the largest residual errors (different between the prediction and the actual net worth) return a list of tuples named cleaned_data where each tuple is of the form (age, net_worth, error) """ #calculate the error,make it descend sort, and fetch 90% of the data errors = (net_worths-predictions)**2 cleaned_data =zip(ages,net_worths,errors) cleaned_data = sorted(cleaned_data,key=lambda x:x[2][0], reverse=True) limit = int(len(net_worths)*0.1) return cleaned_data[limit:] But how may I apply this technique to a time series dataset if its rows are correlative?
