Computing confidence interval for average from individual predictions

In the attached image, I am plotting actual vs predicted along with confidence intervals for each of the predicted points. The black star represents the average of all the predicted points. What formula can I use to combine the confidence intervals of all the predicted data points to get a confidence interval for the average? Also, please assume that the average could be a weighted average. I am using python, numpy.
