Where does the white noise come from in MA(q) model?

I'm having trouble understanding the intuition of the moving average model. How is summing up a bunch of white noises related to predicting your particular time series data? Suppose I have a MA(q) model $y_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + ... + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q}$ , where do these $\epsilon's$ come from? Are these $\epsilon's$ some residuals from some other models? If so, how does one estimate these $\epsilon's$ ? Are these $\epsilon's$ just theoretical white noises? If so, why are they sequential?
