If I'm understanding your question correctly you would like to update opponent_life when ever you detect a touch in opponentView . Here are two ways of assigning the label to the view so it can be used from tocuhesBegan:withEvent: 1. Assigning the label to the view in IB @interface OpponentView : UIView { IBOutlet UILabel *opponent_life; } In the nib file for OpponentViewController you change the type of the view from UIView to OpponentView and then connect the label to the outlet of the view. 2. Assigning the label in viewDidLoad @interface OpponentView : UIView { UILabel *opponent_life; } @property (nonatomic, retain) UILabel *opponent_life; In `OpponentViewController' - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; opponentView.opponent_life = opponent_life; }
