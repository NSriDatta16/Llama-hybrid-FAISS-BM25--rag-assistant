Reload tslib touch screen calibration

Background: I am working on a somewhat large Qt-based GUI which handles all user interaction with a touch screen. The program is designed such that the user should not need to access a command prompt in order to do anything, including recalibrating the touch screen. I have written an imitation of tslib's ts_calibrate utility which runs as a QWidget and can modify tslib's calibration file at /etc/pointercal . However, although I can modify the calibration file, changes to the calibration do not seem to be applied until I close and restart the program. I have written a script which can handle re-opening the program, but I would like to find a more elegant way of doing this so that the user's hassle is kept to a minimum. Simply put, is there a function available in one of Qt's classes which will reload tslib's calibration file on the fly, without restarting the application? I have looked through the QWSServer class reference but I did not find anything that looks like it does what I want it to.
