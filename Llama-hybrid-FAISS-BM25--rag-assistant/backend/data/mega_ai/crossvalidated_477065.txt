Anchor Point Calibration (Cyclicality, Central Tendency) - Probability of Default (PD) Question about assessment - Credit Risk

Let's assume we have a PD model that was calibrated with the following parameters: Long Run Average (Central Tendency - CT): 5% Cyclicality (ω): 50% Default Rate (DR): 10% Anchor Point: CT(1-ω)+ωDR = 5%*(1-50%)+50%*10%=7,5% These were parameters calculated let's say 5 years ago. I read that in order to assess the calibration, I need to test whether 0.7*PD > Anchor Point or Anchor Point > 1.3*PD. PD is the estimated probability of default for the portfolio. Do I use the same values as the ones calibrated in the previous calibration (5 years ago)? Or do I need to update the ω,DR,CT values with most recent ones? Also, in the PD, do I put the most recent portfolio default rate or do I calculate PD differently? Any references would also be nice, I tried searching online but there is not a lot of material available.
