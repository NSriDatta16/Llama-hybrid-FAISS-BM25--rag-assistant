Same problem for me as well though I am using Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter to handle the upload. Its useful because you can validate the uploaded file(s) too :) A couple of useful methods that could help you at least on the configuration of your server is: Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http::isApcAvailable(); Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http::isUploadProgressAvailable();
