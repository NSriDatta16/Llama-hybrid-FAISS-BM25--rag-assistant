multithreads process data from the same file

can anyone in this forum give an example in C how two threads process data from one textfile. As an example, I have one textfile that contains a paragraph. I have two threads that will process the data in the said file. One thread will count the number of lines in the paragraph. The second thread will count the numeric characters. thanks
