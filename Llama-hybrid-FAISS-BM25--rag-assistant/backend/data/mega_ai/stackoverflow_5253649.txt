UIButton crashes on uitouch event

I have a UIButton which sends the draginside event to: -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { It does this through the following code in viewDidLoad: [colourButton1 addTarget:self action:@selector(touchesBegan:withEvent:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDown]; Within the method it sends it to, there is the following line: UITouch *myTouch = [touches anyObject]; And for some reason, when dragging inside the UIButton this crashes the app. Any ideas why? EDIT: The solution.. -(IBAction)buttonDragged:(id)button withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { NSSet *touches = [event touchesForView:colourButton1]; [self touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event]; }
