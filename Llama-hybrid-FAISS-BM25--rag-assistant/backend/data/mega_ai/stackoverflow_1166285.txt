Visual Studio 2008 Automatic line breaks in comments

When I write a comment, it's often a paragraph or a few lines that explains clearly what a bit of code is doing and why it's doing that. What I'd like is if I could start a comment, and have the editor automatically insert a line break and continue the comment to the nest line when I reach, say, 80 characters long. So I'd type: // Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. // Etiam congue quam eget leo dignissim tincidunt.
