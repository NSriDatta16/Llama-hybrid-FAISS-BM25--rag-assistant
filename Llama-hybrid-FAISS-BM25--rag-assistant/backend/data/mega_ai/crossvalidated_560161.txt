In some of the problems your model should have memory and ability to recall objects. For example in image captioning, your model should learn to generate some words based on the input image. You can not use just CNN or MLPs to solve it because this models only can extract some features from the image and they can not remember what word should be generated after seeing a tree as input. RNNs solve this problem by using feedbacks(as you know, feedbacks are the memory units in mathematical problems). So, when your informations are stored in a sequence words, video frames, and ...) you need to use RNN. You can read this article for more information.
