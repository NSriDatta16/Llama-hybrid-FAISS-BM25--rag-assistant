I would actually check out Team Foundation Server. It is a very good system that can scale and it is probably easy to get through internal it departments. I know it is Windows centric but you can use add-ons for Linux/Mac also and you can use proxies for some sites with slow connections. And I would think about having 2 systems in a large organization, it may help getting the best in some separate cases.
