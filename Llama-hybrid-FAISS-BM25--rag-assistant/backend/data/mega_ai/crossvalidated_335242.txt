linear regression is part of PCA but also an extention to it...(Truth or Bluff)

The question I’d like to ask is what is the correlation of regression and PCA. From my understanding the correlations of a factor and its constituent variables is a form of linear regression – multiplying the x-values with estimated coefficients* produces the factor’s values** are they called factor loadings? are they called factor scores And , my most important question is can you perform (not necessarily linear) regression by estimating coefficients for the factors that have their own now constant coefficients)
