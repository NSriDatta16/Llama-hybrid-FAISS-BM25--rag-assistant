Any reason for GROUP BY clause without aggregation function?

I'm (thoroughly) learning SQL at the moment and came across the GROUP BY clause. GROUP BY aggregates or groups the resultset according to the argument(s) you give it. If you use this clause in a query you can then perform aggregate functions on the resultset to find statistical information on the resultset like finding averages (AVG()) or frequency (COUNT()) . My question is: is the GROUP BY statement in any way useful without an accompanying aggregate function? Update Using GROUP BY as a synonym for DISTINCT is (probably) a bad idea because I suspect it is slower.
