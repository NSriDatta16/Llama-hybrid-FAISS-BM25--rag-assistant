It is perhaps worth pointing out that an SVM with an Lq or other regularisation term acting on the Lagrange multipliers (the alphas) is not really any longer a kernel model, as the interpretation of a linear model constructed in a kernel induced feature space is almost certainly lost (and along with it the generalisation bounds on which the SVM is based). This doesn't mean that it won't work better than any other sort of SVM, just that some of the justification for kernel approaches is lost, so there may not be a good reason for concentrating on SVMs and something like an import vector machine might be more appropriate. If a sparse model non-linear is what is required, you may also just use LASSO/LARS/Elastic net, after pre-transforming the inputs using a radial (or some other) basis functions etc.
