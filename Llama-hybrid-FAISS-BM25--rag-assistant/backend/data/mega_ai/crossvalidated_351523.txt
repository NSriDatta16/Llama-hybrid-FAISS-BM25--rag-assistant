Problem of finding linear combination of variables that best explains them (= has the largest possible variance) is well known and solution for it is known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It can be shown (by Lagrange multipliers , for instance) that eigenvector coresponding to largest eigenvalue gives coeficients of desired linear combination. So, any other linear combination (including $V^*$, you described) has variance lower or equal to that given by eigenvector coresponding to largest eigenvalue.
