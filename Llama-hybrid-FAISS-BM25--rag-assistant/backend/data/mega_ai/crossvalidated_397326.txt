Take this is answer with a grain of salt - as it is more of a wild idea than an true and tested response based on experience. You might want to try Bayesian Optimization . Typically BO is used to find the best hyper-parameters (i.e. numbers of layers, activation functions, etc...) of a neural network model for a given set of inputs. But it might be possible to reverse the approach so that you have a fixed set of hyper-parameters and are searching for inputs, instead of fixed inputs and searching for hyper-parameters.
