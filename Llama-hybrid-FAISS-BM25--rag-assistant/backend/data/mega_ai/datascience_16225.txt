Would you recommend feature normalization when using boosting trees?

For some machine learning methods it is recommended to use feature normalization to use features that are on the same scale, especially for distance based methods like k-means or when using regularization. However, in my experience, boosting tree regression works less well when I use normalized features, for some strange reason. How is your experience using feature normalization with boosted trees does it in general improve our models?
