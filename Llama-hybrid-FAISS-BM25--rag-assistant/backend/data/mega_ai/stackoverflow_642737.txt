Apparently it's a feature, not a bug: "in the Add files to source control we do not support the addition of empty folders, but in our research our users preferred the SCE toolbar button for actually creating their empty tree structure rather than going to the file system, doing it there and then adding to source control." http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=119974 In TFS2008 you can drag and drop folders from Windows Explorer into source control explorer, and empty subfolders will be created when checking in. Not sure if this works in TFS2005, I don't have an instance handy to test it - anyone?
