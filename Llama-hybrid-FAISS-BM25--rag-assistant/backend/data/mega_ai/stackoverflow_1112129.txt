2 questions about drag and drop with Javascript

I'm trying to be able to drag random highlighted text or images on a random page that is not written by me, thus I cannot simply wrap the text in a div and make it draggable. Is there any way to get highlighted text or images on a random page, like say Yahoo, and drop it into a container that can recognize what was being dropped into it (like content and content-type) without it even being an explicitly declared draggable? I've been playing with jQuery, but can't figure it out. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Regards, David
