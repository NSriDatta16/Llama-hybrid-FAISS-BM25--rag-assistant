Don't try and model your domain entities as resources. Model your views/use cases as resources. There is absolutely nothing wrong with building resources for specific clients. REST encourages serendipitous re-use, i.e. unexpected re-use, it does not suggest you try and build resources that will work for every possible scenario. RESTful frameworks should make resources really cheap and quick to create. If you need five different resources to model all the ways a customer is accessed, then that's fine. In general I prefer to go with coarse grained resources, just because that is what HTTP is optimized for.
