As Norbert says, I think the answer is in /etc/shells. Mine has this: # List of acceptable shells for chpass(1). # Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using # one of these shells. /bin/bash /bin/csh /bin/ksh /bin/sh /bin/tcsh /bin/zsh Add /opt/local/bin/zsh to that list, and you should be fine. You should then be able to change the shell (individually for each user) using chsh .
