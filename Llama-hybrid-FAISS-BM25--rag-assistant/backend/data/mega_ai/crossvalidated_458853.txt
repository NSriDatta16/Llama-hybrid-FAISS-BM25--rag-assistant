I don't think the previous answers really capture the key difference, although it is implicit in the discussion of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (which is a social sciences term rather than a statistical term). If you use a multinomial model then your predictions for the different options sum to 1; If you use n different logistic regression models they won't. The multinomial model is to be preferred when there is a fixed set of classes, and they are mutually exclusive. So for instance in case: "For each person predict the probability that some mobile phone company is the favourite one (lets assume every one have favourite mobile phone company). Which of those methods would You use and what are the advantages over the second one?" If you believe there is a fixed unchanging set of phone companies, then multinomial regression would be appropriate. If instead you are eg predicting top 3 (which are fixed), but there is also a tail of smaller companies you don't model, then I would suggest 1 vs rest for top 3 companies is appropriate (because top 3 doesn't cover 100% of respondents)
