Max Kuhn covers this well in Ch16 of Applied Predictive Modeling . As mentioned in the linked thread, imbalanced data is essentially a cost sensitive training problem. Thus any cost sensitive approach is applicable to imbalanced data. There are a large number of such approaches. Not all implemented in R: C50, weighted SVMs are options. Jous-boost. Rusboost I think is only available as Matlab code. I don't use Weka, but believe it has a large number of cost sensitive classifiers.
