SIFT feature matching through Euclidean distance

SIFT feature matching is done through a Euclidean-distance based nearest neighbor approach. Can some please explain this? Is there a calculation? If then can someone help me to calculate the Euclidean distance for my SIFT feature vector? I want to save calculated Euclidean distances to feed for neural network with some more features like roundness and color of images.
