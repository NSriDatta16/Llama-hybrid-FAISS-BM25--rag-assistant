How is this function (for updating a Stochastic Gradient Descent model) called without a parameter?

I'm in the middle of a Deep Learning Course offered by DataCamp and the example below was given for optimizing a SGD model: As you can see, the function "get_new_model" requires one parameter: "input_shape". However, in line 9 there is no parameter given. Why doesn't this throw an error?
