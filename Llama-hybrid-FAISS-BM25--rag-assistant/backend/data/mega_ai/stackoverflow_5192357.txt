The Titanium Mobile SDK leverages over 5,000 device and mobile operating system APIs to create native applications that perform and behave just like they were written in objective-c (iPhone and iPad) or java (Android phone and tablets) native apps that deliver user-optimized experiences. In addition, you can reach billions of other devices by deploying to the mobile web or create rich hybrid applications that leverage the best of both worlds â€¦ all from a single code base. Whether there are updates to the operating systems or updates to your applications, make sure they're built quickly, tested, and deployed to keep your users interested and engaged.
