SharePoint 2010 and 2007 are both built on top of the .NET Framework, and have a rich object model, so you can build quite complex applications on top of it. You have to work within the constrains on building on top of the SharePoint platform of course, and there are headaches and scale limitations that come from this, but beyond that you aren't very limited in what kind of business application you create on top. I have implemented reengineered business processes on top of the platform, with complex workflows that route tasks to different people based on complex business logic. My team has created entire business applications on top of SharePoint instead of doing it completely custom, in order to leverage the CRUD and security functionality already in there. At the end of the day, it did everything we needed, despite the box we had to operate in being it was not fully custom on top of just a framework like .NET or J2EE.
