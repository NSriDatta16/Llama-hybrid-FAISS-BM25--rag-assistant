With C/C++ you can use OpenMP . It's C code with pragmas like #pragma omp parallel for for(..) { ... } to say that this for will run in parallel. This is one easy way to parallelize something, but at some time you will have to understand how parallel programs execute and will be exposed to parallel programming bugs.
