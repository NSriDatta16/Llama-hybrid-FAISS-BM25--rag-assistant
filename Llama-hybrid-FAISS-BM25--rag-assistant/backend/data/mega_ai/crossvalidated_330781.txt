Your advisor is mistaken. Logistic regression is not suited for real-value prediction; it is suited for dichotomous 0/1, true/false, etc prediction. While you could reformulate the problem to a binary problem (sales increasing/decreasing) there's no good reason to do so. Even a cursory glance at the Wikipedia page for logistic regression will convince your advisor otherwise.
