The old server probably had output buffering enabled by default. This meant that it wouldn't echo right away, but rather wait until the whole script has finished, and then echo . This also means that the header would be sent before the echo (since it was buffered), and therefore would not result in a warning. On the new server, you most likely do not have output buffering enabled by default, and this would mean that it would echo straight away, without buffering it, and therefore it would be sent before the headers and result in a warning. I would encourage you to use headers_sent() to check if the headers has been sent before using headers() after echo , like this: Related links: Output Control Runtime configuration for Output Control - how to enable output control in your php.ini file ob_start() function for manually enabling output buffering anywhere in your script. header_sent()
