This is a good thought, but the problem arises when you have important covariate imbalances that are not displayed by this method. Consider two variables on the same scale that have different effects on the outcome and the same effect on the treatment probability. If they are imbalanced with the same magnitude in the matched set, the marginal propensity score mean is .5, but you would expect to see bias in the effect estimate. Consider the following example: > x1 = rnorm(n) > x2 = rnorm(n) > z = as.numeric(x1 + x2 > rnorm(n)) > tapply(x1, z, mean) 0 1 -0.4991431 0.4709013 > tapply(x2, z, mean) 0 1 -0.4262566 0.4316203 > ps = glm(z ~ x1 + x2, family = binomial(link = 'probit'))$fitted > mean(ps) [1] 0.4990706 The average propensity score ( ps ) is .5 in this data set, and yet there are large imbalances in the covariates. If there was not perfect bias cancellation (i.e., if the variables affected the outcome differently), you would still see bias in the effect estimate. It may be that a mean propensity score of .5 is necessary for balance, but it's definitely not sufficient. Either way, it always makes sense to assess balance on the covariates directly.
