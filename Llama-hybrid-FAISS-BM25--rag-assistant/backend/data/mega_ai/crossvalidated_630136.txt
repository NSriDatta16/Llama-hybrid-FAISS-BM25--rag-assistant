Strange interpretation of odds ratio from logistic regression

I am involved in writing a manuscript applying logistic regression to estimate rates of seafood mislabelling. The model (fitted using glm() with the default logit link) employs source (grocery store, restaurant, or sushi bar), state (modified or plain), appearance (cooked or raw), form (chopped, chunk, fillet, or whole) and colour (light or red) to predict whether samples are mislabelled (1) or correctly labelled (0). Baseline reference levels are alphabetical as above. Here are the odds ratios derived from exponentiating the log odds given in the summary() output based on converting the above categories to factors via as.factor() : (Intercept) Source State Appearance Form Colour 1.1518858 0.9112306 0.2528131 3.5247487 1.5654099 0.1954747 Consider the Source variable. My colleague writes "Source is associated with an 8.888% decrease in the odds of mislabelling compared to a grocery store sample." The 8.88% comes from 1 - 0.9112306 = 0.0887614. I see what the author is doing since comparison is being made to a base odds of 1. However, the interpretation as absolute percentage difference seems off. Thoughts on this?
