Tensor Factorization would not work for text generation as a stand-alone technique. There is no way for the decomposition to model long-term dependencies in language. Without modeling long-term language dependencies, its results would be similar to low-order Markov chains. Tensor Factorization could be used as another signal in a larger natural language generation system, for example improving word-embeddings .
