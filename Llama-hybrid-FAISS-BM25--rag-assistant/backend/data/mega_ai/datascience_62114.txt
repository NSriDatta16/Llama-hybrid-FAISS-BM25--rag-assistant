Convolutional neural networks for non image dataset

Can we use Convolutional Neural networks for a non image dataset for prediction? The dataset is a record of student academic details I know that CNN is mostly used in computer vision and image processing for analyzing visual imagery. And it is also used in natural language processing for text classification. I am new to this please guide me through Thank you!!
