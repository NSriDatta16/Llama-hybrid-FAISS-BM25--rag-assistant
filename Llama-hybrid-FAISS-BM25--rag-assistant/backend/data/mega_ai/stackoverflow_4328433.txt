Azure + Windows phone 7

I am planning on a photo app, and want to know how I could upload/ download images from windows phone 7 to the blob storage as well as access the table storage. I don't mind placing the access key on the application, since the app is planned to be distributed internally only. Since the Azure API is not available can somebody tell me how I can do the same ?
