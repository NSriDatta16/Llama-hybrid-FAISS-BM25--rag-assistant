My BDD practices involve using Cucumber. I try my hardest to keep it to what the user sees. That is, any When and Then statements should reflect user input or user visuals. In your case I would make sure that a success message appears afterwards, and then I would (if possible) look for data on the screen indicating the application is aware of the object. For instance, if you added a comment to a blog post you should fill in the post, hit the 'accept' button, see a 'Message Posted' success message, and then also see your content on the page as a new post. You should back up your user-driven BDD tests with unit and sometimes controller tests to make sure everything behind-the-scenes is functioning correctly as well. I tend to use RSpec and verify that things get added to the database, methods are returning expected results etc. But I also use Cucumber to make sure the user sees what the user is expecting to see (But I don't really let cucumber care about what's in the DB). I hope this helps. If you aren't using cucumber yet I highly recommend it for BDD testing in conjunction with RSpec. You should check out the book (comes in electronic PDF form) - I started with that and it helped a ton with my testing practices: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book
