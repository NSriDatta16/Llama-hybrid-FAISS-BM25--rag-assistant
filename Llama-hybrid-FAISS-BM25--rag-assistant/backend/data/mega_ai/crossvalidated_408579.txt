The independence between two binary variables can be studied statistically using Fisher's exact test , alternatively, it's common to use the chi-square test for independence . Note that regression analysis is a different type of approach. There are several types of regression, to name two: linear regression deals with continuous variables (that is not the case here); and logistic regression deals with a dichotomous dependent variable (like here) but it is more complex than doing a Fisher test or a qui-square test. Your equation is the probabilistic way of studying exactly if there is independence. In a $2\times2$ table, you may check for independence by checking if $$ P(tr=1, pt=1) = P(tr=1) P(pt=1) $$ where $tr$ stands for training and $pt$ stands for part-time. However, this approach is different from statistical hypothesis testing that deals with sample data. The way your question is worded leads me to think that statistical testing is the correct approach in this case.
