Well, first of all I'd like to ask why are you doing this? Is it because of the storage or load or perhaps failover? In case it's storage, why are you sending the file to the second server via HTTP? I guess a simple SSH file transfer would be just fine ( scp ). In case it's failover you'll be better off with rsync . If using your own second server is not mandatory you might as well go with a CDN service.
