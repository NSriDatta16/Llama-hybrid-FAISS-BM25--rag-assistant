What is a log-odds distribution?

I am reading a textbook on machine learning (Data Mining by Witten, et al., 2011) and came across this passage: ... Moreover, different distributions can be used. Although the normal distribution is usually a good choice for numeric attributes, it is not suitable for attributes that have a predetermined minimum but no upper bound; in this case a "log-normal" distribution is more appropriate. Numeric attributes that are bounded above and below can be modeled by a "log-odds" distribution. I have never heard of this distribution. I googled for "log-odds distribution" but could not find any relevant exact match. Can someone help me out? What is this distribution, and why does it help with numbers bounded above and below? P.S. I am a software engineer, not a statistician.
