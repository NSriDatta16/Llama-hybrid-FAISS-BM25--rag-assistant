Average of a Sum in Mysql query

I am having some problems creating a query that gives me the average of a sum. I read a few examples here in stackoverflow and couldn't do it. Can anyone help me to understand how to do this please? This is the data I have: Transaction_x0020_Number Product_x0020_Code Sales_x0020_Value Date Cashier 000356 350 24.99 2010-06-04 131 000356 726 32.99 2010-06-04 131 000357 350 24.99 2010-06-04 131 000358 350 24.99 2010-06-04 131 000358 360 24.99 2010-06-04 131 000770 703 69.99 2010-06-04 130 000771 726 32.99 2010-06-04 130 000772 1126 5 2010-06-04 130 000773 482 32.99 2010-06-04 130 000774 600 32.99 2010-06-04 130 000775 350 24.99 2010-06-04 130 Basically I need the average transaction value by cashier. I can't run a basic avg because it will take all rows but each transaction can have multiple rows. At the end I want to have: Cashier| Average| 131 | 44.31 |(Which comes from the sum divided by 3 transactions not 5 rows) 130 | 33.15 | etc. This is the query I have to SUM the transactions but don't know how or where to include the AVG function. SELECT `products`.`Transaction_x0020_Number`, Sum(`products`.`Sales_x0020_Value`) AS `SUM of Sales_x0020_Value`, `products`.`Cashier` FROM `products` GROUP BY `products`.`Transaction_x0020_Number`, `products`.`Date`, `products`.`Cashier` HAVING (`products`.`Date` ={d'2010-06-04'}) Any help is appreciated.
