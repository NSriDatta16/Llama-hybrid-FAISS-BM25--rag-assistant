Well, since you're tying into an array, I'd just check $lines[$i] and $lines[$i+1] (as long as the +1 address exists, that is), and if the former matches TITLE and the latter PERFORMER, swap them. Unless perhaps you need to transpose these even if they're not consecutive?? Here's an option (this snippet would go inside your for loop, perhaps above the REM-checking line) if you know they'll be consecutive: if ($i Another option (which would work regardless of consecutiveness, and is arguably more elegant) would be to use List::MoreUtils qw(first_index); (up at the top, with your other use statements) and then do (inside &c , but outside the for loop): my $title_idx = first_index { /^TITLE.*?"$/ } @lines; my $performer_idx = first_index { /^PERFORMER.*?"$/ } @lines; if($title_idx >= 0 and $performer_idx >= 0 and $title_idx Is that what you're after?
