Yes, you should split the paragraph to sentences and give those sentences to the model. Your deep structure should be like this: In the first layer, you must put a word embedding layer to represent a sentence as a sequence of vectors. In the second layer, you must put LSTM to be able to model your sequence vector as a single vector. Now, you can add successive layers with linear, relu or sigmoid activation functions to make your model deeper. In the last layer, you must use sigmoid activation function to do binary classification.
