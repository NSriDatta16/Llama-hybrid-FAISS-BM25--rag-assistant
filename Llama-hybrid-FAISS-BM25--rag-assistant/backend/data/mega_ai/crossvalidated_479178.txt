There are various ways a negative binomial distribution can come about. One of them, as Robert Long comments , is as a Poisson distribution whose parameter is itself Gamma distributed. The Wikipedia page gives the derivation of this result. So this covers parts (i) and (ii) of your model. This is an example of compound-distributions , which are often also called "mixtures" (e.g. a "Poisson-Gamma mixture" in the present case). This can be confusing, since a "mixture" has at least one related but distinct meaning in statistics.
