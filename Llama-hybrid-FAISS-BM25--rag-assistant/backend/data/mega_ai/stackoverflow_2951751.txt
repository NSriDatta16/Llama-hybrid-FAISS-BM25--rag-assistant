Another option would be to develop an Excel plug-in using VSTO. The difficult part of this architecture would be that you have to implement your own IPC between the source application and the plug in. However, I'd choose this over IDataObject (DDE Emulation) based on prior experience with DDE. The advantage of the IDataObject approach is that a typical old school Excel power user will be comfortable with it; and it doesn't require any plug-ins to function. If the act of dragging the control and dropping onto Excel is an important part of the scenario, then it's probably worth implementing a COM server. However, if your client isn't familiar with DDE and just wants to have Excel updated dynamically, that's probably not worth the effort.
