Alternatives to classification trees, with better predictive (e.g: CV) performance?

I am looking for an alternative to Classification Trees which might yield better predictive power. The data I am dealing with has factors for both the explanatory and the explained variables. I remember coming across random forests and neural networks in this context, although never tried them before, are there another good candidate for such a modeling task (in R, obviously)?
