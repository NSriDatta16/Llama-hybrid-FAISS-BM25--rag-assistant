How to embed one nib into another?

There are many view that share a common part in my current project so I just visualize a way to encapsulate the common part into a nib file that could be shared by many controllers by embedding it to their corresponding nib file. Although I know how to do it programmatically, I still believe there should be a way to achieve this simply in Interface Builder. Are there anyone who has achieved this and would you like to point the way out?
