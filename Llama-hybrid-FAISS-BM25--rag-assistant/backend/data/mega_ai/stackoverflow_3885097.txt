I think this page should help: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html 1.5 doesn't do scaling because all devices at the time of 1.5 launch were mdpi. For 1.6 and above Android decides which res directory to pull from based on a runtime determination of the screen's dpi and then scales assets appropriately. So if you put your 100x100 bitmap in res/drawable and then run your app on an hdpi device, Android will first look for the bitmap in res/drawable-hdpi, when it doesn't find it Android will scale up the resource you have in res/drawable.
