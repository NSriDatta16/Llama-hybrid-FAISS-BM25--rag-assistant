Balancing sets of values

So I'm working on a fun little program and ran across this rather interesting problem: I have several sets of values of pre-defined set sizes. These are all a unique subset of a larger pool of values. The averages of each subset of numbers should be as close to each other as reasonably possible. This does not need to be perfect, but should be close enough that all sets are "balanced" against each other. ex: {1,2,3,6,9,10,15,23,27} global mean: 10.66 needs to be sorted into 2 sets of 2 and one set of 5 acceptable result: {1,27}{2,23}{3,6,9,10} In practice, the values will range between 60 and 200, and the sets will range from size 6 to 20. I've tried a couple different algorithms, with various degrees of success, but I was interested in seeing what the good people at StackOverflow think. My best, Zach
