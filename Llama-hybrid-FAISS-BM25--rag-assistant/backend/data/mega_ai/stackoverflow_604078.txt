Looking for a Good Reference on Neural Networks

Duplicate What are some good resources for learning about Artificial Neural Networks? I'm looking for a good (beginner level) reference book (or website) on different types of Neural Nets/their applications/examples. I don't have any particular application in mind, I'm just curious as to how I can make use of them. I'm specifically interested in using them with Python, but any language, or even just theory would do fine.
