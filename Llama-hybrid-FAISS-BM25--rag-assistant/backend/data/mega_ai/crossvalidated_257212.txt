If you compute the ratio before you average out, you have an infinite value which prevents you from getting mean, standard deviation or confidence interval. You could drop the one case but there really is no justification for that. Also, there is no particular reason to believe that the ratio has a normal distribution. You could sum the numerator and sum the denominator and then take the ratio. If you take that approach, you could bootstrap to get estimates of the mean and standard deviation, and construct a confidence interval for the sample mean using say Efron's percentile method. No need to assume normality or use the standard deviation (standard error of the mean) to get the confidence interval.
