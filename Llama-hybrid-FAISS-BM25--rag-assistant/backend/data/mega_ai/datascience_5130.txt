I would start off with All Of Statistics by Larry Wasserman . This quickly gets you upto speed with statistics assuming you have some mathematical background. I think all it needs is introductory calculus and linear algebra. R is pretty straightforward to pick up and there are a number of resources you can use. The R Programming course on coursera is an excellent short course to get you familiarized with R. Besides that there are a number of books and tutorials on the subject. I would recommend you start working through All of Statistics and start playing around in R along with that book. If you are at a SaaS company, there are a number of data sciency roles and responsibilities that should be available. Most SaaS companies will have analytical tools to provide basic insight. Once you start learning statistics and data science, you will be able to identify the gaps in the pre baked tools and ways to improve them. I would also read The Field Guide to Data Science , it's a short book that will give you a high level idea of data science and its utility.
