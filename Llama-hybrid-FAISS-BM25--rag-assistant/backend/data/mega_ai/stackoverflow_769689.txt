Reboot between each benchmark run? Honestly, I think the best approach would be just to load up a table with lots of clob/blob data. Ie, perhaps a fake table like this 'create table testtable (id integer primary key, testdata blob);'. Once you've loaded it up with a few gigs of test data (sequentially increasing ids), have your program query randomly (using Math.random) and use that for your comparison. That should eliminate most caching related variations, and give you a good picture of whether there really is a significant different in performance between the various blob retrieval methods.
