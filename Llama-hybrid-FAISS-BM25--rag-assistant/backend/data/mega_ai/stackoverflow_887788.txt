The use of include files in ASP.NET has generally been superseded by user controls which are much more powerful. Here's another alternative to using include files: ASPX: Code behind: private string GetFrameContent(int arg) { string filename = (arg == 1) ? "LeftFrame.htm" : "LeftFrameOthers.htm"; string path = Server.MapPath("./" + filename); string content = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(path); return content; } // Populate Literal FrameLiteral.Text = GetFrameContent(arg); Not as elegant as doing it with user controls, but it should do the job and is relatively neat and tidy.
