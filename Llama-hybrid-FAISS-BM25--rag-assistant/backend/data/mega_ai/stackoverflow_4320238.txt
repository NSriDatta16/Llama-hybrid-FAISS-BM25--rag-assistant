iphone - how do I create a bundle and put files on it at run time

My app generates 3 files every time the user saves a project. I would like to be able to build a bundle at run time, and save all files to that bundle and save it to the app's directory. So if the user wants to move the project to the desktop its just the matter of dragging one bundle (= a directory that looks like a file, like the Mac OS X apps and Pages files)... I googled around and found nothing. How do I do that at run time? thanks.
