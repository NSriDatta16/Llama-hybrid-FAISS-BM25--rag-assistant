A simple way to proceed with issue (1) in a survival model is to include the actual year of T0 as a covariate in the model, ideally fit flexibly with a spline. Issue (2) of right censoring is inherently incorporated into a survival model. Yes, you might have more uncensored data at longer times for patients with earlier T0 years, but that's OK. Mostly, that just means that estimates of baseline hazards at long times after T0 won't be as precise as those at early times. But with a standard Cox proportional hazards model, the precision of coefficient estimates has mostly to do with the total number of events, not their distribution in time. (Actual time isn't explicitly included in a Cox model, except for the ordering of events in time.) Patient characteristics (issue 3) are readily incorporated into a survival model. You could include interactions of patient characteristics with the T0 year in the model, if you think that the association of a patient characteristic with outcome changed over calendar time. Having "the independent variable [interact] time after T0 with the patient characteristic I am interested in" sounds like having a time-varying regression coefficient for that patient characteristic in a survival model. See the R time dependence vignette . That might ultimately be necessary, but it's not usually the way to start. The initial assumption is typically that a covariate has a particular association with the extra hazard of an event that is constant over time, even as the baseline hazard might change over time. Your proposed set of logistic regressions year by year is a type of discrete-time survival model. If you have survival values in continuous time, a standard survival model is typically more informative as it keeps more detail about individual survival times.
