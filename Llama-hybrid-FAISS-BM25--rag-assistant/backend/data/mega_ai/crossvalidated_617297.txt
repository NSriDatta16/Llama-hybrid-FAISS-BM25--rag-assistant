The $p(x|y)$ in Bayes' theorem is the likelihood function , whereas the MLE is the maximum of this function, which is a point . The likelihood function is not unique for Bayesian methods, it is also used in classical statistics. (Answer for 1.) I don't have a good answer for part 2). But I would like to point out some pitfalls: The likelihood function is not a probability distribution, despite its appearance, as it is (almost never) normalized to 1. To make things worse, the notation for $p(x|y)$ stems from mathematical logic, where the $x$ is investigated under the assumption -the vertical bar- that $y$ remains fixed. However, the MLE maximizes $p(x|y)$ as a function of $y$ , while keeping the $x$ fixed. So the notation for $p(x|y)$ is counterintuitive.
