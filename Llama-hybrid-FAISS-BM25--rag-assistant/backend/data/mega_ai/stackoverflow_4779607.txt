HTML5 : Performance implications of drawImage()

I was wondering if there were any performance differences in using drawImage() on a dynamically created canvas (i.e. document.createElement("canvas")) versus a canvas already created in the DOM (i.e. tags on a HTML page). My thinking is that the "slow" part of drawImage() occurs when it actually has to display visuals to the user, though I could be wrong (can't find too much information on this). Would it be substantially more expensive to draw a group of objects to a canvas in memory followed by a final draw to the "main" canvas than just drawing straight to the latter? I feel like it'd be better to have multiple canvases, at least for organizational purposes. Related: Does the size of the canvas impact performance if you're only drawing to a subsection of it?
