Yikes that hurts my eyes. Here are a few tips. 0 - Write code for humans to read. The most important lesson to learn is that code is for humans to read not computers. 1 - Code style. Pay attention to the curly brackets. As a general rule a { should cause all code between the { and the accompanying } to be indented. 4 spaces is a reasonable amount to indent. This makes the intent of your code easier to determine and therefore easier to spot mistakes. 2 - Validate all input. Never trust anything the user submits. In your sql statements you have the following: $sql = "UPDATE users SET posts=posts+1,tposts=tposts+1,points=points+25,tpoints=tpoints+25 WHERE `users`.`friendid`='$friend'";` The problem is the $friend variable. I presume this is being based on user input. The user could enter something nasty like 2; DELETE * FROM * (ok, that SQL may not be correct, but you get the idea). Validate all input and always use SQL parameters. 3 - Use functions. Functions should be used to reduce code duplication. Reducing the number of statements in your code, reduces the potential for errors. Functions should be used to indicate the intent of the code. For example if you have a complicated expression for an if statement you could move the expression to a separate function. For example if (isDateInRange($date, $range)) {} Finally, spend time reflecting on your code. Ask yourself 'is the intent of the code clear?', 'is there a better way to do that?'. Make sure you understand every single line of your code. The temptation when you're starting out is to have the attitude 'hooray, it works! Let's move on'. Resist this temptation, it will not serve you well in the long run.
