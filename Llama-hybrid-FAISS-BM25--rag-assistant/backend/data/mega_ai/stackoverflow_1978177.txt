It depends on so many things. How many users do you think you will you have? What sort of content will they be allowed to upload? What quotas will you give your users? But without knowing any of these, I'll just guess: no, 10 GB is not going to be enough for a site like Facebook. You would need terabytes of storage if your site became popular. The high resolution photos of people's cats alone would fill your 10G.
