How to force a marker drag in Google Maps JavaScript API (V3)?

When adding a marker to a google v3 map, I want to automatically begin dragging it. The click event that adds the marker is already on the canvas, and so I want the same click event that adds the marker to also act as a drag start. Very similar to how it's done when adding markers to a Google MyMaps map (though I'm pretty sure that still uses V2). Is this possible, or do I have to add the marker, then make it follow the mouse around until the user clicks again, then drop?
