Prototype parameter names

In my header, I have a prototype declaration like this: void move(int, int); I can omit the parameter names, that's how I'm used to it from C. I do that so that I don't have to keep the parameter names in sync - it's extremely confusing if they differ between prototype and implementation. Right now, I'm documenting all of my code with Doxygen, and I decided to put all comments into the header. Now I have to refer to parameter names that are defined in the implementation but not in the header: I find that confusing. /** * Moves the entity to the specified point. * @param x The x coordinate of the new position. * @param y The y coordinate of the new position. */ void move(int, int); In the generated Doxygen HTML, it is not easy to figure out which parameter is which. Of course, one could follow the same order here, but if one has many parameters, it is still confusing. The alternative would be to duplicate parameter names and try to keep them in sync. However, some people don't encourage this approach, saying that header parameters should start with a double underscore so that the user of a method can not possibly use the same name (names starting with __ are disallowed in C++). How do you do it?
