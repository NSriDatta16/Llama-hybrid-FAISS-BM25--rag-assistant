Confidence interval scoring

Question migrated form https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10019576/confidence-interval-scoring-with-programming-languages#comment12812602_10019576 I used a CI scoring algorithm from http://evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html , The data is most liked and disliked programming languages of each person. According to the scores it should seem that Python should have a relative higher score, but according to the score data it is in the middle. Am I doing something wrong? Joel Cornett mentioned You need to use Student's T curve, not the normal distribution for smaller sample sizes. Is there a way to fix this? Here is my gist https://gist.github.com/2305834 , which contains the data , scores and the script that generates the scores.
