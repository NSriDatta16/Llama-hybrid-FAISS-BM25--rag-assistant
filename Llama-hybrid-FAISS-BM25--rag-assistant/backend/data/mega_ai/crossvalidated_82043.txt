Asymptotic distribution of Kernel density estimator

For my research I am looking for proof of the asymptotic distribution of the univariate Kernel density estimator as proposed by Rosenblatt 1956 and Parzen 1962. A proof is for example given here and is also included in Nonparametric Econometrics by Pagan and Ullah. But since I am not writing about an economics topic I would like to cite a more "original" source. Does somebody know the paper in which the proof occurred first? Or an more basic math book would also be helpful.
