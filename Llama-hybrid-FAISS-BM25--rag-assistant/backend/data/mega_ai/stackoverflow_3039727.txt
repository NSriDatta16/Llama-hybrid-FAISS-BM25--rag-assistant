Your JBOval views would each be responsible for drawing themselves (basically drawing an oval path and filling it, within their bounds), but JBDrawingView would be responsible for mousing and dragging (and thereby sizing and positioning the JBOvals , which would be its subviews). The drawingView would do no drawing itself. So far as archiving, you could either have a model class to represent each oval (such as its bounding rectangle, or any other dimensions you choose to represent each oval with). You could archive and unarchive these models to recreate your views. Finally, I use the JB prefix too, so â€¦ :P at you.
