Julia's first target use cases are numerical problems. Basically, you can break these analysis and computational science fields into data science (data driven) and simulation science (model driven). Julia is dealing with the simulation science use cases first. They are also dealing with the data science cases, but more slowly. R will never be very useful for simulation science, but Julia will be very useful for both in a couple of years.
