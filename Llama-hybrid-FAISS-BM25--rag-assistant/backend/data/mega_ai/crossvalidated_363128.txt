Book Bayesian statistics

I write here to ask for a suggestion about a graduate level Bayesian statistics book. I have a bachelor degree in statistics but despite having a fairly solid background on frequentist and non parametric statistics, I do not know much about Bayesian statistics. In particular I am undecided between these two books: Doing Bayesian Data Analysis http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/DoingBayesianDataAnalysis/ Statistical Rethinking https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-Stan/McElreath/p/book/9781482253443 Which one is right for me? I know R very well, so the presence of examples on R is an added value.
