The "when the likelihood function is tractable" is somewhat self-defeating, as the reason for using ABC is that it is intractable. As for the likelihood principle, ABC is definitely not respecting it, since it requires a simulation of the data from its sampling distribution. It thus uses the frequentist properties of that distribution rather than the likelihood itself. Except in the (unrealistic) limiting case when the tolerance is exactly zero and the distance is based on the sufficient statistic, the ABC thus fails to agree with the likelihood principle. In my humble opinion, this is a minor issue when compared with the major problems faced by ABC, unless you can provide an example with dire (There are also exact Bayesian approaches that do not agree with the likelihood principle, witness the Jeffreys or matching priors .)
