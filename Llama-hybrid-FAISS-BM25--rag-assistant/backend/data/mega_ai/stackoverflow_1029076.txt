I've tried looking into this a couple of times the last couple of years, it seems like such a trivial thing (It was for the AmigaDos workbench), but programming for the Windows shell is ugly; actually programming anything in the Windows API is ugly. Its a horrible mess. Be prepared for a bunch of hair pulling and heart ache. Not to discourage you, but MicroSoft thinks it knows best when it comes to icon placement in folder views and I have found little in a way to implement 'permanent' icon placement (I.e. Icon view is far from permanent). The MSDN docs offer little help in this regard (at least no examples). The last thing I looked into was writing a shell extension to record and restore icon position (I wouldn't record these in the registry, I was just going to store positions in the folder's desktop.ini file, but it would probably be better to create a file in the user's private settings folder). Code Project has a number of articles on shell programming and extensions. http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/ http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/shlext.aspx I ended up writing my own little shell in nice clean pure C++ that does exactly what I want in the context of my application.
