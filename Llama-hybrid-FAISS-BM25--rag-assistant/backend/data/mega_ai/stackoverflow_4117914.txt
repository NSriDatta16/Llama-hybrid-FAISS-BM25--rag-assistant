the average of optical flow

I want to find the average of the optical flow, I could extract the features from the first frame and found their location in the next frame. Now, I want to find the average of the displacement in order to translate the image back to its stationary background in order to stabilize the image. // here I take the optical flow cvCalcOpticalFlowPyrLK(frame1_1C, frame2_1C, pyramid1, pyramid2, frame1_features, frame2_features, corner_count, optical_flow_window, 5, optical_flow_found_feature, NULL, optical_flow_termination_criteria, NULL); // here the features that I extract them for( int i=0; i Now I want to take the average for them, and if you want me to show you more of the code I'm ready to do that. The corner_count is the number of the features.
