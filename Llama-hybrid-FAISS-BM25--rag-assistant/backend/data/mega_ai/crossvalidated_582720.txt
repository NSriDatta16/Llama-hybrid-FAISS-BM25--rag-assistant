Is cosine similarity enough to measure word embedding similarity?

Is cosine similarity a good metric to measure word embedding similarity? Suppose that we have two vectors of word embedding in same direction but with different length( first one with len=1 and second with len=10). Almost in articles, the cosine similarity has been calculated, but how we can interpret this above mentioned situation? They are far from each other but in same direction.
