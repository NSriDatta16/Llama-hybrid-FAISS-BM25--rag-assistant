How do I measure the time series forecasting accuracy?

I have my data for 10 years and I used ARIMA model to forecast data for 30 years. Now, I want to measure the forecasting accuracy for the next 30 years. How do I calculate each one of MAD, SMAPE, MAPE and etc....? Each one of these formulas needs actual and forecast data. How could I do with 30 years forecast, where there is no actual data?
