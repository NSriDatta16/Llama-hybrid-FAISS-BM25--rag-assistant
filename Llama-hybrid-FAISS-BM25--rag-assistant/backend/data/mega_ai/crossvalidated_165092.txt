If your distance function is squared Euclidean, then you can exploit additivity and Konig-Huygens. Variance is equivalent to the average pairwise squared deviation. Similarly, the squared deviation from the center of another cluster should be the average squared deviation (but not the squared average) to the cluster members. The same trick will not work with other distances.
