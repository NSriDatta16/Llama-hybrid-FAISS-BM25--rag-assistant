C-statistic and measuring the contextual effect in multilevel logistic regression

I have a two-level logistic regression model where the outcome is "InfectedqPCR" (Plasmodium-infected as determined by qPCR) at the individual level. I have a range of individual- and household-level variables. Household is the grouping structure. I have been reading Austin and Merlo's (2017) "Intermediate and advanced topics in multilevel logistic regression analysis" Tutorial in Biostatistics - Statistics in Medicine - about using the c-statistic as a measure of the magnitude of the general contextual effect. Following their methods, I am trying to interpret the c-statistic output from the following three models: model1 So, from this, I interpret that the change in the c-statistic from model1 with only fixed effects and no random effect structure to Mod_MAd_Indi, which includes the random effect structure, is 0.17. In the Austin and Merlo paper, their example has a change in the c-statistic of 0.004, which indicates a "weak general contextual effect". Question 1: So, if 0.004 is weak, what can I say if my contextual effect is 0.17? Is this a moderate contextual effect or a strong effect? Are there any guidelines or references for this? Question 2: The Austin and Merlo paper also emphasises that "the addition of cluster characteristics to the model that contains cluster-specific random effects cannot increase the c-statistic of the model containing only the cluster-specific random effects." So, is this 0.17 change in the c-statistic the maximum possible change - what Austin and Merlo refer to as "a ceiling"? Is this why my addition of the household variables (Mod_MAd_Comb_Vil) resulted in a lower c-statistic? It could have been the same or lower, but definitely not higher - is that what Austin and Merlo are meaning? This is an addition following on from the helpful input of Eric Ruzek in the comments below: In a further series of models, I have a C-statistic that has increased, only at the second decimal place, but nevertheless, it has increased after including household-level variables in the model. In the individual (and random effects) model, it is 0.880 In the household and individual (and random effects) model, it is 0.892. This seems to go against all statistical intuition, but might the following explain this? The individual model is as follows: Mod_Indi_Child_0.05_Apriori The combined model is as follows: Mod_Comb_Child_Apriori The difference between the two models is the addition of the "Household-level" factor (Number of persons in the house count) in the combined model. Could the reason why this model has a higher C-statistic than the individual-only model be because this "household level" level factor actually contains information at the individual level as well? By that, I mean because the variable is "Numeber of persons living in the house", the individual is part of that house count, so the model is treating at least part of that "house count" as an individual-level variable, hence the rise in the C-statistic. Is this a possible explanation for the unusual result I have, or am clutching at straws?
