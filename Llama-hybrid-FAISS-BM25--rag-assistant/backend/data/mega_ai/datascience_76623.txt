Rolling average: when is it possible to consider it?

I would like to know if I can consider rolling average to predict the future trend of sells. I collected data from January 2020 to March 2020, day by day, on sells in a shop and I would like to run some analysis. I was considering rolling average on multiple periods (5 - 10 days). Do you think it might make sense?
