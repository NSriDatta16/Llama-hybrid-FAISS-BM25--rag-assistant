If you can do your work in a vertex/geometry shader, you can use transform feedback to write directly into a buffer object. This also has the option of skip the rasterizer and fragment shading. Transform feedback is available as EXT_transform_feedback or core version since GL 3.0 (and the ARB equivalent).
