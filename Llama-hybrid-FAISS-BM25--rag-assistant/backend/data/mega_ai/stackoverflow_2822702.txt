Is there any way to prevent a Delphi application from using Virtual Storage on Vista/Win 7 without enabling Runtime Themes?

The question pretty much says it all. I have an app with an older component that doesn't work right if runtime themes are enabled. But if I don't enable them, the app always ends up messing with the virtual store. Thanks! Update: Using Mark's solution below, the application no longer writes to the Virtual Store. But, now it won't access a tdb file (Tiny Database file) that it needs. This tdb file is the same file that was being written to the Virtual store. Any ideas on how I can give it access to the tdb file and still prevent writing the Virtual Store?
