"Average" standard errors of multiple samples

let's assume that I have 3 subjects with each of them producing 5 values. Now, I can calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, and standard error for each subject. Each subject has its own mean value. However, how can I combine the VAR, SD, and SE, if I want to say what the average variance, average standard deviation and average standard error for an "average" subject is while neglecting that they have all different mean values? Example: Subject 1 produces the values {79,75,77,80,74} thus with the mean=77.0, VAR=5.2, SD=2.28, SE=1.02 Subject 2 produces the values {83,79,81,84,84} thus with the mean=82.2, VAR=3.8, SD=1.94, SE=0.87 Subject 3 produces the values {81,76,80,77,79} thus with the mean=78.6, VAR=3.4, SD=1.85, SE=0.83 Thank you for your help! Edit: What I need is the standard deviation and standard error which can be expected within one random single subject. I certainly do not want to compare the subjects against each other but simply say how data within one subject will usually vary. I have seen different approaches: I could calculate the SD and SE for every subject separately and then determine the mean values of the SDs and SEs. In another thread, a different approach is used: The mean variance among all subjects is calculated with the average SD being deduced from the mean variance. Cf. How to 'sum' a standard deviation? Both lead to similar but different results and the answer in the other thread is disputed. And it also does not answer how I deduce the average SE then. Is there a >correct
