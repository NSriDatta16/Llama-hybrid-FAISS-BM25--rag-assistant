If you want to minimize the sum of the squares of the distances (not the sum of the distances), then the point that minimizes that sum is the average of the points in X. Proof: sum(squares of distances) = (x-x0)^2 + (y-y0)^2 + (x-x1)^2 + (y-y1)^2 + ... d/dx sum(squares of distances) = 2(x-x0) + 2(x-x1) + ... = 2(Nx - x0 - x1 - ...) the sum is minimized when the derivative is zero, which occurs when Nx = x0+x1+... , so x = (x0+x1+...)/N The derivative is symmetric around this point, and the function is quadratic, so I'm pretty sure the closest point in Y to this average point is the best. Minimizing the distances is harder, but I suspect the same algorithm, with more leeway in the set of Ys that you test, would work also.
