iPhone Objective-C memory leak issue

Im having a bit of an issue where i create an array of button objects and place them onto a view, something like for(int i=0;i However if i release them straight after i add them to the view, they break when the user taps on them naturally. My question is where would be the best place to release them? The list is repopulated periodically so currently im keeping a reference to the objects and when i got to repopulate i release them there by iterating through the view like for(_object *obj in self.view) { [obj removeFromSuperview]; [obj release]; } Is there a more elegant way to do this?
