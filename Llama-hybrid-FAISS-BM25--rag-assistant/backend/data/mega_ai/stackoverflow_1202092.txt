You need to add the view from each external nib to the main xib and then connect the view outlet to the correct view. For example, if you have the tab bar in MainMenu.xib and an external xib named ViewOne.xib then open both of them, drag Custom View (or whatever it's called) from the ViewOne.xib window to the MainMenu.xib window. Then connect the view outlet of the tab for that view to Custom View. You should probably rename Custom View once you copy it to MainMenu.xib so that can tell it apart from the other views you will have to add to MainMenu.xib.
