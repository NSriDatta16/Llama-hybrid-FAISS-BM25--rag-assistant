How to decrease the perceived loading time of Java Swing forms?

In my Swing application I have the problem that when creating a new instance of a Swing form for the first time, it takes several hundreds of milliseconds. That's not really long but the subjective impression of getting slowed down is really annoying. It happens with all forms, even a JOptionPane message or other trivial forms. (Of course larger forms need longer because of the more complex constructor) Now I noticed that the second time creating a new form instance is significantly faster . Since the initial startup time doesn't matter, I'm planning to create invisible instances of all important forms at startup, but that looks like a dirty hack to me. (And I'm not sure it'll even work) My questions: Is there a more elegant way to speed up the creation and display of forms? What happens the first time a form is shown, that doesn't happen the second time?
