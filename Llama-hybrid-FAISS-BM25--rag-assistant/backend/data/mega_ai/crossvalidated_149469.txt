You specified a KPSS test of the null hypothesis that the time series coke[, 5] is level stationary (i.e., stationary around a constant mean). This is tested against the alternative that the series is not stationary (i.e., of integration order I(1)), leading to a significant result (at conventional significance levels). The precise p-value is not shown, however, just 0.01 which is the smallest p-value tabulated in the package.
