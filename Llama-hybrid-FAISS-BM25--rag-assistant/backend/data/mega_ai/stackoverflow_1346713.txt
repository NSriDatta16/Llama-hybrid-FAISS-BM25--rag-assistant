Just to add to Francis B.'s answer , svn list may be enhanced in a future release of SVN, if I believe this thread : The list subcommand is excellent for writing scripts over the set of files/directories as listed in the repository, without having to fetch the source. I have been experimenting with using svn:externals leveraging the ' ^ ' syntax for describing logical views of my repository. However, I discovered that the svn list subcommand has no option for walking the externals. I think this would be a really useful feature to be able to list what would be checked out or exported without having to actually do it. Introducing an option such as --no-ignore-externals would allow the default for svn list to remain the same, but still allow the option to walk the externals.
