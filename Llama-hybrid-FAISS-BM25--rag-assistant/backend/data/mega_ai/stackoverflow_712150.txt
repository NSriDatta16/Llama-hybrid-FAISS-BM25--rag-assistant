While I am unfamiliar with the palette texture extension I still recommend using a fragment shader for this sort of effect. It is almost trivial to do a color-key replacement with a shader, versus the other methods you mentioned, and will be way faster than writing the palette functionality yourself. Here's an example GLSL fragment shader that would replace the color white in a texture for whatever color is passed in. uniform vec4 fvReplaceColor; uniform sampler2D baseMap; varying vec2 Texcoord; void main( void ) { vec4 fvBaseColor = texture2D( baseMap, Texcoord); if(fvBaseColor == vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)) fvBaseColor = fvReplaceColor; gl_FragColor = fvBaseColor; } Yes, it does take a little bit extra to set up shader, but but what it sounds like you are trying to do I feel it's the best approach.
