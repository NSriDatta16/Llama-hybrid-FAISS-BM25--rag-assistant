jquery resizable return false

I have an object that has a property status="lock". The div that represents this object is resizable and draggable. For the draggable, if i use the following logic then the dragging is effectively locked start: {... if status==lock then return false ...} But the same logic for resizable does not work I can set the resizable("disabled") but was wondering if I can stop the resize within start or resize events Thank you
