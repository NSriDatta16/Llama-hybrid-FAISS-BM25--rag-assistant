Disclaimer: I've never had to cluster using this sparse of data before, but it might be worth using a stacked autoencoder to reduce the data into a latent continuous space. Once reduced, you can cluster the data using traditional methods. Because of the one hot encoding, you'd need a convolutional autoencoder that uses 1d-convolutions for your 2d-inputs.
