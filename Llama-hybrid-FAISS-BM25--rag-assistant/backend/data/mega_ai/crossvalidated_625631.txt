You could , simply mention the differences, but I think you really should carry out a formal statistical test. While the difference you provided looks like there's a big difference in men compared to women (5.6 vs. 4.38), the standard deviation of your female measurements is about 15% lower than the males. It's hard to tell by simply reading your assertion that this is a statistically signfiicant and interesting result and not simply a result of your sampling variability. I think it's prudent that you carry out formal tests to make sure you're not saying something that really isn't true (e.g. men are more likely to report favorable use of AI than women). If you're concerned about the repetative nature of the results in your prose or in cluttering your writing with the parenthetical results, I'd suggest simply putting together a table of your averages, standard errors, and and $p$ -values. By the way, in your quoted example, you are reporting a standard deviation, but I think you need to be reporting standard errors. Also, why do you only report one signfiicant digit for men (5.6) and two for women (4.38)?
