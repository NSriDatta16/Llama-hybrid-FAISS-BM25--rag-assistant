Fullcalendar editable property not working?

Here is my code $(document).ready(function() { $('#calendar').fullCalendar({ header: { left: 'prev,next today', center: 'title', right: 'month,basicWeek,basicDay' }, dayClick: function() { alert('nemke'); }, events: function(start, end, callback) { $.ajax({ url: 'UserCalendarService.asmx/GetEvents', type: 'POST', dataType: 'xml', data: {start: + Math.round(start.getTime() / 1000),end: + Math.round(end.getTime() / 1000)}, success: function(result) { var events = []; $(result).find('Event').each(function() { events.push({ title: $(this).find('Title').text(), start: $(this).find('Start').text(), editable: $(this).find('Editable').text() }); }); callback(events); } }); }, disableResizing: true, editable: false //disableDragging:true }) }); This property editable false is not working. I tried to set each event it's behavior from the server, and it didn't work. Then I tried to set the property to false, and it also didn't work. I need to set some events editable and some not. I can only set disableDragging, but that doesn't solve my issue 'cause I need some of the events to be able to drag. This property only works with event source set as array like this example Looks like this ajax callback is not working. Has anyone had similar issue? Fullcalendar link
