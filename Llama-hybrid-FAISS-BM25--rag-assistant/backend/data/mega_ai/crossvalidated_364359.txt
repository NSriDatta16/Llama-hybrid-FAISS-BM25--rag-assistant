Prerequisites for Learning Regression

I am doing self-study to learn Data Science (software developer by profession) and needed to read and understand ISLR but this book requires Linear Regression as prerequisite. I searched here and got good books for Linear Regression and I can order one by Draper and Smit from Amazon India . This is the only one which I can afford buying, rest all are imported and out of my budget. I only know Algebra and some Calculus which I learned in last 2 months from MOOCs and Khan Academy and lot of search but I got no background either in Probability or Statistics. Can I got straight to learning Linear Regression from the book ? NOTE: I am not looking to learn Statistics or Math and I do not want to learn any theory either. I just want to understand Linear Regression so that I can do my Data Science work.
