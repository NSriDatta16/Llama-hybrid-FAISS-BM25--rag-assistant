JavaScript: add or subtract from number in string

I have a string that looks like "(3) New stuff" where 3 can be any number. I would like to add or subtract to this number. I figured out the following way: var thenumber = string.match((/\d+/)); thenumber++; string = string.replace(/\(\d+\)/ ,'('+ thenumber +')'); Is there a more elegant way to do it?
