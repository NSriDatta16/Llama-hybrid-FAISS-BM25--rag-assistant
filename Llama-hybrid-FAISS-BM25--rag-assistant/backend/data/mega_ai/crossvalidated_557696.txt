Outliers Logistic Regression

I want to know how to find and remove outliers from my Logistic Regression. I have tried using formula from Faraway, but I don't know is it applicable for logistic regression or not For example my code is library(vcd) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(MLmetrics) library(pROC) d=read.delim("http://dnett.github.io/S510/Disease.txt") d $disease=factor(d$ disease) d $ses=factor(d$ ses) d $sector=factor(d$ sector) finalmodel=glm(disease~age+sector, family=binomial(link=logit), data=d) For finding the outliers I am using this code from Faraway library(faraway) i_n = influence(finalmodel)$hat # calculate the influence of data points with leverage i_n which.max(i_n) # R code halfnorm((i_n)) halfnorm(rstudent(finalmodel)) #jacknife residuals Please help me if u know is it right or not. And how do I remove the outliers from my data? Thanks!
