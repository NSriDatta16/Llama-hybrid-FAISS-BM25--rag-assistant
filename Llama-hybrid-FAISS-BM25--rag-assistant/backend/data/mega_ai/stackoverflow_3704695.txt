Is it okay to think of a worker role as an agent? Yes, definitely. In practice the message can be larger than 8 KB so I am going to need to use a blob storage and pass as message the reference to the blob (or is there another way?), will that impact performance ? Yes, using the technique you're talking about (saving the JSON to blob storage with a name of "JSONMessage-1" and then sending a message to a queue with contents of "JSONMessage-1") seems to be the standard way of passing messages in Azure that are bigger than 8KB. As you're making 4 calls to Azure storage rather than 2 (1 to get the queue message, 1 to get the blob contents, 1 to delete from the queue, 1 to delete the blob) it will be slower. Will it be noticeably slower? Probably not. If a good number of messages are going to be smaller than 8KB when Base64 encoded (this is a gotcha in the StorageClient library) then you can put in some logic to determine how to send it. Is it correct to say that if needed I can increase the number of instances of the Processor worker role, and the queue will magically be processed faster ? As long as you've written your worker role so that it's self contained and the instances don't get in each others way, then yes, increasing the instance count will increase the through put. If you're role is mainly just reading and writing to storage, you might benefit by multi-threading the worker role first, before increasing the instance count which will save money.
