The XOR problem is probably the canonical ANN toy problem. Richard Bland June 1998 University of Stirling, Department of Computing Science and Mathematics Computing Science Technical Report " Learning XOR: exploring the space of a classic problem " The TensorFlow Playground is an interactive interface to several toy neural nets, including XOR and Jellyroll. Computing the largest eigenvalue of a fixed-size (2x2 or 3x3) symmetric matrix is one I use in classroom demos. A. Cichocki and R. Unbehauen. " Neural networks for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors " Biological Cybernetics December 1992, Volume 68, Issue 2, pp 155â€“164 Problems like MNIST are definitely canonical but aren't easily verified by hand -- unless you happen to have enormous free time. Nor is the code especially basic. As far as NLP tasks, the Penn Tree Bank is a very standard benchmark data set, used for example in Wojciech Zaremba, Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals " Recurrent Neural Network Regularization ," and probably hundreds of other papers.
