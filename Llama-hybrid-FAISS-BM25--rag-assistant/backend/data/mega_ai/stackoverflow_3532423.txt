Yes. This is guaranteed in C99. I don't have the C89 spec handy. Of course, compiler implementers have been known to make mistakes on occasion so YMMV. C99 specifies the following in paragraph 6 of 6.5.8 Relational operators : Each of the operators (less than), > (greater than), (less than or equal to), and >= (greater than or equal to) shall yield 1 if the specified relation is true and 0 if it is false. The same or similar clauses appear in paragraph 3 of 6.5.9 Equality operators , paragraph 3 of 6.5.13 Logical AND operator , and paragraph 3 of 6.5.14 Logical OR operator .
