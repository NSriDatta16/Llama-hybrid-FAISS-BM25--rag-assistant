If the time series have trends in them then you will have spurious regression unless they are cointegrated or you address this various ways. ARIMA with input variables (regression with ARIMA error), Arimax (which involves prewhitening the two series), ARDL, and VAR/VECM are all some of the ways this has been addressed. You could get lucky. Check the two series with unit root tests (I suggest both KPSS and ADF). They might both be stationary.
