I would second the recommendation for Hyndman-Athanasopoulos and note that there is a third edition (comment by Mehmet linked to second edition). Time series forecasting is more of an art than a science sometimes but in general the second pipeline you described is better. The #1 pitfall with time series is look-ahead bias . This is where you use information to make a prediction which wouldn't have actually been available to you at the time. Another related form of look-ahead bias is selecting features/models using testing data and so potentially overfitting to relationships which happen to hold true in the testing period. You want to build features based on relationships learned in training and then see whether those relationships continue to hold true in the testing period. Even better you could have train/validation/testing periods for feature selection/model selection/model testing respectively.
