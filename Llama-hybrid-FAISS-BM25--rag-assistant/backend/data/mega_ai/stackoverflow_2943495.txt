I would guess that the site with the RSS feed is sniffing the User Agent still, and the CFHTTP one isn't set to one that the site is using. Use a HTTP Proxy Sniffer (ie Charles HTTP Proxy) to record the HTTP request of a browser that is displaying the RSS feed correctly, then try using CFHTTP with the same User Agent string as a previously successful request. If it still doesn't work, use the 'proxyport' and 'proxyserver' attributes of CFHTTP to run the ColdFusion request through your HTTP sniffer and check to make sure the User Agent is being set correctly and compare to a working request.
