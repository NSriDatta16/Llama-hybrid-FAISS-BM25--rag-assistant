SPARQL Negation: All foaf:Agents which aren't foaf:Persons

I am trying to write a SPARQL query which should give me all foaf:Agents which aren't foaf:Persons . I can't see a way to apply this OPTIONAL/BOUND construct to this problem, because all the properties like rdfs:subClassOf and rdf:type are transitive and reflexive. I tried this: SELECT * WHERE { ?x rdf:type foaf:Agent OPTIONAL { ?y rdf:type foaf:Person } FILTER ( !BOUND(?y) ) } But rdf:type seems to be transitive, at least with JENA/ARQ/SDB.
