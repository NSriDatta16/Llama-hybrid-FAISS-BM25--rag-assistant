WPF How to add and perform events on those controls generated during Runtime

For example, I have an empty tabControl in my Windows during the compile time, and I have an undetermined amount of images need to be added onto the tabControl, so I used loop + tabControl.Children.Add("image1 to x") to add those images... but after that during runtime, I want to perform events on those image controls, such as dragging the image from the tabControl to another Panel. Is it possible to do so? If it's possible, how?
