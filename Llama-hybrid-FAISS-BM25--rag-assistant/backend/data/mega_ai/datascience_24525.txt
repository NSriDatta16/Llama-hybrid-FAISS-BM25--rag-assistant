Since your question and the nice answer from @Stephan Kolassa discuss ARIMA and neural networks in particular, i wanted to mention that you can give the forecast package in R a go - it has a nnetar function that trains a simple feed forward neural network with 1 hidden layer and lagged inputs. Maybe you could try something along the lines of: extract many features for each of your observations like day of week, day of month, weekday/weekend etc. (only datetime is mentioned as a potential dependency in your question so that's why i included this - but you can include all possible things that you believe could be influencing your variable of interest). lagged values of your variable of interest as well as the datetime information (like the day of week etc.) would be your inputs. you can include the datetime variables as external regressors ( xreg ) for example. and predict the future values of your var of interest based on these inputs. Additionally, you could also think of including the the observed mean and variance/deviation on each given day of the value you want to predict. This would mean that you would have to first forecast your expected mean and variance with e.g. ARIMA then add that as additional input to the approach mentioned above. hth.
