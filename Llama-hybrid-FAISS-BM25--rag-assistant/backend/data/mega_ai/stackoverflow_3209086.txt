A simple datastore such as a key-value or document database is also beneficial in cases where performing analytics reasonably exceeds a single system's capacity. (Or it will require an exceptionally large machine to handle the load.) In these cases, it makes sense to use a simple store since the analytics require batch processing anyway. I would personally look at finding a horizontally scaling processing method to coming up with the unit/time analytics required. I would investigate using something built on Hadoop for parallel processing. Either use the framework natively in Java/C++ or some higher level abstraction: Pig, Wukong, binary executables through the streaming interface, etc. Amazon offers reasonably cheap processing time and storage if that route is of interest. (I have no personal experience but many do and depend on it for their businesses.)
