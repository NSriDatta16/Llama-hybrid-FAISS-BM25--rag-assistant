How to determine calibration accuracy/uncertainty of a linear regression?

To determine organic carbon concentrations in a water solution from UV spectroscopy I made a calibration curve with known carbon concentrations and measured the UV absorbance. I used R for the data analysis and the data are found below. My question now is, how to determine the accuracy of my calibration curve. I would like to tell people that I can measure the concentrations with an accuracy of 15% or 4 mg l-1, for example. How can I go on with this? Can I just use the $R^2$ (0.91) and say that I have an uncertainty of 9% (1-0.91)? What is the correct way to do this? concentration
