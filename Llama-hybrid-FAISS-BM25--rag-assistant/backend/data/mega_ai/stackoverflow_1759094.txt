Following the Separation of Concerns principle- AuthenticateAccountManager is a service-level operation. It should call into your repository, which will return the raw User data. The service then authenticates or not based on what is returned by the repository. The general guideline is that the repository is responsible for retrieval and committing of data only . Interpreting and executing behaviors based on the data is business logic.
