Is it right to consider the output of the neural network as its confidence in predicting the output?

Suppose I have a single output sigmoid (tanh) that is producing an output ranging [-1, +1]. Is it right to consider this output as its confidence measue of predicting the output. The output value would be between -1 and +1 but even though I have a high accuracy I see that the values are pretty close to zero. So, I am worried that displaying the output value * 100.0 with such low numbers might not be good. On the other hand, I am able to get a high recall and precision on the validation set.
