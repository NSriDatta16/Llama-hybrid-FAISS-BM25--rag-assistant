You could try using two separate elements, for example a paragraph and an image, and then setting the z-index of the image lower than the z-index of the paragraph and then absolutely positioning the image behind your content. But I would recommend not having the background print. Otherwise you're messing with users' expectations and people will probably get annoyed.
