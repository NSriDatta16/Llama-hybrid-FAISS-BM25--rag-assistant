Magento - custom filters on product list page

I ma trying to create 2 filters for a product list page, one for price and the other for a custom attribute I have made; location Ideally, what I'd like is a drop down, with the price ranges and another dropdown with the locations and a submit button, which will then filter. I've had a look round, but I can't seem to find any examples of how to implements this. On a default Magento store i have locally, I have the layered navigation (on the left) and filtering gives me a URL of: index.php/products?location=7&dir=asc&order=position&price=3%2C1000 So the dropdown filters will need to emulate this, if possible. Thanks
