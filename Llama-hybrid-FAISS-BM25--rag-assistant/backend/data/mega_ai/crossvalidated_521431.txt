The hot hand paradox . Quoting Miller and Sanjurjo's paper: Jack takes a coin from his pocket and decides that he will flip it 4 times in a row, writing down the outcome of each flip on a scrap of paper. After he is done flipping, he will look at the flips that immediately followed an outcome of heads, and compute the relative frequency of heads on those flips. Because the coin is fair, Jack of course expects this conditional relative frequency to be equal to the probability of flipping a heads: 0.5. Shockingly, Jack is wrong. If he were to sample 1 million fair coins and flip each coin 4 times, observing the conditional relative frequency for each coin, on average the relative frequency would be approximately 0.4. Intuitively, the problem is that the amount of available data is positively correlated with the number of heads - so a failure to follow heads with tails is more likely to occur in a sample where there are fewer instances of heads to analyse, giving it a larger impact on the calculated mean, introducing bias. Sampling bias caused by this paradox went undetected in a notable study on the hot hand phenomenon in basketball for over thirty years ( Wikipedia ).
