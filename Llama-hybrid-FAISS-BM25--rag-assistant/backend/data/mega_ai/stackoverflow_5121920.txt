Embedding global content variable values in Drupal content

A customer of mines wants the ability in their Drupal site to set some variables which they will embed in content. You know, things like number of customers, number of branches and so on. This way, when they update the variable values, the changes ripple throughout the site without them having to go and update a bunch of pages. Have any of you come across a module which can handle this? Many thanks Froogle.
