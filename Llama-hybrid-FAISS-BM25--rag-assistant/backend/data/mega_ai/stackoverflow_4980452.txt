Wix RegistryKey Permission

I am attempting to install a registry key that should only be accessible by certain users. Every other part of the installer works (it installs a service and registers a component). Here is the fragment. When the installer is complete, all users can read the key (instead of just administrators). My command line to install is this: msiexec /i installer.msi /l*v installlog.txt The log says nothing about permissions. When I open the database in Orca, the LockPermissions table shows the permission row and it looks fine. What am I doing wrong?
