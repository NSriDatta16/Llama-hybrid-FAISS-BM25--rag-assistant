Estimating conditional mean

Suppose I have a uniform random variable $X$ taking values $\{1,...,n\}$, and two functions $v(X)$ and $w(X)$. I know that $v(X)$ and $w(X)$ are jointly distributed with correlation $\rho$. (And can assume any distribution structure including joint normal if it makes it easier). First, I observe all values of $v(X)$ for $x=\{1,...,n\}$ and estimate $E[v(X)]$ as the average of the observations. My goal is to estimate $E[w(X)]$ without sampling $w(X)$ by using the values of $v(X)$, the mean $E[v(X)]$ and the correlation coefficient. Any hints/directions will be appreciated, including a Bayesian approach.
