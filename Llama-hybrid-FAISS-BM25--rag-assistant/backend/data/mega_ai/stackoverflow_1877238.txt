What is the best file parsing solution for converting files?

I am looking for the best solution for custom file parsing for our enterprise import routines. I want to basically change one file format into a standard file format and have one routine that imports that data into the database. I need to be able to create custom scripts for each client since its difficult to get the customer to comply with a standard or template format. I have looked at PowerShell and Iron Python to do this so far but I am not sure this is the route I want to go. I have also looked at some tools such as Talend which is a drag and drop style tool which may or may not give me what I want as far as flexibility. We are a .NET shop and have created custom code to do this in the past but I need something that is quicker to create then coding custom parsing functions each time we get a new file format in.
