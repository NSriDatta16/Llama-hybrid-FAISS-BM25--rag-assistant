As you say, CNN convolves. In signal processing the convolution is with continuous data, here it is with discrete values. This article in Quora explains, how the mathematic expression in neural network forms the same equation than that of two functions in mathematics. Mathematically, applying a Gaussian blur to an image is the same as convolving the image with a Gaussian function. BLUR in wikipedia Gaussian function is higher on lower values so it kinda is a low pass filter when applied with convolution.
