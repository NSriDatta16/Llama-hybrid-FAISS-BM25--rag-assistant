Survival analysis w/ repeated observations of experimental and control units within periods of differing size & trends over the periods

I have an experiment called Fear Conditioning Acquisition Protocol. We expose mice to subsequent white sounds followed by short electric shocks through the floor. Our aim is to let them learn to associate the sound to the shock. We assess the degree of learning by measuring the freezing of the mouse during the sound exposition. To do the comparison between the subsequent phases of the experiments we use the average of the freezing of each mouse in every phase. This is the result graph: Then we have another set of mice in which no shock follows the sound (control group) here's the results: Values are percentage of freezing on phase duration. My questions are: which test should I use to compare the average freezing between each phase to assess if it's significantly different? I used ANOVA with "Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test". graphically the level of freezing is clearly increasing, is it important then to question about the significance of the difference among the freezing levels? how to formally compare the freezing in the exposed and the control group to show that is significantly different? Generate a value that represent the freezing of a mouse to correlate it with the expression of certain proteins. What to use? total freezing over total sound exposition? average freezing?
