ASP.NET MVC 2 Membership users table mdf file

I have an MVC 2 project where I have my own *.mdf file in the App_Data directory. The *.mdf file contains my normal tables but not a users table. Is it possible to add a Users table to my *.mdf file and work with that instead of the simple register form? (if so: how could this be done?) Because I don't know how to do these things above, I searched and only found steps to add build in Membership to my mdf file and I tried it: I tried to add normal build in Membership to my *.mdf file with this: aspnet_regsql.exe -C CONSTRINGHERE -d PATHTOMDFFILEHERE -A all and I changed my Web.config file to this: I did not modify anything else. I did not change the AccountController or something. I builded and ran my MVC 2 application and went to LogOn and registered an account but got stuck there: Account creation was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again. * The password retrieval answer provided is invalid. Please check the value and try again. Summary: I thought that it would be better to have a Users table in my *.mdf file but I don't know how to do the register/login/logout/membership/etc... things with an own users table. So I tried adding Membership to my own *.mdf file so that everything would be in that one *.mdf file but that gives me also problems. Maybe this info is important: In the future I want it to be possible to let users register and login via Hotmail, Gmail, OpenId and I should need more fields like website, nickname, avatar, etc... other than the basic register form now. Also would need to show a profilepage from the user on the website. Could anybody help me out? PS: I don't have experience with Membership in ASP.NET :s
