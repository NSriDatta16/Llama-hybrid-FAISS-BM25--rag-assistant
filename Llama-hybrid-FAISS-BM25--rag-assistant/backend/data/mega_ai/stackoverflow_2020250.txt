Wpf Custom Control problem

I have strange problem with WPF custom control that I have made. When I drag and drop WPF custom control from toolbox to design surface I only see one border without any controls in it... I have another same WPF custom control project with same custom control and same code and when I reference that project everything works fine. I have template in theme folder that is called DatePicker.Generic.Xaml and I have defined where DateControls is xml namespace of my DatePicker custom control. I have also added [assembly: ThemeInfo( ResourceDictionaryLocation.SourceAssembly, ResourceDictionaryLocation.SourceAssembly)] in assemblyinfo file. Can someone help? Thanks
