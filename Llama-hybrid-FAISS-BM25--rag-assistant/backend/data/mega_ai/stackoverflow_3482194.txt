Ensuring uniqueness of additions to MySQL table using PHP

I'm trying to create a page that tracks some basic user statistics in a database. I'm starting small, by trying to keep track of how many people come using what User Agent, but I've come across a stumbling block. How can I check the User Agent being added to the table to see if it is already there or not?
