Using catalog image as full background image in Magento

I am dealing with a short deadline here, so I will ask this question without having investigated this in depth yet. Although I blieve it's a good question that may interest alot of people dealing with Magento. I have been ask to do some modifications on a Magento eshop. Among other things I need to use the category image of each category as a full resizable background image, using this (or a similar) plugin - http://johnpatrickgiven.com/jquery/background-resize/ Any help would be greatly appreciated.
