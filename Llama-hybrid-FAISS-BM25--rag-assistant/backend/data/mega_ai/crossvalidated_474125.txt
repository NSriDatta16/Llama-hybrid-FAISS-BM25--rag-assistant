Comments (to show R code): Your way: choose(10,5)*(1/13)^5*(12/13)^5 [1] 0.0004548553 Using R's built-in binomial PDF dbinom . dbinom(5, 10, 1/13) [1] 0.0004548553 # exactly the same And 1/3200: 1/3200 [1] 0.0003125 The first two (correct) answers are for exactly 5 Aces. For 5 or more Aces, the probability would be a little larger: sum(dbinom(5:10, 10, 1/13)) [1] 0.0004879945 The average number of Aces is $10(1/13) = 0.7692,$ so we can expect lower numbers of Aces will be most probabable. Here is a bar plot of the distribution $\mathsf{Binom}(10, 1/3).$ You can see that most of the probability is for three or fewer Aces. k = 0:10; PDF = dbinom(k, 10, 1/13) plot(k, PDF, type="h", lwd=3, col="blue") abline(h=0, col="green2") The probability of getting exactly three Aces: dbinom(3, 10, 1/13) [1] 0.03119008 The probability of getting exactly three Aces in ten draws, if cards are not replaced after each draw. (Smaller, roughly because if two aces are already missing, then it's less likely to get a third ace.) dhyper(3, 4, 48, 10) [1] 0.01861668 choose(4,3)*choose(48,7)/choose(52,10) [1] 0.01861668
