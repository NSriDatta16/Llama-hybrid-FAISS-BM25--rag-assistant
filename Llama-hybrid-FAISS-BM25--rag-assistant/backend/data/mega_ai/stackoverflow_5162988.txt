What are the cons of using Django compared to (ASP.net MVC,NHibernate and Spark View Engine)?

I am new to ASP.net MVC, but I am pretty used to Django. I find ASP.net very dragging to do even small things. Comparing Django to ASP.net MVC with NHibernate and Spark View Engine, am I missing anything in Django that makes ASP.net too good ? Is the performance of ASP.net much better than Django since ASP.net is compiled ?
