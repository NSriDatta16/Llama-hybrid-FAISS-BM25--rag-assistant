If a table is really called for, these information should be included: Regression coefficients An asterisk system or bold font to indicate statistically significant coefficients If space allows, add a column to show confidence interval. Another useful technique to build in some animated boxes or arrows to direct their attention to the key information. That way you won't lose them. But the important question is, if they are not trained in statistics at all, why show them a table? How would knowing the other coefficient help them? Instead, I'd suggest you to finely craft the interpretation of the results and then put it onto the slide. Just state the regression coefficient of the main predictor and whether it's significant. And then as a foot note on the slide, indicate what variables were controlled for. Remember to avoid causal inference. Before the presentation, prepare a copy of the actual print out. If there is anyone asking in-depth questions, ask the person to talk to you after the event for more details.
