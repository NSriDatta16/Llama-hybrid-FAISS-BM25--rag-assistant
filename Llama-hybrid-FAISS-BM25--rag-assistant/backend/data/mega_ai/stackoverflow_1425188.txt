You can reorganize the rules or use the discontiguous directive as hinted above. Alternatively, and this would make sense with regards to the program use, you could declare the facts associated with the song narrative as dynamic. The production rules associated with a son, daugher etc. are established (even if the issue of married(X,Y) is hotly debated ;-) ), whereby the facts of the song need to be asserted. Another thing: unless you are debugging/checking the sanity of your rules, you don't need to spell-out all the facts, only these from the lyrics. For example: "I had a baby son [from w]" gives you son(s1, i) and [implied by song] son(s1, w), but you can let prolog infer that male(s1) or child(s1, i), if that is even useful to its assertions. Have fun !
