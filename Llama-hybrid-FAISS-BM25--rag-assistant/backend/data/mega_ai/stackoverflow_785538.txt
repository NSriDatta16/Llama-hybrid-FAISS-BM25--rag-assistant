I have the luxury (burden?) of working from home so I end up doing quite a bit more work than I would were I in the office. With the laptop already set up and connected to the VPN, it's entirely too difficult for me to resist the temptation to "just pound this out". I'd say I probably average a few (less than 10) hours a week of "unpaid" work. BUT, I will only work "unpaid" if what I'm doing is at my own direction or to help fill a gap in my knowledge that is relevant to the current project. The little "oh, I should try it this way" moments would qualify for "unpaid" time as would the "now, how the fsck do I do that?" problems.
