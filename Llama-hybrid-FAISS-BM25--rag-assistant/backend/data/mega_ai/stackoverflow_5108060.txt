Retrieve and echo greek characters problem

Lets say I have a string like this - " Πρώτη θέση Δεύτερη θέση" Using php DOM tree I search for elements td and I am trying to echo Πρώτη Θέση and Δεύτερη Θέση. Although when I am echoing the Greek characters do not appear regularly. Instead I get some weird symbols! I have already set the appropriate encoding. I think the problem is caused during the retrieval.
