You haven't said how you're dragging them. If you're using jQuery UI's Draggable (can it drag rows?) , you can either use CSS or events. CSS : From the docs : Draggable elements gets a class of ui-draggable During drag the element also gets a class of ui-draggable-dragging And so: #tables tr.ui-draggable-dragging { background-color: yellow; } Events : The docs also talk about the start and stop events, which you could use if you didn't want to use CSS.
