Neither of you (davidg or Kevin Pang) paid attention to the fact that he's interested in WinForms , not Web Forms . He wants a framework that pushes the Model-View-Controller design pattern (davidg, MVC isn't just the name of an ASP.NET framework) in a WinForms project using the .NET Compact Framework. He asked his question just fine.
