Algorithm for stacking events/items

I'm looking to build a pseudo Gantt chart, except one where events can be on the same line as long as they don't overlap, something like this: M T W R F S U M T W R F S U M T W R F S U Category 1: |Event 1| |Event 2| |------Event 3--| |---------Event 4-----------| |-Event 5-| I'm looking for an algorithm to efficiently pack these events. I know I can use the length of event and the start date to determine overlapping, but I'd like to have some kind of starting point. For the curious, I'm looking at getting around limitations of the Gantt calendar view in SharePoint 2007. Our users like that view, but don't want one task per line.
