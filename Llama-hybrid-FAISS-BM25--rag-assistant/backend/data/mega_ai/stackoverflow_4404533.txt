Yeah, I've tried to do that. In theory you'd expect the display list of each extended class to stack, but they don't - it works as you describe, where you only see the graphics associated with the most recent class. It's not a deal-breaker for you, though - various architectural options are at your disposal. You could, for instance, create a CardBackground class which is exported out of your library and has the card shape etc. Then you create a Card class which has a background:CardBackground property. Then your Ace class can extend Card and it should have the desired background. Technically you're supposed to favor composition over inheritance, but Flash really encourages the inheritance mindset. Once you get used to breaking out of that you'll realize it's possible to create much more powerful, robust classes using composition in the manner described. Cheers, and I hope that helps!
