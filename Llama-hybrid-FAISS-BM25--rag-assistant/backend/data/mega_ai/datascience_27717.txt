Ways to Make Feature Values Relative for Each Participant

I have a number of participants from a study and am trying to classify them into five "perceived effort" zones. However, I am finding that the accuracy is sitting at around 70% - 75% using various machine learning algorithms, which is OK but I think this could be more accurate by making the features relative for each participant. Each zone corresponds to the participant's perceived effort: Zone 1 I would like to run the same algorithms on data that has feature values relative for each participant, because one participant's zone 3 maybe be the equivalent to another's zone 4. In other words, the zones are not uniform. One idea I had was to make the feature's relative to to each participants max of that feature. As an example: Participant 1: Max running speed is 20 mph (running speed = Feature 1) run zone actualSpeed relativeSpeed 1 5 20 20 / 20 = 1.0 2 4 17 17 / 20 = 0.85 3 3 13 13 / 20 = 0.65 4 2 10 10 / 20 = 0.50 5 1 8 18 / 20 = 0.40 However, a few of my features have values that range from -3.6 to + 2.5, and I am stuck on how to make such features relative to the participant. Question: How to make sample feature values relative to the groups/participants for supervised classification machine learning?
