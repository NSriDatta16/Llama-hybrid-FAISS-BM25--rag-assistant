Choosing a prior for the intercept in a logistic regression with increased -INF probability?

I am trying to fit a simple logistic regression of the kind: n ~ binomial(N, theta) theta = inv_logit( a + x * b ) where x is either 0 or 1 depending if a condition is present or not. Therefor the intercept a is directly linked to the probability theta for condition 0. From what I read most people recommend a non-informative normal(0,10) prior for a , but this is always for centered data. I am modeling with rstanarm , which is centering the data (and I think the priors as well?) internally, so I would suspect that the prior I choose should be closer to the raw data I expect and not the centered one, is this correct? In my data, I know that I have a lot of cases where I have no observations n in condition 0, therefor theta tends to zero and a would tend to -inf . Shouldn't this be reflected by a prior which gives a higher density to -inf Values (e.g. a gamma(1,0.5) distribution (but trying it gives me the error below). Chain 4: Rejecting initial value: Chain 4: Log probability evaluates to log(0), i.e. negative infinity. Chain 4: Stan can't start sampling from this initial value. Summarizing the Question: Do I have to account for the centering of the the priors in rstanarm . If not, what would be a appropriate prior for the intercept, if -inf has a high probability.
