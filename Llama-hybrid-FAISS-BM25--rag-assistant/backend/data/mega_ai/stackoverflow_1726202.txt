Don't use three or more consecutive s, that's a signal you're using them for stylistic purposes and no, you shouldn't. Some would say a single is enough and instead of two you should use , but there are situations (e.g. screenplays) in which you want to introduce a longer pause without implying a change of topic or a new period starting, like a paragraph usually does.
