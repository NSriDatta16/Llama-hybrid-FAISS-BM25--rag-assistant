You can take several approaches: use the finest-grained time series data (for instance, seconds) and interpolate/fill data when needed use the coarsest-grained (for instance, years) and summarize data when needed any middle step between the two extremes You should always know your data, because: in case of interpolating you have to choose the best algorithm (linear or quadratic interpolation, splines, exponential...) in case of summarizing you have to choose an appropriate aggregation function (sum, maximum, mean...) Once you have the same time scales for all the time series you can perform your arithmetical magick, but be aware that interpolation generates extra information, and summarization removes available information.
