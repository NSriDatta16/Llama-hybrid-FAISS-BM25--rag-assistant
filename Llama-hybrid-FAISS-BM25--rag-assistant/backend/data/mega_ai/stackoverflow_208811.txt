ODBC x64 oracle problem

I have a workstation with Windows 2008 x64, MS Access 2007 and Oracle 11g x64 I use Access to connect to Oracle via ODBC. I am the administrator (in the administrator group) on the workstation. I run Access as administrator but when I want to make an ODBC call to Oracle it does not work. How do I do it: I start MS Access and creates a direct query. In the properties dialog I go to add new and the Select datasource dialog appears. I then use machine datasource and click New, System datasource - but the driver for Oracle is not there. Regards Robert :-)
