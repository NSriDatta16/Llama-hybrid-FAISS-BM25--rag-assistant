How do I access node information from a view in Drupal

I have written a custom view template called "views-view-unformatted--FAQ.tpl.php. How can I access the nodes? The $rows array only holds the rendered content from the node.tpl.php template. Bottom line is this - I want to organize the FAQ's into sections by taxonomy.
