So if you have a time series model for the measurements X(t) = f(previous Xs and ts) + N(t) where N(t) = noise at time t. then you can write N(t) =e$_t$ + a$_1$ e$_t$$_-$$_1$ +a$_2$ e$_t$$_-$$_2$ +...+ a$_k$ e$_t$$_-$$_k$ where the e$_t$s are iid random noise (i.e. white noise) Then N(t) is correlated noise with autocorrelation determined by the a$_i$s (k could be just 1 or it could be 2 or higher). Given a model like this you can write down the likelihood and find the maximum. Being that you say f is linear this is solved via conditional least squares.
