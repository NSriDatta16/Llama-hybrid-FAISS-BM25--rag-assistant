MS Velocity vs Memcached for Windows?

I've been paying some attention to Microsoft's fairly recent promoting of Velocity as a distributed caching solution that would compete with the likes of Memcached. I've been looking for a 64bit version of Memcached for Windows for some time now with no luck, and since everything about the ASP.Net MVC project I'm working on is 64bit, it doesn't make sense to use anything but 64bit. Now we're already hedging our bets with ASP.NET MVC in Beta (RTM soon hopefully), but StackOverflow doesn't seem to be doing too badly, so I have limited concerns there. But Velocity is still very much an unknown quantity and will still be Beta (or CTP) for ages - but it does have 64bit! Does anyone have relevant experience or point of view to offer in this situation? Should we bide our time for Velocity - is it even anywhere near good enough to compete with a giant like Memcached, or should we invest time trying to get a 64bit version of Memcached going?
