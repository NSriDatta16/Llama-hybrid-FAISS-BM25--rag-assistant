Q1 has been answered quite well above. The answer is (a), NOT (e). For Q2, I'd personally do neither. Since the text is arbitrary , there's no way to mark-it-up semantically as we have no idea what the markup is trying to represent. However, assuming it is not directly related to the accompanying copyright notice, I would separate it in markup, as it IS separate. Something like: Copyright 2010 My Company | This text is arbitrary. (small might seem presentational, but "small-print" definitely has semantic meaning in my mind) Or better yet: Copyright 2010 My Company | This text is arbitrary. However, neither of those options are provided, so if I HAD to choose between the two, I'd probably go with (b), purely because it "feels" wrong to me to put text directly inside a , which is really designed to group other elements rather than to hold text directly. s are intended purely for grouping other elements, as are other block-tags like and ... Well - according to HTML4/XHTML1, this is how s should be used anyway - HTML5 has different ideas and has invented the element which does precisely the same thing used to do, while use of seems to be discouraged altogether... very odd.
