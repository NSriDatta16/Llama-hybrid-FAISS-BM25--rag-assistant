Play sound on a touch event?

i am using the following code to play a sound when user touches anywhere at the screen but whenever i test it no sound is played and also when i use the same code on a button it plays on the second click on the button not on the first click?? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(CGRectMake(320,480,0,0),point));//CGRectMake(5, 5, 40, 130), point)) { AVAudioPlayer *player; if(!player){ NSString* resourcePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath]; resourcePath = [resourcePath stringByAppendingString:@"/try.wav"]; NSLog(@"Path to play: %@", resourcePath); NSError* err; //Initialize our player pointing to the path to our resource player = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL: [NSURL fileURLWithPath:resourcePath] error:&err]; if( err ){ //bail! NSLog(@"Failed with reason: %@", [err localizedDescription]); } else{ //set our delegate and begin playback player.delegate = self; [player play]; } } } }
