I was able to get it work like expected once I went ahead and created a Class Library project in the same solution, built the project, copied the DLL from the bin of the Class Library and placed it in a folder of my Web Project used for holding external binaries. I also added a reference to the .dll in the project. Once I did that, then the syntax: began to work. Does anyone know if I am able to somehow automatically update the compiled .DLL in my web project from the class library in the same solution? Or do I just have to go into the bin folder each time and manually copy it into the web project? Thanks, Mike
