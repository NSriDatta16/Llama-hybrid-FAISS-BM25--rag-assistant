How to write correct code at the first time?

I usually make lots of mistakes (logic errors, syntax errors) in the first attempt to accomplish some programming tasks. I have to write unit test to detect those bugs. This is especially problematic when I am in an interview. In that situation, I am under pressure and I can not test my code with compiler and unit test. My question is that how can I write correct code in the first place? I know it is difficult. Is there any pragmatic approach to reduce bugs at the first time? I was required to write a function that receives a pointer to an int array and the size of the array. Fill that array with prime number. It's not a difficult problem at all. But I made lots of mistakes at the first time and keep finding out new bugs. Since it was a phone interview I was asked to type the answer and send it thought mail. My first try void prim(int * array, int size) { bool isPrime = true; for (int i=0;i It was a really bad idea to write code in gmail. I will never do it again . I knew the program needs two for loops. However there are some big problems in the code 'i' should not increase at the end of first loop. if i%j==0, isPrime should be false the array operation should be put at the end of loop when we find a prime My second try, I added isPrime test, fixed some errors and resubmitted it. void prim(int * array, int size) { bool isPrime = true; for (int i=0;i There are still some fundamental errors in the code. But my time is up, I try to fix them in my third try. void prime(int * array, int size) { assert(array != null) assert(size>0) bool isPrime = true; for (int i=0;i Finally. After the interview, I felt that I really massed up. I copied the code into my IDE, fixed all the bugs and tested it. I sent this to my interviewer and said sorry about that. I was really surprised by how many errors I could make in such a small problem. Final Version #include #include using namespace std; void prime(int * array, int size) { assert(array != 0); assert(size>0); if (size == 1){ *array=2; return; } else { *array=2; array++; } bool isPrime = true; int testNum = 3; for (int i=1;i
