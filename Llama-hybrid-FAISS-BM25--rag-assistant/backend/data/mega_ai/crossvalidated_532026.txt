When Should we apply the Aggregations(mean, sum , count, max, min) and how to deal with correlations features

I am beginners to machine learning , I worked on the some basics machine learning problems. I had a little bit confusion about feature Engineering. some people are using aggregations functions for model input data and some people are not using. I don't understand when should I use aggregation function, In the same way how to deal with correlation features and should I delete the highly correlated features with target variable. please help me to understand these things.
