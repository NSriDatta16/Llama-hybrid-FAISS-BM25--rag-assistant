Magento uses an EAV structure so finding information can be tricky. There is a slightly out-of-date but useful overview diagram here: http://inchoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/magento_v116-database_diagram.pdf To answer part of your question, I don't think Magento stores the login status in the database, that would be stored in the session. Other details like description/username will be in one of the entity value tables.
