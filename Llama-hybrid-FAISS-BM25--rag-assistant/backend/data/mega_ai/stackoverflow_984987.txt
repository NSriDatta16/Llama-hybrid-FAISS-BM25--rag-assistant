If you treat append to a Vector/ArrayList as O(1) - which it really isn't, but might be close enough in practice - (EDIT - to clarify - append may be amortized constant time , that is - on average, the addition would be O(1), but might be quite a bit worse on spikes. Depending on context and the exact constants involved, this behavior can be deadly). (This isn't Java, but some made-up language...). One vector that will be called "Forward". A second vector that will be called "Backwards". When asked to append - Forward.Append() . When asked to prepend - Backwards.Append() . When asked to query - if ( Index (and also check for the index being out of bounds).
