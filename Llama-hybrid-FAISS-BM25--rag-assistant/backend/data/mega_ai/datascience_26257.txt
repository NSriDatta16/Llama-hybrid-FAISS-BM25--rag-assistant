As @Emre mentioned, RNN is a good option. It's worth noting that if the number of possible nodes in each tree is the same or at least has the same upper bound, you could use literally any architecture you want and just pass in the adjacency matrix. Alternatively, you could build an intermediate model to convert your graph into a graph embedding and then once again, you can do basically whatever you want with that. A pretty big piece of potentially important information here is what you are trying to accomplish, which could have significant consequences for how you want to represent your inputs.
