Systematic way of specifying ARIMA(p,d,q) which surprisingly normalizes residuals

Based on what I read in this (very) helpful/clear/pedagogical article ARIMA models for time series forecasting , I decided to systemize a way of specifying an ARIMA model. My algorithm actually computes the PACF of MLE-based residuals, and then (given that my series exhibits an AR signature -- indeed a first nonseasonal difference of my series returns a lag-1 negative autocorrelation lower than -.5, I consequently decided to add AR term to correct for mild under-differencing --), it iteratively identifies the most significant lag, turns it into an AR term, recomputes the PACF, re-identifies the most significant lag, and so on... To summarize, the algo Starts with (a constant-only model) an empty list of AR terms Computes the PACF using the (empty or growing) list Identifies the most significant lag and adds it to the list of AR terms Goes to step 2 Sometimes, at step 2, the algorithm identifies a lag which is already present in the list. In this case, instead of adding it to the list (which would have no sense -- non full-rank explanatory matrix/perfect colinearity), it takes the (seasonal?) difference associated to the lag, keeping all previous AR terms. And curiously/interestingly, it cleans the residuals, making them normal ! Below a gif in which we are shown the process iXoY ............. reads X difference(s) using succesively the Yth lag(s) arW-X-Y-Z .... reads as the list of lags used as AR terms In the above gif, (or the capture below) we see that differencing twice at lag 40 and using the lags 1, 2, 4, 7, 15, 40 as AR terms, yield residuals whose null hypothesis of normality is highly conserved (I used a shapiro test since it is one of the most powerfull -- even if I cannot find anymore the reference in which I read that.). The model which is being selected is (whose PACF of the residuals is shown below) $\Delta^2_{40} y_t = \sum_{l \in \{1,2,4,7,15,40\}} \rho_l \Delta^2_{40} y_{t-l} + \varepsilon_t$ where $\Delta^2_{40}$ stands for two differences made against lag 40. What enormous mistake am I currently doing ?
