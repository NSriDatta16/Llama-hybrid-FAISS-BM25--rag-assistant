Boosting using other "weak learners" than trees

Descriptions of boosting (and specific techniques like gradient boosting) typically talk about "weak learners" in general, and then immediately switch to discussing boosted trees specifically. Why is this? I've seen some discussions regarding boosting SVMs, but little to no discussion about boosting neural networks or Gaussian processes, for instance. Is there any literature on the topic of why trees are more suitable for boosting than other "learners"?
