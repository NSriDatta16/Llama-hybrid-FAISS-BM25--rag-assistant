The best idea would be to create a md5 key generated from the user agent, ip and a time frame. Then store that in a database and populate it in a hidden text field so on submit you can revalidate the value. You can also use $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] to get were the request came from and validate it against the url of your site. Remember this is set by the user web browser so it can be spoofed. Here is a list of available $_SERVER variables and their descriptions. http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php
