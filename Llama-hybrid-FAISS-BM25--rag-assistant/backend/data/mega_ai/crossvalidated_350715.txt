The package MCMCglmm can easily handle and estimate covariance structures and random effects. However it does use bayesian statistics which can be intimidating to new users. See the MCMCglmm Course Notes for a thorough guide to MCMCglmm, and chapter 5 in particular for this question. I absolutely recommend reading up on assessing model convergence and chain mixing before analysing data for real in MCMCglmm. library(MCMCglmm) MCMCglmm uses priors, this is an uninformative inverse wishart prior. p Fit the model m In the model summary summary(m) the G structure describes the variance and covariance of the random intercepts. The R structure describes the observation level variance and covariance of intercept, which function as residuals in MCMCglmm. If you are of a Bayesian persuasion you can get the entire posterior distribution of the co/variance terms m$VCV . Note that these are variances after accounting for the fixed effects. simulate data library(MASS) n Estimating the original co/variance of the random effects requires a large number of levels to the random effect. Instead your model will likely estimate the observed co/variances which can be calculated by cov(group_var)
