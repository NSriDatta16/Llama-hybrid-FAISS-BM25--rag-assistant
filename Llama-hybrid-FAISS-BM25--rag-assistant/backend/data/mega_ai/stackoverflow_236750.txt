Edited: Robert and Vinko state that you need to declare the name of the referenced column in the foreign key constraint. This is necessary in InnoDB, although in standard SQL you're permitted to omit the referenced column name if it's the same name in the parent table. One idiosyncrasy I've encountered in MySQL is that foreign key declaration will fail silently in several circumstances: Your MySQL installation doesn't include the innodb engine Your MySQL config file doesn't enable the innodb engine You don't declare your table with the ENGINE=InnoDB table modifier The foreign key column isn't exactly the same data type as the primary key column in the referenced table Unfortunately, MySQL gives no message that it has failed to create the foreign key constraint. It simply ignores the request, and creates the table without the foreign key (if you SHOW CREATE TABLE posts, you may see no foreign key declaration). I've always thought this is a bad feature of MySQL! Tip: the integer argument for integer data types (e.g. BIGINT(20)) is not necessary. It has nothing to do with the storage size or range of the column. BIGINT is always the same size regardless of the argument you give it. The number refers to how many digits MySQL will pad the column if you use the ZEROFILL column modifier.
