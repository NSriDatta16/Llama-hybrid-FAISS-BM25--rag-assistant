Drag drop a usercontrol in vb.net

I have, what should be , a very simple problem, but now I have used 5 hours without results. I have a usercontrol, UserControl1, which I want to drag and drop on my form, Form1. Thatâ€™s it. It should be simple, but I have googled for hours without results. Does anybody have a sample code to fix this?
