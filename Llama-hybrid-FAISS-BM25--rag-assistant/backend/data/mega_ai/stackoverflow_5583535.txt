Wordpress Uploads Permissions Issue

I have a had a wordpress site up and running for over a month, and I have set that my uploads be organized by month/year.. When april was made the uploads stopped working. The permissions on the wp-content and uploads are 775 , the permission of 04(folder) was 747 and the owner was "apache" I've never run into this issue before on any wordpress site, how do I correct this for the future and fix the present issue? I changed the organization option and I still can't upload. The error is The uploaded file could not be moved to /var/www/vhosts/websitename.com/httpdocs/wp-content/uploads.
