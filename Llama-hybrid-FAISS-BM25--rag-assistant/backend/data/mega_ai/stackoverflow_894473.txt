Does ASP.NET MVC use the regular toolbox controls?

In ASP.NET MVC, do I use the "regular" controls from the toolbox and assign data to them like I did with webforms? Can I use the gridview, for example? Thank you. EDIT: The answer appears to be no. So what do you use? Are there any drag and drop controls in Visual Studio like the webform controls?
