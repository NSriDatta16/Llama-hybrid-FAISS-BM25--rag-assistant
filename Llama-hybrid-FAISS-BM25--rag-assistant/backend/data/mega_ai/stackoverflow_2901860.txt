Delphi 7: how to execute shell command and check the result?

I'm using Delphi 7 and can't predict the target version of Windows. I need to create a database (probably MySql, but might be something else) and define some table structures. I do not need to populate any data. Unfortunately, all of the ADO components seem to expect that a database already exists and they will then allow you to manipulate it. So, since it's only a few simple commands, I thought that I might as well use ShellExectute(). Agree? Disagree? Can anyone give me a sample code which will attempt to run "MySql --version" and let me check the result? After that I should be able to figure it out for myself. Thanks. [edit] No offence intended, but I do know how to google. It's just that I don't find useful results. It's my own fault for not being explicit in this question, so please accept my apology - what I need is a code example, not just the name of a component. Sorry (and thanks for the replies so far (all of which are +1)) [edit] The links which Robert gives do the job (procedure RunDosInMemo() does the trick) ... B U T you Must remember to include an .exe extension (so, 'notepad.exe', not just 'notepad', and to ge a full path if your command is not on the path.
