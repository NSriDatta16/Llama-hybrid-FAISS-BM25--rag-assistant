GBM vs XGBOOST? Key differences?

I am trying to understand the key differences between GBM and XGBOOST. I tried to google it, but could not find any good answers explaining the differences between the two algorithms and why xgboost almost always performs better than GBM. What makes XGBOOST so fast?
