Bayesian AB testing for Bernoulli Events with Time Patterns

I have read in this paper , about how to do Bayesian AB testing for conversions in digital advertising. One can start with uniform priors, and update them to Beta distributions based on num_trials_A , num_successes_A , num_trials_B and num_successes_B . However it seems that the authors take the conversion rates to be constants there. What if there is some seasonality, or a trend in the rates over time? Is there something about modifying the test for this in the literature? My intuition is to check whether I can get this seasonality/trend to go away by taking the difference between the two sample rates.
