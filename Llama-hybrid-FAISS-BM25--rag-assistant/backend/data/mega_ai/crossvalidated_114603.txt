Cluster analysis (proximities)

I have a question regarding clustering. I have a symmetric matrix of 50 specialties (50 X 50) where each cell represents the number of observations related to each combination of specialties. Some combinations in this matrix do not exist in the data (coded with zero frequency) and the diagonal is zero. I would like to perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering to find the structure of these specialties. But before, I need to transform the frequency in each cell into "proximities" (similarities /dissimilarities). Does anyone know of an index of similarities / dissimilarities on the basis of joint frequencies? Another question, what is the accepted clustering method (single linkage, average linkage, ward's method etc.) to analyze these proximities. All suggestions are welcome.
