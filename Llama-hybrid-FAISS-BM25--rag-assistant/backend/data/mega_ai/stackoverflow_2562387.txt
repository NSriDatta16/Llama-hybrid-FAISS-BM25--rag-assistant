If user agents see the site as thirdparty.com they are going to require an https certificate for thirdparty.com . So if that's an EV cert, then they are indeed going to see the green glow. Of course, you will want to make sure any communications between thirdparty.com and mysite.com should be appropriately secure. (BTW: rfc2606 for example domain names.) Disclaimer: I'm not really competent to answer this question, but this is stackoverflow.
