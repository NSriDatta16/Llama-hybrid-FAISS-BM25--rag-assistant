Spillover effect in short time-series

My goal is to identify a potential spillover effect. I study the industry-level profitability (e.g. profitability in agriculture, profitability in finance and insurance etc.). I calculate the industry-level profitability change based on the profitabilities of the companies within the industry. I have a panel data of approximately 6.000 companies (grouped into 19 industries) in the period of 2003 - 2020. Data is yearly (I do not have quarterly or monthly data). Here is how it looks like. The actual table is 17 x 19 (17 years and 19 sectors). The percentage values represent the industry-level year-to-year changes in profitability. Sectors 2003 ... 2018 2019 2020 Sector A 5% ... 5% 5% 5% ... ... ... ... ... ... Sector Q 5% ... -2% 3% 5% Sector R 5% ... 5% -2% 3% Sector S 5% ... 5% -2% 3% Please take a look at sectors Q, R and S in the period of 2018 - 2020. I exemplified what I mean by a spillover effect. You can see that once sector Q reaches a particular result (e.g. -2% in 2018), the sectors R and S follow (e.g. -2% in 2019). So the decrease/increase in profitability spills from sector Q to sectors R and S. I thought of using VAR (Vector autoregression) as it seems perfectly suitable for studying the spillover effects. However, I came across several discussions discouraging the use of VAR when only a few time stamps (in my case, 17 years) are available. I assume it concerns PVAR (panel VAR) also. Could you please comment on the usability of VAR/PVAR in this setting or advise other methods to employ?
