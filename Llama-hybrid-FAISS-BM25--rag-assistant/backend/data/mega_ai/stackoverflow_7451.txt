I second RodeoClown's comment about code reviewing every commit. Once he's done it a fair few times he'll get in the habit of testing stuff. I don't know if you need to block commits like that though. At my workplace everyone has free commit to everything, and all SVN commit messages (with diffs) are emailed to the team. Note: you really want the thunderbird colored-diffs addon if you plan on doing this. My boss or myself (the 2 'senior' coders) will end up reading over the commits, and if there's any stuff like "you forgot to add unit tests" we just flick an email or go and chat to the person, explaining why they needed unit tests or whatever. Everyone else is encouraged to read the commits too, as it's a great way of seeing what's going on, but the junior devs don't comment so much. You can help encourage people to get into the habit of this by periodically saying things like "Hey, bob, did you see that commit I did this morning, I found this neat trick where you can do blah blah whatever, read the commit and see how it works!" NB: We have 2 'senior' devs and 3 junior ones. This may not scale, or you might need to adjust the process a bit with more developers.
