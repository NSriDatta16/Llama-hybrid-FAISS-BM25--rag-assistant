If you consider $w_i$, $i=1,...$ as the weight of each bug, then the total weight of the population is $X=\sum_i w_i$. Now, trivially $n=\frac{X}{Y}$ where $Y=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i w_i$ is the average weight of an individual. You can estimate $n$ if you can estimate $X$ (by weighing the whole population) and $Y$. Estimating $Y$ can be accomplished by weighing several samples of known (e.g. the same) sample size. If you use the same sample size (say $k$) each time (say $m$ times) then $Y=\tfrac{1}{m}(\sum_j \frac{1}{k}(\sum_l w_{j,l}))=\tfrac{1}{mk}\sum_{j,l} w_{j,l}$ is just an empirical average of $mk$ draws from the distribution of weights. The distribution of $Y$ then, will be the sampling distribution of the mean, which according to the CLT approaches Gaussian. Then, you can model $n=\frac{X}{Y}$ as a ratio distribution . If you assume both the numerator and denominator are independent Gaussian random variables, then there is a closed form expression for the ratio. In particular you could use the Gearyâ€“Hinkley transform $t\approx \frac{\mu_{Y} n+\mu_X}{\sqrt{\sigma_Y^2 n^2 + \sigma_X^2}}$ which will cause $t$ to be approximately a standard Gaussian. The variance of $X$ may be quite small depending on the precision of your scale. The variance of $Y$ will depend on how many samples you draw (and your scale).
