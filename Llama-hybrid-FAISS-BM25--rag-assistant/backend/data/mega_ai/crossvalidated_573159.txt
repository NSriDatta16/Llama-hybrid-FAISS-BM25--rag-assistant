You have prior information before the first measurement: trees don't have negative height and the tallest trees surely are still unlikely to be much more than, say, 120 m tall. So, you could have a prior that's pretty flat between 0 and 120, but then tapers off. That'd arguably be a weakly informative prior. Of course, that doesn't sound like a normal prior, so if you still want to do conjugate updating, you might have to represent that with a mixture of normals, in which case conjugate updating works again. On the other hand, modern MCMC samplers like Stan can usually just sample the posterior, if you can write down your prior distribution in terms of a nice smooth density. Alternatively, you may have your own personal initial assessment (or you may have elicited it from a group of experts) by looking at the tree, that's another option (an informative prior). You could also have run a model on data of previously measured tree heights accounting for the type of tree, area, climate etc., which could give you a predictive distribution for the height of your particular tree. That would be yet another reasonable option for setting the prior. The option of setting the prior as the normalized likelihood of the first measurement is essentially equivalent to saying that we knew absolutely nothing beforehand (an "uninformative improper prior").
