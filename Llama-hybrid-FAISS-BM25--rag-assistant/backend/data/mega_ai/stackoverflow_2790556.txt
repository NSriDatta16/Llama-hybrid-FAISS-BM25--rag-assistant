Fix for iframe calling location.href

I'm trying to embed a mapquest direction page such as http://www.mapquest.com/maps?1c=Ann+Arbor&1s=MI&1a=1440+Hubbard+St&1z=48109-2083&1y=US&1l=42.293437&1g=-83.724491&1v=ADDRESS&2c=Ann+Arbor&2s=MI&2a=930+N+University+Ave&2z=48109-1055&2y=US&2l=42.278558&2g=-83.737969&2v=ADDRESS using an iframe. The problem is at least one of their javascripts calls location.href which is causing the script to hang. If I'm not mistaken this is because the page I'm embedding the page on is in a different domain. Are there any ways around this?
