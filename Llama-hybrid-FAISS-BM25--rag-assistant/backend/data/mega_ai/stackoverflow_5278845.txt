Enhancing a Jquery drag-and-drop demo

I have a requirement that very closely matches this Jquery demo , which is a simple shopping cart demo. Basically I need to make two enhancements into this demo. I need a text input alongwith with the available "products". So when I drag-drop one of the products, the text fields should be dragged along with that, which will be filled by user in the "cart" field. I need a "cross" in front of each item in cart, which can be used to delete a certain item. Jquery's "destroy" function doesn't seem to do that. So how can I accomplish deletion of items from shopping cart? Thanks for all the help.
