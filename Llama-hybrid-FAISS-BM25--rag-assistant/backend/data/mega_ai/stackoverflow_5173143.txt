iPhone parse JSON on phone or on server?

I'm not sure if this is even possible on the iphone. Scenario 1 : I get some json object by calling some api through a URL. I parse the json on my iphone and display results. OR Scenario 2 But let's say I get some json object by calling some api through URL. I pass the object to a web service to parse it with C# and return the data organized the way I want then parse it again (but obviously nicer and cleaner parsing) Which one do you think is better if both are possible?! Thanks
