Gretton, Arthur, et al. "A kernel two-sample test." The Journal of Machine Learning Research 13.1 (2012): 723-773 introduces a few two-sample test using maximum mean discrepency for seeing if two samples are drawn from different distributions. M. Gutman, “Asymptotically optimal classification for multiple tests with empirically observed statistics,” IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 35, no. 2, pp. 401–408, 1989. uses some maximum likelihood techniques for multinomial distributions, and Unnikrishnan, Jayakrishnan. "On optimal two sample homogeneity tests for finite alphabets." Information Theory Proceedings (ISIT), 2012 IEEE International Symposium on. Ieee, 2012. provides some analysis for a two-sample $\chi^2$ test.
