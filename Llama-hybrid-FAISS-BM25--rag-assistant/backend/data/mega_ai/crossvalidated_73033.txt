A typical strategy would be to compare the proportion of the nodes in each network satisfying each of the criteria instead of the number of nodes. So for example, if your networks had $100, 200, 400$ nodes respectively and the param1 for each of these networks was $50, 60, 80$, then the corresponding proportions of nodes of this particular type would be $50/100, 60/200$ and $80/300$, or $0.5, 0.3, 0.2$. Then it would make sense to average these numbers; the average proportion of nodes of this type is $(0.5+0.3+0.2)/3 = 0.333$. So if, say, you had a new network with $1000$ nodes, you might guess that it would have about $0.333 \times 1000 = 333$ nodes of the desired type, all other things being equal.
