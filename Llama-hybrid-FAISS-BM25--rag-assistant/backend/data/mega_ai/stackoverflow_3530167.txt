How do I change the order of the product compared and viewed block in Magento?

I’m trying to move 'recently view products' block to below the 'compare products' block in the right sidebar. I’ve managed achieve this by the following inclusion in local.xml, however, the product viewed block appears twice now, with the original still sitting at the top. How do I code the xml to just send the top to the bottom, instead of duplicating as I have done? product_compared product_viewed
