Hi: you need the $\hat{\epsilon}_{t}$ , namely the estimates of the error terms, in order to estimate the model. Specifically, the numerical way to obtain the parameter estimates of an MA(q) is to calculate the $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{\epsilon_i}^2$ for the sample and then minimize that term numerically. ( well, that's not exactly how it's done but, for purposes of this question, it's fine ). Note that the estimate of $\epsilon_t$ at time $t$ ( during the $t$ th loop of the optimization routine ), namely $\hat{\epsilon}_t = y_t - \hat{\mu} - \hat{\theta}_{1}\epsilon_{t-1} - \hat{\theta}_{2}\epsilon_{t-2} - \ldots \hat{\theta}_{q}\epsilon_{t-q}$ . So, if you did have an unknown coefficient on $\epsilon_{t}$ , there would be no way to calculate the estimate, $\hat{\epsilon_t}$ and therefore, no objective function to minimize. There are particular difficulties that come up with the MA(q) that make the optimization task even more difficult than what I described above. But the reason for needing $\theta_{0}$ does not change and is hopefully clearer now. Note that, technically, $\theta_0$ doesn't have to be 1.0 but it has to be a known constant rather than an unknown parameter. P.S. : If you want a much better and thorough explanation of numerical techniques for estimating time series models ( not necessarily ARMA but some of it is devoted to that ), I highly recommend Andrew Harvey's " The Econometric Analysis of Time Series". He tends to be quite terse so there's an ton of info-details compacted into each page ( and once in a while, skipped steps ) but definitely worth the effort. I know of no other texts that cover the material he covers, atleast from a numerical-estimation framework. Another P.S. : Note that I really should be starting the sum of the $\hat{\epsilon_i}^2$ at $i = q+1$ ( because $q$ observations are lost because we need the first $q$ observations in order to obtain the first $\hat{\epsilon}$ at $t = q+1$ but these are details that I'd prefer to not deal with because they don't effect the reasoning.
