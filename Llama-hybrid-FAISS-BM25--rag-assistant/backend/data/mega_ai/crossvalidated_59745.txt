Linear regressions are great because you can implement prediction very simply in any program that can multiply and add. Random forests, on the other hand, are much more complicated. They are made up individually of decision trees , which can basically be represented by a set of rules. However, a random forest may have hundreds or thousands of individual trees, which would be very tedious to implement by hand in another system. Your best bet is probably going to be to find a random forest implementation for the system you wish to export the model to, and then use PMML to export the model. The RPMML package will let you convert your random forest to an XML file, which you should be able to import to any system that supports PMML.
