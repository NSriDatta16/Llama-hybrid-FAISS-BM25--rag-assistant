What can I use for good quality code coverage for C#/.NET?

I wonder what options there are for .NET (or C# specifically) code coverage, especially in the lower priced segment? I am not looking for recommendations, but for a comparison of products based on facts. I know the following: NCover Seems to be very popular and looks quite good Supports statement coverage and branch coverage $480 for "NCover 3 Complete" Older beta versions are available for free Visual Studio (2008 Pro) | (2005 Team System (Development, Test or Team Suite Editions)) Well, it's Microsoft so I'd expect it to work properly Fully integrated into Visual Studio At least $5,469 PartCover - no further development (moved to OpenCover) Open source Supports statement coverage OpenCover - successor to PartCover OpenSource Supports branch and statement coverage 32 and 64 bit support Silverlight support Background Tutorial on The Code Project by the primary developer No .NET Core support yet SD Test Coverage Works with 32 and 64 bits, full C# 4.0 Handles both small and very large code bases $250 for single user license JetBrains dotCover $100 for Personal License. Free for user groups, open source projects, students and teachers. Supports statement coverage Silverlight support NCrunch $159 for personal license $289 for commercial seat license * Free during beta, to become commercial, pricing unknown future unknown . Code coverage indicators in Visual Studio Continuous (near real time) testing Visual per-test code coverage Performance metrics, parallel multi-core test execution NDepend $410 for developer license NDepend can import coverage data from NCover, DotCover, Visual Studio 2017; 2015, 2013, 2012, 2010 and 2008 Code Coverage files. Dependency graph Dependency structure matrix Visualizing code metrics Validating code rules
