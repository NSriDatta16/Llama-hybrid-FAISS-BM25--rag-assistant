To achieve the colour, you could use a rich text edit style if you're using PB 11.5. For the hyperlink functionality, I'd try to leverage the Clicked event, trying to identify with SelectedStart() what word has been clicked and then whether or not it is a hyperlink. The column would need to have TabOrder so that a click would place the cursor in the text. Good luck, Terry.
