uri manipulation class .net

Is there a decent OSS URI manipulation class for .NET? Please dont suggest the BCL Uri class, or all other manner of manual hacks I could do around that almost useless thing. I'm looking for a robust library to handle taking uris of all different forms (relative, absolute, with/without query string etc) that lets me access and manipulate all the fragments in an elegant way. Thanks
