Since the result of the computation is never used the compiler can optimize out almost all of your code. The only things that must remain are equivalent to int main(void) { int i; do { printf("enter value"); scanf(“%d”,&i); } while(i>0); return 0; } As others have already said the only remaining variable i can't be of register storage class since its address is taken.
