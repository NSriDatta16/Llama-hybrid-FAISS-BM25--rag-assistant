try to remove the [bookView autorelease]; and do it like this: // Add the new view/button combo to the scrollview. // THIS WORKS VISUALLY, BUT THE BUTTON IS UNRESPONSIVE :( [_scrollView addSubview:bookView]; [bookView release]; _scrollView.canCancelContentTouches = YES; should do the trick delaysContentTouches - is a Boolean value that determines whether the scroll view delays the handling of touch-down gestures. If the value of this property is YES, the scroll view delays handling the touch-down gesture until it can determine if scrolling is the intent. If the value is NO , the scroll view immediately calls touchesShouldBegin:withEvent:inContentView:. The default value is YES. canCancelContentTouches - is a Boolean value that controls whether touches in the content view always lead to tracking. If the value of this property is YES and a view in the content has begun tracking a finger touching it, and if the user drags the finger enough to initiate a scroll, the view receives a touchesCancelled:withEvent: message and the scroll view handles the touch as a scroll. If the value of this property is NO, the scroll view does not scroll regardless of finger movement once the content view starts tracking.
