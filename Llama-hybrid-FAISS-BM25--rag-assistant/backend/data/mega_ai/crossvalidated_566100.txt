I agree with the answer above - neural networks are definitely not the only way to find input-output relationships. We do need more information for answering. But here are some questions you may want to ask yourself first, before jumping into neural networks: Did you plot the data to see if there are any trends? Try plotting your output on Y axis with input on X axis to see if there is a visible trend. If there are no visible trends, all is not lost. But having visible trends will help you diagnose if something is going wrong with your attempt to find input-output relationships. Are you trying to predict a number or a category? For the former, you should do a regression and for the latter, you should do a classification. If you have numerical data, a reasonable first step (after cleaning data: removing large numbers, outliers, negatives, blanks etc) is looking at the correlation matrix. You can look up what this is - it will help you quickly tell how your all your inputs are related to your outputs (bird's eye view). If you have categorical data, try a boxplot for a bird's eye view. Only after all this would be it pertinent to decide if neural networks are good way forward or not. Hope this helps.
