The Strategy pattern comes to mind. The strategy pattern is intended to provide a means to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable. The strategy pattern lets the algorithms vary independently from clients that use them. In this case, the "family of algorithms" are your different actions. As for switch statements - in "Clean Code", Robert Martin says that he tries to limit himself to one switch statement per type. Not eliminate them altogether. The reason is that switch statements do not adhere to OCP .
