An alternate to foldLeft that starts from second element

I have a List defined as: val l = List("1", "2", "3") I want to convert it to the string "1:2:3" One way is the following: l.foldLeft("")((x, y) => x + (if (x == "") "" else ":") +y) Is there a more elegant method? [EDIT: further explanation] Easy Angel's answer works when the elements of l have a 'meaningful' toString method. although I have l as List[String] , l can be a list of a custom type which does not override the toString method, say, as in: class my(i:Int) { val x = i } I have also a method def getMy(m:my) = "Hello "+m.x So I would like the output of getMy to be used instead of the output of the default toString method.
