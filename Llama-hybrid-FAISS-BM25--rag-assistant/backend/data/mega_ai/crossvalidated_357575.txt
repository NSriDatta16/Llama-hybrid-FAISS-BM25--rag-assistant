I quite do not see the aim of this procedure. If it is to test that the stock return is proportional to the market cap, why don't you make only one regression and test the significance of $b_0$ ? If you are looking for some seasonality in the $b-0$, then you should test if your b0 is a constant (i.e. var=0). The percentage of time it is not significant will give you a number but you have no other number to compare with. So unless on rare occasion (it is 100%, or there are not significant during winter for example), you will be able to deduce something. The $R^2$ is the cosine of an angle, so I do not see what the average of cosine can be!
