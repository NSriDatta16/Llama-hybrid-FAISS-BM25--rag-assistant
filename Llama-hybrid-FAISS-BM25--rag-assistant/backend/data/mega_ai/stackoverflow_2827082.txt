Now, I don't know about onTouchEvent short circuiting onClick, and I don't know if maybe you need to set android:clickable to true (or setClickable(true) ). But, if you can't make it work cleanly, you can use a boolean in the onTouchEvent to mimic click detection if all else fails. in ACTION_DOWN, set it to true (isClicking or something like that), in ACTION_MOVE set it to false (because the user is dragging therefore not clicking) and then in ACTION_UP you can test for it. If it's true, this means the user has pressed down but not dragged. It's hacky, but if you can't get onClick to work it's basically the same thing.
