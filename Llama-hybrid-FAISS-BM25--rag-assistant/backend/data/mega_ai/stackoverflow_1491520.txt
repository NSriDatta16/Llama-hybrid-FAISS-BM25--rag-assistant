It's a good idea to separate the parsing of a file from the implementation of objects parsed from that file. This is known as "Separation of Concerns". The implementation of Species should not know or care how it is represented in persistent storage (in OO design jargon, it should be "persistence agnostic") or where the parameters passed to its constructor come from. It should only care about how interacts with other objects in the system once it has been created, however that creation occurs. The concern of how Species are represented in persistent storage should be implemented elsewhere, in your case in the SpeciesReader.
