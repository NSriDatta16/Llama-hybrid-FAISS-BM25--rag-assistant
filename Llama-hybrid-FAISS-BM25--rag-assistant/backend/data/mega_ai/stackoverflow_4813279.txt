Problems with NSTextView where NSTextField worked

I'm just starting out with obj-c, I'm trying to build an importer to fetch a couple numbers from a piece of formatted text. I started with a wrapping TextField and was able to both get the text into a string and search it as I wanted with NSString *varImport = [NSString stringWithString:[importTextView stringValue]]; When I switch over to the TextView in the Interface Builder I get there error -[NSScrollView string]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x100429160 I think this may be the root of my problem, although I am dragging over a TextView when I look in the inspector panel its labeled as a ScrollView which I'm not familure with yet. Through my research I came across two different sites saying that TextView wont directly feed into a string but it was for odd reasons, IE TextView stored the data as a MutableString that was constantly updating and to access it you had to copy the original (Second example) Anyways I'm turning to the experts because I'm clearly doing something wrong and I can't make sense of the answers on the web. NSString *varImport = [NSString stringWithString:[[import textStorage] string]]; NSString *varImport = [[import string] copy]; Don't worry so much about the other stuff if you don't have the time to explain what's going in the web examples, I mainly want to know about the ScrollView stuff and how to get a string out of it to be able to search it. Thanks in advance! Graham
