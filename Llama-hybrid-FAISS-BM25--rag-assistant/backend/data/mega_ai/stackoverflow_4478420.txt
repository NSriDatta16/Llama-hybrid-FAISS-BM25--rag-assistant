You have written a recursive method . You have to be sure that it will terminate by reaching the base case, otherwise it could go into a loop until a stack overflow exception occurs - which is what is happening here. The easiest way to guarantee termination is to always ensure that you get closer to your base case on every call. Your base case here is that the arguments i and j at some point must become equal, so you should try to bring them at least one closer to each other at every step. Here's the line that gives the problem: return (fillMinAverageTimeArray(i, k - 1) + fillMinAverageTimeArray(k + 1, j)); This is just going to call your method with the same values repeatedly. Are you sure you didn't mean i + 1 and j - 1 instead of k + 1 and k - 1 ?
