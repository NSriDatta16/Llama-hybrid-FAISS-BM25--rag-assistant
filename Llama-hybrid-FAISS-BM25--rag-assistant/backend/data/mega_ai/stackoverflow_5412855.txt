I see you're looking for slickiness, so I advise loading your XML file into an XML document object. Why treat the XML information as a string "soup", when it's actually neatly organised in an easily searchable hierarchy? Dim xmlDoc As Object Set xmlDoc = CreateObject("Msxml2.DOMDocument.6.0") xmlDoc.async = False ' Don't ask. xmlDoc.Load "C:\myfile.xml" 'Voil√†, your XML is loaded and parsed, ready to be searched. See documentation form XML DOMDocuments here . Then you can have random access to the data in the XML document using the XPath notation (tutorial here ), e.g. Set someElement = _ xmlDoc.selectSingleNode("//MyElementName[@MyAttributeName = 'blabla']") theStringINeed = someElement.Text where the stuff in quotes is an XPath. I'm sure you can retrieve the thing you're looking for using a single XPath statement. The XML object will do the searching for you if you tell it what you're looking for. That's what it's there for. This is really the correct way of accessing XML-formatted information. Anything else and you're really just making your own life miserable in comparison.
