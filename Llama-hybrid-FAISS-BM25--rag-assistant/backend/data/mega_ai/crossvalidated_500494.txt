How does LOESS work in STL Decomposition Algorithm?

I am trying to write a SQL program to calculate STL Decomposition of monthly time series data. In going through the algorithm in the original paper , inner loop step 2 has the detrended series grouped by sub cycle (in my case groups of months) to which LOESS smoothing is applied to produce estimated values for the data set + 6 months on either side. How does one apply Loess to sub-series groups and produce the required estimated series?
