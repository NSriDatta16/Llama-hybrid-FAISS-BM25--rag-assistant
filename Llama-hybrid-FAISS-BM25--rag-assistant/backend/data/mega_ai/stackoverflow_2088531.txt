As others have pointed out the alignment is not guaranteed by the spec. Many say it is hardware dependent, but actually it is also compiler dependent. Hardware may support many different formats. I remember that the PPC compiler support pragmas for how to "pack" the data. You could pack it on 'native' boundaries or force it to 32 bit boundaries, etc. It would be nice to understand what you are trying to do. If you are trying to 'parse' input data, you are better off with a real parser. If you are going to serialize, then write a real serializer. If you are trying to twiddle bits such as for a driver, then the device spec should give you a specific memory map to write to. Then you can write your POD structure, specify the correct alignment pragmas (if supported) and move on.
