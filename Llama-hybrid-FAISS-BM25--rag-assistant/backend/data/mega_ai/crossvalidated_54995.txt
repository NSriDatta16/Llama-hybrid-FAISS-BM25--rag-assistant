Interpretation of clusplot graph, first two PCA components only explain 50% variance

Can the clusplot graph still be used as a 2D representation of the cluster results if the first two components only explain ~50% of the total variance. Also, is it true that the points lying on the boundary of each cluster ellipse is a potential outlier for cluster. Using this graph for example, even if the first 2 PCA components only explain 50% of the variance, can i still say many of the points could belong in either cluster 1 or 2. Any guidance for plot interpretations would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
