Is there a performance penalty for storing values in the web.config compared to const fields?

currently in our application we have an ApplicationConfiguration class. It is basically just a static class with const values specifying certain application-global configuration options. Some of these values will rarely if ever change and are only put into the configuration for elegance/cleanness. . It's currently hardcoded to something like 100, which is good for all practical applications. --> Some of these values though do need to be different between production and development. So I'm considering making this class just a wrapper over Web.config. These values are checked many times throughout our codebase. If I change these from a const to a read-only getter that reads from Web.config will this affect compiler optimizations or make our application in any way slower?
