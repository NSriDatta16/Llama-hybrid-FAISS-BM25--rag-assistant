You can remove an app in your emulator via Settings->Applications->manage Applications. There you can see a list of all installed apps. If you then click on the app you want to uninstall, a screen opens, with an uninstall option. A second option for uninstall is the use of "adb uninstall". adb is a command line tool which is located under the Android SDK folder. You can find it there in a folder called "platform-tools". So you have to navigation to your SDK installation and use a terminal window to run adb there. Dragging an icon onto the trash does not uninstall an app. It only removes it's icon from the home screen.
