If you have views module available you can create a view that lists the pdfs attached to a particular node, using the node id (nid) as an argument, or use more complicated arguments if you want, as long as the fields displayed in the view are the the filefields you used for your pdf you can get pretty creative with how the pdfs are organized. It's somewhat tricky to get arguments into views blocks but it's certainly possible, using panels, or using other tricks.
