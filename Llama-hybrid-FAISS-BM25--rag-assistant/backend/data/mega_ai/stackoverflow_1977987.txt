List of deltas between ASP.NET 2.0 and ASP.NET 3.5

Is there a source for quickly getting up to speed with the general, programming deltas between ASP.NET 1.1/2.0 and ASP.NET 3.5? For example, I understand that cookies are no longer encouraged and you should use properties??? Is there a list out there somewhere?
