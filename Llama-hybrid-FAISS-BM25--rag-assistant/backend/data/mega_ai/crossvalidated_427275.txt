Interpolating time ordered smooth function into space

I am using GAMs in R to generate daily weather variables, mainly precipitation and temperature. Currently, I am fitting a model for each weather station but I would like to use it in places where there is no available data. Until now I've been using a GLM based model where coefficients can be interpolated into space fairly easy. One of my models is the following tx_fit Where tx is the current day's max temperature, tn_prev and tx_prev are the previous day's temperature, prcp_occ is precipitation occurrence, mean_tx and mean_tn are seasonal averages and doy is the day of the year. This model is fitted to each station in the network. Each smooth function is a non-parametric function so I don't have any coefficients in order to rebuild it somewhere else. Besides each station has its own function. The functions are like this: And interactions are like this: Seasonal averages will be interpolated to a regular grid and so will be the first value of the simulation. I've thought of fitting a new spline to the smooth function retrieved by the gam but I am still not sure how to interpolate it into space. Do you have any ideas on how could this be done? Can fixing the number and positions of the knots be of any help? If sample data can be of help, I will post it right away! Thank you very much and I apologise beforehand for my English! My best, Alessio UPDATE: 16/09/2019 I've created a folder in Goggle Drive where I've uploaded the code I've used to fit the models and some sample data. Code and sample data
