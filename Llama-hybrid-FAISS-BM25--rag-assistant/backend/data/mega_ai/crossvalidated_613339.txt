Can the randomness in random forests lead to some samples/features being used more/less than others, resulting in skewed and biased results?

The way I see it, is that since samples and features are chosen randomly, there is a chance, small as it may seem, that at the end of it all, some samples and some features might end up not being used at all , and some might be used a lot more than others, on average, which can lead to skewed and biased final results. Does that make sense? If yes, then is there a way to make sure that at the end, throughout the whole forest, all samples and all features would end up being used in trees on average the same amount of times, ensuring that no sample/feature would be left out?
