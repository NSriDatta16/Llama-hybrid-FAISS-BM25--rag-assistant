The "average" you're talking about is actually called the "mean". It's not exactly answering your question, but a different statistic which is not affected by outliers is the median, that is, the middle number. {90,89,92,91,5} mean: 73.4 {90,89,92,91,5} median: 90 This might be useful to you, I dunno.
