This is a late reply, nevertheless I hope it adds something. I have been trained in telecommunication where most of the time we use the Bayesian approach. Here is a simple example: Suppose you can transmit four possible signals of +5, +2.5, -2.5, and -5 volts. One of the signals from this set is transmitted, but the signal is corrupted by Gaussian noise by the time it reaches the receiving end. In practice, the signal is also attenuated, but we will drop this issue for simplicity. The question is: If you are at the receiving end, how do you design a detector that tell you which one of these signals was originally transmitted? This problem obviously lies in the domain of hypothesis testing. However, you can't use p-values, since significance testing can potentially reject all four possible hypotheses, and you know that one of these signals was actually transmitted. We can use Neyman-Pearson method to design a detector in principle, but this method works best for binary hypotheses. For multiple hypotheses, it becomes too clumsy when you need to deal with a number constrains for false alarm probabilities. A simple alternative is given by the Bayesian hypothesis testing. Any of these signals could have been chosen to be transmitted, so the prior is equiprobable. In such equiprobable cases, the method boils down to choosing the signal with maximum likelihood. This method can be given a nice geometric interpretation: choose the signal which happens to be closest to the received signal. This also leads to the partition of the decision space into a number of decision regions, such that if the received signal were to fall within a particular region, then it is decided that the hypothesis associated with that decision region is true. Thus the design of a detector is made easy.
