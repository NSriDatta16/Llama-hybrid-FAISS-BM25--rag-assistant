Paired vs unpaired t test

You are testing the effect of a compound (X) on mammalian cell size. You have chosen HeLa cell lines to do your experiments. The experiment included growing HeLa cells in their standard culture medium (control group) and standard culture + X (Treatment group). Following is the data on average cell diameter (in um) in replicate plates. So to find whether there is any effect of the compound on cell size, which test would you perform paired or unpaired t test for this ? Please answer.
