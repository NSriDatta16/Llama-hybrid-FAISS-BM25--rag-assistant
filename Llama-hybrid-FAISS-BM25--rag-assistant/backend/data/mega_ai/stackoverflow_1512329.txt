SQL Server Express has some limitations but I don't know what you exactly mean by importing and exporting data. It does well for most small apps. I would consider the features I use in the application and the database size/CPU/memory requirement to see if SQL Server Express is applicable or not. No, you can't use a single CAL for a Web application . For externally focused server applications. Processor licensing is a better choice for externally focused server applications, such as Internet and extranet scenarios . It is often difficult to count devices or users in these scenarios, so hardware-based pricing is more straightforward. Also noted here : Multiplexing: Use of Middleware, Transaction Servers, and Multitiered architectures Sometimes organizations develop network scenarios that use various forms of hardware and/or software that reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software on a particular server, often called multiplexing or pooling hardware or software. Use of such multiplexing or pooling hardware and/or software does not reduce the number of CALs required to access or use SQL Server software. A CAL is required for each distinct device or user that is connected to the multiplexing or pooling software or hardware front end. I suggest you consider SQL Server 2008 Web Edition
