References to self-created environments in latex

How is possible to define labels and corresponding references to a self-defined environment within latex? Example: \newcounter{fpcounter} \newenvironment{fp}[2] { \stepcounter{fpcounter} \label{#1} \textbf{Problem~\arabic{fpcounter}} } {} Any references to the included label though get redirected to the surrounding section/subsection/paragraph though. Any hints? Thanks a lot.
