Which indicators to use for measuring stochastic-volatility behaviour and/or seasonal effects?

Context I have a vector with 1000 time series, I would like to create a workflow to classify them as described in the following pseudocode: Time_series ( is a vector of time series) For ts in time_series: Idx1=Meassure_index_1(ts) Idx2=Meassure_index_2(ts) If idx1 >= yield: # is a seasonal time series If idx2 >= yield: # is a stochastic-volatility time series Which index could I use to avoid visualizing them in order to classify them?
