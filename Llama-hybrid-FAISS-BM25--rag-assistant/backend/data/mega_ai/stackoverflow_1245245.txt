jQuery date/time picker

I've been looking around for a decent jQuery plugin that can handle both dates and times. The core UI DatePicker is great, but unfortunately I need to be able to take time in as well. I've found a few hacks for the DatePicker to work with times, but they all seem pretty inelegant and Google isn't turning up anything nice. Is there a good jQuery plugin for selecting dates and times in a single UI control with a usable interface?
