Should I use regularization every time?

I have learned regularization for linear and logistic regression but when I implement that algorithm to my code generally my estimates not changing.I mean,it looks like ineffective.I know,it's for overfitting.So if I use it in my code every time ,could it be a problem? or is this a good thing?
