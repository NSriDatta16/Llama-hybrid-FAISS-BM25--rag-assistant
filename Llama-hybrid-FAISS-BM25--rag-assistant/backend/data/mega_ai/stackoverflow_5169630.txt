Magento Collections and Many to Many relationships & crud

I haven't found a very convenient way of making a collection from a many to many relationship. Ideally, I'd like to be able to call the toArray() method and end up with something like: id => 1, value_field => array('foo','bar') id => 2, value_filed => array('baz', 'qux') .. To complicate this, i'd like to be able to load this many to many relationship into a backend CRUD and on save, update the proper values in the linkage table. I'm currently thinking about using an afterLoad and afterSave to build and save the collection / POSTed data, but I've seen this done in a more pratical/automagic way in other frameworks an cant see that Magento hasn't handled this. Any suggestions?
