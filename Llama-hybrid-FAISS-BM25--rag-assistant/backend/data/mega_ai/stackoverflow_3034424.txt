I believe the problem is that the fragment identifier causes the container to scroll before the page scrolls. After the page is complete the container element has a scrollTop value of "16". Here's what I did in greasemonkey in Firefox to recover the missing area. window.addEventListener('scroll', function(e) { var cont = document.getElementById("container"); if ( cont.scrollTop > 0) cont.scrollTop = 0; }, false ); What that, when you scroll back to the top, the missing space is shown. As a solution, I don't like it at all, but it demonstrates where your problem lies and maybe others can think of a cleaner way of fixing the container's scrollTop to 0.
