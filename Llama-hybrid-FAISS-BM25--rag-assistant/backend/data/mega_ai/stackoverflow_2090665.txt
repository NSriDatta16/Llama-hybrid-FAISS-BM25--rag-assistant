I'm still a novice with Magento, but did some research on your problem that you may find helpful. It looks like this thread over at the official Magento forums has some good suggestions: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/31791/ It may be your problem is caused by either permissions problems on your filesystem, or a corrupt core extension. I would say that if you can't resolve your problem based on any of the advice in that thread, your best bet would be to uncomment: ini_set('display_errors', 1); in your magento/index.php file and post here any error messages you get when trying to access Magento Connect. Good luck!
