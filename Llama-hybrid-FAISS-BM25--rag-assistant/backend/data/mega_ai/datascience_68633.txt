Solve an equation using machine learning

Imagine we have the following equation: y=xz. We have y but not other ones. Note that y is like a matrix and we could as many sample we want. It is the values obtained from sensors. This means it will be a m*n dataset where m represents number of samples and n represents the number of sensors. I am wondering whether we can use machine learning techniques (any method including GAN) to solve the equation and get at least one of the variables of x or z. Thanks.
