It seems to me that this is a "has" relationship. If you have a PhoneNumber element, then it should have a property that is of type PhoneNumberType. Rather than messing around with validating and restrictions, I would suggest that you turn PhoneNumber into a complex element and make PhoneNumberType a required property of it.
