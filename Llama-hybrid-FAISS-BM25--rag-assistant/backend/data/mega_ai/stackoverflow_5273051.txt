Stopwatch class that shows min, max, average, ... times?

I am looking for a java class that simulates a StopWatch (like Spring's StopWatch or Commons' StopWatch ) but that would give minimum, maximum and average times. Preferable also average over last n runs as well. Is there such a thing or do I just build it myself? regards, Wim
