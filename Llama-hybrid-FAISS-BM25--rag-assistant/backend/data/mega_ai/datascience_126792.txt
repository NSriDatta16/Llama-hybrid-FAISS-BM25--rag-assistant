Why Latent Space in Stable Diffusion has shape 64x64x3?

I am wondering why the dimensionality of Latent Space in Stable Diffusion is 64x64x3 . Since the encoding is performed by Variational Autoencoder it must output some mean and log variance that we can use to sample a latent vector of shape (latent_dim, ) . But how Stable Diffusion uses 64x64x3 latent space when we expect shape (latent, ) ?
