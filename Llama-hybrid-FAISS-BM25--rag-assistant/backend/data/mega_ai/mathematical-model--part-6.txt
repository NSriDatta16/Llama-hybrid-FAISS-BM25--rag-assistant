s between the different variables. Examples One of the popular examples in computer science is the mathematical models of various machines, an example is the deterministic finite automaton (DFA) which is defined as an abstract mathematical concept, but due to the deterministic nature of a DFA, it is implementable in hardware and software for solving various specific problems. For example, the following is a DFA M with a binary alphabet, which requires that the input contains an even number of 0s: M = ( Q , Σ , δ , q 0 , F ) {\displaystyle M=(Q,\Sigma ,\delta ,q_{0},F)} where Q = { S 1 , S 2 } , {\displaystyle Q=\{S_{1},S_{2}\},} Σ = { 0 , 1 } , {\displaystyle \Sigma =\{0,1\},} q 0 = S 1 , {\displaystyle q_{0}=S_{1},} F = { S 1 } , {\displaystyle F=\{S_{1}\},} and δ {\displaystyle \delta } is defined by the following state-transition table: The state S 1 {\displaystyle S_{1}} represents that there has been an even number of 0s in the input so far, while S 2 {\displaystyle S_{2}} signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained an even number of 0s or not. If the input did contain an even number of 0s, M {\displaystyle M} will finish in state S 1 , {\displaystyle S_{1},} an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted. The language recognized by M {\displaystyle M} is the regular language given by the regular expression 1*( 0 (1*) 0 (1*) )*, where "*" is the Kleene star, e.g., 1* denotes any non-negative number (possibly zero) of symbols "1". Many everyday activities carried out without a thought are uses of mathematical models. A geographical map projection of a region of the earth onto a small, plane surface is a model which can be used for many purposes such as planning travel. Another simple activity is predicting the position of a vehicle from its initial position, direction and speed of travel, using the equation that distance traveled is the product of time and speed. This is known as dead reckoning when used more formally. Mathematical modeling in this way does not necessarily require formal mathematics; animals have been shown to use dead reckoning. Population Growth. A simple (though approximate) model of population growth is the Malthusian growth model. A slightly more realistic and largely used population growth model is the logistic function, and its extensions. Model of a particle in a potential-field. In this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass which describes a trajectory in space which is modeled by a function giving its coordinates in space as a function of time. The potential field is given by a function V : R 3 → R {\displaystyle V\!:\mathbb {R} ^{3}\!\to \mathbb {R} } and the trajectory, that is a function r : R → R 3 , {\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \!:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb {R} ^{3},} is the solution of the differential equation: − d 2 r ( t ) d t 2 m = ∂ V [ r ( t ) ] ∂ x x ^ + ∂ V [ r ( t ) ] ∂ y y ^ + ∂ V [ r ( t ) ] ∂ z z ^ , {\displaystyle -{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}\mathbf {r} (t)}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}m={\frac {\partial V[\mathbf {r} (t)]}{\partial x}}\mathbf {\hat {x}} +{\frac {\partial V[\mathbf {r} (t)]}{\partial y}}\mathbf {\hat {y}} +{\frac {\partial V[\mathbf {r} (t)]}{\partial z}}\mathbf {\hat {z}} ,} that can be written also as m d 2 r ( t ) d t 2 = − ∇ V [ r ( t ) ] . {\displaystyle m{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}\mathbf {r} (t)}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}=-\nabla V[\mathbf {r} (t)].} Note this model assumes the particle is a point mass, which is certainly known to be false in many cases in which we use this model; for example, as a model of planetary motion. Model of rational behavior for a consumer. In this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of n {\displaystyle n} commodities labeled 1 , 2 , … , n {\displaystyle 1,2,\dots ,n} each with a market price p 1 , p 2 , … , p n . {\displaystyle p_{1},p_{2},\dots ,p_{n}.} The consumer is assumed to have an ordinal utility functio
