In any discrete choice model, there are two types of variables: those that vary across the alternatives, and those that are constant for each decision maker. The first become generic coefficients, and the second are alternative-specific . There is one generic $\beta$ that is the same for all alternatives, but each alternative has its own alternative-specific $\beta$. So for $J$ alternatives, each alternative-specific variable creates $J-1$ parameters. In a typical discrete choice model, this isn't a problem. But a residential location choice model usually has $J$ somewhere near 1000. It is impractical to consider 999 different parameters for a single variable. This is why variables that do not vary across alternatives (like a person's income) are usually interacted with variables that do (like the average cost of a home in each zone). In standard econometrics, we typically include the non-interacted components to separate correlation between income and home price as much as possible. But in your problem, you don't really have a choice.
