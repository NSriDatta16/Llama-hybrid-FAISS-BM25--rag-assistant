It is not a commercial/free issue only. You have other things to take in account. Some font licenses allows embedding (in a document, for example) while others don't. AINAL but I think some commercial fonts allowing embedding might prohibit a person holding a document to reuse the distributed font. Note that most fonts (at least the commercial ones) have license metadata: you can see it with an hex editor, or some appropriate reader. I used to install a Microsoft shell extension adding font information tab(s) to the properties of the file. A useful tool.
