Best way to shutdown an OSGi Container (specifically equinox)

I'm looking for a best practice on shutting down an OSGi container. Currently we are using a small launcher app which calls EclipseStarter.startup() and installs some core bundles. After that the launcher terminates. When the test GUI (running as a bundle) is closed it calls a System.exit(0) to shutdown the container, but there must be a more elegant solution than this. Thanks
