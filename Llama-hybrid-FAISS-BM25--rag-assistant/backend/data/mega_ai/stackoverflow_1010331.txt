Tools to convert html layouts to Silverlight 3.0

I have a couple of applications for clients that were dragged into the web kicking and screaming. I'd like to take a crack at moving some to Silverlight 3.0 if even just as a proof of concept exercise. I'd like to see if I could make them full apps, layout and all. I think the layout of the web app along w/ the graphics is good and don't want to lose that aspect. Which leads to my question, are there tools to convert existing HTML/graphics to Xaml? I'd rather use SL 3.0 navigation and not embed Silverlight xaps on every page as I would have to do w/ an ASP.NET MVC / Silverlight type solution. Thanks.
