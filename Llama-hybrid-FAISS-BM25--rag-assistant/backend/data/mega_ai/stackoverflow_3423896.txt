Implementing a simple UI editor in Java

I'm thinking about writing a simple UI designer in Java. I'm just playing with ideas at the moment to see if it is feasible. It would be good to have something like this as all of our UIs are generated from XML. Just wondering if anyone has tried anything like this before. I know there will be a lot of effort in doing something like this. Does anyone know of any 3rd party products that already do something like this? If not then at a simple level, it will have drag and drop support for any component that can be positioned on a panel. Then extra bits will be added. Are there any good samples on the net for this? Cheers
