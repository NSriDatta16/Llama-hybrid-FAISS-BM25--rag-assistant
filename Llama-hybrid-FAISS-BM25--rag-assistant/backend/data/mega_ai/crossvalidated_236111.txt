How to find the best set of parameters for XGboost

I am using XGboost as a learning engine and I am getting a good results with default configurations. Now, I want to improve the predication by tuning the parameters, however, the list of parameters is pretty long. Is there a systematic way to find the best set of parameters? and which parameters could significantly affect the prediction accuracy?
