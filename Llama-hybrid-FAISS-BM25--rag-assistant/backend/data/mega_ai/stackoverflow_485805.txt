If you build a shed and use a hammer 80-90% of the time, does it follow that you should use only hammers to build sheds? No, you use the most appropriate tools for each part of the job, just as you have done! Also the average skills/experience level of the IT work-force has increased in recent years. E.g. This SO Poll showed the medium SO programmer is in their 30's with over 10 years experience. You boss will have no problem recruiting programmers with a broad mix of skills and experience.
