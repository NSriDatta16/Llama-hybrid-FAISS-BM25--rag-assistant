createDocumentFragment and jQuery

i have a big table and need to set CSS-classes on it etc. So i clone the table into a documentFragment to prevent the browsers reflow for each touched DOM-property etc. The Problem is, i set much of $.data and have $.live events appended to the tables TD's. So the question is, how can i preserve the $.data of the table for the new table?
