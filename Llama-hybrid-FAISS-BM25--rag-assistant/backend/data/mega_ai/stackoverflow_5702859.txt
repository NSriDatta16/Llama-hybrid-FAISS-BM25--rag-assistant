Pagination logic for html page[Android Ebpub Reader]

I have been developing Android epub reader application, Using which I can Read Epubs, page by page even if it's font sizes have changed.All I need to do is to paginate html page, So That I can give a user book-like reading experience.that html page will contain images. Currently I tried to implement it using Columising html page using following CSS Style. sytle=" body {width:"+displayWidth+"px; height:"+displayHeight+"px;-webkit-column-gap:"+pagegap+"px; -webkit-column-width:"+width+"px; -webkit-column-height:" +displayHeight+"px; text-align:justify ;} "; But problem with this approach is it show some images splitted ,which will be in different columns.right and bottom of paragraph get clipped It Also have some Performance problem. Is there is any better way to do pagination or Atleast How can I solve this splitting of image problem Any informative links and hints all are welcome. Thanks for your time. Regards, Kariyachan
