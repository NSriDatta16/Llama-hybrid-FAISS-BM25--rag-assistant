The short answer - No. The long answer - no, since the code relies on the presence of a SMTP server running on the local machine, and listening on port 25. The SMTP server (technically the MTA or Mail Transfer Agent) is responsible for communicating with the Mail User Agent (MUA, which in this case is the Java process) to receive outgoing emails. Now, MTAs are typically responsible for receiving mails from users for a particular domain. So, for the domain gmail.com, it would be the Google mail servers that are responsible for authenticating mail user agents and hence transferring of mails to inboxes on the GMail servers. I'm not sure if GMail trusts open mail relay servers, but it is certainly not an easy task to perform authentication on behalf on Google, and then relay mail to the GMail servers. If you read the JavaMail FAQ on using JavaMail to accessing GMail , you'll notice that the hostname and the port happen to be pointing to the GMail servers, and certainly not to localhost. If you intend to use your local machine, you'll need to perform either relaying or forwarding. You'll probably need to understand the SMTP protocol in depth if you intend to get anywhere when it comes to SMTP. You can start with the Wikipedia article on SMTP , but any further progress will actually necessitate programming against a SMTP server.
