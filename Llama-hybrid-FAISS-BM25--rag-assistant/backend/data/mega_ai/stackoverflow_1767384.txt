How can I get a recursive full-path listing, one line per file?

How can I spit out a flat list of recursive one-per-line paths? For example, I just want a flat listing of files with their full paths: /home/dreftymac/. /home/dreftymac/foo.txt /home/dreftymac/bar.txt /home/dreftymac/stackoverflow /home/dreftymac/stackoverflow/alpha.txt /home/dreftymac/stackoverflow/bravo.txt /home/dreftymac/stackoverflow/charlie.txt ls -a1 almost does what I need, but I do not want path fragments, I want full paths.
