I think you're really trying to ask "How can I return an object created inside my function?" There are several valid ways: Allocate on the heap and return a pointer Use an automatic variable and return its value, not a pointer (the compiler will copy it) Let the caller provide storage, either by pointer or reference parameter, and build your object there.
