Training Set, Validation Set and Test Set for Time Series

I have monthly time series data on stock prices from January 1990 to August 2023. I tend to use walk-forward validation to compare the forecasting performance of ARIMA and LSTM models on this time series. I split the time series as follows: Sub-training : January 1990 to December 2020 Training : January 1990 to December 2021 Validation : January 2021 to December 2021 Test : January 2022 to August 2023 For the LSTM part, 9 models (3 values for the number of units and 3 values for the number of lags) are going to be trained and a forecasting model will be selected using the following steps: Training the 9 LSTM models on the sub-training set. Evaluating the performance of the models on the validation set . Selecting the model with the minimum validation RMSE . Building the selected model on the training set . Implementing a walk-forward forecast for test set using the selected model and calculating the test RMSE I hope I have been clear enough and I would appreciate your feedback on whether the split sets and the above steps I have chosen are reasonable.
