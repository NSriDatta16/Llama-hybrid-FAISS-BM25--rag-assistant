Is there any good reason why your reputation system exist? Joel Spolsky's Building Communities with Software mentioned that if you want your users to participate, you shouldn't be making it hard. By setting up a complicated reputation system, aren't you limiting your community too much? In software, as in architecture, design decisions are just as important to the type of community that develops or fails to develop. When you make something easy, people do it more often. When you make something hard, people do it less often. In this way you can gently encourage people to behave in certain ways which determine the character and quality of the community. Will it feel friendly? Is there thick conversation, a European salon full of intellectuals with interesting ideas? Or is the place deserted, with a few dirty advertising leaflets lying around on the floor that nobody has bothered to pick up?
