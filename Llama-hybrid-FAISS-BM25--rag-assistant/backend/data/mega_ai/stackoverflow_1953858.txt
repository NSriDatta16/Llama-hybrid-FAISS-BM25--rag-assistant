I suppose you are starting in debug mode. This mode can be up to 3 times slower than normal mode. But there might be also a problem when switching from JDK5 to JDK6. I found this solution here on the net: I've solved that. It's a debugging issue. I've changed my debug settings from: wrapper.java.additional.26=-Xdebug wrapper.java.additional.27=-Xnoagent wrapper.java.additional.28=-Djava.compiler=NONE wrapper.java.additional.27=-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=7199,server=y,suspend=n to: wrapper.java.additional.26=-Xdebug wrapper.java.additional.27=-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=7199,server=y,suspend=n and JBoss becomes fast again. Hope this helps.
