Sure; it'll be framework and architecture dependent though. C# WPF will have a different way to do it then C# WinForms which will be different than Java Swing. For Winforms, you'll simply create a Graphics object based on some area of your form bounded by a control (like a Panel or PictureBox), then on that Control's MouseClick event, log the mouse's current location and draw a line between that location and the location of the previous click (or all other clicks). If you want to drag and drop, like from a toolbar, that's a little more complex; basically you need to track what you dragged and where you dropped it so when you drop it you can perform the proper action. I believe the arguments you'll get in the DragDrop handler will give you this information.
