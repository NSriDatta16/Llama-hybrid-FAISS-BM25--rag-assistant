For the second part Magento already shows only products relevant to a given store. When you set up the stores (in System > Store Management ) you have the option of giving it a unique "root category". Creating root categories is easy, in Catalog > Manage Categories . The first part requires some programming work. From your previous questions it looks like you have a good understanding of Javascript so AJAX is not a problem. I don't know how familiar you might be with PHP, listing products will require you create a new module, with it's own controller, that forms a collection from the selected category. Collections make their own queries so you don't need to write a lick of SQL, and they have functions for exporting as JSON or XML so you don't need to write that either. For an experienced programmer it would take almost no time at all.
