Pulling in Date or other mixed-data column items in the past has bit me with Excel. It seems that their provider "peeks" ahead XX rows (depending on Provider version) to determine what the column type is at runtime . The prior answers that apply properties to your connection have helped me in the past, but do not help when you have BLANK dates and/or different values in the column itself - it confuses the Excel driver. What I recommend is that you use FileHelpers or another third-party library instead. Infragistics Excel component has treated me very well, while FileHelpers is opensource.
