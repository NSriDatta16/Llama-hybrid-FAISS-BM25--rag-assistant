Scikit-learn has recently released new transformers that tackle many aspects of feature engineering. For example: You can do multiple missing data imputation techniques with the SimpleImputer ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html ), including mean, median and arbitrary value imputation in both numerical and categorical variables. You can do multivariate imputation using several estimators, like Bayes, random forest and others (equivalent to R's MICE, Amelia and MissForest) with the IterativeImputer ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html#sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer ) You can do categorical one hot encoding with the OneHotEncoder() from Scikit-learn You can encode categorical variables by numbers with the LabelEncoder . You can do Yeo-Johnson variable transformation with the PowerTransformer ( http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer.html ) You can do discretisation with the KBinsDiscretiser ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_discretization.html ) There are potentially other feature engineering transformers in Scikit-learn and the developers update the library quite regularly. As an alternative to the well known Scikit-learn library, there is a new recently released open source library called feature-engine . With feature engine you can: Do mean, median, arbitrary, end of tail and random imputation in numerical and categorical variables Do various types of categorical encoding, including one hot, integer, ordinal, mean encoding and weight of evidence. Do various variable transformations including log, reciprocal, exp and box cox Various types of discretisation including equal frequency, equal distance and tree based Outlier handling. More details in the github repo and docs ( https://feature-engine.trainindata.com ) Disclaimer: I created feature engine and made it open source. Another open source python package allows for different types of categorical variable encoding: https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/
