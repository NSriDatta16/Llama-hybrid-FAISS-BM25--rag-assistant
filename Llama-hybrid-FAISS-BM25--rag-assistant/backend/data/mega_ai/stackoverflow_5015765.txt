If you upgrade magento : turn off your theme and reset to default turn off all custom extensions used upgrade version by version (if you use 1.3.2.4 today you have to apply all versions between latest to make it work flawlessly) turn on and debug your template turn on extensions one by one and debug database upgrades are handled by versions setup scripts To illustrate this: you need 2 git repositories . One for magento version and one for your own site make a git repo of needed magento versions with this bash script http://pastie.org/1573801 next up you have to copy your own site , unify the line endings (so it can be compared to original magento version) and make it as a git repo , it can be done manually or with rsync, I prefer rsync way make a empty dir and init this a s a git repo, pull your clean magento version to it like git pull ../magento magento-1.3.2.4 copy over your live site and you can perform a git status to see what you have added, changed move or discard any changes that have been made to core files, move edits in default templates under your own theme commit your changes , add extensions and so on , ignore what's not needed in .gitignore turn off your template, and disable extensions (move them out from app/etc/modules/ folder) perform a git pull ../magento magento-nextversion as this will merge all changes and eliminate all deleted files from new magento version visit your site frontpage and see how it is upgraded repeat the git pull nextversion and home page visiting with each version you need to upgrade , commit between if you need start enabling your theme and extensions one by one Now you can make a shell or python , ruby or whatever script to automate this for you. My experience says that all this (with generating magento repos, copying live database to dev, rsyncing needed files, upgrading in a loop) will take less tan 5 mins from 1.3.2.4 to 1.5.0.1 if automated
