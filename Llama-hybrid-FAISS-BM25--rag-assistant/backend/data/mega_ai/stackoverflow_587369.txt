javax.crypto has AES support: http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Security/AES/AES_v1.html As for secure key storage, the usual method is to derive an encryption key from user input (a passphrase) using a cryptographic hash function, and use the derived key to encrypt the keychain. Or, if you only need one key, you can use the derived key itself. Always keep in mind that the security of the system is directly related to the strength of the hash function used. Use a cryptographically secure hash function, along with a salt if possible, and hash more than once (hundreds of times, for example). That being said, the question is very vague.
