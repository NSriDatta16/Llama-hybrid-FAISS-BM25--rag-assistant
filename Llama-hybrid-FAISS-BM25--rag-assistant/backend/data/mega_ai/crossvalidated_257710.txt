This is obviously a self-study problem, and the first thing you should do is to edit your question to include the self-study tag. The second thing you should do is to draw a sketch of the plane with coordinate axes $x_1$ and $x_2$ and indicate on it which region of the plane it is on which the joint pdf has value $\frac 12$. Then set up the double integral that you need to compute, taking particular care about the limits. Don't wing it; look at the diagram very very carefully and pay attention to the fact that you have a nested integral in which, as far as the inner integral with respect to $x_2$ is concerned, $x_1$ is just some fixed number in $(0,4)$, say $\pi$ if you have difficulty thinking of one. For this value of $x_1$, for what values of $x_2$ is the joint pdf $f(\pi,x_2)$ nonzero? Plug in the formula and don't forget to replace all occurrences of $x_1$ by $\pi$, on the left side as well as the right side. Actually, if you have any memory of what you were taught in calculus about what an integral is calculating and what a double integral is calculating, you might be able to deduce the value of the double integral from a formula that you most likely had to memorize in middle school but since then have forgotten.
