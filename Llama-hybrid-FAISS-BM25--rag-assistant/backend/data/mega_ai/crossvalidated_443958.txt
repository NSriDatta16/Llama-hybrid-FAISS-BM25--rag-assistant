In my view, MCMC/bootstrapping/permutation methods all fall under the category of computational techniques . They aren't tied down to a specific approach or way of thinking about a problem but rather an algorithmic approach to a class of problems. Techniques that involve resampling and iteration don't arise from a machine learning framework, they come out of mathematical theory; the main factor in their recent popularity in solving more classical statistical problems is simply computing power, not something borrowed from machine learning. There is very little in machine learning that cannot be motivated in some way from classical statistics and the related mathematics. I think it will always be easy to identify certain approaches that are "pure" machine learning, especially deep learning approaches, and more generally the "black box" machine learning approaches that are solely concerned with prediction. There will always be classical statistical approaches that don't relate to machine learning in any way. However, trying to draw any distinct boundary between them in the gray area is as fraught as trying to discriminate physics and chemistry where they intersect.
