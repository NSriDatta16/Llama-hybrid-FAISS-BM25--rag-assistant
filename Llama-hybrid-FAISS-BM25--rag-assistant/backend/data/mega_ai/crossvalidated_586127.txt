How to predict Long term time series?

I am working on a time series problem where I am trying to predict the temperature of a product in a refrigerator by using the information about the temperature of the air in the refrigerator with respect to time. So in our case temperature of the air is the independent variable and temperature of product is the dependent variable. We are getting the temperature of air and product every one minute (for training the model). Lets say for example the temperature of the air in the refrigerator fluctuates between 2°C to 6°C, then the temperature of a particular product may fluctuate from 3°C to 5°C and the problem statement is to predict accurately these fluctuation in the temperature of the product by using the fluctuation in the air. If I get the temperature of both the air and product every minute, I am able to predict the fluctuations in the temperature of the product by using the fluctuations of air with an error of 0.25°C using ARIMA (as I have the latest temperature of both, air and product and by using the historical values I am able to get very good accuracy). But the challenge here is to make the future point in time predictions just by looking at the temperature of air at the particular moment for let say next 3 months. Because the temperature of the product will not be available in future. So in this case we will have the historical values of air and product temperature for some time but the future predictions have to be made using the temperature of air only. So currently we are stuck in making long time series predictions, if anyone has any expertise in working on long time series prediction problem. Any suggestions/help is really appreciated.
