Barplot totals by month with ggplot?

I have time series data (I've posted it here as a data.frame): x What's the best way to plot this as a bar plot in ggplot that would show the total value per month (with the month name as text)? I can do this manually by adding a month field: x$month Then plotting this independently, but the months are not ordered correctly using this approach (suppose that I need to create an ordered factor?); I am also presuming that there's an "easier" way with ggplot.
