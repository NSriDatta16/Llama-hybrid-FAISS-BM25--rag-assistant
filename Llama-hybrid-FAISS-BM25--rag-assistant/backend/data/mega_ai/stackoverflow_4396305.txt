Android Autocomplete Textview Filtering

I have an AutoCompleteTextview but default filtering is not good for me. eg: The string "hum" should match to Hohum Plumbing, Humphrey Bogart, and Robert Mitchum , but currently, it is not happening. Currently, I am passing ArrayList and creating adapter. Now how can I customize the filtering?
