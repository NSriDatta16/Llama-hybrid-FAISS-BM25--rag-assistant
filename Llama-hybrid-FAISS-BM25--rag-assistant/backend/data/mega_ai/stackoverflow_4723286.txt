SugarCRM: Custom Module assigned_to_user field not saving 'id' value

I'm designing a Custom Module named Agents, using ModuleBuilder in SugarCE 6.0.0 . The module is based on Accounts. In Studio, when I click on assigned_user_name from the Assignable section and save it, it generates two fields, namely: assigned_user_name _id_c When I deployed the package and tried to pick a username from the assigned to field, at first it wouldn't fetch any results at all (neither through autofill nor popup). I checked out the custom/modulebuilder/packages/MyPackage/modules/Agents/vardefs.php , here's what I found: '_id_c' => array ( 'required' => false, 'name' => '_id_c', 'vname' => '', 'type' => 'id', 'massupdate' => 0, 'comments' => '', 'help' => '', 'importable' => 'true', 'duplicate_merge' => 'disabled', 'duplicate_merge_dom_value' => 0, 'audited' => false, 'reportable' => true, 'len' => 36, 'size' => '20', ), 'assigned_user_name' => array ( 'required' => true, 'name' => 'assigned_user_name', 'link' => 'assigned_user_link', 'vname' => 'LBL_ASSIGNED_TO_NAME', 'rname' => 'name', 'type' => 'relate', 'reportable' => true, 'source' => 'non-db', 'table' => 'users', 'id_name' => '_id_c', 'module' => '', 'duplicate_merge' => 'disabled', 'massupdate' => 0, 'comments' => '', 'help' => '', 'importable' => 'true', 'duplicate_merge_dom_value' => '0', 'audited' => true, 'len' => '255', 'size' => '20', 'ext2' => '', 'quicksearch' => 'enabled', 'studio' => 'visible', ), Note that the module option in assigned_user_name is not being set to the right value. First question: Is this a Studio bug? My quick fix was to set module => 'Users' and it worked. I was now able to select the username from a dropdown (autofill) list. However, selecting a username still doesn't populate the hidden _id_c field with the 36 Char UUID of the user and hence, when I save the record and reload it, the assigned_user_name field remains blank. Does anyone have an idea as to why this is happening? And any remedies for this? Thanks, m^e
