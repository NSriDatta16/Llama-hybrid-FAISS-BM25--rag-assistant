determing the height in pixels of a gridview on an asp.net page at runtime?

Anyone know if it possible at run-time to know how many pixels high an asp.net gridview is? I have a gridview on the left of my page. On the right side, I populate with random images that vary in height and I would like to (as close as possible) match the total height of the gridview with the sum total heights of the pictures on the right. (The code keeps checking for pictures until it find ones with the right height). I can approximate the height by knowing the number of rows (gridview.rows.count * an average row height), but since row heights can vary depending on if they are long lines wrapping, I'd prefer to try and get a better height estimate... Thx!
