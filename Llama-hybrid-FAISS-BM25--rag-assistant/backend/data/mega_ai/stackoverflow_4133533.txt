I don't know of doing what you are asking, but if you currently use Resharper (or are interested in trialing or buying it) then it includes a File Structure window in which you can easily change the order of class members, classes themselves and regions simply by dragging them around. In addition it adds keyboard shortcuts for moving whole methods up and down within a type. Beyond these simple rearrangement functions, it also has a wealth of refactorings for moving methods within the type hierachy, extracting interfaces, &c.
