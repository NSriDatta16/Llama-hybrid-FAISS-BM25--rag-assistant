ValueError: Found array with 0 sample(s) (shape=(0, 13)) while a minimum of 1 is required

I am new to this logistic regression and finding this error. Please help. solver='lbfgs' def lr_model(X_train, y_train): # import the LogisticRegression class from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression # create the model object model = LogisticRegression() # fit the model to the training data model.fit(X_train, y_train) #error here time.sleep(0.1) #return the fitted model return model # Test tmp_model = lr_model(X_train[0:12], y_train[0:12] ) #showing error here print(tmp_model.predict(X_train[4:5])) print(tmp_model.predict(X_train[5:6]))
