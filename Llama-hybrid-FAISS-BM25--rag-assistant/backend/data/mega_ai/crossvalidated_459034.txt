Generally, the rare event variables will lead to very high uncertainty around their coefficients unless their effect is huge. They lead to collinearity issues too. Consider their correlation with the constant term (intercept). If your data set is very large, the rare occurences of non zero in your rare event variable will be averaged out, and Pearson correlation will be close to 1 between the variable and the intercept. This can mess up both of them. Conceptually, there's very little data to estimate the coefficients of these variables. The sample size effectively shrinks to the number of non-zero occurrences of the variable in the data set, then you have the impact of all other variables, so you end up with high number of variables to estimate on a very small effective data set. In some MSAs, like Beverly Hills or Comptons, the famous person is in every other house.
