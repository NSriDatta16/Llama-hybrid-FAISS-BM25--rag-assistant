Adding item to NSPasteboard using "setData"?

Im learning how to do drag and drop to allow ordering of items in an NSOutlineView. (Its my first time using NSPasteboard). From the slightly related examples I found online, it seems you use: [pasteboard setData: data forType: @"myapptype"]; What should be put into the NSData when you are doing a move. The samples put an archived version of the object as the data. The object attributes could possibly change while the item is being dragged, so doest it make sense that instead I stuff a pointer to the object in there?
