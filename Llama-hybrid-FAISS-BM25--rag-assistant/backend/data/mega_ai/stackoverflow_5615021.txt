Spontaneous CSS Problems

I was working on the print CSS for a webpage of mine, and for some impossible reason, my website's CSS (as presented to a computer screen) became very odd. Firebug says that a user agent stylesheet is causing portions of my page to have enormous margins in random places for no reason. I have no idea how this could have possibly been caused. Anyway, to begin, how can I get rid of user agent stylesheets?
