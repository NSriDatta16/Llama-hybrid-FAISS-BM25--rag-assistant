You can run a JScript script from a batch-file with the command-line based scripting host CScript.exe . You would need the script in a separate file though which you pass as an argument to CScript.exe. If you want to keep everything in a single file, you can embed the JScript code in you batch-file, dump it to a temporary file which you pass to CScript.exe and delete the temporary script file afterwards. There might be more elegant solutions (hopefully)
