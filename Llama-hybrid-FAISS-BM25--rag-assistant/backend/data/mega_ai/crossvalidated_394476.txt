Moving Average Method

Suppose I have data for 6 months: $2,5,1,9,3,4$ . If I calculate 3 months moving average, then from this data, I get two average $2.667(=\frac{2+5+1}{3})$ and $5.333(=\frac{9+3+4}{3})$ . But if I have data for only 5 months, $2,5,1,9,3$ , and I want to calculate moving average, how can I calculate it?
