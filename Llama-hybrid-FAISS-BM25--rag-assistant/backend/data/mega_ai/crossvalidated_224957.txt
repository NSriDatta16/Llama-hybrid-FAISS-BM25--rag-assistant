What is the value of linear dimensionality reduction in the presence of nonlinear alternatives?

From the results I've seen, manifold learning methods seem to generally outperform PCA for complicated, very high-dimensional datasets like images or videos. This makes sense to me, since nonlinear dimensionality reduction (like manifold learning) would allow for more complex understanding of the high-dimensional data than linear methods like PCA. So, if manifold learning is more powerful and successful than PCA, why do people still use linear methods like PCA at all?
