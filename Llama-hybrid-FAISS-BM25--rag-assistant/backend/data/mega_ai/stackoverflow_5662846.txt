I was finally able to figure out how to solve this problem, or atleast how to make a workaround. The problem seems to be that ListBox also captures the mouse within its select code. So what I changed was to add e.Handled = true so the ListBox wouldn't get the event and thus override the mousecapture. This did render the select mechanism unusable but to workaround this I moved my code to only listen to MouseRight event which means that when I leftclick I select and when I rightclick I can drag. private static void element_PreviewMouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { FrameworkElement element = sender as FrameworkElement; if (element == null) return; Debug.WriteLine(element); isDragging = true; element.CaptureMouse(); offset = e.GetPosition(element); e.Handled = true; }
