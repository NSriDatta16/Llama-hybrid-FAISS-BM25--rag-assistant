Analyzing tritomous categorical variable between- and within-groups

I have data examining a decision task across age groups. For the decision task, responses are categorical and coded into 3 possible decision types (A, B, C) that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (i.e., a participant's response can be only one of the decision types). This task was given to participants who were classified into 5 different age groups. What I want to do: Compare the proportion of decision types across age groups: i.e., Did participants in age group 1 make decision type A more frequently than participants in age group 2? Compare the proportion of decision types within age groups: i.e., Did participants in age group 1 make decision type A more frequently than decision type B? For each of these analyses, I'd ideally like an omnibus test with complete resolution for follow-up (i.e., pairwise comparisons b/w age groups and decision types). I initially re-coded decision type as a within-subjects variable (i.e., 1 on the decision type the participant responded with, 0 on the others) and ran it as a mixed ANOVA (Age Group X Decision Type), and though this allowed for the omnibus + post-hoc testing, it didn't seem appropriate given the nature of the DV. I also looked at logistic regression, but this seems like a messy and cumbersome analysis (i.e., have to run a large number of individual regressions because logistic regression compares all groups to one reference group per regression--at least in SPSS). Also, I'm not sure whether there are viable options for comprehensive post-hoc analyses via logistic regression (outside of more logistic regressions). Any suggestions for more appropriate/parsimonious analyses to get at the two points above (+ guidance on practical implementation in SPSS/R)?
