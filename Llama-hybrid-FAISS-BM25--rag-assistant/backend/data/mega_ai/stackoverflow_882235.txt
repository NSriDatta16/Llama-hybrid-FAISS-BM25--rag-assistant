Flex Drag and Drop

I am trying to do a flex drag and drop. It is very similar to this first example. http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=dragdrop_7.html The problem is that event.currentTarget.mouseX,mouseY is showing the position where I put the mouse down rather than the position where I had finished dragging. I am just wondering why this could be? If there is a short answer?
