In terms of pairwise dependence structures, the standard linear or monotonic correlations aren't appropriate but recent developments in nonlinear and complex dependence metrics may help. Columbia's Statistics department spent the academic year 2013-2014 focused on developing deeper understandings of dependence structures and ended it with a 3 day workshop and conference that brought together many of the top contributors in this field: http://datascience.columbia.edu/workshop-and-conference-nonparametric-measures-dependence-apr-28-may-2 These contributors included the Reshef Brothers, now famous for a 2011 Science paper "Detecting Novel Associations in Large Data Sets" http://www.uvm.edu/~cdanfort/csc-reading-group/reshef-correlation-science-2011.pdf which has been widely discussed (see AndrewGelman.com for a good overview of this debate, published simultaneously with the Columbia event: http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/14/maximal-information-coefficient ). In their presentation the Reshefs addressed all of these criticisms, as well as presenting a vastly more efficient MIC algorithm. Many other leading statisticians also were in attendance including Gabor Szekely, now at the NSF in DC. Szekely developed his distance and partial distance correlations. Deep Mukhopadhay, Temple U, presented his Unified Statistical Algorithm -- a framework for unified algorithms of data science -- based on work done with Eugene Franzen http://www.fox.temple.edu/mcm_people/subhadeep-mukhopadhyay/ One of these approaches should help you elucidate the relationships. The sequencing of the RNA represents a subtle twist to this. Sequential analysis is another topic area receiving significant attention in recent years ever since Google began using sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) as a way to economize on the information required for multivariate A/B type tests. Alexander Tartakovsky's 2014 book Sequential Analysis is probably the single best treatment of the field. In addition, Columbia Statistics (again) held a workshop on this in June of 2015.

David Dunson, Duke, is among those developing methods for this. See his paper Bayesian Tensor Regression on his website for an introduction and overreview of this field: https://stat.duke.edu/~dunson/
