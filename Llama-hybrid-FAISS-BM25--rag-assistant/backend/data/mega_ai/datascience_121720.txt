To the best of my knowledge, all generally used synthetic data generation methods scale their data to reside in $[0, 1]$ or $[-1, 1]$ . This is also done in TimeGAN & RCGAN. If your data has a significant but regular downward trend, you probably want to reduce the trend in a data preprocessing step. If your data has significant and highly varying trends (one going upwards, the other going downwards), then you simply stumbled across a limitation in the architecture. These models work best on somewhat normally distributed data. If your time-series goes all over the place, the model will have a hard time converging. More research still has to be done into time-series generative networks to be able to predict such trends.
