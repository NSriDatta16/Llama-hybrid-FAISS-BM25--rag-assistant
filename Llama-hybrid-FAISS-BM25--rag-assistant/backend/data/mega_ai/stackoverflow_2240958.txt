Do you have control of the binding function? If so, reference jQuery's unbind or die methods: Unbind Die Using such, you can assign your original ajax click event to a variable and then unbind/die just that one: Example: To unbind just one previously bound handler, pass the function in as the second argument: var foo = function () { // code to handle some kind of event }; $("p").bind("click", foo); // ... now foo will be called when paragraphs are clicked ... $("p").unbind("click", foo); // ... foo will no longer be called.
