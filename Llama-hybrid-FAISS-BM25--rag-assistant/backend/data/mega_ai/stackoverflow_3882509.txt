Drag a label from a view to a window in iPhone?

I am trying to implement a feel like drag and drop of label in iPhone. I am able to drag and drop inside a single view. But if I try to to drag the label from my view to another view added on the window, the label goes below the second view (added to window). But I want to drag the label over the second view (added to window). How can I achieve this?
