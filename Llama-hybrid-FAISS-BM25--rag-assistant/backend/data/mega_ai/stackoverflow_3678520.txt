Hyphenated company name in Java packages

Say you're working on the core module of the foo project for BarBaz Incorporated. Your code fragment might look like this: package com.barbaz.foo.core; import com.barbaz.foo.util; What would the convention be if your company's website was not barbaz.com , but instead bar-baz.com ?
