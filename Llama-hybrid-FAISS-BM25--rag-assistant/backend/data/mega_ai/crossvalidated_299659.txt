Estimating probability of winning for each player based on ranking data of previous tournaments

The question could also be: "estimating the true ability of each player", though I think that already implies some assumptions. In this paper I saw some references to Rankade and TrueSkill used by Microsoft, but I couldn't find any simple implementation for my relatively simple case. Let's say there are 5 total players and I have data for $$ t \in \{1, 2, 3 ..., T\} $$ tournaments. Each tournament has only data on the rankings for the people that played. For example: | rank | player | 1 5 2 3 3 1 Note that not all players play in all tournaments. Assumptions I'm willing to make (but let me know if they're reasonable) The skill of the players doesn't evolve The observed skill of player $i$ at tournament $t$ is some sort of true skill plus noise: $$O_{it} = s_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$ Then the observed rankings are just the result of the rankings of $O_{it}$ for the players observed. I'm happy to make simplifying assumptions about $Cov(\varepsilon_{it}, \varepsilon_{jt})$ and $Cov(\varepsilon_{it}, \varepsilon_{i(t-1)})$. These cross-terms could be assumed to be zero. I think one possibility is to go bayesian: start with a prior on $s_i$ (assume they have the same mean and variance) and then to update, but I'm not sure how to proceed with this. My specific objetive Coming with a code/estimation/simulation procedure that allows me to predict a ranking after observing $T$ tournaments. Getting confidence intervals is nice but not necessary. Getting a closed-form solution would be great, but I doubt I'll get there. My (unfortunately still rather vague) question for you How would you approach this? @Glen_b in the comments suggested a Bradley-Terry model (which has an R implementation If I get it right, these models run with pairwise data. That is, given my data above like | rank | player | 1 5 2 3 3 1 I would have to transform this data to player_5 > player_3 , player_5 > player_1 and player_3 > player_1 ?
