Steffen's comment and link to the question above is very useful. I would say that it depends. I am going to assume that you are using LaTeX, at least (for mathematical typesetting), and possibly R (cos its free, and great). In that case, especially given that you have mentioned org-mode, I would suggest using Emacs to organise your statistical analysis. The advantages are as follows: unify your statistical analysis (Emacs Speaks Statistics), your paper writing (LaTeX) - Emacs sweave support is also the best I have found. You also have Ebib to manage references, and this is very nice. Emacs is so customizable that anything you need to do, can be done from within it. However, it has quite a steep learning curve, and you may need to unlearn some shortcuts and ways of dealing with programs that are commonplace elsewhere. Emacs also has integrated version control. I cannot speak to their quality as I have not used it. On reference management, I personally didn't like Zotero, and use JabRef. JabRef is nice for the GUI and its simplicity, and could support you while you learn enough about Emacs to be productive within it. It also has a cite while you write plugin for open office, if you like that kind of thing. HTH.
