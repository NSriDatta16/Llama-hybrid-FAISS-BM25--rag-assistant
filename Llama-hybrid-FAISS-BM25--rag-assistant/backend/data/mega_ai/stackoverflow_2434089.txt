Isolated storage

I am not sure that I understand Isolated storage. I read the article http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ak841sy%28VS.80%29.aspx 1) Why I don't just use App data folder? 2) In the link above : "With isolated storage, data is always isolated by user and by assembly. Credentials such as the origin or the strong name of the assembly determine assembly identity. Data can also be isolated by application domain, using similar credentials." I can't think about a scenario that makes this future important. In general I don't understand the philosophy and the need of "isolated storage" which inspire MS to create such a thing. Thanks
