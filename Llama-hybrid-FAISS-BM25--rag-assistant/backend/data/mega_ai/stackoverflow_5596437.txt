If you don't want to use extra storage, there are roughly two solutions. The first is brute-force: For every element i, check if it equals the elements 0..i-1. This is O(N*N) (obvious worst case: last two elements are the first duplicates). The second solution is to make the search faster, by keeping the range 0..i. sorted. You'll find the duplicates trivially during the sorting. A bubble sort is efficient because the range 0..i-1 was already sorted in the previous iteration. Still O(N*N) worst case, but O(N) if the range happened to be sorted before.
