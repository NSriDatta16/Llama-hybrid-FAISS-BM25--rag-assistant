Web Service Call Via CXF Gives Null Parameters

I have two code projects both using CXF to use web services. When I make a call from project A to project B, the method I am calling receives null parameters. I've turned on logging and the inbound message does indeed contain the correct parameters. I have also tried calling my service from SoapUI (a webservice testing tool). This passes over the parameters as I expect. Anyone have any ideas what's going wrong? The service interface: @WebService public interface IShortlistService { public IShortlist createOrUpdateShortlist(@WebParam(name = "sessionId") String sessionId, @WebParam(name = "datastoreInstance") String datastoreInstance, @WebParam(name = "datastoreRecordId") String datastoreRecordId); } The service impl: @Name("shortlistService") @WebService(endpointInterface = "com.oobjects.shortlist.service.IShortlistService", serviceName = "ShortlistService") @Features(features = "org.apache.cxf.feature.LoggingFeature") @Transactional public class ShortlistService implements IShortlistService { public IShortlist createOrUpdateShortlist(String sessionId, String datastoreInstance, String datastoreRecordId) { // At this point all inputs are null } } Logging for inbound message that proves it's OK: INFO: Inbound Message ---------------------------- Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8 Headers: {cache-control=[no-cache], content-type=[text/xml; charset=UTF-8], connection=[keep-alive], host=[mypc.mycompany.com:8080], content-length=[391], SOAPAction=[""], user-agent=[Apache CXF 2.2.5], Accept=[*/*], pragma=[no-cache]} Payload: 854a48b5-922f-4081-9c76-b6d08b58a341 http://mypc.mycompany.com:8080/shortlist-app/services/ShortlistService -------------------------------------- The versions of CXF are the same (2.2.5). I can't think what else to check! Some requested information... @Name is a Seam annotation Configured programmatically Aegis databinding (JAXWS doesn't like interfaces)
