I just coded up a quick sample from scratch using dojo 1.4 and was able to set an arbitrarily large DBX size with no problems. Without seeing your code it might be hard to find where your issue is stemming from but it does not seem to be an inherent limitation of the dojo toolkit. Perhaps you have some CSS rules that are inherited in a way you did not anticipate? Perhaps you can use my sample below to compare with your use case and figure out what is different about your implementation. test djConfig = { parseOnLoad: true }; google.load("dojo", "1.4"); google.setOnLoadCallback(function (){ dojo.require("dijit.Dialog"); dojo.require("dijit.form.Button"); }); @import "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.4/dojo/resources/dojo.css"; @import "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.4/dijit/themes/tundra/tundra.css"; Show big Dialog dijit.byId("bigdbx").show(); Paragraph with really wide fixed size...
