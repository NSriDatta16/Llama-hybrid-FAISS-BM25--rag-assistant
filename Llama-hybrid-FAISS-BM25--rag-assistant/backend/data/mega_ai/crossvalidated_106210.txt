Using extreme value theory to estimate bounds

Suppose I have I have a random variable $X$ that I know is doubly bounded on support $[0,\theta]$ but I dont know $\theta$ (we don't know anything on the distribution of $X$, but assume it is not crazy so usual regularity conditions apply when you need them). Consider $Y:=X+Z$, where $Z$ is standard normal ($X$ and $Z$ are independent). And suppose I draw $Y_1,Y_2,...$ which are i.i.d. readings of $Y$. Using the answer posted (actually the appendum to that answer) for this (extreme value theory: show normal to gumbel), and assuming I did my computations right, I showed that $Y_{(n)}$ when suitably normalized with the $(a_n,b_n)$ given in the appendum of the solution, converges to the Gumbel as well. My question is: Is there a way to use this process to provide some estimates on $\theta$? I feel that before normalizing $Y_{(n)}$, it is possible that we have a shifted, scaled version of Gumbel with the shift reflecting the value of $\theta$ somehow (intuitively, as $n$ gets larger, the index $j$ for which $Y_j = Y_{(n)}$ is more and more likely to also be such that $X_j = X_{(n)}$ which is getting closer and closer to $\theta$, so for gigantic $n$, perhaps $Y_{(n)}$ is somewhat like $Z_{(n)} + \theta$?) I can't seem to mathematically justify this or find a procedure to extract some estimates of $\theta$. Any suggestions?
