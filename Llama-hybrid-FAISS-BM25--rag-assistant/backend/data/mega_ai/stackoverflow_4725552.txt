Using element when referring to elements of a page in text

In a web app's help/instructions and error message we often need to refer to parts of a page. Example: Enter your message in the "body" field. Example: The "body" field's content cannot exceed 250 characters Question : in terms of html markup, would it make sense to use the element for the "body" word above? What would be the semantically correct markup to use? Enter your message in the body field. The body field's content cannot exceed 250 characters Looking for opinions, suggestions. Notes: Don't care about the use of quotation marks, I want something that is semantically correct, i.e. it give the right meaning. Would like a simple tag that a tech writer/translator could easily deal with. Would like to avoid body as it is long and give no semantic meaning to its contents. Found this: When referring to a word’s form rather than its meaning, use quotation marks to draw the reader’s attention http://termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=fra&lettr=chapsect8&info0=8.11#zz8 Conclusion Going to go with the good old body . I guess I was wishing for an html tag for something like "text references". Thanks for the feedback. Marc
