Probability models in SAS

What sort of tests are available in SAS that allow you to figure out what the probability of an event occurring is? And I do mean probability, not odds. Specifically, I would like to know what is the probability a person might say yes vs. no to a particular type of surgery based on their age, insurance status, or other a combination of other factors? I have tried logistic regression, but it appears to only return odds, and again, I am interested in a statistical test that returns probabilities, not odds. You would think I could just google, "probability models (or tests) SAS" and get an answer, but strangely enough, I haven't - at least not one that is clear. So here I am. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!
