Most (if not all) queries against this view will behave as if you used the underlaying table directly. Thus if you indexed agent_name in agent_table , and performed a query like: select * from agent_view where agent_name = 'James Bond'; ...it would be rewritten by the optimizer to: select * from agent_table where agent_name = 'James Bond'; Whether the index would be used or not is another question.
