Jquery UI Tabs, how do you perform page navigation without ajax?

How can you perform page navigation with Jquery tabs without the ajax events firing? Following the tutorial, I added $("#tabs").tabs({ select: function (event, ui) { var url = $.data(ui.tab, 'load.tabs'); if (url) { location.href = url; return false; } return true; } }); And I added hrefs to the tabs going to other pages. The problem is, I have ajax used on the page and onload it posts to the url with an ajax call. I was hoping to disable ajax altogether for the tabs and just use them for straight navigation so I can leverage the styles.
