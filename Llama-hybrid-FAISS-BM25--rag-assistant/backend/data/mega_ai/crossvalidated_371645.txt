What kind of PCA is best for my data?

I'm using sklearn to reduce the dimensionality of an object.This scan is 3D, with shape [15,15,15] and contains mostly zeros, altough the non-zero values are usally clustered together in some groups. Examples of one slice out of the 3d object, all purple pixels are zeros: sklearn includes a list of several pca options: sklearn.decomposition.PCA truncated SVD sparse PCA From what I understand, my object is considerd "sparse" since most of its values are zero. Also, I'm flattening this object into a vector before reducing it. what pca kind - or dimensionality reduction in general - is best for this kind of objects?
