The way you get concurrency in go is to use the keyword "go" in front of functions you want to execute concurrently: func bar () { ... } func foo () { go bar() go bar() go bar() ... code that waits for all the bars to close ... } That's all it takes to run 3 bars at the same time. PS: You might want to provide an example in a language you are familiar with, C++ / Perl / Python / whatever since the go code fragment you included wasn't much help. I realize you probably speak English better than I speak your native language, but you might also want to get some assistance formulating your question more clearly. Hotei
