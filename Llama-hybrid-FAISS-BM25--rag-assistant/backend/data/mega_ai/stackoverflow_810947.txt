If the website you're talking about is public one that you intend to release on the world, then I would suggest you finish what you're doing, ship it, and get user feedback on the site before you decide to throw it away and reimplement it. If this is just a hobby site then throwing it away is fine. However, there's no doubt in my mind that ASP.NET MVC is the better option and you should use it as the default option for all future development. As mentioned in other responses, SO is using ASP.NET MVC. I don't think ASP.NET MVC is going to get in the way of hitting your scale requirements - in any commercial website it's generally the data source (your SQL database, or the webserivices that you call) which will limit your ability to deal with high traffic. I guess it really depends upon your usage patterns, how much data you're accessing to build pages, whether your content will be cachable, whether you have millions of users just reading pages, or hundreds of users who are updating data and things like thisthat will drive your ability to scale, and most of these are orthoganal to the framework you use to render the pages.
