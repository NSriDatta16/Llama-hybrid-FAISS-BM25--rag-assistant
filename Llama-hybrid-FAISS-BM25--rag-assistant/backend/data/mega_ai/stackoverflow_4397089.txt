R.java not getting generated and AIDL files not getting compiled in Android SDK 2.3

i noticed that ADB.exe moved to platform-tools on Android 2.3 SDK and added it to the path so thats fine. But now, even with all tools and Eclipse plugin updated, my R.java does not get generated and the AIDL files get not converted into stub classes -> ergo the whole gen folder is empty (even if i delete the whole folder or clean my project). Our build is broken due to this and i want to ask if someone had/has the same experience and maybe some solution to this problem? thanks Robert
