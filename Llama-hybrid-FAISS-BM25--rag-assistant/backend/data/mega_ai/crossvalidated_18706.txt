Using statistical significance test to validate cluster analysis results

I am surveying the use of statistical significance testing (SST) to validate the results of cluster analysis. I have found several papers around this topic, such as " Statistical Signiﬁcance of Clustering for High-Dimension, Low–Sample Size Data " by Liu, Yufeng et al. (2008) " On some significance tests in cluster analysis ", by Bock (1985) But I am interested in finding some literature arguing that SST is NOT appropriate to validate results of cluster analysis. The only source I have found claiming this is a web page of a software vendor To clarify: I am interested in testing whether a significant cluster structure has been found as a result of cluster analysis, so, I'd like to know of papers supporting or refuting the concern "about the possibility of post-hoc testing of the results of exploratory data analysis used to find clusters". I've just found a paper from 2003, " Clustering and classification methods " by Milligan and Hirtle saying, for example, that using ANOVA would be an invalid analysis since data have not have random assignments to the groups.
