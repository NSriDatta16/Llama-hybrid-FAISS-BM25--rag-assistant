Overview Feature Extraction in images?

I have been searching for deep feature extraction approaches for a while now, but I did not find a single paper giving me a coarse overview on this matter. Apart from an overview, for example I would like to read about using the encoder of an autoencoder as a feature extractor. Does somebody know any papers on this topic? Thank you in advance for any answers!
