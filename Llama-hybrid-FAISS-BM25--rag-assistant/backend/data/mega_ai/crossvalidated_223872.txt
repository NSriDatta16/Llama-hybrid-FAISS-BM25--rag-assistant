Forecasting ARIMA with `predict` vs `forecast` in R

Data consisting of 30 values is stored in a time series time . After applying ARIMA modelling on time , I used forecast function to predict future values: model = arima(time, order = c(3,2,1)) prediction = forecast.Arima(model,h=10) prediction step is not working and showing error Error in ts(x) : object is not a matrix As you see above, I am getting an error message. But if I do model = arima(time[1:25], order = c(3,2,1)) prediction = forecast.Arima(model,h=10) it works. Why is it so? When I used the predict function model = arima(time, order = c(3,2,1)) prediction=predict(model,n.ahead=10) it also works. Which function would be better to use, predict or forecast , for ARIMA models in R, and why ?
