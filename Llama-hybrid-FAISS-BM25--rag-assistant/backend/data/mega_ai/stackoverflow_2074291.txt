If you are by any means concerned with your site's performance you should switch to APC as it provides both opcode caching as well as means for caching as a key/value store. You can store entire blocks of content, arrays, objects, you name it: // you must supply: // 1. a key you will later use to retrieve your content // 2. the data you wish to cache // 3. how long the cache should remain valid apc_store($key, $data, $ttl); As far as retrieval goes, you simply make a call like: $data = apc_fetch($key);
