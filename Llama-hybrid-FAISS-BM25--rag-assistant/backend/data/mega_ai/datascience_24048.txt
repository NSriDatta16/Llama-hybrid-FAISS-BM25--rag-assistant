I think this is 'mood' vs. 'character'. And as such, it depends on the question you ask. E.g. did I make my customer upset? Or is my customer loyal? Though mood and character correlate, as someone with a certain character will be more likely to be in some mood, there is also variation. I think you will measure 'mood' with the 'tone' analyzer, and 'character' with the 'personality' analyzer. For the 'personality' you will need all the data you can get to get the 'average', for the 'mood', a single data point can be sufficient.
