To capture a double-click event on a UIComponent (or more generally, an InteractiveObject ), set both its mouseEnabled and doubleClickEnabled properties to true and add a MouseEvent.DOUBLE_CLICK event listener. iaObject.doubleClickEnabled = true; iaObject.addEventListener(MouseEvent.DOUBLE_CLICK, doubleClickHandler); The mouseEnabled property should be set to true by default, but it could have been flipped by the dragging code. You might want to check it in your debugger to be sure.
