How can I tell if the results of an MCMC data-model fit are reasonable?

I'm using an MCMC Python package ( emcee ) to fit observed data to a 4-dimensional ($A, B, C, D$) model. After a run with 100 walkers and 5000 steps (1000 burn-in period) I get a result that looks like the image below. The 2-parameters density maps look horrible and the (16th, 84th) percentiles (dashed blue lines) around the median (red line) enclose an enormous region. Does this mean that the 5000 steps I'm using are not enough? Do I need more walkers? Could it be that this is the best results I can hope for?
