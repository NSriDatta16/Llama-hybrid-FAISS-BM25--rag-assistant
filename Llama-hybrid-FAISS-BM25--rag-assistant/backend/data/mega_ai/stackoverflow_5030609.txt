You will find http:// graphdrawing.org / and this tutorial , by Roberto Tamassia , professor at Brown University, quite helpful. I like a lot Force-Directed Techniques (pp. 66-72 in the tutorial) like the Spring Embedder . You assume there is a spring or other force between any two adjacent nodes and let nature (simulation) do the work :)
