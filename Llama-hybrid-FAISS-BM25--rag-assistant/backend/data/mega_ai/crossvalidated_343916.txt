EDIT: I found this paper referenced in a thread on the maths stack exchange ( Approximate order statistics for normal random variables ), so I had a look. For the maximum, $r=n$. "In a sample of size n the expected value of the rth largest order statistic is given by $$E(r,n)=\frac{n!}{(r-1)!(n-r)!}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\{1-\Phi(x)\}^{r-1}\{\Phi(x)\}^{n-r}\phi(x)dx,$$ where $\phi(x)=1/\sqrt(2\pi)exp(-\frac{1}{2}x^2)$ and $\Phi(x)=\int^x_{-\infty}\phi(z)dz.$" Royston, J. P. (1982), 'Algorithm AS 177: Expected Normal Order Statistics (Exact and Approximate)', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series C (Applied Statistics) , 31(2):161-165. So $Y$ is an order statistic . Let's label its density function $g_{(n)}(x)$, to indicate that it's the pdf of the variable in the nth position (i.e. its the pdf of the maximum in the sample). Let's also label the normal $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ density function as $f(x)$. It's a standard result that $$g_{(n)}(x)=n[F(x)]^{n-1}f(x),$$ where $F(x)$ is the cumulative density function of $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ (as a reference, I suggest Mathematical Statistics (7th ed.) by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer, p.333). It is at this point that I'm unable to proceed - I don't know how to evaluate the expected value of $Y$, given that it has such a strange pdf. However, I'd advise you to search for "expected value of order statistic" - in particular, I found a thread on this topic on the maths stack exchange site: EDIT: As pointed out by Khol, thread is for a uniform distribution, not a normal distribution. The uniform is apparently more straightforward to deal with.
