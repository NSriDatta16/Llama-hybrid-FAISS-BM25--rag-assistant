From your description, it seems that you are facing a regression problem, because you want your output to be certain values. This is different from classification problems, that have as output the probability of the input belonging to certain class. The key to using neural networks for regression is that the output layer should have no activation, that is, it should be a linear layer. As pointed out by @JanvanderVegt, a common loss function for regression problems is the mean square error (MSE) between the current output and the MFCC features you computed. If you google "tensorflow regression example" you can find dozens of complete examples, like this or this .
