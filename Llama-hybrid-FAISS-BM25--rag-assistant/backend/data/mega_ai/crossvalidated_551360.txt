Why is AR(1) process with $|\phi| > 1$ not stationary?

I saw the top answer on the following post: Stationarity of AR(1) model . It says that an AR(1) process $X_{t} = \phi X_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}$ where $\epsilon_{t} \sim WN(0, \sigma^{2})$ has a stationary solution if and only if $|\phi| . However, it is also commonly known that explosive processes with $|\phi| > 1$ can be represented as $$ X_{t} = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} -\phi^{-j} w_{t+j} $$ which is a stationary time series. So does it not follow that all AR(1) processes other than when $|\phi| =1 $ have a stationary solution?
