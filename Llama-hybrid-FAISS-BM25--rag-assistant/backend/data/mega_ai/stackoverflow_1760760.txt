At the risk of providing more up-votes for Jeff who has already crossed the mountains of madness... see here The argument rages back and forth, but... it's is a simple one-off or little used script you are writing then sure use regex, if it's more complex and needs to be reliable with little future tweaking then I'd suggest using an HTML parser. HTML is a nasty often non-regular beast to tame. Use the right tool for the job... maybe in your case it's regex, or maybe its a full blown parser.
