What is an "ERM rule" in Understanding Machine Learning by Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David?

I am reading "Understanding Machine Learning" book by Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David. On page 48, theorem 6.7 (The fundamental theorem of statistical learning, FTSL) says: Let $H$ be a hypothesis class... the following properties are equivalent... 4. $H$ is PAC learnable. 5. Any ERM rule is a successful PAC learner for $H$ . I could not find the definition of ERM rule in this book or anywhere. What is it? It can not be any algorithm which minimizes empiric risk, can it? What are the conditions on the algorithm to find the PAC solution?
