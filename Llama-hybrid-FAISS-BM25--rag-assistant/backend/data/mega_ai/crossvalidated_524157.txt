Principal component analysis, the relation between the variance and error

As is known, the rank-1 PCA aims to solve the following optimization problem $$\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}\quad -x^T \Sigma x\quad\quad\quad s.t.\quad \Vert x\Vert_{2}=1,$$ where $\Sigma\in\mathbb{S}^{d}$ is the covariance matrix. Thus the optimum $x^*$ of the PCA problem is the top unit eigenvector of $\Sigma$ . Given an approximation $\tilde{x}$ (normalized), the error between the $\tilde{x}$ and $x^*$ is measured by the sine function $$\sin^{2}(\tilde{x}, x^*) = 1-(\tilde{x}^T x^*)^2.$$ I was wondering if there exists any analytical relationship between the objective function $\tilde{x}^\top\Sigma \tilde{x}$ and the error $\sin^2(\tilde{x}, x^*)$ ? Any help appreciated.
