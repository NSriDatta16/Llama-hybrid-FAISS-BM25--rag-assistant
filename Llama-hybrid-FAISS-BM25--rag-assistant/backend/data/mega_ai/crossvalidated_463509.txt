Time series forecasting without significance in autocorrelation

My data which has no significance in ACF and PACF plot fits very poorly to my observed data. There are similar cases like my case too which when there's no significance in PACF and ACF their prediction performs very poorly (e.g predicting stock prices). I have not found any article that mentions that having significance in ACF PACF plot would also be assumption if we want to do time series forecasting so i thought if our data is stationary then we're good to go on building a time series model. My question is, is it a must or do we need to have significance in ACF PACF in order to do time series forecasting? if yes, why is it so important to have significance ACF PACF in order to have a good fitting time series model?
