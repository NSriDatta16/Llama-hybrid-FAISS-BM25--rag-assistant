I'm thinking you could always load the picture upload control in a div and have a Javascript link to toggle the display attribute of the div. Or perhaps use CollapsiblePanels from the AjaxToolKit to hide and show the upload form. I think either of those ways would be more elegant than doing a post back (even if it's in an UpdatePanel) just to retrieve the picture upload form.
