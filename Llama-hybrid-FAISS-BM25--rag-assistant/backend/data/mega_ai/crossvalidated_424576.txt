Data known to be normal. As an easy example, suppose you have data from a population known to be normal, but for which the population mean $\mu$ and population standard deviation $\sigma$ are unknown. (Using R.) set.seed(901) mu = 59; sg = 3.5 x = rnorm(10^6, mu, sg) Pretending not to know the parameter values, you can estimate them as the sample mean $A$ and the sample SD $S.$ a = mean(x); s = sd(x); a; s [1] 59.00138 [1] 3.502753 Then use the estimated parameters to estimate the 60th and 80th percentiles (3rd and 4th quintiles). [The exact 3rd and 4th quintiles of $\mathsf{Norm}(69, 3.5)$ are 59.88671 and 61.94567, but we have "forgotten" the actual values of $\mu$ and $\sigma.]$ The statistician's 4th quintile is 59.889. qq.mle = qnorm(c(.6,.8), a, s); qq.mle [1] 59.88879 61.94937 If you didn't know this is a normal distribution, somewhat less accurate estimates of these quintles could be found directly from the data. qq.dir = quantile(x, c(.6,.8)); qq.dir 60% 80% 59.89191 61.95077 Then using the quintile estimates 59.889 and 61.949 based on $A$ and $S,$ we find the average value of the data values on the interval $(59.889, 61.949).$ The planner's mean of third quintile is 60.86, mean(x[x > 59.889 & x If I have understood your Question correctly, the next step is to try to find the 3rd quintile of a population distribution of unknown type and then to find the mean of the observations between the 3rd and 4th quintiles. Data for unknown population type. For a very large sample from a distribution of unknown type, it may be best to get the quintiles directly from the data and then to average the relevant data values. For smaller samples, results of that will be reflect the population less accurately. Then you may want to use bootstrapping to get 95% nonparametric CIs for the quintiles and the mean of the values between. For example, y is a sample of size $n=1000$ from a skewed population with 3rd quintile 52.366, observed 3rd quintile 51.282, and other descriptive statistics given below. summary(y) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 11.40 34.85 46.48 50.16 62.95 163.91 q3.obs = quantile(y, .6); q3.obs 60% 51.2817 The following program makes one style of 95% nonparametric bootstrap CI $(49.33,\, 53.05)$ for the third quintile. set.seed(901) d.re = replicate(2000, quantile(sample(y,1000,rep=T),.6) -q3.obs) UL = quantile(d.re, c(.975,.025)) q3.obs - UL 97.5% 2.5% 49.33390 53.04923 Note: Data vector y simulated in R as: set.seed(2019); y = rgamma(1000, 5, .1)
