Benchmark data for Random Forest evaluation

I would like to make/explore several alternative formulations of random forest ( link ) and am looking for the current state of the science for evaluating performance. In the reference file Leo provides "microarray", "DNA", "glass", and "spectral" data to exhibit the performance of his method. Are these available? How do I get them in order to first reproduce the results, and explore performance of changed parameter settings? How general and authoritative are they? Other references that I have thus far found include ( this ), ( this ), and ( this ). Can you suggest rigorous, modern, and relatively complete list of quality classification benchmarks to be used to compare the performance of very similar random forests?
