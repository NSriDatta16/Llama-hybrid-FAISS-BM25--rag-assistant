So now I need to have access from .NET application to private application database file, which is placed on Android device. That is not possible, except on the emulator and perhaps on rooted phones. Either store your database on external storage (which you would then mount as a Windows drive when your application is not running), or build an export-to-external-storage option into your application, or otherwise make your data available from places other than the application-local file store.
