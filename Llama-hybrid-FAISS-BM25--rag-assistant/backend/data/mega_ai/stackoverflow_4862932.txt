Only the last member of a C struct can be flexible as in arr[] . Shamelessly copying from paragraph 6.7.2.1, sub-paragraph 16 of the ISO C99 standard: 16 As a special case, the last element of a structure with more than one named member may have an incomplete array type; this is called a flexible array member. With two exceptions, the flexible array member is ignored. First, the size of the structure shall be equal to the offset of the last element of an otherwise identical structure that replaces the flexible array member with an array of unspecified length.106)... EDIT: As for C++, see this . Bottom-line: flexible array members are not allowed in C++ at all - at least for the time being.
