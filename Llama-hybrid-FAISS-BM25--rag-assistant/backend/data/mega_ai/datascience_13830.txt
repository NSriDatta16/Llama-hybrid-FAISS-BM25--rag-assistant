It is not clear from your question what your use case is exactly. But for cases like what you mentioned, it is usually more helpful if you generate time series out of each feature. For example, if you have user's login and logout time, you can generate a time series where it is 1 when the user is logged in and 0 when the user is logged out. But again, tell us more about your use case first.
