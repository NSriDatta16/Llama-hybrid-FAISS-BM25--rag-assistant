t-test and p-value for calculating the difference between two fields

I am running statistical test to measure the difference between two fields (graduation age women and graduation age men). I am using ttest_ind() and I got the following results: Ttest_indResult(statistic=10.965703359355636, pvalue=5.7138670616970964e-16) From what I read (I have not a strong statistical background), the p-value is significant. In terms of results for features selection in machine learning algorithms, what would it mean? Currently I am considering graduation age as a feature that can actually improve my ML (model performance metrics have been improved after adding it).
