This will probably be closed quickly as opinion-based, but here is a point you may want to consider. 200 features is a lot , and 30k rows is less than it sounds like. A "fishing expedition" to find relevant features is quite likely to overfit and select spurious features . The danger is that when you go to your domain experts with these features you "found" to be relevant, they may not push back. Instead, it's a very common human reaction to start telling stories about how these features are indeed useful, because we humans are very good at explaining stuff, even stuff that is simply noise. Talking to your domain experts first will not completely avoid this problem, but it may reduce the number of wild goose chases.
