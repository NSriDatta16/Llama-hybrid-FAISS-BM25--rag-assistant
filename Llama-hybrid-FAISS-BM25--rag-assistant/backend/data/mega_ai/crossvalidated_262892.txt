Two linearly perfected correlated variables. Can deep-network with 1 million hidden layers and 2 trillion neutrons beat a simple linear regression? EDITED In my experience, sample collection is more expensive than computation. I mean, we can just hire some Amazon instances, run deep learning training and then come back a few days later. The cost in my field is about $200 USD. The cost is minimal. My colleagues earn more than that in a day. Sample collection generally requires domain knowledge and specialized equipments. Deep learning is only suitable for problems with cheap and easy access data set, such as natural language processing, image processing and anything that you can scrape off from the Internet.
