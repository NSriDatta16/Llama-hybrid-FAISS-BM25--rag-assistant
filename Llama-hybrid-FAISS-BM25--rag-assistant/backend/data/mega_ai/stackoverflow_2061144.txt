You could use a JPQL query that looks very similar to your query. select t from JpaClass t order by t.id desc After you establish your Query object you could then call query.getSingleResult() or call query.setMaxResults(1) followed by query.getResultList() EDIT: My mistake: Please note mtpettyp's comment below. Don't use query.getSingleResult() as an exception could be thrown if there is not exactly one row returned - see java.sun.com/javaee/5/â€¦() - mtpettyp Go with setMaxResults and getResultList. query.setMaxResults(1).getResultList();
