My question is: when we talk about the null hypothesis here, are we referring to the sampling distribution constructed: Before any data is collected (a priori), or After data has been collected (a posteriori)? In a one-sample t-test, for example, it is a combination. A priori, you decide your null hypothesis, say $\mu=0$ (in general, $\mu = \mu_0$ for some constant $\mu_0$ ). A posteriori, you calculate the sample variance, the sample mean, and the sample size. All four components go into calculating the sampling distribution, test statistic, and p-value. $$ \dfrac{\bar X - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n - 1} $$ These terms a priori and a posteriori allude to and sound like, but are not the same as, the ideas of prior and posterior distributions in Bayesian statistics.
