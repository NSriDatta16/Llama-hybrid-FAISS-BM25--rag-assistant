I recently tried out some html clean-up libraries, and the best I came across was the Cobra Html Renderer and Parser which seems to faster than others and also manages to convert dirtier HTML do XHTML. I first went for HTML Tidy , but it ended up complaining about "Unparseable HTML" way too often. What I'd strongly discourage you from doing is to use a REGEX ;-)
