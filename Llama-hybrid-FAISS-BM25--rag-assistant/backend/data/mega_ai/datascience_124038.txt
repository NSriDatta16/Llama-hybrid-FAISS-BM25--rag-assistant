Xgboost model predicting extreme values for events and non-events | Overfitting

Extreme values are predicted by my trained xgboost classification model in BQML for both events (Y=1) and non-events (Y=0). For all event observations, the model calculates probability scores that are almost 0.98 and above, while for all non-event data, they are almost 0.02. The box-plots below show the distribution of probability scores for these observations of events and non-events. Furthermore, this comes from the testing dataset. This is overfitting. Any suggestions for how to approach this?
