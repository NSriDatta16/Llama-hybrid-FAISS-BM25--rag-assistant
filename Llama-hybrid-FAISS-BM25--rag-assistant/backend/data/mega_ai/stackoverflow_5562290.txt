Interweaving vector of binary representations in C++

I have a templated function in C++ called weave which takes two unsigned chars and interweaves their binary expansions and returns a unsigned short. It can also take two unsigned shorts and interweaves their binary expansions to return an unsigned long. Here is what I wrote: template Typeout weave(Typein lhs,Typein rhs) { //Need to check that Typeout contains enough storage to contain 2*Typein: assert(sizeof(Typeout)>=2*sizeof(Typein)); Typeout weaved = 0; for(int k=0;k Now I'm having trouble with weaving together vectors. I want to write a function called weave that given a vector of chars interweaves all of their binary expansions and returns this. For instance given a vector of unsigned chars of length 4 it should interweave their binary expansions and return a representation of this. I want this to work for vectors of chars of length greater than 8 so I can no longer keep them in a unsigned long long. I guess I need to return a vector?? But I'm not sure how to cut the resulting binary expansion up. I'm new to C++ so please feel free to correct the code or give me advice on it. Thanks in advance.
