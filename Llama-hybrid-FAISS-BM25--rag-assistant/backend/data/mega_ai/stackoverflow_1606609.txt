If you are using fixed width or margins, left align can make it easier for the users to resize the window width when they need to (e.g., to view other windows along side). With a single drag of the right window edge, they can shrink the window to show the thumbnail and name, allowing them the scan for albums while taking the least screen space. In some center align implementations, the user has to drag the window edge then scroll horizontally, creating more work.
