Deep Learning Predictions Seem Off

I'm doing a linear regression using the h2o deep learning interface with R. I'm comparing the predictions to the ones I'm getting from the randomForest R module. The predictions from randomForest seem to roughly match up with what I'd expect given the distribution of the variable that I'm trying to predict. However, the predictions from the h2o deep learning module don't seem to match up with what I'd expect. Here's the summary from the variable I'm trying to predict: Profit Min. :-1438.56 1st Qu.: -133.80 Median : -0.59 Mean : 19.54 3rd Qu.: 127.39 Max. : 508.41 and here are the predictions from h2o deep learning: preddp Min. :-0.079954 1st Qu.:-0.017919 Median :-0.010088 Mean :-0.011903 3rd Qu.:-0.003921 Max. : 0.060259 and here are the predictions from randomForest: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -212.500 -6.346 20.530 24.690 50.600 244.700 which is roughly what I'd expect. Why are the h2o deep learning predictions so strange? Also the correction between the predictions and the target variable are strongly positive with randomForest and even more strongly negative with h2o deep learning so I figure I have to be doing something wrong. Here's the command I'm using to train the deep learning model: sdmodel.deep
