Well, one easy, if not the easiest, way to get an high level of code coverage is to write the code test-first, following Test-Driven Development (TDD). Now that the code exists, without unit tests, it can be deemed as legacy code. You could either write end-to-end test, external to your application, those won't be unit tests, but they can be written without resorting to any kind of mock. Or you could write unit tests that span over multiple classes, and only mock the classes that gets in the way of your unit tests.
