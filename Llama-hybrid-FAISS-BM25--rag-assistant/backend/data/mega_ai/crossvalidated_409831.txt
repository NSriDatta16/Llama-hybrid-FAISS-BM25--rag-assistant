Proof of $P(|X+Y|>b)\leq P(|X|>b/2)+P(|Y|>b/2)$ which is what the OP's edited question says he really wanted to prove in the first place... The event $\left\{|X|\leq \frac b2, |Y| \leq \frac b2\right\}$ , that is, the event that $(X,Y)$ lies in the square of side $b$ centered at the origin, is clearly a subset of the event $\{|X+Y|\leq b\}$ , and hence, taking complements of both (and using DeMorgan's laws), we have that the event $\left\{|X|> \frac b2\right\} \cup \left\{|Y| > \frac b2\right\} = A \cup B$ is a superset of the event $\{|X+Y|> b\} =C$ . Hence, \begin{align} P\bigg\{|X+Y|> b\bigg\} &\leq P\left(\left\{|X|> \frac b2\right\} \cup \left\{|Y| > \frac b2\right\}\right)\\ &\leq P\left\{|X|> \frac b2\right\} + P\left\{|Y|> \frac b2\right\}\end{align} where the second step is just using the fact that $P(A\cup B) \leq P(A)+P(B)$ which is sometimes referred to as the simplest form of Boole's inequality . Non-proof of original claim It was shown above that $C \subset A\cup B$ and so it just be that \begin{align} C &\subset A\cup B\\ &\Downarrow\\ C &\subset (C\cap A) \cup (C \cap B)\\ &\Downarrow\\ P(C) &\leq P\big((C\cap A) \cup (C \cap B)\big)\\ &\leq P(C\cap A)+P(C \cap B)\\ P\bigg\{|X+Y|> b\bigg\} &\leq P\left\{|X+Y|> b, |X|> \frac b2\right\} + P\left\{|X+Y|> b, |Y|> \frac b2\right\}, \end{align} that is, the equality in the OP's original claim needs to be replaced by $\leq$ (as the OP noted in a comment on @aksakal's answer).
