calling a VB.net function from javascript

I need to find a way to call a vb.net function in my aspx page from javascript. I have a Jquery function that makes the .drop class .droppable, and whenever I drop a .draggable onto a drop target, my Jquery code successfully fires a java alert statement. All in pure javascript. What I need to do is some heavy math! I do understand that javascript exists client-side, ASP/VB exists server-side, and never the two shall meet. From google research, it seems like the ideal way to get what I need done, is to trigger an asynchronous postback in my update panel. I created a hidden button called "HiddenButton", and I also created a hidden label called "HiddenLabel". How do I get it to work so when I drop something, my javascript calls something that updates both the text in the HiddenLabel (so I can pass a value to server-side), and somehow fire the HiddenButton_click event? My current javascript goodness looks like this: $(document).ready(function() { doReady(); var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance(); prm.add_endRequest(function(s, e) { doReady(); }); }); function doReady() { $('.drag').draggable({ revert: true, helper: 'clone' }); $('.drop').droppable({ tolerance: "touch", // Here should be a string drop: function() { alert('dropped'); } This is where I think something needs to go to update the label and trigger the post-back, but I don't know what it is :( }); } // End of do ready
