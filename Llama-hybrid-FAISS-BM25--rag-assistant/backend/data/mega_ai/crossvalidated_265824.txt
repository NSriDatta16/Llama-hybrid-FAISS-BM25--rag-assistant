Estimation An AR(X) model is easy to estimate because one can apply OLS for that. On the other hand, MA(X) and ARMA(X) models require maximum likelihood estimation which is more computationally demanding. This becomes especially pronounced in multivariate models, which is why VAR(X) are much more popular than VARMA(X) or VMA(X) models. Parsimony ARMA is flexible yet parsimonious -- more so than either AR or MA. No wonder ARMA is quite popular (for univariate time series). In total, AR has the computational advantage; ARMA has the benefit of parsimony; while MA... I am not aware of particularly appealing benefits of MA. Of course, MA is useful when we want to look at a process as a sum of weighted past shocks, but that is not the most frequent use of ARMA type of models.
