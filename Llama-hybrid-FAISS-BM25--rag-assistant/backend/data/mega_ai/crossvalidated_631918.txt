Importance of language models when given simple instruction to a Robot

Do I really need a transformer-based language model if I want to instruct a robot very simple task? Suppose I give an instruction like "Go to the right and pick up the book from the table" . I am confused because the language models are generative but the above instruction is pretty straightforward and the robot does not need to infer anything from the instruction.
