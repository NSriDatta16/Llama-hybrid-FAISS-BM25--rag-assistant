Why are mouseDragged-events not received when using MouseAdapter?

Why are mouseDragged -events only received when using MouseMotionAdapter and not when using MouseAdapter ? Java has two abstract adapter classes for receiving mouse-events ; MouseAdapter and MouseMotionAdapter . Both classes have a mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) -method, but the one in MouseAdapter does not seem to work ; mouseDragged -events never get through with this one. Both classes implement the MouseMotionListener -interface which defines the mouseDragged -event, so I don't understand why it is not working correctly on both of them. Here is sample-code which shows this issue : import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter; import java.awt.event.MouseEvent; import java.awt.event.MouseMotionAdapter; import javax.swing.JFrame; public class SwingApp extends JFrame { public SwingApp() { // No mouseDragged-event is received when using this : this.addMouseListener(new mouseEventHandler()); // This works correct (when uncommented, of course) : // this.addMouseMotionListener(new mouseMovedEventHandler()); setBounds(400,200, 550,300); setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); setResizable(false); setVisible(true); } public static void main(String args[]) { new SwingApp(); } class mouseEventHandler extends MouseAdapter { @Override public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) // Why is this method never called ? { System.out.println(String.format("MouseDragged via MouseAdapter / X,Y : %s,%s ", e.getX(), e.getY())); } } class mouseMovedEventHandler extends MouseMotionAdapter { @Override public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { System.out.println(String.format("MouseDragged via MouseMotionAdapter / X,Y : %s,%s ", e.getX(), e.getY())); } } }
