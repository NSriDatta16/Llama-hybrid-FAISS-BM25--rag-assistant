Magento does not support bundle products with selections of products that have some required options (configurables, downloadables with links, simple products with any required option and so on). Your configuration is not valid for a system and not supported. In fact Magento does not show mentioned above products as a possible choice for bundle option selection. If you were able to make such a bundle using standard Magento admin panel - report a bug with detailed step-by-step case at http://www.magentocommerce.com
