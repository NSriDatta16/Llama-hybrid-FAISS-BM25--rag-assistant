GarageGames.com sells a lot of that kind of thing... 3d models, textures, background music and so on. http://garagegames.com and specifically http://www.garagegames.com/products/browse HTH edit: whoops, I didn't see the "free" requirement! Do a search on "creative commons" and you'll find lots of music, at least, and some graphics.
