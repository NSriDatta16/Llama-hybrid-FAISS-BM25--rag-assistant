Sessions are normally identified by cookies, which are only visible in one browser. You could probably use Flash to share the session ID between browsers, but I cannot think of a use case. The point of the session is to store data which is bound to a single browsing session, and not to the user in general. You should use a database or some other form of server-side storage for generic user data.
