Is there a typical name for a function like 'map' that operates on a list of argument lists instead of multiple lists of arguments?

(I finally posted and accepted an answer to the effect of "no, there isn't, and the question isn't actually that general".) Consider the Common Lisp function 'mapcar'. It takes a function and some lists as arguments, and calls the function with arguments pulled from the same position in each list. Do standard libraries typically have a similar function that takes a single list, where each element of the list is a list of arguments for the function? What is a function like that typically called whether "standard" or not? (This isn't meant to be a Lisp question, but it's the only functional language+library I halfway know.) I guess I'm asking if an operation like (in pseudo-Lisp): (mapcar (curry #'apply function-to-map) list-of-arg-lists) already has a name that is common across multiple languages or libraries (in the same way that 'map' and 'reduce' are names for common operations, not just specific library functions). Thanks.
