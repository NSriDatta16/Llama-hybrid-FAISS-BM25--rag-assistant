Creating 'Non Visual' .NET User Controls

How do I create non visual components in .NET that can be dragged and dropped onto a Form ? For example the imagelist component is a non visual component, it appears in the toolbox and can be dragged onto a form and properties can be set for that component. How can I achieve that ? How can I create non visual components. I know about user controls but that is not what I am looking for. Thank you
