Machine Learning with fixed and variable inputs and multiple outputs

I've been doing machine learning and neural networks for a couple months, and finished a 5 months online course of it last year, but I'm struggling in an specific scenario: Let's say we've got this data: X1 , X2 , F3 , F4 and Y1 X1 and X2 are possible to change. F3 and F4 change only with time and arbitrary. Y1 only changes as a result of X1, X2, F3 and F4 changing. I've collected thousands of samples ready to train, but I don't know what type of algorithm should I use. This is how I want to use it: I want to "reach" a desired target value of Y1 , setting the combination of values of X1 and X2 , respecting the existing and unchangeable values of F3 and F4 . E.g. [X1, X2] = run_algorithm(Y1, F3, F4); And what if I also decide to include these X1 and X2 in the algorithm too, so it finds the most efficient way of doing it knowing the already existing values of X1 and X2 . E.g. [X1, X2] = run_algorithm(Y1, F3, F4, X1, X2);
