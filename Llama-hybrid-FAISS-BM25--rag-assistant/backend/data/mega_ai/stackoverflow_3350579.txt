CSS element opacity that does not affect transparency of its contents

I'm trying to create a that has an opacity of 60%. I want the content of that to be clear and not transparent. The with the class white_bg should have a white background color with 60% transparency, but the text and the image inside that should be clear and not transparent at all. Is that possible? Please note that the text in the paragraph with the class main_content will be dynamic and the height will always change, so I can't just set a width and a height for the white_bg class and use position absolute and place it right behind the paragraph.
