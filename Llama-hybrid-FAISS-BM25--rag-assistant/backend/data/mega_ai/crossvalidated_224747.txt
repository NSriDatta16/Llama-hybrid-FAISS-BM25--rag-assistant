Calculating the probability to die in a card game using Markov chains

I saw this interesting question on reddit and couldn't figure it out. Situation There is a special card in the game seen below: Once this card gets played, there are 6 options that can happen. Only two options are relevant to the question: You lose 3 health. Repeat this process two more times (i.e. pick two options from the card at random again) All of the options have the same probability of $1/6$ of happening once the card is played (e.g. with a dice throw). Question What is the probability of losing the game if you start with 20 health and draw the special card mentioned above? You lose if your health is zero or less. All other cards in the game are irrelevant because I'm only interested in the probability of dying with the special card. Example The only possible way to lower your health continuoulsy is to get the second option (i.e. chose another option two times) and then get the first option (-3 health). A possible chain to death could look something like this (numbers indicate options from above): $2, 1~\text{(-3 health)}, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1$ After hitting option $1$ seven times, your health falls below 0 and it's game over. My attempt I tried to tackle the problem using a Markov chain. As far as I see it, there are 5 states: Irrelevant option, move ends Health - 3, another move Another 2 moves (i.e. option 2 from above) Irrelevant option, another move Health - 3, move ends The transition matrix with state space $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ is as follows: $$ M= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 4/6 & 0 & 1/6 & 0 & 1/6 \\ 0 & 1/6 & 1/6 & 4/6 & 0 \\ 4/6 & 0 & 1/6 & 0 & 1/6 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$ The canonical form of $M$ is: $$ Q= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1/6 & 1/6 & 0 & 1/6 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1/6 & 1/6 & 4/6 \\ 4/6 & 1/6 & 0 & 1/6 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ Another difficulty is the first throw: Only options $1, 3$ or $5$ are possible at the start. I tried to simulate it using random first options, but the probability of your health falling to 0 or below is so small that I never saw it once in hundreds of thousand of simulations. Is there an analytic answer?
