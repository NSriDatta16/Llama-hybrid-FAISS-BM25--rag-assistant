Kind of a late answer, but here it goes: I faced the exact same problem and ended up writing my own solution for it, working with .NET and SQL Server only however. It basicaly does implement the process you describe: All DB objects are kept as embedded CREATE scripts as part of the source code DB Objects are set up automatically (or on request) when using the data access functionality All non-table changes are also performed automatically (or on request) at the same time Table changes, which may require special attention to migrate data, are performend via (manually created) change scripts also upon upgrading the database Even manual changes made to any databse object can be detected, so that schema integrity can be verified and rectified An optional lightweight ORM can map stored procedures and objects as well as result sets (even multiple) A command-line application helps keeping the SQL source files in sync with a development database The library including the database are free under a LGPL license. http://code.google.com/p/bsn-modulestore/
