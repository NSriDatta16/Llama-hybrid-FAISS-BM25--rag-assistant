You usually dont need to change alignment settings for modern compilers. Even if compiler will store someting unaligned, program will be not broken. The only place where it can be needed is stuctures passed between linux and windows version of programm in binary (via files or via network). But in these cases the usage of pragma pack is better style. Update: drivers also require binary structures to be bit-by-bit equal with specification.
