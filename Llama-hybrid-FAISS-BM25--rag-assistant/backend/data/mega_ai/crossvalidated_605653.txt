A few observations that might help, based on the 11 count values you provide. First, it seems strange to have so many replicates with the exact same number of counts (3 with exactly 400, 4 with exactly 30) if the underlying distribution is supposed to be negative binomial (as I understand that DESeq2 assumes). I don't use DESeq2, so maybe there's something going on in the way it does the normalization. Second, the 11 data values you show indicate a slight problem with Cook's distance in a standard linear model. Try the following: countVals One sample in the last plot of standardized residuals versus leverage shows a Cook's distance greater than 0.5. The sample in question is the one with 300 counts, however, and I think that is too low to be flagged by DESeq. And these estimates are probably affected by the value grouping noted above. If you repeat this with: plot(lm(countVals[c(1:5,7:11)]~factor(labVals[c(1:5,7:11)]))) similar to your removing one sample from analysis, no samples exceed a Cook's distance of 0.5. Third, the default cutoff for the Cook's distance with DESeq depends on the number of samples. Reducing the number of samples will make the cutoff larger and reduce the number of outliers that are flagged. Fourth, the vignette says about the Cook's distance cutoff: The default is to use the 99% quantile of the F(p,m-p) distribution (with p the number of parameters including the intercept and m number of samples). A 99% quantile for a cutoff means that you can have 1% false positives. As the Cook's distance is calculated "for every gene and for every sample," having 350 genes flagged when you are presumably evaluating on the order of 20,000 genes in 11 samples might just represent those false positives. My sense is that the use of Cook's distance in DESeq is to help identify particular samples that show a problem. Try manual inspection of the samples with respect to PCA and boxplots of Cook's distance values. See the section in the vignette: "Note on many outliers."
