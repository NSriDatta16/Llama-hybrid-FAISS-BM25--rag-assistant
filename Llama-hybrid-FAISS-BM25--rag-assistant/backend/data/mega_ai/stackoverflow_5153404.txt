No, currently SQL::Translator::Producer::MySQL (and even DBIx::Class itself I think) do not provide a way to do this. However, according to the MySQL manual , these index collations are currently ignored: An index_col_name specification can end with ASC or DESC. These keywords are permitted for future extensions for specifying ascending or descending index value storage. Currently, they are parsed but ignored; index values are always stored in ascending order.
