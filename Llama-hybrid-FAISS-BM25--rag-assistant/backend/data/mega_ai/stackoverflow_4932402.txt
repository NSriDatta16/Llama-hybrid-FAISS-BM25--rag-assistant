New line writing to a file

I am trying to write to a file the log of my application. I have created an method which appends a line to the end of the line. public static void write2Log(String s){ StringBuilder contents = new StringBuilder(); File root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File logFile = new File(root, "testWrite2file.log"); if (root.canWrite()){ try { BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(logFile)); String line = null; while (( line = input.readLine()) != null){ contents.append(line); // contents.append(System.getProperty("line.separator")); } input.close(); FileWriter logWriter = new FileWriter(logFile); BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(logWriter); out.write(contents.toString()+"\r\n"+s);//// Everything works fine less the new character line. I have tried using: \r\n System.getProperty("line.separator") newline() But i keep getting all in just one line :( Any ideas?
