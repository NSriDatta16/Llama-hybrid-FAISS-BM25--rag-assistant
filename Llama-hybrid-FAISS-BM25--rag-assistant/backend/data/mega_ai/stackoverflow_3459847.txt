Google Maps API V3 and Local search problem - empty results?

I am trying to implement a Maps API V3 and Local Search but I seem to be having problems. Somehow, the results in the OnLocalSearch() function is empty. Here is my complete code: // FYI, I am using this as an example and I am stuck for a few hours now about this: http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn-history/r136/trunk/localsearch/places.html Any reply will be greatly appreciated. Regards, Wenbert UPDATE I made a mistake somewhere here: Also, make sure you double check the address you are geocoding. I am from the Philippines and it seems that Google only geocodes Major Roads.
