If you can organize the x and y coordinates of your line segments into 2-by-N arrays, you can use the function PLOT to plot each column of the matrices as a line. Here's a simple example to draw the four lines of a unit square: x = [0 1 1 0; ... 1 1 0 0]; y = [0 0 1 1; ... 0 1 1 0]; plot(x,y); This will plot each line in a different color. To plot all of the lines as black, do this: plot(x,y,'k');
