multiple linear regression with 5 records and 25 features

X1 X2 X[...] X25 Y Q1_2019 23 65 18 32 1,6 Q2_2019 87 32 23 46 1,2 Q3_2019 34 15 63 78 3,2 Q4_2019 85 45 43 65 3,9 Q1_2020 85 43 78 35 1,1 Q2_2020 37 78 54 78 1,5 I have a very expensive dataset which shows aggregated survey data. These are probably means. I am trying to get the individual data but at the moment that is all I have. The shape of data frame is 5x26 Y data so far is collected data calculated at the end of each quarter via other means The survey is done at the beginning of the quarter. Y is my dependent variable and I would like to derive a polynom to predict the exact number based on future X data or at least the probable trend it will be going in the next quarter once new survey data is available. Up, down, stable would be enough I have done correlation analysis (all vs all) and there are strong pairwise correlation between several X and Y Questions Y comes as a one digit before the comma and one digit after the comma. Since all other values are 2 digits before the comma I would like to multiply it with 10 to transform it into 2 digits before the comma.Is that ok from math/data science perspective? 5 records is not much but there are a lot of features. I would like to do multiple linear regression. Do you think this feasible with this data set? What would be objections and risks doing that? Would upsampling the dataset help me with anything here? Or could I just work with the five records? With the strange shape of the dataset especially the low number of records do you think that sufficient precision can be reached? How could I calculated the maximum possible precision/discriminative power possible with this dataset? (I am looking for strong arguments why they should give me access to the complete dataset)
