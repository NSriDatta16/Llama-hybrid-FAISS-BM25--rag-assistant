The typical logistic regression model is written as something like $$\log\left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right)=x^T\beta$$ where we model the log-odds by a linear combination of our predictor variables $x$. In the equation above $\pi$ would be the probability that you are interested in calculating a confidence interval for. Now, rearranging terms, we know that we can estimate the probability $\pi$ as $$\hat\pi=\frac{e^{x^T\hat\beta}}{1+x^T\hat\beta}$$ where $\hat\beta$ are the estimated coefficents from your linear regression. It should be noted that, since maximum likelihood estimates are invariant to transformation, $\hat\pi$ may also be considered the maximum likelihood estimate of $\pi$. So now, construction of confidence interval proceeds using the fact that $$\frac{x^T\hat\beta-x^T\beta}{\hat{SE}}\stackrel{.}{\sim} z$$ where $$\hat{SE}=\sqrt{x^T(X^TWX)^{-1}x}$$ We can then construct a $(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval for $x^T\beta$ as $$(L,U)=\left(x^T\hat\beta-z_{\alpha/2}\hat{SE},\,x^T\hat\beta+z_{\alpha/2}\hat{SE}\right)$$ and thus, finally, a $(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\pi$ is therefore $$\left(\frac{e^L}{1+e^L},\,\frac{e^U}{1+e^U}\right)$$ Some of the details above I have excluded assuming that you understand how a logistic regression works in general, and its corresponding design matrix, etc.
