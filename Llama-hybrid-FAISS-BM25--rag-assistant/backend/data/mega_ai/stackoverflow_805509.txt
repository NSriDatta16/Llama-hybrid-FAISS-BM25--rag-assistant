If you create a class for the association to type B it's fairly simple: You need some kind of list anyway. So just create a "PetList" or something like that, that has a Method " averageAge() " which computes this value from all it's pets. Now you can access the average by calling person.getPets().averageAge() . From an object-oriented point of view the information about the average shouldn't be directly in the Person-object anyway.
