DBSCAN considers all data points noise for reduced time series data

I had a data matrix 609 rows Ã— 264 columns, time-series data. Data was reduced using t-SNE algorithm to 3 dimensions. When being clustered I get zero clusters, where all data points are considered noise. I tried increasing eps until I reached 1.0, and I get same results for min_samples=2: zero clusters, all noise data. As a side note, I ran DBSCAN on t-SNE-reduced 2D data and I got (not so good but) more decent results. My question is how can the eps be 1.0, and I get no clusters for min_samples=2?
