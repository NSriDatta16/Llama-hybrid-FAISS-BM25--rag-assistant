Flash based network graphing?

Is there a flash widget that can read, say JSON/XML data, and create an interactive network graph that which users can drag nodes around? I'm not looking for software that creates static images... but something more dynamic, like "heavier" the node, the bigger it looks. That kind of Flash widget.
