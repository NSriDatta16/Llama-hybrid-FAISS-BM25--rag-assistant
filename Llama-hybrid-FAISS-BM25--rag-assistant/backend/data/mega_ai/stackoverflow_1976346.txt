Function before form or form before function?

What do you believe in? As an incomplete basis for a good product - would you prefer a mess of code that is horrible to look at but works perfectly for what its supposed to do, or a beautiful set of well organized classes (or something else if OO doesn't float your boat) but have buggy functionality that still needs a lot of work? If you were just handed a project to improve and work towards completion, which would you prefer? And what do you put the emphasis on when starting a new project?
