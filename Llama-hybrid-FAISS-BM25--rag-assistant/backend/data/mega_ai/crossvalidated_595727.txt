Instead of comparing the exposure for people who are cases and not cases, the case-crossover design compares exposure for a person at the time they had an event with their exposures at other times when they didn't have an event. In a matched case-control design, the conditional likelihood conditions on the number of events in a case and their matched controls (at a specific point in time). In a case-crossover design, you condition on the number of events at a case time and a set of control times, for a specific person. The original idea was that this would just give conditional logistic regression. In your example, the control times are the past 28 days except for the past 6 days -- which adds up to 22. You start off with the case records, and you end up with an extra 22 control records for each of them. You need to know the exposure for these 22 extra records, but it's air pollution. It's public. The government measures it and tells you. So, for each case you have a matched set of 22 control times and you do conditional logistic regression, estimating which $\beta$ best matches the relationship between exposure and being an event. This is all not quite true, though it is how the approach was derived. My first involvement with case-crossover designs in air pollution was to point out that the so-called conditional likelihood is not actually a conditional likelihood. Fortunately, maximising the 'conditional likelihood' does give pretty reasonable estimates, even though you can do better.
