Is it possible to achieve a -like effect without using the tag?

I personally like the tag because of how it draws a box and puts the at the top of it, over the border. Like this. However, the fieldset element was made to organize forms , and using it for general design is no better than using tables for general design. So, my question is... how can I achieve the same result using another tag? The border has to be erased under the (or whatever other tag will be used), and since there could be a "complex" body background image, I can't afford to just set the background-color of the legend to match the one of the element under. I'd like it to work without JavaScript, but CSS3 and XML-based formats (such as SVG or XHTML) are fine.
