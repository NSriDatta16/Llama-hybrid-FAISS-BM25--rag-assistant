Kohana ORM count_all() working but find_all() is not

I'm having an issue where I'm building an ORM query based on several conditions from a $_POST. The final query looks fine and returns records in a direct SQL query (phpmyadmin) but in my application does not return any records. here is the code... $records = ORM::factory('record')->where(array('date >='=>$_POST['fromdate'],'date $_POST['todate'])); if ($_POST['agent'] != '0') $records->where(array('ccp_id'=>$_POST['agent'])); if ($_POST['supervisor'] != '0') { $ccps = ORM::factory('employee')->where(array('supervisor_id'=>$_POST['supervisor'],'active'=>'1'))->find_all(); foreach ($ccps as $ccp) { $agents[] = $ccp->id; } // echo kohana::debug($agents); $records->in('ccp_id',$agents); } if ($_POST['lead'] != '0') $records->where(array('lead_id'=>$_POST['lead'])); if ($_POST['reasons'] != '[]') { $reasons = explode(',',str_replace(array('[',']','"'),'',$_POST['reasons'])); $records->in('reason_id',$reasons); } $records->find_all(); $records->loaded is false. If I change out the find_all() with count_all() I get an accurate count. With sample data in the $_POST I have this query in $records->last_query() SELECT `records`.* FROM (`records`) WHERE `date` >= '2010-10-10' AND `date` this returns 4 records in phpmyadmin and (4) for count_all(). I do not understand why this is happening. Any insights would be helpful. Thank you.
