Not the cause of your problem, I'm sure, but it's best not to serve a set of radio buttons without one of them selected. In your particular case, if you know that you set one when you serve the page, you don't need a "required" check; there's no way the user can get the radio buttons into a state where none are selected. Pick a sensible default, make it the first option, and make it selected. Simplify your life :) From the W3C: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#radio If no radio button in a set sharing the same control name is initially "on", user agent behavior for choosing which control is initially "on" is undefined. Note. Since existing implementations handle this case differently, the current specification differs from RFC 1866 ([RFC1866] section 8.1.2.4), which states: At all times, exactly one of the radio buttons in a set is checked. If none of the elements of a set of radio buttons specifies `CHECKED', then the user agent must check the first radio button of the set initially. Since user agent behavior differs, authors should ensure that in each set of radio buttons that one is initially "on".
