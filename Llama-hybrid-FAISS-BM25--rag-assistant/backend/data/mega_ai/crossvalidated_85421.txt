R auto.arima() with non-stationary covariates

I want to fit an ARMA model with covariates to a non-stationary time series. I have daily measurements for water flow for 4 stations (S1-S4) and the time series is not stationary, so I will have to take a first difference. I want to find an ARMA model that takes as covariates the other 3 stations. What I have done: a) m1 = auto.arima(S1, d=1, max.p, max.q, xreg=data.frame(S2,S3,S4)) b) m2 = auto.arima(diff(S1), d=0, max.p, max.q, xreg=data.frame(diff(S2),diff(S3),diff(S4))) My question: which model is correct, considering the series are non-stationary? I will appreciate any suggestion. Thank you, Patricia
