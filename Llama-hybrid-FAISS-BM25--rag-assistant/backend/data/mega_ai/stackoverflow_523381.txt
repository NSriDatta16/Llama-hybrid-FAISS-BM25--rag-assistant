It sounds like you want to do some very hardcore AIR hacking. I don't think hosting the AIR runtime in your own process will be very easy. But you might consider embedding the Flash Player ActiveX Control. Since it is just a COM object, any COM application can CoCreateInstance() the Flash Player. The COM interface is not well documented, but here are some examples that might be helpful: F-IN-BOX is a developer's library to enhance Macromedia Flash Player ActiveX features. It does not use its own engine to display movies but provide a wrapper around official swflash.ocx/flash.ocx code instead. How to embed Flash Player ActiveX using BoxedApp SDK If you want to get even lower level access, you could embed the open-source Tarmain AS3 VM . The code has an example command-line shell called "avmshell". If you build the Tamarin VM yourself, you can add new ActionScript classes implemented in native C++. Tamarin (and the Flash Player) implement many of their features using this "AVM Glue" between AS and C++.
