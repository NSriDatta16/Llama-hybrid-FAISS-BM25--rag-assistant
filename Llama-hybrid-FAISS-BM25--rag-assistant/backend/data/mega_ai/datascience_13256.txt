Your method looks interesting. I will borrow it when I have the chance. Let me make a couple of suggestions ("suggestions", not "prescriptions"): The price multiple is usually refer as "index." Consider indexing against an over-all weighted average, instead of doing the pairwise indexing. A weighted average index will make comparisons against a more stable denominator. To circumvent the missing values in the index, you can use the indexed lagged one unit of time, use it with today's values, and make updates (replacing today NA's with predictions) to be used tomorrow. In the past I tried the following: if the value of a quantity $X$ at time $t$ is not available, use $\hat X(t) = \text{most recent observed value of $X$}$. It did not work very well in my case for what I was trying to do, but if the dynamics of the quantities you are tracking is not too wild, it might work for you. You may combine both ideas, using 2) to update the baseline of the index in 1). Remember that there are no "best predictions". There are only "reasonable prediction methods", and "useful predictions." My suggestion of using some average as baline for the index is borne in from the fact that averages are more stable than single observations.
