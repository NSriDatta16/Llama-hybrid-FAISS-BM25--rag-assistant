Equivalent procedure to Scikit-Learns class_weight=balanced in Keras?

I want to train a SVM and a CNN with the same unbalanced multiclass-dataset and want to compare the results. I use Scikit-Learn for the SVM and Keras for the CNN. My goal is that no class is preferred during the training, every class should be considered equally important. For the SVM I use class_weight='balanced' . Would it make sense to use also Scikit-Learns class_weight='balanced' in Keras for training the CNN? What is your opinion? What would you recommend? Many thanks for every hint
