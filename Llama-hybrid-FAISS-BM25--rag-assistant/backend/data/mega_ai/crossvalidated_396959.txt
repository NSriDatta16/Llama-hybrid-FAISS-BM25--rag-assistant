The chi-squared test will answer the question "Are the sentiments positive vs. negative independent of the experience level of the user?" The null hypothesis is that they are statistically independent. I find that p-value is 0.0019, so you may reject the null hypothesis and assert that there is a dependence between these features. But you specifically ask "is there is any test i can do it beside chi square?" So I'll assume that you are not interested in/not happy with any $\chi^2$ results. So, to answer your question, YES, there is another test you can do. You may use a T test of means to determine if the mean sentiments of the experts is statistically significantly different from the mean sentiments of novices. If "like" has a value of 1 and don't-like has a value of 0, then your t-test will be between the novices with data (1 1 1 1 . . . 1 0 . . . 0) 22 1's and 9 0's and the experts with data (1..1 0..0) 12 1s and 27 zeros. I get a p value of .00062, or a rejection of the null that the two groups have the same average sentiments about the new Apple watch features.
