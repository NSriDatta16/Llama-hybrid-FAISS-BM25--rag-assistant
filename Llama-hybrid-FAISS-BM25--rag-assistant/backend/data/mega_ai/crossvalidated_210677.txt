Three stage least squares have some efficiency gains with respect to two stage least squares but it might not always be applicable. It's really a huge field that depends, among other things, on the quality of your instruments. Two good applied resources are: 1. This paper on estimating oil demand and supply 2. The introductory paper for the systemfit package which explains well the kind of tests you want to run to discriminate between 3SLS and 2SLS Both seem targeted to the economics graduate but that's just a consequence of the field's need to deal with simultaneity and shouldn't discourage you.
