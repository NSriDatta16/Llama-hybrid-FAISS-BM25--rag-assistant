Why noisy data will benefit Bayesian?

Recently I am reading a paper in 2001, Michael D. Ernst, Jake Cockrell, William G. Griswold, David Notkin Dynamically Discovering Likely Program Invariants to Support Program Evolution TSE 2001 , in this paper, it says, Learning approach such as Bayesian and PAC learning, assume there is noise in the input data and hence, inaccuracies in classification are acceptable or even beneficial. I never knew Bayesian will be benefited by noisy data. So, my questions are: Noisy data will really benefit Bayesian? If so, it will improve accuracy or simply speed up the model? What does "noisy data" here really mean? Because I tried to check some resources, one paper said, noisy data will speed up EM, and noisy data there means latent data or missing data. I felt EM has some connection with Bayesian, so I am wondering whether there is any connection...
