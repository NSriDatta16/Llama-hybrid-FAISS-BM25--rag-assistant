If I were in your shoes I would try to leverage what I knew (sprocs) with Linq2Sql. Linq2Sql can still use your sprocs but then you have the added bonus of putting a new tool in your belt. I think having a grasp on the Linq2XXX (X being a random technology not adult entertainment....which isn't a bad idea now that I think of it) syntax and methodology is going to be a great addition to your skill set using Linq over a collection of objects is way sweet. But ultimately something like NHibernate will suit you better in the long run.
