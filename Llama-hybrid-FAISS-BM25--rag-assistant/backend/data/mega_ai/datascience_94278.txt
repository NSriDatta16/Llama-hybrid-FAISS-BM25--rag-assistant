Slight confusion on the learning process

Hi guys I have a slight confusion on the learning process of neural networks. When the input layer receives inputs, goes through the hidden layers and then into the output layer. How does the neural network know that the outputs at the output layer are incorrect? When the error is calculated at the output layer, it needs the predicted output which is fine but how is the actual output found? Thanks
