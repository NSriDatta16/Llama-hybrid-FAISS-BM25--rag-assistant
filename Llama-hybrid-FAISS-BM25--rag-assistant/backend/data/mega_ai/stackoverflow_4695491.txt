I was having this same issue with "live" and sortable when I found your post (delegate has the same problem as well). To follow up on the observation @Stephen made about clicking on the drag handle once before an item's click handler bound with live works without having to click twice... I've successfully used this workaround. For a hack, I don't find it too offensive. $('table.demo tbody').sortable({ handle: 'td.drag', stop: function(e,ui){ $('td.drag', ui.item).click(); } }); I'm just issuing a click call to the drag handler as soon as the drag is complete, and now other items (in my row) that I have bound with live do not require clicking on twice.
