Showing 0 covariance for special form of AR(1) time series

This is an exercise I have been trying to solve but have not made much progress. Suppose $\{Z_t\}$ is an AR(1) process with $\rho_1 = \phi$ . Define the sequence $\{b_t\}$ as $b_t = Z_t - \phi Z_{t+1}$ . Show that $Cov(b_t, b_{t-k}) = 0$ for all $t$ and $k$ . Show that $Cov(b_t,b_{t+k}) = 0$ for all $t$ and $k > 0$ . I've tried rearranging the terms, for instance writing $b_t = (1-\phi^2)Z_t - W_{t+1}$ (where $W_t$ is white noise from the AR(1)). I then wrote this in linear form: $$(1-\phi^2)(\phi^tZ_0 + \sum\limits_{i=0}^{t-1}\phi^iW_{t-i}) - W_{t+1}$$ And then calculating covariance the usual way, $E(b_tb_{t-k}) - E(b_t)E(b_{t-k})$ but it did not result in the expected solution; in fact I could not reduce it to simple terms. Is there some property or rearrangement I can use to solve this?
