Using DNS for failover using multiple A records

It has recently come to my attention that setting up multiple A records for a hostname can be used not only for round-robin load-balancing but also for automatic failover. So I tried testing it: I loaded a page from our domain Noted which of our servers had served the page Turned off the web server on that host Reloaded the page And indeed the browser automatically tried a different server to load the page. This worked in Opera, Safari, IE, and Firefox. Only Chrome failed to try a different server. But after leaving that server offline for a few minutes and looking at the access logs, I found that the number of requests to the other servers had not significantly increased . With 1 out of 3 servers offline, I had expected accesses to each of the remaining 2 servers to roughly increase by 50%, but instead I only saw 7-10%. That can only mean DNS-based failover does not work for the majority of browsers/visitors, which directly contradicts what I had just tested. Does anyone have an idea what is up with DNS-based web browser failover? What possible reason could there be why automatic failover works for me but not the majority of our visitors?
