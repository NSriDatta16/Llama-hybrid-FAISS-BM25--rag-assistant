You describe two types of noise you want to remove. (BTW the wikipedia page for noise reduction isn't bad, look at the "in images" section). One type is odd dots noise. This is often called "speckle" or "salt and pepper" noise, and is usually removed by some sort of averaging filter. There's a good page describing some algorithms for this at mathworks . The second type is lines. This is harder, and I wouldn't really describe it as noise, it would be dependent on you input image type. This paper seems appropriate, but it isn't available for free online, so you might have to buy it or go to your local University library. You might also want to look at this , which is downloadable from many places, but is really for motion pictures (video), so probably not what you want.
