What is the 'standard' concerning style guidelines in JavaScript?

First of all, I'd like to say that I'm not trying to start a discussion on what is the best coding style. Rather, I was wondering what is actually the global standard when it comes to styling your code. I've seen different websites and mainly open source organisations which have their own guideline page, which for example says that you should put } else { on the same line. Are there some (un)written rules concerning code style which apply to all JavaScript being written? Is there a common preference for specific coding styles? Or is this really on a per-organisation basis?
