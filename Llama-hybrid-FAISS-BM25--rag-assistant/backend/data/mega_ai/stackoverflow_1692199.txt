I'm assuming this is related to .NET managed C++ because standard C++ has no sense of "dispose". Delete will release the memory used to store the object; this memory returns to the heap and can be used for other storage requirements. Dispose will give the object the chance to release resources it acquired such as file handles, etc. Standard C++ would see this sort of task done in the destructor.
