I liked Jan Jongboom's answer. Here is another alternative using file access instead of a WCF service: Get the path to the image file, using either System.Win32.OpenFileDialog for a dialog box, or DataObject for drag-and-drop. Combine a fixed server UNC path (such as \\MyServer\Share\Directory ) with the image file name using Path.Combine() Call File.Copy() to copy the image to the server path you built in step 2 Store the server path in the database
