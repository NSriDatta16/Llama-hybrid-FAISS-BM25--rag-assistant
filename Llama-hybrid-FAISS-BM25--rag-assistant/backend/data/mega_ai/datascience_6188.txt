What is the best way to propose an item from a set based on previous choices?

The goal of this question is to be able to propose a user further choices based on his past experiences: like Amazon's book advices. From a set of mp3 files, I assume that a set of mp3 tags data is already filled, based on the music he/she has alredy listened to : what is the easiest way to implement a machine learning that is able to propose a list of music choices based on the user's set ? NB : I'm a Machine learning novice I'd appreciate if the answer could be based on Orange, Weka or these kind of tools. Update: removed the classification tag as recommanded. For new comers as me: - the book Predictive Analytics For Dummies is a nice general introduction about this subject - a next step would be the the paper Finding Clusters of Similar Artists which is really interesting especially for the K-means approach - The millions songs dataset which is a gold mine with its huge dataset as well as tutorials with Python codes to use with it - special thanks sheldonkreger for his answer with neo4J graph usage idea wich is really interesting
