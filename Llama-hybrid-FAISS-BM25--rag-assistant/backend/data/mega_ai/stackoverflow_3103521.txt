Google analtyics is showing hundreds of 404s resulting from a null url

Looking at analytics for a site I maintain that is powered by Magento I am seeing that every week there are lots of visitors reaching a 404 page and it is because there is null being appended to the url. I am always on the site and have never had this happen and have no idea where these are coming from. Has anyone else encountered this or have any ideas on how I can diagnose how these are being generated?
