Turn jQuery into vanilla JS - Insert p element after h1

Any ideas on how I would convert this jQuery to vanilla JS: $('.section > h1').after(' This paragraph was inserted with jQuery '); I am new to jQuery and even newer to vanilla JS. This is as far as I got: var newP = document.createElement('p'); var pTxt = document.createTextNode('This paragraph was inserted with JavaScript'); var header = document.getElementsByTagName('h1'); Not sure where to go from here?
