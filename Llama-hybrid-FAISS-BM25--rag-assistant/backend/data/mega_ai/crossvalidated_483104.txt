A simple way to obtain a conditional probability for your problem is to use a logistic regression. A logistic regression is a way to model a conditional probability in which we assume that a binary variable $y$ is conditionally distributed over ${\bf x}=(x_1, \ldots, x_M)$ as $$ t\vert{\bf x} \sim \text{Bern}(\sigma({\bf w}^T {\bf x})) $$ You could obtain the expectation of the conditional distribution via maximum likelihood, a.k.a., minimization of the cross-entropy cost function, or follow a probabilistic approach and find the predictive conditional distribution. To solve your problem via maximum likelihood you can use a library such as scikit-learn . I am not aware of any libraries that let you find the predictive conditional distirbution, but you can check this notebook for a guide on how to implement it.
