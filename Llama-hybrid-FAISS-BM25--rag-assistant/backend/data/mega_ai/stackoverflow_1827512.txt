How to organize a webapp?

I'm starting my first webapp, and I'm not sure how things typically are done. I'm using Django and Apache: How do you manage a source control repository? Do you check out to a separate folder, and then have a build script that copies files over? What exactly should be added to the repository? In other words, how do you make sure that you don't commit auto-generated files? (it's sometimes hard to tell what's auto-generated and what I just haven't figured out yet :) How do I first deploy to a private development page, and then deploy to the main page when ready? Can I set up two servers? If so, how? I know these are kinda newbie questions, but I can't seem to find a good tutorial that really explains these fundamental issues.
