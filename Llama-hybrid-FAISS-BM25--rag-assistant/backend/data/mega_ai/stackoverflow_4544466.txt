Well, you need to store the last time someone sent a POST somewhere. You have several options: In a cookie - This is not as safe as the other options, as the client can manipulate / remove the cookie. In server session ($_SESSION) - This is the easiest way, since you don't need to track a specific client by IP or something like that. In a database - This is the most flexible way, you can easily see and manage your clients. Each time when someone makes a POST, check in your storage when they last did a post, and deny it if it was to soon. You could also do this on client side, using javascript. However, that's not as safe as the client can disable/manipulate it.
