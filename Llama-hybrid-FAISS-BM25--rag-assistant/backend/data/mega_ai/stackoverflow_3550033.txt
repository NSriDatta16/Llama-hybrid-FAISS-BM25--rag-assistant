is there any benefit to nulling references to "encourage" .NET garbage collection?

Suppose there is the following code: foreach (...) { List localList = new List (100); // do stuff localList = null; } From time to time, I am tempted to null references just as the procedure is about to exit (that is, return) or in this case, just as it is about to loop. Is there any benefit to doing so, even if a small one?
