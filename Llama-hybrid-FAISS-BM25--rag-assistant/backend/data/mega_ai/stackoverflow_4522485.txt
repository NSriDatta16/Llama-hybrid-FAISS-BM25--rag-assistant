Fetching records from different tables in the database

My application has a facebook-like stream that displays updates of various types. So it will show regular posts (from the "posts" table), and events (from the "events" tables) table and so on. The problem is I have no idea how to fetch these records from different tables since they have different columns. Shall I query the database multiple times and then organize the data in PHP? if so, how? I'm not sure how I should approach this. Your help is much appreciated :)
