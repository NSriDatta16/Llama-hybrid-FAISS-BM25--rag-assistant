Android: Why user agent value is missing

this question is continuation to my previous question : How to set user agent for new ACTION_VIEW intent . In my application I am launching a new Intent with url (browser) using the following code: Intent myIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW,Uri.parse(url)); try { context.startActivity(myIntent); } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) { Log.e(TAG, "cannot initiate Browser", e); } In the server side I see that some request headers containing "Apache-HttpClient/UNAVAILABLE (java 1.4)" as a user agent value. Does anyone know if there any device, operator, browser or any other cause that will not sent the real user agent? thanks -Z
