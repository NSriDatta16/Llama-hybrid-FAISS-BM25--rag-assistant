Resources to build SNMP support for my device?

Can any one recommend resources for adding SNMP support for my device? my understanding the steps I need to do are as follow: Create a MIB file that define what values your MIB will support Use code generator to convert it to C module Use generated code to fetch real values Convert the module to an agentx sub agent, so you can integrate your MIB a separate process that could work with any snmp agent that support agentx protocol. Are my assumption correct, any suggestions or corrections, I am specially looking for resources that help me, books, courses, online, etc... Thanks
