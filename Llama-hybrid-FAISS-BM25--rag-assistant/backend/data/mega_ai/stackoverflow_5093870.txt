immutable chrome sqlite return objects

I am using a sqlite DB as a storage system for a webapp. I been using the objects that are returned from queries directly in application. For example: function get_book_by_id(id,successCallback,errorCallback) { function _successCallback(transaction, results) { if(results.rows.length==0) {successCallback(null);} else { book=results.rows.item(0); successCallback(book); } } db.transaction( function (transaction) { transaction.executeSql("SELECT id,title,content,last_read from books where id=?;",[id], _successCallback, errorCallback); }); } This returns me an object with the given id, all columns are provided as properties. Nice. The problem I just figured out is that all the properties of the result set object are immutable. So for example if I want to change the property 'title' it takes no effect, which in my opinion makes no sense. Example: get_book_by_id(1,handle,error); function handle(book) { //THIS DOESN'T WORK, book.title is still what it was. book.title=book.title+"more text"; } I of course can convert all my DB objects into mutable objects, but I rather would not do that. Is that an expected behavior? Can I request mutable objects? I am using google chrome 9.0 on Mac OS X.
