What usually happens is that the developer creates a booter loader that they load on storage device (such as HDD, CD/DVD, USB, etc). The bootloader has (if I remember correctly, it's been over 8 years since I did this) 512K address to point to a startup register (usually 08h ). That 512K address will store your address to your environment variables, startup address, etc. The developer then writes a program and sets his main method to point to the startup boot address (usually 08h but that is not standard, it is vendor specific) so that when the bootloader points to the startup address, the program connected to the startup address is booted and run. Language, hardcore C/C++/Assembly (or Pascal since it is capable of doing so).
