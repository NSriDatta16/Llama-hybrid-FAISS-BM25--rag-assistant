It certainly is possible to create a shopping cart without mySQL, e.g. using flat files for data storage instead. But if you have a mySQL based solution working, it's probably a better idea (and perfectly possible) to fix the encoding issues right there. mySQL is perfectly capable of storing hebrew characters with a UTF-8 character set. If you provide details of what goes wrong at which point, you are very likely to get the problem solved on Stack Overflow.
