I believe you can use XMLHTTPRequest (Ajax Technology) to ping your server to, say, blank page with simple session_start(); Say, every fifteen minutes (default PHP session timeout is 20 seconds) so they don't overload your server. But, if you do really want to have persist data, a cookie with no explicit expired time are being cleaned on browser exit, so you can store a storage key in cookie. This have one advantage over session -- if client's network connection dies, the session is still working. But this risks more of the session hijacking. If you are talking about keeping login persists within a browser session, a cookie way is preferred, and is in used by many sites around the world, including Drupal, Wordpress and Joomla! CMS.
