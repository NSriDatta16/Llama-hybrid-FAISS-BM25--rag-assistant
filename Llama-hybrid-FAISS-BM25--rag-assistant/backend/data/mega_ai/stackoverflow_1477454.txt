Storing Custom Classes in Objective-C

I need to take existing classes for an iPhone application and store them in a preference/plist/some other data storage format. A good comparison of what I need to store is a gradebook, with the following class structure: GBGradebook + NSArray (GBAssignment) + NSArray (GBClasses) + NSArray (GBStudent) GBStudent + NSString *studentName ... GBAssignment + GBGrade *grade ... GBGrade + NSNumber *pointsReceived + NSNumber *maxPoints ... That's the basic class structure. What is the best way to store this data?
