Looks like your query is a 3 part question How missing data occur : Missing data can occur when no data value is stored for a variable, or because of nonresponse, or the information is just not available Understanding missingness : forms of missingness take different types MCAR(missing completely at random) : Missing data values do not relate to any other data in the dataset and there is no pattern to the actual values of the missing data themselves. MAR(missing at random) : Missing data do have a relationship with other variables in the dataset. However, the actual values that are missing are random. MNAR(missing not at random) : The pattern of missingness is related to other variables in the dataset, but in addition, the values of the missing data are not random. Handling missing data : Once you have understood what missingness is all about. Next step is to handle them, dropping missing data or replacing with mean/mode is few of the techniques. Deletion methods Listwise deletion: ideal for MCAR Pairwise deletion: ideal for MAR or MCAR Single imputation: Mean/Median/Mode substitution Regression imputation LOCF(Last observation carried forward) Model-Based methods: Maximum likelihood: best maximum likelihood technique is EM (Expectation-Maximization) Multiple Imputation: MICE algorithm, Amelia(ideal for time series) are few packages that handle multiple imputation. Look into these for better understanding of your missingness missing data imputation handling missing data in R
