Compute the centers of the predefined partitions, and use these to run k-means. Try to find a library that has the book by Hartigan, his variant should be explained there. A good article discussing the merits of his variant is this: Hartiganâ€™s Method: k-means Clustering without Voronoi Telgarsky, Vattani And always remember that K-means is just a partitioning heuristic . It does not actually look for structure, and there are tons of toy examples where it just fails badly. Consider it a preprocessing method. In particular, when the Euclidean distance isn't what you really want to use on your data. Being a good heuristic means it will often give reasonable good results; in particular when used in certain ways. Even when the results (e.g. due to outliers) may appear quite bad in a strict analysis of the clustering result.
