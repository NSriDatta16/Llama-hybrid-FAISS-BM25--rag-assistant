Which p-value to report in a comparison of different logistic regression models using marginal effects?

I am running logistic regression models to compare the impact of different indicators using Stata. As these comparisons may lead to false conclusion due to confounding and rescaling if log-odds or odds ratios are compared (see Karlson/Holm/Breen 2012 and Mood 2010), I am comparing average marginal effects. However, Stata sometimes shows z- and p-values which differ between the original log-odds estimation and the average marginal effects estimation of the same model. My question is, which of these different z- and p-values should I include or use in a table which compares the models, e.g. to print the popular significance stars? Here is an example, which shows the existence of these estimation differences with example data from Stata: . webuse acmemanuf . logit acceptable i.temp y, nolog Logistic regression Number of obs = 49 LR chi2(3) = 14.43 Prob > chi2 = 0.0024 Log likelihood = -23.740177 Pseudo R2 = 0.2330 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ acceptable | Coef.

The differences between the estimations for the two "temperature" values are very small and may even occur due to rounding issues etc., but the differences for the "y"-variable are relatively large, especially if one considers the z-values. Of course, it does not matter much in this case as no p-value falls under or climbs above conventional limits. But what if they would do so? Literature: Karlson, K.B., A. Holm & R.
