Another thing is to show how well behaved your variables are. If, for example, one of your variables is the salary, and you have interviewed exactly one billionaire, when you input his salary into the logistic regression is going to dominate over everything else, so you will likely learn to ignore the salary, regardless of how much actual information it may hold. Some methods are more sensitive than others to skewness and extreme values, and logistic regression is rather on the sensitive side. Of course, the final proof is in the pudding, and you can compare the results obtained with the raw data, or with each feature transformed towards normality.
