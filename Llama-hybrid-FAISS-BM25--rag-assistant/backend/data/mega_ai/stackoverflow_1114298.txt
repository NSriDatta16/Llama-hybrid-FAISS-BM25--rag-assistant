You should post your C# code in the question (sounds a bit like homework, people will have more faith if you demonstrate you've already done the effort in one language and are really trying to learn more about another). There isn't necessarily much F#-specific here, you can do this pretty similarly in any .Net language. There are a number of strategies you can use, for example below I use regular expressions for lexing out the words... only a couple F# idioms below, though. open System open System.Text.RegularExpressions let text = @"Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Paul G Someone), entered March 18, 2008, which, in an action for personal injuries sustained in a trip and fall over a pothole allegedly created by the negligence of defendants City or Consolidated McPherson, and a third-party action by Consolidated McPherson against its contractor (Mallen), insofar as appealed from, denied, as untimely, Mallen's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and third-party complaint, unanimously affirmed, without costs. Parties are afforded great latitude in charting their procedural course through the courts, by stipulation or otherwise. Thus, we affirm the denial of Mallen's motion as untimely since Mallen offered no excuse for the late filing." let lines = text.Split([|'\n'|]) // If was in file, could use //let lines = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"c:\path\filename.txt") // just like C#. For this example, assume have giant string above let fullText = String.Join(" ", lines) let numParagraphs = let mutable count = 1 for line in lines do // look for blank lines, assume each delimits another paragraph if Regex.IsMatch(line, @"^\s*$") then count Seq.iteri (fun n word -> if 0=String.Compare(word, token, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) then printfn "Found %s at word %d" word n ) let tokensToFind = ["insofar"; "thus"; "the"] for token in tokensToFind do Find token
