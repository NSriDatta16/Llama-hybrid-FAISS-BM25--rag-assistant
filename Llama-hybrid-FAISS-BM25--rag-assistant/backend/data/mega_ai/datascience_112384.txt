Is a Gaussian process necessary for that? No - There are many ways to handle uncertainty in machine learning. For example, a Gaussian process is parametric. You can also use non-parametric methods like kernel density estimates (KDE. Can a simple distance to a few nearest data points be used as a measure of the uncertainty of a prediction? Yes - For models that use distance metrics. Not all machine learning models use distance metrics. And thus, can any machine learning method be considered a probabilistic method? No - There are many machine learning methods that are not probabilistic. One example is a decision tree.
