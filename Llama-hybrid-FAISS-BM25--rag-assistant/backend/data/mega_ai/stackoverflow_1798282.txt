That's not what's causing your problem, but.. Isn't this wrong? var txt = el.innerHTML; el.innerHTML = txt; Edit: Try this: One simple, but not very efficient implementation of a dictionary is a linked list. In this implementation all operations take linear time in the worst case (and even in the average case), assuming that insertions first check whether the item is in the current list. A more scalable implementation of a dictionary is a balanced search tree. In this lecture note we present two even more efficient data structures based on hashing. and... function tagText() { var range = window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0); range.surroundContents(document.createElement("b")); }
