Have a wrapper around your program that does the following. import sys req_version = (2,5) cur_version = sys.version_info if cur_version >= req_version: import myApp myApp.run() else: print "Your Python interpreter is too old. Please consider upgrading." You can also consider using sys.version() , if you plan to encounter people who are using pre-2.0 Python interpreters, but then you have some regular expressions to do. And there might be more elegant ways to do this.
