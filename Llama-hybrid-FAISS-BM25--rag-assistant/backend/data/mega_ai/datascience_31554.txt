Your question is quite broad so it is not easy to give a direct answer. However, a simple approach and a good introduction to machine learning would be to use a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) . This is one of the most basic and fundamental neural network architectures. You will also want to read about Backpropagation , which is the standard method of training such algorithms. Here are some code examples/libraries (in no particular order) that can get you started: Keras - (Python) Theano - (Python) DeepLearning4J - (Java) Caffe - (C++/Python/Matlab) TensorFlow - (C++/Python) Weka - (Java)
