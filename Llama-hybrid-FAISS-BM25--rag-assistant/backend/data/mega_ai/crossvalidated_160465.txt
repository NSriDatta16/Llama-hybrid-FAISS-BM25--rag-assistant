What to do with important features?

I am currently solving the titanic problem in kaggle . The data of the problem consists of several features such as "sex", "class in society", etc., and you are to predict whether a person survived the titanic incident or not. According to the analysis of other people, females are more likely to survive than males. They analysed the data using graphs. Given that information, am I supposed to do anything so that my model would know that the "sex" feature is important? Or is the analysis only important for data science (i.e. for the sake of knowing which gender survived the most).
