Why does the first eigenvector in PCA resemble the derivative of an underlying trend?

I am using PCA to analyze several spatially related time series, and it appears that the first eigenvector corresponds to the derivative of the mean trend of the series (example illustrated below). I am curious as to why the first eigenvector relates to the derivative of the trend as opposed to the trend itself? The data are arranged in a matrix where the rows are the time series for each spatial entity and the columns (and in turn dimensions in the PCA) are the years (i.e. in the example below, 10 time series each of 7 years). The data are also mean-centered prior to the PCA. Stanimirovic et al., 2007 come to the same conclusion, but their explanation is a little beyond my grasp of linear algebra. [Update] - adding data as suggested. [Update2] - ANSWERED. I found my code was incorrectly using the transpose of the eigenvector matrix when plotting results ( excel_walkthrough )(thanks @amoeba). It looks like it's just a coincidence that the transpose-eigenvector/derivative relationship exists for this particular setup. As described mathematically and intuitively in this post, the first eigenvector does indeed relate to the underlying trend and not its derivative .
