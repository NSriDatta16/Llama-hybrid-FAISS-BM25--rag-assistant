In simple words.... an overfitted logistic regression model has large variance, means decision boundry changes largely for small change in variable magnitude. consider following image the right most one is overfitted logistic model, its decision boundry has large no. of ups and downs while the middel one is just fit it has moderate variance and moderate bias. the left one is underfit it has high bias but very less variance. one more thing_ An overfitted regrresion model have too many features while underfit model has very less no. of features.
