XSL / Schemas beginners question

Been using XML for ages now for data storage & transfer, but have never had to validate or transform it. Currently starting a new project and making some design decisions and need to know some rudimentary things about XSL & Schemas. Our XML is like this (excuse the boring book example :) ): 1 Book1 24.?? US 1 24.69 Our requirements: Transformation a) Turn "US" into United States b) if Price > 20 create a new lLement True I'm guessing this is done with XSLT, but can anyone give me some pointers on how to achieve this? Validation a) is ID an integer, is Price a float (the most important job to be honest) b) Are all tags filled, e.g. the name tag is not filled (2nd most important) c) Are all tags present, e.g. Country is missing for book 2 d) [Probably tricky] Is the ID element unique through all books? (nice to have) From what I have read this is done with a Schema or Relax NG, but can the results of the validation be outputted to a simple HTML to display a list or errors? e.g. Book 1: Price "Price.??" is not float Book 2: ID is not unique, Name empty, Country missing Or would it be better do do these things programatically in C#? Thanks.
