By far the most common reason this happens to me is that I failed to notice that there was an error compiling the application so it didn't push the new version. Especially when my package explorer is obscured so I don't notice the red X. Edit: one other reason it often happens to me is I have more than one emulator running or my phone or tablet plugged, and I accidently install the latest version to the wrong device without paying attention.
