For better understanding I have added a picture here. Auto encoder follows the strategy of neural network. Auto encoder is comprised with encoder and decoder. Half of it's encoder and remaining is decoder. According to the image there are multiple features x1, x2,x3 and encoder encoding it and providing z1 and z2 as output. So z1 and z2 is the encoded output. Reversely, if you decode again in the same way you will get the input. However, it may not be exact as the input. But, it's close to the input. Basically, depends on error rate. Auto encoder is used for multidimensional feature to be reduced as shown in the picture. The Decoder part is used to measure the auto encoder is preforming well or not. I mean measure the error rate of encoded features. Most of the time after training the model the decoder remains unused.
