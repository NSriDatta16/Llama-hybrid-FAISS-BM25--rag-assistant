Are you using any Borland proprietary components? If so, I'd say you're out of luck. You'd have to replace those components, and this is likely not to be easy. I should say you may not find a tool that can automatically "translate" these. If not, it should be easier. But be aware that Borland compiler has support for many things that are not C++ standard. If your code is portable enough, you'll be fine just recompiling it under VS. You might have to change some header files, replace some pragmas, but nothing too complicated.
