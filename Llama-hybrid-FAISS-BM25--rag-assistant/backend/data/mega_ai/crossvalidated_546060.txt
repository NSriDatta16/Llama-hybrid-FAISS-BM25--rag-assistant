Dimension selection based on test accuracy

consider that I have a dataset with train, validation and test set and I want to train the pipeline PCA+logistic regression classifier. So far, for a specific k (that is the reduced data dimension from PCA), a logistic regression classifier is trained on the training set, using the validation set for tuning the parameters of the classifier. The fine-tuned classifier is subsequently used to get an accuracy for the test data. Then, for another value of k, the same procedure is followed to get another accuracy for the test data. Is it fair to follow this procedure to choose the best value for k?
