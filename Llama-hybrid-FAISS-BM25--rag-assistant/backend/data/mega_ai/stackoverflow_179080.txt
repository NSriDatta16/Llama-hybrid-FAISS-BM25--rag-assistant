When unit tests don't exist or are terribly hard to add with proper coverage in the time frame given, you are going to have to rely on regular testing. In theory, this large and dirty code base you talk about has been deemed fit for use for a time now past. In order to make that determination, there was either programmer testing, QA testing or some kind of testing done by the customer. You want to find out how that was done, what was done, if it's enough to cover what changes you'll make, and then get a commitment to have that done again plus whatever testing is needed for the new code until the product is good enough. Unit tests are a great service to a programmer, but they're not the only kind of testing out there.
