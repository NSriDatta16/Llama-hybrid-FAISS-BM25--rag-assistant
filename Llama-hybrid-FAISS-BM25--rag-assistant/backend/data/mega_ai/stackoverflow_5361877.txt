To renew the development profile before it expired, I finally found a way that works for me. I boldfaced the steps I had been missing before. Go to the Apple provisioning portal, select "Provisioning". You'll get a list "Development Provisioning Profiles" where you'll see your soon to expire profile with the label "Managed by XCode". Click the "New Profile" button on top, select the type of profile you want and create it. Wait half a minute, refresh the home screen and when it shows the new profile as "Active", switch back to XCode, go to the Organizer, select "Provisioning profiles" under "Library" in left top column. Click "Refresh" at the bottom, log in (if it asks) and the new profile appears in the list after a short while. Now, crucially, connect your device and drag your new profile to the "Provisioning Profiles" row under the connected device in the left column. Finally, you can clean up the old profiles from your device if you feel like it. Note: interestingly, it seems that simply marking and deleting your provisioning profile on the iOS Provisioning Portal site causes a new fresh Team Provisioning Profile to be created. So maybe that is all that is needed. I will try that next time to see if that is enough, if so you don't need to create a profile as I described above.
