Schedule Controls for ASP.Net MVC

Are there any scheduling components, commercial or otherwise, for ASP.Net MVC? Our company currently uses the Infragistics WebSchedule controls, but they don't appear to support MVC. Edit: I think I may have been a bit unclear, I am not looking for a task scheduler, rather I am looking for a web calendar/appointment/schedule management framework or component set. Something that would include a Month/Week/Day view of a calendar and allow me to create and display appointment items. A framework that would let me build something like Google calendar, except the appointments would be stored in my database, not Googles.
