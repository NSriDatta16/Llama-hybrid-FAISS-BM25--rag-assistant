I think the criterion of having an observation exceed $\bar X + 2S$ is intended as a way to highlight an observation as an "outlier." This criterion does not work very well because the large observation 120 itself leads to inflating both $\bar X$ and $S$ so that $\bar X + 2S$ is larger than it "should" be. A better criterion might be to delete 120 before computing mean $\bar X^\prime$ and $S^\prime.$ Then you'd have $120 > 6.082.$ [Computation using R.] x.d = c(2,3,4,5); mean(x.d) + 2*sd(x.d) [1] 6.081989 Another method is to use the interquartile range (IQR) as a 'robust' measure of variability (which does not depend so crucially on any one observation). That is the idea behind using boxplots to suggest possible outliers. x = c(2, 3, 4, 120, 5) boxplot(x, horizontal=T) The boxplot 'outlier' rule is to suggest any observation above $Q_3 + 1.5\text{IQR}$ as a high outlier, where $Q_3$ is the third quartile. Similarly, any observation below $Q_1 - 1.5\text{IQR}$ is suggested as a possible low outlier. All outlier criteria need to be used with great caution because some distributions routinely have 'outliers'--especially in large samples. Almost all samples of size 100 from an exponential distribution have 'outliers'. More specifically, for the simulation below about 99% of exponential samples of size 100 had at least one outlier and the average number of outliers per sample was nearly 5. nr.out = replicate(10^5, length(boxplot.stats(rexp(100))$out)) mean(nr.out) [1] 4.84265 mean(nr.out > 0) [1] 0.99023 Even among samples of size 100 from a normal distribution, over 90% have at least one 'boxplot outlier'--but usually only one or two of them per sample. Generating such a sample with today's date as seed, I happened to get three 'outliers'. set.seed(1116); x = rnorm(100) boxplot(x, horizontal=T)
