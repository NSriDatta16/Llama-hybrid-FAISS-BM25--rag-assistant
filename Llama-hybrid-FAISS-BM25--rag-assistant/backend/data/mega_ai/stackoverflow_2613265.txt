Chances are that you're getting z-fighting at steep angles ( i.e when all points have very similar z values ) because 1) You're z-buffer resolution is too low i.e you've set a 16-bit z buffer - try changing the resolution to 32-bit 2) Your model is very small i.e all your points are too close together. You could try scaling up the model. Using a fixed offset will give inconsistent results because most z-buffer schemes are biased to give higher-resolution the closer you are to the near clip plan i.e you need a smaller offset the closer you are to the near clip plane. Here's a gamedev article that discusses the problem in more depth Note that anti-aliasing and changing shader are unlikely to help much here ( unless you did some funky custom pixel shader to modulate the z-values but that seems an overkill to me though I'm no expert on pixel/fragment shaders so it may be doable)
