That's utterly impossible to diagnose from the command line switches, you have to use a profiler. One thing that's relevant however is you using the /clr option. Unless you explicitly use #pragma managed in your code, everything will be translated to IL, even the STL template code. Which means that your optimization settings have no effect whatsoever since they only apply to generated machine code. You are then subject to what the JIT compiler does for optimization. It will not optimize by default when you have a debugger attached for example.
