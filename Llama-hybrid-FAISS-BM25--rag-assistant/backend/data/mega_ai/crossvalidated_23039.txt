You could do a grid search: start with ARIMA(1,0,0) and try all the possibilities up to ARIMA(5,2,5) or something. Fit the model to each series, and estimate a scale-independent error measurement like MAPE or MASE (MASE would probably be better). Choose the ARIMA model with the lowest average MASE across all your models. You could improve this procedure by cross-validating your error measurement for each series, and also by comparing your results to a naive forecast . It might be a good idea to ask why you're looking for a single model to describe all of the series. Unless they're generated by the same process, this doesn't seem like a good idea.
