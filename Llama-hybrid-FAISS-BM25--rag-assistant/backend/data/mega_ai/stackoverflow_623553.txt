The reason you're running into a problem is that the particular method you're looking for is generic. One of the types of the method is based off of the generic parameter of the method. This presents you with a bit of a catch 22. The generic parameter is tied to the method so you cannot properly construct the type array for the method until you have the method itself. One solution for this specific scenario is the just grab the first generic method. var method = typeof(Transformer).GetMethods().Where(x => x.IsGenericMethod).First();
