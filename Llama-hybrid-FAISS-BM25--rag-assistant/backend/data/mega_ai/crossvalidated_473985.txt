Question like this may be too broad to answer. Many people see machine learning is doing supervised learning (regression or classification.) and non-supervised learning (clustering). The data can be structured data (in table format, rows and columns) or unstructured data (text data, image data, etc). So, if we are doing classification on text data (such as sentiment analysis), it is a NLP and machine learning problem. Similarly, doing document clustering would also be a machine learning problem. To get started with NLP with machine learning or statistics background, you may read some tutorials to convert unstructured data into structured data , for example, using bag of words, or tfidf.
