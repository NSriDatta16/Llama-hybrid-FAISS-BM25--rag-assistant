Apache commons httpclient - disable debugging / lower debuglevel

i am using the apache commons httpclient in a lotus notes java agent and it works fine. BUT when establishing a proxy connection the log will be spamed with the following line : [INFO] AuthChallengeProcessor - basic authentication scheme selected Do you know how to disable the integrated loging or how to set a lower debug level ? Its a "feature" from the httpclient itself, so code from my side is not needed :-) Thanks.
