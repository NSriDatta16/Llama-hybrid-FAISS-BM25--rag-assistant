I realize you are focused on Ant as a build tool. However, I would encourage you to consider Maven. Some of the issues you describe are why Maven exists. The idea of unit testing before creating a JAR file, the idea of building in version numbers, the idea of branching and tagging a version within your source code repository (SVN even) are all built right into Maven. The downside is that it is yet another tool to learn, and the learning curve can be steep.
