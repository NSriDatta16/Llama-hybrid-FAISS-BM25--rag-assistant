How to tell how extreme an outlier is?

I am analyzing some data and want to look at one particular point and see how "extreme" it is. Do I exclude this outlier from the data, calculate the dataset's standard deviation and average, then compare my outlier to THAT, or do I calculate the standard deviation and average WITH the outlier included and THEN analyze my outlier with respect to those metrics?
