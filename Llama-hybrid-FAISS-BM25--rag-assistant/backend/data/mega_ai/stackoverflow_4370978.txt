The easiest and quickest solution is to use the Visual Basic PowerPack's PrintForm control (You can use it in C# projects as well). http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/bb735936.aspx Just drag the control on to your form then from code call printForm1.Print(); This will print whatever is on the form, so just design your report on a form then call that code, and you're done.
