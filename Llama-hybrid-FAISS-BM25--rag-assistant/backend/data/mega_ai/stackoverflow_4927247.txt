It makes no sense to average over what you're already grouping by. Just to give a trivial example, imagine grouping people by age, and then finding the average age within each group... they're all the same age! My guess is you just need to take out the minutes parts of the grouping: var eventInfo = from eventData in dt.AsEnumerable() group eventData by new { TechnologyType = eventData.Field ("TechnologyType"), TechnologySubType = eventData.Field ("TechnologySubType") } into g select new { Phase1Avg = g.Average(x => x.Field ("Phase1Minutes")), Phase2Avg = g.Average(x => x.Field ("Phase2Minutes")), g.Key.TechnologyType, g.Key.TechnologySubType };
