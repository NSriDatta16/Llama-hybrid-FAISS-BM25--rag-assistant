Each solution has its pros and cons. Storing files in the DB is great for small files. Just remember to keep the files themselves and any metadata about those files in two different tables. This will prevent your queries from being slowed down by the binary data. Also keep in mind that, overtime, this can lead to very large DB tables. File system storage is great, but keep in mind that you're going to have to keep file permissions / security in mind moreso than you would if you stored them in the DB. I hope this steers you in the right direction. Post a comment if you have questions.
