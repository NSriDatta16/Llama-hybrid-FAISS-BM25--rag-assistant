Looking at the problem from an algorithmic stand-point, let's consider the limitations that you've put on the problem. All numbers will be from 1-31. The list is a collection of "ranges", each of which is defined by two numbers (start and end). There is no rule for whether start will be more, less than, or equal to end. Since we have an arbitrarily large list of ranges but a definite means of sorting/organizing these, a divide and conquer strategy may yield the best complexity. At first I typed out a very long and careful explanation of how I created each step in this algorithm (the dividing portion, the conquering potion, optimizations, etc.) however the explanation got extremely long. To shorten it, here's the final answer: This should (theoretically) work on arrays of arbitrary length for any positive integers. Negative integers would get tripped up since - is our delimiter for the range.
