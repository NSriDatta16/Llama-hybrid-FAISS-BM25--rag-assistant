Synchronous NSURLConnection Threading on iPhone

I started out using asynchronism but to get the returned data became a hassle. I then began using class methods which, I believe, ruled out the possibility of using the delegate methods. So I kept with the synchronous, knowing that this would be an issue but didn't think I would have this much difficulty with a solution. What is the best way to retrieve data whilst keeping the UI interact-able?
