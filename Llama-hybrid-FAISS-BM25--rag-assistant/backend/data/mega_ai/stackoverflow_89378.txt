Something's very broken there. Perl's scoping is relatively simple, and you're unlikely to stumble upon anything odd like that unless you're doing something daft. As has been suggested, switch on the strict pragma (and warnings, too. In fact you should be using both anyway). It's pretty hard to tell what's going on without being able to see how %in is defined (is it something to do with that nasty-looking ReadParse call? why are you calling it with the leading &, btw? that syntax has been considered dead and gone for a long time). I suggest posting a bit more code, so we can see what's going on..
