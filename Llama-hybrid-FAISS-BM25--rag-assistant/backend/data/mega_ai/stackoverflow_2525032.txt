Try Process Explorer from Sysinternals. Very useful. This article explains what you are seeing. Basically Task Manager averages the cores together, and Performance Monitor sums up the the Process 's time on each core. So, % Processor Time on a system with 4 cores could go up to 400. N * 100 = MaxValue; Where N is the number of cores/processors in the system.
