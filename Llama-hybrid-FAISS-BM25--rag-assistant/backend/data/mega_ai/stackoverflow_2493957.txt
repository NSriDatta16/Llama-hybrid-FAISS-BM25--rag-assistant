Oh, that was easy.. Came across the answer with a little more research: var textRange = new TextRange(TextBox.Selection.Start, TextBox.Selection.End); textRange.ApplyPropertyValue(TextElement.FontFamilyProperty, "Consolas"); textRange.ApplyPropertyValue(TextElement.FontSizeProperty, 10D ); textRange.ApplyPropertyValue(Paragraph.MarginProperty, new Thickness(0)); textRange.ApplyPropertyValue(Paragraph.BackgroundProperty, "LightSteelBlue"); The only limitation is that the highlighting still extends only as far as the text, rather than to the right side of the control. I'll leave this question open for a couple of days; if someone can tell me how to extend the background to the right edge of the control, I'll accept your answer to this question.
