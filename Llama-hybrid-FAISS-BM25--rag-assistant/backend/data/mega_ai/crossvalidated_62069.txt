Anomaly Detection with Dummy Features (and other Discrete/Categorical Features)

tl;dr What is the recommended way to deal with discrete data when performing anomaly detection? What is the recommended way to deal with categorical data when performing anomaly detection? This answer suggests using discrete data to just filter the results. Perhaps replace the category value with the perctage chance of observation? Intro This is my first time posting on here, so please, if anything doesn't seem technically correct, either in the formatting, or the use of correct definitions, I'm interested to know what should've been used instead. Onwards. I've recently been taking part of the Machine Learning class by Andrew Ng For anomaly detection we've been taught to determine what the Normal/Gaussian distribution parameters are for a given feature/variable, ${x_i}$ within a data set, and then determine the probability of a chosen set of training example's/observation's value given that particular Gaussian distribution, and then taking the product of the probabilities of the features. Method Choose $x_i$ features/variables that we think explain the activity in question: $$\{x_1, x_2,\dots,x_i\}$$ Fit the parameters of the Gaussian for each feature: $$\mu_j = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^m x_j^{(i)}$$ $$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^m (x_j^{(i)} - \mu_j)^2$$ For each training example, $x$, compute: $$p(x) = \prod_{j = 1}^n \ p(x_j; \mu_j, \sigma_j^2)$$ We then flag as an anomaly ($y = 1$), given: $$y = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 1 & \quad p(x) This gives us the method with which to determine if an example requires further inspection. My Question(s) This seems fine for continuous variables/features, but discrete data is not addressed. What about dummy variables, e.g. a gender flag feature, possibly called [IsMale] that can be of the value $0, 1$? To take a dummy feature into account would we use the binomial distribution instead to calculate $p(x)$? What about categorical data such as car colour? While we could map colours to numerical values, e.g. $red \to 1, blue \to 2$, the distribution of such a categorical feature could be close to uniform (i.e. equally likely chance to be any of the colours), and further, as any numerical mapping that occurs (i.e. $red$ having the value $1$, etc) is not ordinal, does it make sense to try and transform any non-normal distribution of frequencies for colours to be normally distributed (does it even matter that it is not ordinal??)? For example, to me, it wouldn't make sense to do a $log()$ transform as the data is neither continuous nor ordinal. So perhaps it would be best to find a discrete distribution that fits the feature, as opposed to "torturing" the data to fit the Gaussian? Questions: (updated: 2015-11-24) Can binary variables be modeled with a binomial probability distribution and become another factor in the $p(x)$ calculation? Should categorical variables should be modeled with a discrete probability distribution instead of a Gaussian, and become another factor in the $p(x)$ calculation? Is there another method altogether that takes into account what I'm asking here that I can further research/learn about? What is the recommended way to deal with discrete data when performing anomaly detection? What is the recommended way to deal with categorical data when performing anomaly detection? Edit: 2017-05-03 This answer suggests using discrete data to just filter the results. Perhaps replace the category value with the perctage chance of observation?
