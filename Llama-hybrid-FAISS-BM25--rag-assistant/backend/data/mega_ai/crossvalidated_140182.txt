I think you are on the right track and I guess that in principle the changepoint package should be usable. You can simply order your response variable (e.g., a species abundance) by the gradient of interest (e.g., water temperature) and then apply the functions to the as if they were a time series. You may need to map the changepoint indexes back to the gradient scale by hand but this should not be difficult. Alternative packages of interest might include the strucchange package with the breakpoints() function. It also requires ordering the observations beforehand. It can give you confidence intervals for the changepoints, though. Furthermore, there is the maxstat_test() function in the coin package that uses a nonparametric approach. It has the advantage that both response and gradient can be supplied, e.g., maxstat_test(abundance ~ temperature, ...) . Finally, it may be of interest to find such thresholds not only with respect to a single variable but with respect to several factors. Then recursive partitioning (say via rpart() or ctree() from the partykit package) may be of interest. A worked example for tree pipit abundance is in Section 6.1 of vignette("ctree", package = "partykit") .
