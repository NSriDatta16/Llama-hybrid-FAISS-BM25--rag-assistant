Silverlight applications may not change arbitrary files on the user's computer. However, they are able to store files locally using Isolated Storage : In the .NET Framework, isolated storage is a storage mechanism that enables partially trusted applications to save data on the local machine without violating any security policies set on the computer. Isolated storage is around since the first version of the .NET Framework and is especially useful for downloaded, partially trusted components that are not usually given access to the standard I/O mechanisms. These same applications, though, are usually granted the right to use isolated storage. In this way, applications coming from potentially untrusted sources can still do some disk I/O, albeit in a controlled way. You can read more about that in the following article: Silverlight and Local Storage
