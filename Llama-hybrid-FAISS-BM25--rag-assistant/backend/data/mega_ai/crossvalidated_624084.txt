Test for existence of a linear trend in a time series

I want to know whether there is a time linear trend in a time series. What are some good approaches? One approach seems to test that the model belongs to ARMA(p,q) family however I am not sure if a test exists for this purpose. If necessary I am willing to specify p and q and I am open to other approaches.
