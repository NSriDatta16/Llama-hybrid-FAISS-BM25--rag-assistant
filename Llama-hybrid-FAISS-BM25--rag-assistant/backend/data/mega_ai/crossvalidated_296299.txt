It passes on the result of the sigmoid function and does not binarize the output. The reason for this is that the neural network must (usually) be differentiable for the backpropagation training algorithm to work. The binarization function (rounding) is not differentiable. And a small note about depth. When talking about neural networks, the term depth does not include the input layer. It's just the number of hidden layers + the output layer.
