WPF assembly reference missing - project still building

I am trying to use the Dynamic Data Display library for WPF in my solution. I added a reference to DynamicDataDisplay.dll in my project. I also added a namespace in the .xaml like this: xmlns:d3="http://research.microsoft.com/DynamicDataDisplay/1.0" Intellisense is not helping me when I try to add a element from the Dynamic Data Display library. When I type something like this in my .xaml: Visual studio will mark it as an error with some text like: The type 'd3:ChartPlotter' was not found. Verify that you are not missing an assembly reference and that all referenced assemblies have been built. But the odd thing about it is that it still compiles. Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong? Here is a sample code which compiles fine but is showing an error in the designer: Edit: I tried the namespace declaration like Merlyn Morgan-Graham suggested but it still does not work. Another error occurred: Unable to load the metadata for assembly 'DynamicDataDisplay'. This assembly may have been downloaded from the web. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179545. The following error was encountered during load: etc. It seems like that assemblies that were downloaded need to be manually unblocked. This can be done in the Windows file properties. After unblocking and a restart of Visual Studio the problem was solved. (source: www.xup.in )
