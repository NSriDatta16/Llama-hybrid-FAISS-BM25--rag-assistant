In visual studio you got a Data menu option that can open a Data Sources view. Add a data connection and use the wizard to 'target' the database. After creating a local 'representation' of a table, drag that table from the datasource tab to you windows form application. Look at all the automatically created objects and try to create a list of objects and how they interact. Can you spot the connectionstring or the table definition?
