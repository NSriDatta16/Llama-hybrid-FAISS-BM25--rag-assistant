I believe you are using uniform priors in an attempt to be non-informative, but I believe your priors are more informative than you would like them to be. Do you really believe $\sigma$ or ($\theta$) is equally likely to be between (0,1) as (999,1000)? And that there is absolutely no probability whatsoever that these parameters are above 1000? Also, there is no requirement to have proper priors for MCMC. My suggestion is $\sigma \sim Ca^+(0,c_\sigma)$ (i.e. a folded-Cauchy or half-Cauchy), $\theta \sim Ca^+(0,c_\theta)$, an improper uniform for $\mu$ and all independent. You will need to choose $c_\sigma$ and $c_\theta$ for your problem, but since you are already "confident" the parameter values fall into the regions given, you can just choose these values so the probability outside those regions is small. I prefer heavy-tailed distributions like the half-Cauchy because the data can more easily overwhelm the prior in case you were wrong in your prior assumptions. If you really want the prior to be proper, you could use a Cauchy for $\mu$ and specify a location and scale parameter.
