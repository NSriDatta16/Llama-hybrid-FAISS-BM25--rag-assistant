Usually coverage utilities (such as gcov ) are supplied with compiler. However please note that they will usually give you only C0 coverage. I.e. C0 - every line is executed at least once. Please note that a ? b : c is marked as executed even if only one branch have been used. C1 - every branch is executed at least once. C2 - every path is executed at least once So even if your tests shows 100% C0 coverage you may not catch every path in code - and probably you don't have time to do it (number of paths grows exponentially with respect to branches). However it is good to know if you have 10% C2 or 70% C2 (or 0.1% C2).
