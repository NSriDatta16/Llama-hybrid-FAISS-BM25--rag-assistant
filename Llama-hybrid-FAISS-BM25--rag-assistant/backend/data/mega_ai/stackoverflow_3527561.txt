I suggest using guids for your fid field. This way you can be sure that you won't have duplicate fids, and is more elegant than either (i) maintaining a 'highest fid' somewhere and querying it every time you do an insert operation, or (ii) putting code in that checks all your fids in all your tables every time you do an insert operation.
