How to quantify the performance of the classifier (multi-class SVM) using the test data?

I am working on a traffic sign recognition code in MATLAB using Belgian Traffic Sign Dataset. The dataset consists of training data and test data. I resized the given images and extracted HOG features using the VL_HOG function from VL_feat library and then trained a multi class SVM using all of the signs inside the training dataset. I am particularly interested detecting 8 signs. Question 1: Am I suppose to train the model using only the training set of these 8 signs or train the model with the entire training dataset and ignore the signs that I am not interested in at the detection stage? Upon training the multi-class SVM, I want to test the classifier performance using the test data. Question 2: Can someone guide me through how to do this? I found something similar to what I am looking for available here . It would be great if I can obtain quantitative data such as a confusion matrix in percentage form. Thanks!
