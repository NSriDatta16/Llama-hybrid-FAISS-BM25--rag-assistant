As answered by Eoin, you are asking about PCA but in your analyses, it seems you are performing an exploratory (?) Factor Analysis (FA); for this reason, I added the factor-analyisis tag. Although there is a great deal of overlap between PCA and FA, they are not exactly the same . Now, there is no reason for the loadings of a given variable to be a priori non-zero for only one latent dimension. Indeed, loadings of a variable can be zero everywhere or nonzero everywhere. After all, FA is nothing more than a model in which you assume the target covariance matrix $\Sigma$ can be factored $$ \Sigma = L L^\top + \Psi, $$ where $L$ is the loadings matrix and $\Psi$ is the diagonal matrix of specific variances. $L,\Psi$ are unknown parameters that you can estimate through maximum likelihood, PCA. etc. If you use maximum likelihood, some identifiability constraints have to be placed. But, the point is that, unless you place suitable constraints on $L$ , its estimate $\hat L$ will be a dense matrix. Factor rotation methods, such as varimax or promax , are sometimes (but not always) helpful in this respect, since they tend to shrink low-valued loadings towards zero (i.e. the "holes" in the rotated loading matrix represent zeros) delivering thus more easily-interpretable results.
