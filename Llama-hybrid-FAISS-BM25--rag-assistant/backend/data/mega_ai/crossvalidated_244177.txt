There are many possible ways to address this question from a methodological POV. With two years of weekly, store-level information, you are not limited in terms of the options. Some guys with UCLA's Marketing Science department have been pathfinders in terms of functional forms and models. In particular, the several editions of Dominique Hanssens' (Chair of the department and past President of the MSI) book Market Response Models: Econometric and Time Series Analysis is widely considered the go-to bible for questions like this. Among the suggestions Hanssens' makes are VAR (vector autoregression models) as well as the various flavors of ARIMA. VAR is particularly attractive, though rigorous to implement, as noted in the Wiki discussion of it, "The only prior knowledge required is a list of variables which can be hypothesized to affect each other intertemporally." That said, Lee Cooper's (Emeritus at UCLA) book Market Share Analysis (available for free download here ... http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/lee.cooper/MCI_Book/BOOKI2010.pdf ) advocates a somewhat different and even more flexible approach integrating panel data models, kind of like a dummy variable model which captures features related to the cross-sections (brands, stores, etc.) and time periods. Cooper relies heavily on analyses of the elasticities and cross-elasticities, deriving several functional forms depending on the type of underlying relationship one assumes between sales and the marketing instruments. Forget about the fact that it's focused on market share since it's simply an excellent introduction to marketing mix models. The list of model options is endless, really. These are just a few of the broad avenues one can pursue.
