Many help page might refer to that tab, but the Eclipse Helios page doesn't. As far as I can see, this is no longer available with Eclipse 3.6. You can add your source when exporting your plugin , but that is not exactly the same. The " Generating Source Features and Plug-ins " is still there though. It was the alternative mentioned by the old Ganymede Help page Declared Source Locations An alternative way to ship source code locations is to use declared (pre-defined) source locations. This is done by using the org.eclipse.pde.core.source extension. A plug-in defining this extension will be treated as a source location. The extension point schemas and source archive(s) for a plug-in are located in a unique subdirectory under one of these source code locations. The name and structure of the subdirectories must follow a specific convention.
