Is there a version of Latent Class Analysis with unspecified # of clusters

I understand that you can use the elbow method to plot LCA solutions vs log likelihood to figure out, at which k , it is no longer worth it to add more clusters. And I will resort to this if need be. But I think it would be much more disciplined to infer the k from some Bayesian inference or maximum likelihood method. I know that there are latent class clustering methods with unspecified k , such as the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (unspecified- k version of Latent Dirichlet Allocation). However, LCA is much closer to what I need than LDA or HDP. Is there a technique that assumes no k and uses a similar model process to LCA to output the same parameters (mixture components, item probability matrix)? Or do I have to resort to methods that force me to run LCA multiple times for different k and compare?
