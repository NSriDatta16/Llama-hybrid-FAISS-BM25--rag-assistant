I think you should probably check out the UIImage documentation: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIImage_Class/Reference/Reference.html In particular, this method: - (UIImage *)stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:(NSInteger)leftCapWidth topCapHeight:(NSInteger)topCapHeight iOS doesn't have a '9-patch' image, in the sense that a 9-patch defines the stretchable sections within the image itself. Instead, you define the stretchable parts of the image in code (leftCapWidth and topCapHeight respectively). I'm not quite sure how that helps you with your game, but since your question was 'is there something similar to 9-patch' on iOS, I hope this answer suffices!
