Deep Learning model for classifying skin diseases

I have planned to create a deep learning model that classifies skin diseases(around 5 to 7 diseases). Please suggest me a good deep learning model to go with. I am planning to integrate this model as a mobile application. It goes like this. The user uploads a skin disease image and the machine is going to classify it accordingly. I need a good degree of accuracy.
