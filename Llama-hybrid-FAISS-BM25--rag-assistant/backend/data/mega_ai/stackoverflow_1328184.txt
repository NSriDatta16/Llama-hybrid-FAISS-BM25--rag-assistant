You should TDD using baby steps. Try thinking of tests that will require less code to be written. Then write the code. Then write another test, and so on. Try to break your problem into smaller problems (you probably used some other methods to have your code completed). You could TDD these smaller methods. --EDIT - based on the comments Testing private methods is not necessarily a bad stuff. They sometimes really contain implementation details, but sometimes they might also act like an interface (in this case, you could follow my suggestion next paragraph). One other option is to create other classes (implemented with interfaces that are injected) to take some of the responsibilities (maybe some of those smaller methods), and test them separately, and mock them when testing your main class. Finally, I don't see spending more time coding as a really big problem. Some problems are really more complex to implement than to test, and require much thinking time.
