If the page you want to grab is foreign or even if it is local but that you don't know its structure in advance, I'd say the best to achieve this would be by using the php DOM functions . function get_first_paragraph($url) { $page = file_get_contents($url); $doc = new DOMDocument(); $doc->loadHTML($page); /* Gets all the paragraphs */ $p = $doc->getElementsByTagName('p'); /* extracts the first one */ $p = $p->items(0); /* returns the paragraph's content */ return $p->textContent; }
