It's common practice in organizations I've worked with to also include binary resources to which we don't have the source code and are required for the build in the source control. I'm aware that this is a somewhat controversial practice but it's worked wonders for us. Usually we keep them in a solution-rooted folder named 'Resources' or the like such that they're available for each developer to use when they check out the solution.
