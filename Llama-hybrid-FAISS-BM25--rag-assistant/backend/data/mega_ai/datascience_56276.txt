Significance of AUC score

My model (Logistic Regression) has AUC score of 0.8 Am I right in stating that the probability of the model ranking a random positive sample higher than a random negative sample is 0.8? Also, how does this interpretation change if I pick more than 2 random samples (let's say 5) ? Can I say that the probability of the model to predict highest probability for the best sample (positive) out of 5 is 0.8? Or will this become 0.8*0.8*0.8*0.8 = 0.4096?
