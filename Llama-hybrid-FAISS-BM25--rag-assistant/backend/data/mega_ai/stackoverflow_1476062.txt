It's a bit of a pragmatic choice really, but the clue is in the name - they aren't called 'helpers' for nothing. If you're doing simple markup, then go ahead and use raw HTML. If you're doing stuff that caould possibly change, due to restructuring of routing rules for example, then use the helper and it will take care of responding to those changes. A good example of this is the 'BeginForm' helper. Like most things in life, use common sense.
