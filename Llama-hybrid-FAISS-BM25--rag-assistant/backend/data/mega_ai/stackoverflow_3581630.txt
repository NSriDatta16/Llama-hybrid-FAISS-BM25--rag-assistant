Null pointer is a special reserved value of a pointer. A pointer of any type has such a reserved value. Formally, each specific pointer type ( int * , char * etc.) has its own dedicated null-pointer value. Conceptually, when a pointer has that null value it is not pointing anywhere. Void pointer is a specific pointer type - void * - a pointer that points to some data location in storage, which doesn't have any specific type. So, once again, null pointer is a value , while void pointer is a type . These concepts are totally different and non-comparable. That essentially means that your question, as stated, is not exactly valid. It is like asking, for example, "What is the difference between a triangle and a car?".
