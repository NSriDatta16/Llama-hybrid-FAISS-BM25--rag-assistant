This will work: $total_time_worked = 0; foreach( $db_records as $time_entry ) { $start = strtotime($time_entry['date_start']); $end = strtotime($time_entry['date_end']); // Time worked (in seconds) $worked = $end-$start; // Increment the total $total_time_worked += $worked; } // Get the average time worked (in seconds) $average = $total_time_worked/count($db_records);
