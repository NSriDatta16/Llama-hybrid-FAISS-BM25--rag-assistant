It is a very quick and broad tutorial based overview of using R for many business analytics topics, with one chapter dedicated to data mining (using the R Rattle GUI). Don't expect a lot of formal math though. * recent review ** It's often useful to learn a lot of the practical aspects of data mining and machine learning by learning alongside specific programming language examples. If you have a particular programming language you prefer, I could try to recommend alternatives. ***One other broad, but gentle, introduction to these areas (less practical examples, and not business based, but more mathematically inclined) is: Introduction to Machine Learning , Ethem Alpaydin. edit: In response to your comment. If Python is your language of choice, look no further. Machine Learning , by Stephen Marsland is hands down the best practical book to pick up many of your requested topics, with many good code based illustrations to actually build and follow along. On the Pandas side, you might have some interest in a current Coursera course (just 2 weeks in) that is Python oriented, with Python based applications towards Portfolio analysis, financial markets, and simulation backtesting (although it's a bit introductory, the instructor participates in a AI based Hedge Fund consulting firm).
