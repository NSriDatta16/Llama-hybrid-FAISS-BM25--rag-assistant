Another possibility would be to use a Poisson distribution . The estimated average number of lightning strikes in a section is $\hat \lambda = 213/300 = 0.71$ per year. Assuming that lightning strikes occur at random over the area (with 300 sections), we could model the number of strikes in a section as $X \sim \mathsf{Pois}(\lambda = 0.71).$ Then the probability of at least one strike in any one given section during a year is $P(X \ge 1) = 1 - P(X =0) = 1 - e^{-\lambda} = 0.5084.$ 1 - dpois(0, 0.71) [1] 0.5083558 1- exp(-0.71) [1] 0.5083558 This is not a lot different from the probability obtained in the answer $0.5089$ of @dariober (+1). For relatively large $n$ and relatively small $p$ the binomial distribution $\mathsf{Binom}(n,p)$ is approximately the same as $\mathsf{Pois}(\lambda = np).$ 1 - dpois(0, 213/300) [1] 0.5083558 1 - dbinom(0, 213, 1/300) [1] 0.5089385 I chose to use the Poisson distribution because it seems a more natural choice and it is computationally a little simpler. Sometimes you can use a normal distribution to approximate Poisson and binomial probabilities, but the normal approximation doesn't work very well in this problem.
