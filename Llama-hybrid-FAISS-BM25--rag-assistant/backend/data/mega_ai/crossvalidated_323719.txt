Confused because of statement saying a prob dist with lower entropy is a briefer and therefore simpler explanation

The discussion is how to justify picking a simpler model. Mackay here is saying that from an IT perspective it makes sense to pick a simpler model. From http://andrewgelman.com/2011/12/04/david-mackay-and-occams-razor/ When you think about it from an information theory / data compression point of view, the Occam story becomes very compelling. P l = log 1/P … Replace “Simpler explanation” by “Briefer explanation”, and it becomes effectively a tautology. “Of course the briefest explanation is the most probable explanation! Because brevity is just log P.” You might enjoy reading about the “bits back” coding method of Geoff Hinton, which accurately embodies this data-compression / Bayesian phenomenon for quite complicated models including latent variables. But a simpler model is the model that is smoother. So the simpler model will actually have a higher entropy! edit: I think what is being said is that simpler explanations have higher probability. Because of -log P. But a model (explanation) always involves a probability distribution, I don't find the statement (my first sentence) has any relevance.
