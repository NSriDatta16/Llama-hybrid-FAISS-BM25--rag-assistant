Apparently the exploit-db.com site doesn't allow extending the page size. You therefore need to "manually" page through the result list by repeating the urllib.urlopen() to get subsequent pages. The URL is the same as the one initially used, plus the &page=n parameter. Attention this n value appears to be 0-based (i.e. &page=1 will give the second page)
