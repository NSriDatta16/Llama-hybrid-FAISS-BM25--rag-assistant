Download Android code for Contacts application

I am trying to download Android source code for Contact,Dialer and CallLog applications from the git repository. I have tried the following on my mac(running SnowLeopard): 1. Create a bin dir and a android dir for putting all the downloaded files 2. Added both of the directories to the PATH environment variable 3. run the following commands to get the repo script and make it executable: $ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo 4. cd android dir 5. run repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b froyo When I run this command, I am getting the following errors: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/Users/xxxx/bin/repo", line 595, in main(sys.argv[1:]) File "/Users/xxxx/bin/repo", line 562, in main _Init(args) File "/Users/xxxx/bin/repo", line 181, in _Init _CheckGitVersion() File "/Users/xxxx/bin/repo", line 210, in _CheckGitVersion proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE) File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/subprocess.py", line 593, in __init__ errread, errwrite) File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/subprocess.py", line 1079, in _execute_child raise child_exception OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory A quick google search tells that I need to install git-core library. Unfortunately, I don't know if that is the real problem or not and if so, how to install it.
