Update From running a KDiff on the sources you gave, it looks like there's 1 major line difference: And that looks like it has an ID generated from a session (a cookie) so there's not much you can do about that without copying the IE cookie header. Previous answer "Under the hood", IE and HttpWebRequest both perform the same simple task, which is to send the following text request on port 80 via a a socket to the HTTP server: GET / HTTP/1.1 (or 1.0 - and a host header too). If you're on Windows you can try it out. Install the built in Windows telnet client (add/remove programs->windows features), or putty and then type: GET / HTTP/1.1 (newline) Host: yahoo.com The source from this, IE, and the HttpWebRequest class will be exactly the same. The only difference will come if IE is passing cookies to the server, and any extra header which normally include: A user agent Accept */* Gzip A cookies or session variable (which includes session variables - cookies that expire when IE is closed) For formatting, IE might turn tabs into spaces, or the other way around. The HttpWebRequest will return the raw results without any formatting.
