Notice that you are using a "varying" parameter. This needs to be defined for both the vertex and the fragment shader. Since you appear to have only changed the vertex shader I'm guessing that this is causing your link problem as the colorVarying is probably still in the fragment shader. Try putting the logic of "colorVarying" back into your vertex shader. Something like: uniform mat4 gl_ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 gl_ModelViewMatrix; attribute vec4 gl_Vertex; attribute vec4 color; varying vec4 colorVarying; void main() { gl_Position = gl_ProjectionMatrix * gl_ModelViewMatrix * gl_Vertex; colorVarying = color; }
