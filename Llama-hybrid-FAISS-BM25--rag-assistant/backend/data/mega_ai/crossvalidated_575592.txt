Difference K-fold versus Blocked Cross-Validation?

In the paper "Evaluating time series forecasting models: an empirical study on performance estimation methods" by Cerqueira et al (2020), they mention k-fold cross-validation. Which they differentiate from blocked cross-validation in subsection 2.3.1. I thought I understood the difference but if I then check sklearn's KFold, I am not sure anymore if this is the k-fold cross validation or the blocked cross-validation. Is the k-Fold from sklearn equivalent to the blocked cross validation mentioned in the paper? And which method of sklearn is equivalent then to the k-fold mentioned in the paper? Is it Shuffle & Split?
