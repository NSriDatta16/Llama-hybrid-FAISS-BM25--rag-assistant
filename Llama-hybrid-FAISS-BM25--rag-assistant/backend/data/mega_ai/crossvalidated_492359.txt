In logistic regression, is there an official term for the value you get when you multiply feature values with coefficients?

I am currently calling it the effect, so I can report on the impact of the feature values for each observation. But is there an official term for it? That is, to understand why someone is getting a prediction, I multiply feature values by the relevant coefficient and rankorder them based on the absolute value, and then list the top features in terms of absolute effect (along with the actual effect).
