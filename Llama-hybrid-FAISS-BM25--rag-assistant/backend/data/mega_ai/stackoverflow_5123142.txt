Drag and drop question in flex datagrid

I am performing a drag and drop between 2 datagrids where one item could replace/merge with another item based on some processing. for this, I need to know about certain events: Which event will give me information about the cell in which I am going to drop a item. How could I cancel the dragged operation if I know that the my drag was invalid for a particular condition. Thanks guys...
