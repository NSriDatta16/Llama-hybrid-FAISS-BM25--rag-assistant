Priors and nested random effects in MCMCglmm?

I am trying to construct a zero inflation Poisson GLMM using MCMCglmm(). I am new to Bayesian Statistics and this function and I am struggling to understand a couple of things. For my data I am looking at the species richness of high risk species counted around sensitive sites, I have calculated some variables to explain this distribution and I have a nested random effect structure; with the Date of the count nested within the Location of the site (in glmer terms; (Day.of.the.Year|Location) ). I have struggled to find methods to construct nested random effects in MCMCglmm syntax (maybe I am looking in the wrong places!) but I found one method that said I needed to create a new column with both in; HRnaomit $DaynestLoc Day.of.the.Year,HRnaomit$Location) Am I doing this correctly? As I said I am new to this, so if I am doing it correctly, I'd love to understand a bit more as to why I am doing it correctly. The model below is just for looking at random effects, this is where my error code comes into play; NESTHRRM1 prior Error in priorformat(if (NOpriorG) { : V is the wrong dimension for some prior $G/prior$ R elements So the prior I have here is likely wrong beyond the V being in the wrong dimension as I do not fully understand how to define the V value; I understand G is for the random effects, is the V value the value of all the levels within random effects? I am right in saying the higher the value of nu the more informative the prior? How do you decide how informative a prior should be? If anyone has any walkthroughs on constructing priors they could point me towards I would also be grateful!
