Is there a Django application similar to Drupal's Organic Groups module?

Basically I am looking for the following: Groups can be created by users of the site. Users can apply to join a group. Every group has a group administrator which can approve or reject applications to join a group. Also, they can remove members from a group. Content can be created which is associated with the group. Only group members can create content. Users who are not group members can view this content but not create/modify the content. Are there any Django applications which can help implement these requirements?
