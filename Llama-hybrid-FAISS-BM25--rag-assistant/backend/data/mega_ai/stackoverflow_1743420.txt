The WPF Toolkit chart control doesn't have any code to handle mouse dragging, so you'll have to write it yourself. You should be able to subclass LineDataPoint to add dragging functionality, then subclass LineSeries and override CreateDataPoint() to create your custom LineDataPoint items. In this case, your ItemsSource would not be an IEnumerable of values (eg IEnumerable ), but rather of value holder objects (eg IEnumerable ). The value holder objects would have a property that can be used to retrieve or set the value at that point, Allowing the value to be updated by setting DependentValueBinding to a TwoWay binding to your property. You may be able to reuse existing objects in your application rather than creating a value holder object specifically for this purpose.
