Javascript check for Max/Min/Average number from a record set

function lab09unknownLoopCountPart2() { //Constants var ONE_HUNDRED = 100; var ZERO = 0; //Variables var employeeHourlyWage; var hourlyMaximum = ZERO; var hourlyMinimum = ZERO; var totalHourlyWage = ZERO; var records; var counter = ZERO; var average; records = openEmployeePayrollRecords(); while (records.readNextRecord()) { employeeHourlyWage = records.getEmployeeHourlyWage(); totalHourlyWage += employeeHourlyWage; counter++; average = totalHourlyWage / counter; if (employeeHourlyWage "); document.write("Maximum Hourly Wage: " + hourlyMaximum + " "); document.write("Minimum Hourly Wage: " + hourlyMinimum + " "); } The record set is simply numbers from 15 - 30. I have to sort through them and find the Maximum, Minimum and Average. I know that my two IF statements are incorrect and I'm wondering how to check this, without using Math.min and Math.max. Thanks.
