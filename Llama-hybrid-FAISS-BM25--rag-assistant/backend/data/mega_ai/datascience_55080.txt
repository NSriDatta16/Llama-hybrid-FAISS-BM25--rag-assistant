Ideally PCA should not be used as a part of pre-processing feature reduction. Anyhow regarding saving and reusing PCA model, sharing a basic code snippet which is working very fine in my case(as I'm not able to reproduce the error case). from sklearn.decomposition import PCA import pickle as pk pca = PCA(n_components=2) result = pca.fit_transform(X) # Assume X is having more than 2 dimensions pk.dump(pca, open("pca.pkl","wb")) . . . # later reload the pickle file pca_reload = pk.load(open("pca.pkl",'rb')) result_new = pca_reload .transform(X) # result and result_new same in my case
