I do not know if there's a widely used measure for this, but I would come up with an ad-hoc solution. One example could be subtracting trend B from trend A. Therefore, this new trend of the difference would be somewhat similar to what you expect: negative when B is larger than A; positive when A is larger than B. You just need to place a normalization factor, which could be the sum of the values of trend A and B at that point. I am assuming (from your examples) that both trends are discrete and positive. Let's call this metric D. See below: $$ D_{i} = \frac{a_{i}-b_{i}}{a_{i}+b_{i}} $$ where the i-th value of this metric ( $D_{i}$ ) is the difference between the i-th value of trend A ( $a_{i}$ ) minus the i-th value of trend B ( $b_{i}$ ), divided by a normalization factor which is the sum of both. This follows what you expect: If both $a,b=0$ or if $a=b$ , the metric value is zero. If $a=0$ , then the value is -1. If $b=0$ , then the value is +1. In any intermediate case, you would lie in a range between -1 and +1. As said, this is quite ad-hoc, and maybe there's some metric from the field of time series (with which I am not familiar at all) and someone else can better help you. But this does exactly what you want to do.
