Are dichotomous predictor variables appropriate in a quantile regression analysis?

I want to model the changes in a dependent variable with non-normal distribution (e.g. abundance of micro-organisms) as a function of changes in dichotomous independent variables (e.g. gender, sick or healthy). Is it appropriate to use dichotomous variables as a predictor in a quantile regression analysis?
