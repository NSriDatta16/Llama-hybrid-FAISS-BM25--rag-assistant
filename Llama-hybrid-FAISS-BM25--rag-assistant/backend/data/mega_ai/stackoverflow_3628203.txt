You can not directly attach a file from the upload field of your form to an email. You can only attach files to your email from your server, so you need to upload the file from the form with CIs upload library: $this->upload->do_upload() to your server into some directory. the upload library needs to be configured, which file types are allowed etc. if the upload was successful, the do_upload function returns extensive data about where the file is stored. you can use the 'full_path' index from the array to attach this file to the email. then send the mail. after that you may delete the file from your server. Here are some code fragments that might help. $this->load->library('upload'); if($_FILES['upload']['size'] > 0) { // upload is the name of the file field in the form $aConfig['upload_path'] = '/someUploadDir/'; $aConfig['allowed_types'] = 'doc|docx|pdf|jpg|png'; $aConfig['max_size'] = '3000'; $aConfig['max_width'] = '1280'; $aConfig['max_height'] = '1024'; $this->upload->initialize($aConfig); if($this->upload->do_upload('upload')) { $ret = $this->upload->data(); } else { ... } $pathToUploadedFile = $ret['full_path']; $this->email->attach($pathToUploadedFile); ... $this->email->send(); ... } ... Hope this helped...
