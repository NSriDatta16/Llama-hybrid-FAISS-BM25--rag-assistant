You're not using session IDs explicitly, but PHP uses them automatically. The session ID is sent as a cookie to the browser, who sends it back to the server with every request to identify itself and resume the session. Without that, sessions are not possible. A way to improve security is to regularly change the ID of a session, using session_regenerate_id() . That way, if a hacker acquires somebody's session ID, he has only a limited amount of time to abuse it. Another way to prevent session hijacking (a hacker using your session ID to steal your session) is to store the client IP and user agent string when the session is opened and verifying that they haven't changed when resuming the session.
