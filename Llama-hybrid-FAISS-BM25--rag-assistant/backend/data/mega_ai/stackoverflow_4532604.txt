complex query in mysql

I'm trying to create a small search engine in php/mysql and to use it in my future projects (websites or other web applications). I'm satisfied with fulltext search but still having some problems with grouping of results . Example : On websites like driverguide.com or kelkoo.co.uk (different type of websites) for each search has a detailed result . For driverguide.com after each search on the left are filters for Company , Device and Operating System with exact count for every category . My question is : How can I organise and search on my multi tables to extract this result. Can anyone describe a small example with 2-3 tables how to do that. Thank You!
