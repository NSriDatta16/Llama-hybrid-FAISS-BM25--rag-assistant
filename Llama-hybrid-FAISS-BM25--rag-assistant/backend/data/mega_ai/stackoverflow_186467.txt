Have you noticed stray hits to your web pages that have no parameters?

We have a web application that passes parameters in the url along the lines of this: www.example.com/ViewCustomer?customer=3945 Reasonably often, we will see attempts to access just: www.example.com/ViewCustomer Or system logs this as invalid and sends back a "An error has occurred, contact support with trace number XXX" type page. Our logs include the session information so it is actually someone logged in with a valid session which means they have successfully signed in with a username and password. It could be they just typed that into the address bar, but it seems to occur too often for that. Another alternative is that we have a bug in our code, but we've investigated and sometimes there is only one spot and it is clearly ok. We've never had a user complain about something not working and resulting in this. Everything is under SSL. Has anyone else experienced this? Do some browsers send these sorts of dodgy requests occasionally? Edit: Our logs show this: user-agent = Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648)
