My polished crystal ball tells me, that you that you have some sort of game, that is organized in "turns" and you want to change something for a given turn ("fixTurn"). You may want to store the turns in a list. That's preferrable over an array, because a list can grow (or shrink) and allows adding more and more "turns". Assuming, you have some class that models a turn and it's named Turn , declare the list like: List turns = new ArrayList (); Then you can add turns to it: turns.add(new Turn()); And now, if you have to change some parameter for a turn, do it like this: private void fixTurn(int number) { Turn memory = turns.get(number); memory.setCount(memory.getCount()+count); }
