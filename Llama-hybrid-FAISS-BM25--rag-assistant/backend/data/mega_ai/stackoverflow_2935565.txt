The simplest way to do this is to keep your oledb source object from server1 with the sql select col1, col2, col3 ... from db.dbo.[table1] . Then next in your data flow place a lookup from server2 with the sql select col5 from db.dbo.[table2] where ... . Set the error conditions on the lookup (button in bottom left of dialog) to redirect row on no match. Set the match conditions (tab at the top of the dialog) to match between col1 and col5 by dragging from col1 on the left to col5 on the right (an arrow should appear between them if you have done this right). When done, place your OleDb destination object and drag the error output from the lookup to the input of this object. Select server2.db.dbo.[table2] as your destination table and map your rows properly.
