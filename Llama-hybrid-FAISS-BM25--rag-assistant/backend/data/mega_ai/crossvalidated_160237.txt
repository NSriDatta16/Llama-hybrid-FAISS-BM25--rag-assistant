Depends on who you ask. I recently heard a talk by Scott Golder at Context Relevant . Their product is essentially a feature and model selection robot. The basic underlying model is logistic regression, but the system basically uses machine learning to figure out the right combination of feature selection, dimension reduction, regularization, etc. for generating accurate predictions. It was a very impressive talk, and the details are all very proprietary. Apparently their clients include major financial companies and the system can handle arbitrarily massive data sets. At least a few people, then, seem to think automated data science is already here, at least for certain applications. And some of those people (Context Relevant's clients) are apparently paying through the nose for access to it.
