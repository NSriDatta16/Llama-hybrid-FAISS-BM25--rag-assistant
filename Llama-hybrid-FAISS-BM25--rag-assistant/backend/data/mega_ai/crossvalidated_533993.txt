The two are trials dependent, so this is the marginal probability averaged across situations when X = 0 and X = 1. On the second draw, there's either: 2 red balls and 5 blue balls (2/7), which has a probability of 3/8 of occurring (this is conditioning on X = 1) 3 red balls and 4 blue balls (3/7), which has a probability of 5/8 of occurring (this is conditioning on X = 0) It is a weighted average of 2/7 and 3/7, with the weights being those probabilities based on the first draw, X: ((2/7) * (3/8) + (3/7) * (5/8)) = 3/8. Simulation verifying this, in R: set.seed(1839) balls That returns 0.375028, or about 3/8: 0 1 0.624972 0.375028 As a bonus, you can also look at the probability of each specific combination: library(tidyverse) res %>% t() %>% as_tibble() %>% set_names(c("draw1", "draw2")) %>% count(draw1, draw2) %>% mutate(pct = n / sum(n) * 100) Which gives us: # A tibble: 4 x 4 draw1 draw2 n pct 1 0 0 178551 35.7 2 0 1 133971 26.8 3 1 0 133935 26.8 4 1 1 53543 10.7 Rows 2 and 4 represent the two situations where the second draw (Y) can be 1. And 26.8% + 10.7% = 37.5%, or 3/8 probability.
