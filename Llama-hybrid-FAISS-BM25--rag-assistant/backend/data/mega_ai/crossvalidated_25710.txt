No, it's not possible. Likelihoods that admit conjugate distributions correspond to data distributions that are members of some exponential family . Having a non-linear function of the parameters in the log-likelihood makes it impossible for the data distribution to belong to an exponential family. If you specify the model(s?) and data in a bit more detail I might be able to give you advice on the use of a good hands-off adaptive MCMC routine. I have one in mind -- differential evolution Monte Carlo -- but I'm reluctant to claim that it'll address your problem without knowing more.
