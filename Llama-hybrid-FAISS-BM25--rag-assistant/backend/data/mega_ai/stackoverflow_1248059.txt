looking for some cool Silverlight chart Demos

I am currently using Reporting Service of SQL Server 2008, and I think the user interface is not very elegant. And I want to use Silverlight as user interface to render reporting service backend data. Two questions, Is it possible? Reporting Service exposes interface which Silverlight could retrieve data and render? I am looking for some cool Demos, better free with source codes, which could dynamically show different kinds of charts, curves on coordinates based on the data retrieved by some data source (e.g. Reporting Service). thanks in advance, George
