File Name in the WHERE clause of Mysql returns nothing

I have the this SELECT query that returns nothing from the specified table yet the path to the file is stored in that table; SELECT * from tableName WHERE imageFile = "C:\Documents and Settings\Albert Bayita\Desktop\MovieImages\TheLordOfTheRingsTheFellowship.jpg"; Any advice is appreciated.
