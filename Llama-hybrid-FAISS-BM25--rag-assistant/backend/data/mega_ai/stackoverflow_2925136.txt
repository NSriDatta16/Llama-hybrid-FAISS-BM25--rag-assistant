Can't create blob container on Azure Blob Storage

The following code throws an error on the "CreateIfNotExist" method call. I am attempting to connect to my Azure Blob storage and create a new container called "images" var storageAccount = new CloudStorageAccount( new StorageCredentialsAccountAndKey("my_account_name", "my shared key"), "https://blob.core.windows.net/", "https://queue.core.windows.net/", "https://table.core.windows.net/" ); var blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient(); var blobContainer = blobClient.GetContainerReference("images"); blobContainer.CreateIfNotExist(); The error is: [StorageClientException: The requested URI does not represent any resource on the server.] The "images" container does not exist but I was expecting it to be created instead of an error to be thrown. What am I doing wrong? I have tried HTTP instead of HTTPS but the result is the same error.
