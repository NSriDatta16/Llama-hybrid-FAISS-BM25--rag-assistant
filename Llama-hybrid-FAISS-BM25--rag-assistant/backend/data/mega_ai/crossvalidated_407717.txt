The beta-binomial is a conjugate model, so there is an exact analytic solution. There is no need for posterior simulation. If the prior is beta distributed and the likelihood is binomial, then the posterior is beta distributed. So, for example, if your prior distribution is $$\frac{p^{\alpha-1}(1-p)^{\beta-1}}{B(\alpha,\beta)}$$ and you had a sample size of $n$ and observed $k$ successes then your posterior density is $$\frac{p^{k+\alpha-1}(1-p)^{n-k+\beta-1}}{B(\alpha+k,n-k+\beta)}.$$ If your model were not conjugate, then you should sample until your parameters are burned in and until you have reached convergence. I have had that happen in 5,000 iterations and I have had that happen in 2,000,000 iterations. You are done when you are done. It can also depend on why you are doing MCMC. If you are estimating the denominator of Bayes rule, then you are done when you are done, but if you are graphically presenting the posterior, then you are done when the graph is smooth enough for your presentation purposes.
