Embedded systems development folder structure

I'm starting a big project to run on a PIC32, and like every big project, code organization it's very important. Likewise, folder structure too. In desktop software development I use my own folder structure (very similar to Maven ), but like every applications we make, desktop and embedded implementations will have differences. So, in your embedded systems project, what's your folder structure? Is there any "maven like standard " to embedded systems?
