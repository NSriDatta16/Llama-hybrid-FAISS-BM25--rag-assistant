It all depends on how much load is expected on the application. But as a minimum, I'd go for 2 x cpu or multi-core single cpu, at least 4GB RAM and a decent RAID controller. Depending on your performance and storage requirements - I'd start off with RAID 1 (Mirror) and extend that to RAID 10 (Mirrored stripes) across everything (SAME - Stripe and Mirror Everything). Get some decent network points too. That should at least give you enough headroom if you need to expand.
