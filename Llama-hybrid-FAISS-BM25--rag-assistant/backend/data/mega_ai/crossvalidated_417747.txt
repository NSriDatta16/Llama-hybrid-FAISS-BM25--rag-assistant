how to cut/group variables in Cox model

Considering that for a logistic regression one approach is to cut the numeric variables (or group the categorical ones) with some algorithm before running the logistic model (to allow the algorithm to give them the number that will make the log(odds) linear with the B*X, what would be the way to do this for a Cox model? For example you can use a chaid or a statistical test to group the variables and then convert the levels to factors and run the logistic regression. Finally you canuse some kind of variable selection like stepwise with Akaike criterion (but this is after introducing the variables grouped in groups that have significative different target rates). I thought that, in the Cox model, since what you are trying to estimate is the survival, and this is a distribution over time, one way would be to cut/group the variables (each one) with some kind of test like a goodness of fit for the real survival curve (this is: if the curves are the same, then you should not cut in that point). Do you have any other ideas to cut the variables in a useful way for a Cox model? Is there any package (R) to do this?
