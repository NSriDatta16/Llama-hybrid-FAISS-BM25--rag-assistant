I'm afraid you're incorrect - a linear model can over-fit the data. You have 30 observations and 18 predictors. That is less than 2 observations per predictor! The classic rule of thumb is one predictor for every ten observations (or for logistic regression one per 10 events). I'm afraid the graphs you've included are confusing the issue. These are discussing a y~x (one predictor) equation where you are over-fitting the data with the generation of polynomials (you're expanding the x predictor to x^2, x^3...). If you look at the linear equation you're estimating.... it is large and looks like the one under the over-fit model to the right, but in your case it is y ~ x + t + g + f + ..... You're overfitting in a different way. Rather than taking x and making x, x^2, x^3.... to "over-parameterize" the model you are simply using all 18 predictors. Hope that makes some sense
