DCGAN: How to nearest neighbor on the training set in sense of compressed sensing?

I want to find the nearest neighbor of the output compared to the training set based on this framework: https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow (I asked already generally in this post: Generative Adversarial Network: How to find the most similar image to the output within the training samples? with the answer: "The best approach is probably to find nearest neighbors in a compressed representation space such as the latent code vector of a convolutional autoencoder.") Now, I want to know, how to do that practical based on the DCGAN (see GitHub). Has somebody an idea how to find the nearest neighbors? Where can I find a compressed representation space such as the latent code vector?
