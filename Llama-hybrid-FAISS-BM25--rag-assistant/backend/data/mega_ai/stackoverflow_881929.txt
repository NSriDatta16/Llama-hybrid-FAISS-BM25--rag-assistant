Use the Subsonic.Select() ExecuteTypedList Method with String

This is more a question regarding generics than subsonic: Imagine if have the following code: List result = DB.Select(Product.Columns.Id) .From () .ExecuteTypedList (); That works great and returns a generic list with the ids from my Product table. But if I want to get a list of the ProductName: List result = DB.Select(Product.Columns.ProductName) .From () .ExecuteTypedList (); it throws a compiler message (translated from german): "string" has to be a non-abstract type with a public Constructor without parameter, in order to be used as a generic type or in the generic method "SubSonic.SqlQuery.ExecuteTypedList()" as param "T". cause: String has no empty contructor: int i = new int; // works String s = new String; // compiler error: "string" does not contain a constructor that takes '0' argument If I use a List instead it works , but is there a more elegant way, where I can use List ? Update: List does not work. I indeed get a list of objects but that seem to be "empty" object that doesn't contain my ProductNames ( object.ToString() returns {Object} )
