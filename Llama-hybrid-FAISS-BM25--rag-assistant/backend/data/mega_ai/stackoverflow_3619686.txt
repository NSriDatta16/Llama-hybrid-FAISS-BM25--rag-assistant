You don't want to define CSS for each element because if you ever need to make a change that affects many elements one day, say the looks of all the buttons or headers, you will be doing a lot of Search/Replace. And how to check if you forgot to update one rule to keep your site consistent? Stephen touched on a very strong point in CSS. You can assign multiple classes to an element. You should define some basic rules that "ordinary" developers can't touch. They will provide the consistency through the site. Then developers can assign an extra class to personalize any property. I wouldn't assign more than two classes though: a global and a personalized. Considering you already have this huge stylesheet in your hands, I'm not sure how you will pick which one of the 7 developers will have to sit down through a month and organize it. That is probably going to be hard part.
