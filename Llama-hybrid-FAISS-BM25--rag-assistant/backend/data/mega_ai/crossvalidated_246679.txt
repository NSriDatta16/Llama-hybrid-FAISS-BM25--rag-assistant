How to detect or remove noisy flickering patterns in a discrete space?

right now we are dealing with this problem with euristhics designed on the specific problem but I would like to approach this same problem with something smarter. For example, imagine I have a sequence of the form [A,A,A,A,B,C,D,E,F,E,F,E,F,E,F, G]. Every point is paired with a timestamp. I would like to be able to detect the flickering between E and F and treat as if it was the same as the repeating pattern [A, A, A, A]. I expect the flickering between E and F to have always the same temporal structure but I would like to have some control on the threshold to cut out false positives. I believe that with time series analysis this should be easy but it's a subject I barely know of and I would love some pointers to the right approach to such a problem. Thanks
