How to get the RGB values of a 5x5 square?

I am writing a method that is used to get the RGB values of a 5x5 square of pixels and then calculate the average colour of all of them. We were given a package to use, and that's where the .getPixel methods and such are from. What I am having difficulty with is with getting each pixel in the 5x5 area. What I have tried is running the loop and at the end having x++ so x is increased by one. But I realize that this only gets the pixels in the top row. I think I must have another loop or a nested loop of somekind to get the 5x5 square but I just can't figure out how to make it work while still adding the values to the vars red,green, and blue. Any hints? Thanks private Color tileColor ( Picture pic, int x, int y ) { Pixel p; Color color; int r,g,b; int red = 0; int green = 0; int blue = 0; for (int i = 0; i
