The Azure AppFabric is a collection of services that allow to you leverage functionality traditionally provided on premise by infrasture components common to most networks. Currently, it consists of the following: Azure AppFabric Service Bus - allows for connection of applications by providing a centralized relay point in the cloud. Applications create outbound connections to the rendezvous location, thus helping mitigate the challenges posed by security measures like firewall restrictions on in-bound connections and IP masking via NAT layers. This feature includes both 'real time' options as well a 'message buffer' dynamic to allow for more disconnected style communication. Azure AppFabric Access Control Service - the "ACS" allows WIF applications to quickly access various identity providers and consume a single format of claims token. Used in conjunction with products like ADFS, it allows cloud hosted applications to authenticate against on-premise identity stores. Azure AppFabric Cache Service - currently in public testing, this service brings the "Velocity" style functionality to applications. This provides them with a distributed cache system as well as a new session provider. There's more features/services coming in 2011, but these are the hot ones currently. Regarding hosting your business logic, this is not something that is currently available in the Azure AppFabric. There's been mentions that we may eventually see the potential for placing applications "on the edge", meaning the servers that front the Azure AppFabric connections, but no ETA or even firm commitment that this will happen.
