How to drag a Farseer body with the mouse, without springiness?

I am using Farseer and XNA. I'm trying to drag an body with the mouse, but I don't want a spring behavior, like in the demos.I want the object to follow the mouse very closely and without springiness, but still be able to rotate. I tried using another invisible body attached with a RevoluteJoint and moving that, but that still has a little bit of spring to it, and the dragged body lags behind the mouse a bit. Any ideas ? Thanks.
