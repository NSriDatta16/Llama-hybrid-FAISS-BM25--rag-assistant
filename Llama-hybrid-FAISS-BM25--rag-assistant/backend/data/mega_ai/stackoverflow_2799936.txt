xdebug for PHP 5.2 on Windows 7 64bit

Previous posters have linked to http://fusionxlan.com/PHPx64.php to install 64-bit capable versions of xdebug. I need PHP 5.2 compatibility for Magento, and fusionxlan has disappeared and archive.org doesn't have a copy. Does anyone have a copy of the fusionxlan download or dll that they can share? Thanks, JD
