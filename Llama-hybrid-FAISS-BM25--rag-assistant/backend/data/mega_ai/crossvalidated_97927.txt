How to test a program that uses machine learning

I understand how to test programs that are either right or wrong. But what if permissible some inaccuracy? How to distinguish a bug in the implementation of bad classifier? Naive solution (baseline)? But it seems that it will help to find the only really bad solution. I think you understand what I mean. What are the ways of testing programs without the correct output?
