What's the best interactive Analysis and Plotting Tool for software testing?

My realtime app generates a data log: 100 words of data @10Khz. I need to analyze it and produce some plots of the results. There are intermediate calculations involved - I need to take some differences, averages, etc. Excel would work fine, except for: the 32000 item limit on graph data series is too small - that's only 3 seconds of data. the glacial speed at which it processes changes to graphs containing large data series is unbearable. What are good alternatives to Excel for manipulating and plotting large quantities of data? I'm looking for something interactive, not a library.
