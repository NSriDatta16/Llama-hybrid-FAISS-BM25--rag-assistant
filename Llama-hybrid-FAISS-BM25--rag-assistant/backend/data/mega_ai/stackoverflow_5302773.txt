Can I view the runtime structure of a dynamic in .Net?

I just ran across an interesting error caused by a misconfiguration in my application, and it prompted this question. The Error in Question I am working on an ASP.Net MVC 3 web application, and I had accidentally dragged the web.config file into itself from solution explorer, resulting in the following in web.config: What was happening was that this configuration caused the ViewContext object to be corrupted (and rightly so); I got the following when the MVC runtime tried to access it (this from the immediate window) ? ViewContext.ClientValidationEnabled 'ViewContext.ClientValidationEnabled' threw an exception of type 'System.FormatException' base {System.SystemException}: {"String was not recognized as a valid Boolean."} My Question Is there a way to look at the contents of memory for a dynamic in the DLR? In this case, I'd like to see the contents of the memory location that is referenced to parse ClientValidationEnabled , but every time I tried to access the value, the runtime automatically attempted to box it into a bool . I got as far as ((dynamic)((dynamic)this).ViewContext).ClientValidationEnabled before I gave up trying to figure out a QuickWatch way to do it.
