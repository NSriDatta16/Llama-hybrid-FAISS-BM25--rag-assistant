Why 1 norm of reconstruction error is not used/minimized for low rank approximation using PCA?

In pca, I see reconstruction error is calculated in terms of either frobenius norm or spectral norm. And I also saw they have a closed bound in terms of singular values. My question is why 1 norm of reconstruction error is not used as a performance metrics or why 1 norm of reconstruction error is not minimized?
