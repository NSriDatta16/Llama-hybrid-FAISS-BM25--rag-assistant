I'd say the distinction between engineering and learning is subjective. This is how I differentiate them, Feature Engineering: Handcrafting new variables from the existing ones. eg: BMI, when the weight and the height are available Feature Learning: Letting your system figure out what are the best features for the problem at hand. The wikipedia page is a good resource to read more. There's a huge interest in the field of ML to automatically learn new features and ICLR is a one conference that you may find many directions.
