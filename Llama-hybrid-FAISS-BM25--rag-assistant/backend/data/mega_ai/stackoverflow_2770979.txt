can you use hirarchy grid?mean when you click on employee name it open a grid just below that row?i think it will be best option for you as you can use datatable in one datatable fetch all employee from table and assign them to first datatable and in other datatable fetch all manager and comments after doing all this just assign both datatable two grid datasource and create a join between them and it will work perfectly... links http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/aspnet/web-hierarchical-data-grid.aspx#Overview http://helpcentral.componentone.com/nethelp/c1webparts/default.htm?turl=WordDocuments%2Fdisplayingahierarchicalgrid1.htm http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff407273(office.14).aspx http://aspalliance.com/articleViewer.aspx?aId=21&pId=
