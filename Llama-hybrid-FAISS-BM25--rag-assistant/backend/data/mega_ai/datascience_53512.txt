Different significant variables but same Adjusted R-squared value

I performed a multiple linear regression on 64 variables with 3 different models: Performed Multiple Linear Regression on all 64 variables Perform Feature Selection with Random Forest and then perform multiple linear regression on selected features Performed Stepwise Linear Regression I achieved the same adjusted R squared value for all 3 models but different significant variables. How should I make sense of this? Which model should I go with? Will appreciate any advice! Thank you!
