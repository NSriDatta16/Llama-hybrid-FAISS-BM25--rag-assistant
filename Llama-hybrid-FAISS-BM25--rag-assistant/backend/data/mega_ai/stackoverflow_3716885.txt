You can use property sheets to manage common project properties easily. My suggestion would be to set up user macros organized something like so: $(DependenciesPath) => d:\src\lib\ $(BoostPath) => $(DependenciesPath)boost_1_43\ $(CxImagePath) => $(DependenciesPath)CxImage_6_00\ Then, in your project properties, you only need to refer to $(BoostPath) and $(CxImagePath) and not to specific versions. You can move the entire dependencies folder and you can change individual dependency paths simply by changing the various macros in the property sheet.
