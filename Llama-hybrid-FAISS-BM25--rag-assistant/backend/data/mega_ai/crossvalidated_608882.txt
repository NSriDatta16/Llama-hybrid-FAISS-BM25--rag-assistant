It's not clear why you think that there is "Type I error" (false positives) in your results. If the assumptions underlying the binomial model are correct, then you shouldn't be having false-positive results unless your model is overfitting the data. If you have more than 15 or so cases in the minority outcome class per coefficient that you are estimating (as you seem to), you are probably OK. You can check by repeating the modeling on multiple bootstrap samples. For the degrees of freedom ( df ), the maximum-likelihood method used to fit the binomial logistic regression is based on asymptotic theory that holds in the limit of an infinite number of observations. Comparisons are then based on a normal distribution of coefficient estimates, the limit of the t distribution as the degrees of freedom approach infinity. For your model, you are asking for trouble when you omit the individual coefficient for a predictor ( habitat ) that you are including in an interaction. You might get away with that if there's only 1 interaction term in the model, but you have several. I'd be reluctant to give advice on how to set up the emtrends in this situation.
