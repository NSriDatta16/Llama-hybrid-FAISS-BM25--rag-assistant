For question 1, to explicitly show how it follows from Bayes rule, we'd write $$p(w|y,x)=\frac{p(y|w,x)p(w|x)}{p(y|x)},$$ but we can just assume $w$ and $x$ are independent and write $$p(w|y,x)\propto p(y|w,x)p(w)$$ As for question 2, this is just a standard computation of the posterior of a normal-normal model, see ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_linear_regression ) for the same problem worked out in some more detail with a slightly different prior or ( https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/bayesGauss.pdf ) for the non-regression case.
