Given the number of assumptions that would have to be made, I would answer this question with "no". You could treat the one week average as the sample mean of 7 day-observations, but only if you assume that the web site daily page views follow a normal distribution with equal variance. To do this I would use a one sample t-test. In the real-world, given the variance many websites have given day of week, time of year, or special events(like the NFL website during playoffs), I would want more than one week of data to form any conclusion.
