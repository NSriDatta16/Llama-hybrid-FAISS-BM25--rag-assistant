Methods: public first, then private. Methods which are related (e.g. getHeight() , getWidth() , getArea() ) are placed near each other. If there is a hierarchal relationship between methods, then high-level before the low level (e.g. getArea() uses getWidth() so it's placed before it) variables: similar to functions, public first, then private. Grouped according to context. Alphabetical? I don't like it. It can be a nightmare when reading / modifying the code. I cannot tell whether a function's name is sqrt() or calculateSqrt() , so I won't enjoy looking for it. If the functions are organized according to context, it will be much easier to find them.
