I did something similar to jwhitlock ... I ended up with a StdinDataIO class that wraps around the appropriate OS-specific implementation(*) so that the rest of my program can select() on the file descriptor StdinDataIO provides, remaining blissfully ignorant of Windows' limitations regarding stdin. Have a look here and here if you like, the code is all open-source/BSD-licensed. (*) the implementation is a simple pass-through for Linux/MacOSX, and in Windows it's a rather complex process of setting up a child thread to read from stdin and send the data it receives over a socket back to the main thread... not very elegant, but it works.
