I use a simple named template that does the verbose check and tweak it as needed to handle legacy systems (e.g. some fields may use "Y"/"N", some "True"/"False", others 1/0) and dump the value into a variable. It's not the most elegant approach, but if you're using XPath 1.0, don't have EXSLT support, and can't (or don't want to) utilize outside script calls, it works consistently and can be tweaked as needed. 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 Usage:
