Using averages is just a between estimator in the literature on panel data analysis. Using averages is also the main justification for variance weights, e.g. the explanation of aweights in Stata. (as in Neuneck's answer.) Another related issue is estimation with aggregates, e.g. if you only observe group totals, where groups could be states or countries or industries Consistency is obtained as N goes to infinity, K, and J can be fixed and finite. My guess is that you cannot do better under your assumption that the linear model is correctly specified if you have enough variation of x across units. Without within variation it would be a problem with unobserved heterogeneity, e.g. if there is a unit specific effect or there is not enough between information, e.g. every one has the same number of repeat observations for each levels of a categorical variable.
