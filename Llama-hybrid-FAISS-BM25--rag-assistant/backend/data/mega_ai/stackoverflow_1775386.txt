If you're not writing the Album information to some kind of permanent storage at the end of step 1, e.g. database, file etc., then you could use TempData to keep track of the information entered into the wizard between page requests. TempData uses Session state under the hood and is only persistent across a single request, so you would need write your album/track information to TempData at the end of every controller action and read it in again at the beginning of every action. Then, once you have accumulated all the album/track information, write it to permanent storage.
