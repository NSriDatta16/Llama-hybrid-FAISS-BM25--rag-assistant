Simple thought experiment: You have measured weight and height of 5 infants after birth. And you measured it from the same babies again after two years. Meanwhile you measured weight and height of your baby daughter almost every week resulting in 100 value pairs for her. If you use a mixed effects model, there is no problem. If you use a fixed effects model you put undue weight on the measurements from your daughter, to a point where you would get almost the same model fit if you used only data from her. So, it's not only important for inference to model repeated measures or uncertainty structures correctly, but also for prediction. In general, you don't get the same predictions from a mixed effects model and from a fixed effects model (with violated assumptions). and I can either include a column for (new) subjects in newdf You can't predict for subjects which were not part of the original (training) data. Again a thought experiment: the new subject is obese. How could the model know that it is at the upper end of the random effects distribution? will the by-subject variance captured in the model simply be ignored (averaged over) for the prediction If I understand you correctly then yes. The model gives you an estimate of the expected value for the population (note that this estimate is still conditional on the original subjects).
