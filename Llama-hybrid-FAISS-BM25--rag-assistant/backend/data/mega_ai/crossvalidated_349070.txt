Let's start with part (b) For Part (b), you use Bayes Theorem. There's a 95% chance he is not a gambler, and if you know he is not a gambler, the chance he's frauding you is only 1%. if he is a gambler (a 5% chance), then the chances he's a fraud go up to 20%. Basically, you take a weighted average of the two probabilities with this equation: .95*.01 + .05*.20 This comes out to .0195, or 1.95%. Now, for Part (a), we use the same set up. Since we know he's a gambler, the probability he's a gambler is 100% and the probability that he's not a gambler is 0%. We can take our equation from before and modify it with these new probabilities: 0*.01 +1.0*.20 This gets us the intuitive 20%
