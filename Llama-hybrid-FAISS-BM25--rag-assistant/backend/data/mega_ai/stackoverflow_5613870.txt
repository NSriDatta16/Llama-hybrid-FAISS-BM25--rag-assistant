It helps to appreciate the difference between a value and a variable. A variable is a storage location that contains a value. null means that the storage location does not contain anything (but null itself is just a special kind of value). Read that last sentence carefully. There is a difference between what null is and what null means. 99% of the time you only care about what null means. Undefined means that the variable (as opposed to the value ) does not exist.
