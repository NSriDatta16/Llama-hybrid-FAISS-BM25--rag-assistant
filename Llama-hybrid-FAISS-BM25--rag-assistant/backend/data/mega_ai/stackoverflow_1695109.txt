You could run IronPython inside a .NET appdomain that has restricted privileges. This would definitely work in Windows, and possibly/probably in Mono (I couldn't really say). You would need to write a little program that embeds the IronPython interpreter and passes the script to it. The first example in the chapter on embedding in the book Iron Python in Action shows to write such a launcher. I don't recall if it covers appdomains, but that info should be on the Web somewhere.
