Coffee Drinking & Lung Cancer My favorite example is that supposedly, "coffee drinkers have a greater risk of lung cancer", despite most coffee drinkers... well... drinking coffee, rather than inhaling it. There have been various studies about this, but the consensus remains that studies with this conclusion usually just have a larger proportion of smoking coffee drinkers, than non-smoking coffee drinkers. In other words, the effect of smoking confounds the effect of coffee consumption , if not included in the model. The most recent article on this I could find is a meta analysis by Vania Galarraga and Paolo Boffetta (2016). $^\dagger$ The Obesity Paradox Another example that plagues clinical research, is the claim that obesity can be beneficial for certain diseases. Specifically, many articles, still to this day (just do a quick search for obesity paradox on pubmed and be amazed), claim the following: While a higher BMI increases the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer, once a patient already has the disease, a higher BMI is associated with lower rates of major adversarial events or death. Why does this happen? Obesity is defined as excess fat negatively affecting health, yet we classify obesity based on BMI. BMI is just calculated as: $$\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight in kg}}{(\text{height in m})^2},$$ so the most direct way to combat obesity is through weight loss (or by growing taller somehow). Regimes that focus on loss of weight rather than fat , tend to result in a proportionally large loss of muscle. This is likely what causes lower BMI to be associated with a higher rate of major adversarial events. Because many studies do not include measures of body fat (percentage), but only BMI as a proxy, the amount of body fat confounds the effect of BMI on health. A nice review of this phenomenon was written by Steven G. Chrysant (2018). $^\ddagger$ He ends with: [B]ased on the recent evidence, the obesity paradox is a misnomer and could convey the wrong message to the general public that obesity is not bad.
