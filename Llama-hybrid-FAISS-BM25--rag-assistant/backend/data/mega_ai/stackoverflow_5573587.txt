You can use the service management API to to make changes to your running instances e.g. increase the number of instances, change configuration (basically what you can do through the Azure Portal), but at the moment it doesn't give you any information about how your application is running. This is because the definition of load will vary from application to application. If you want to monitor how your application is running, you will have to decide what you want to monitor and then instrument it yourself. If you want to use performance counters than you can use the DiagnosticMonitor class to store them to Table Storage which you can read from. Another option would be to send performance counter data out from each instance on the service bus and monitor these messages. There are, however, lots of things that you want to monitor that isn't catered for. If you want to look at the number of reads/writes to a queue for example, this is something that you would have to write yourself.
