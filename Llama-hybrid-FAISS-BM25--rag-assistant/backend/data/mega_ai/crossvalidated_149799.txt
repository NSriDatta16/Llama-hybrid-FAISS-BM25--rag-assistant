Code for detrended cross-correlation in R

I want to code for Detrended Cross Correlation in R for time-series data but I'm still stuck. I don't know why the coefficient is not in range -1 : 1. I try to write following these equation below Measuring correlations between non-stationary series with DCCA coefficient Detrened cross-correlation coefficient is calculated as detrended covariance of two dataset over detrened variance of two integrated series (Equation 1) For time-series {xt}, use integrated series profile (Equation 2) where the data must be detrended by local trend in box of size s (Equation 3) (Equation 4) The X_hat is linear fit value evaluated by least square method Detrended covariance of two profiles (Equation 5) Average the covariance over all boxes (Equation 6) ## data_1 x= c(-1.042061,-0.669056,-0.685977,-0.067925,0.808380,1.385235,1.455245,0.540762 ,0.139570,-1.038133,0.080121,-0.102159,-0.068675,0.515445,0.600459,0.655325,0.610604,0.482337,0.079108,-0.118951,-0.050178,0.007500,-0.200622) ## data_2 y= c(-2.368030,-2.607095,-1.277660,0.301499,1.346982,1.885968,1.765950,1.242890,-0.464786,0.186658,-0.036450,-0.396513,-0.157115,-0.012962,0.378752,-0.151658,0.774253,0.646541,0.311877,-0.694177,-0.412918,-0.338630,0.276635) ## window size = 6 k=6 DCCA_CC=function(x,y,k){ ## calculate cumulative sum profile of all t xx I'm not sure if something wrong in integrated profile.
