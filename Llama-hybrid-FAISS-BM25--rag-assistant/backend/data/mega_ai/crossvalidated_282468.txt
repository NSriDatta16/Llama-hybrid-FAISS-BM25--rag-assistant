Your method of building a model to directly predict 120 steps ahead makes sense. (How accurate the forecast will be will depend on your data, of course.) Alternatively, you could look into classical time series forecasting methods, e.g., Exponential Smoothing. Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Hyndman & Athanasopoulos is a good reference. Think about whether you have some kind of seasonality in your daily data: intra-yearly, intra-weekly or even intra-monthly. The book suggests a few tools for this, like seasonplot. ARIMA or similar would be useful if you only have weekly seasonality. If you have yearly seasonality, ARIMA etc. may run into problems - in such a case, you may want to look at TBATS models, or search for "daily forecast" on CV.
