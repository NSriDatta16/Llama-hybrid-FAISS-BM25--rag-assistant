Using exit() is highly discouraged by Apple, per their Technical Q&A QA1561 : WARNING : It is possible to quit the application by calling exit. Applications calling exit will appear to the user to have crashed, rather than performing a graceful termination and animating back to the Home screen. Such usage provides a negative experience and is strongly discouraged. Use of exit() should show up as a crash, like a failure in an assertion would. If a reviewer hit this condition while testing your application, odds are that it would be rejected. However, if this is a very infrequent case you could roll the dice and hope that the reviewer would never encounter it. It's a gamble, and you may be able to get away with that, but I don't know if that's the best plan of attack. If you can identify this inconsistency, I can't see why you couldn't wipe all in-memory stores and effectively start things from scratch, as you would on a fresh boot of the application. I had a rare case where my Core Data database would become inconsistent due to an undo / redo / undo cycle, and this is what I did to recover from that.
