I work with time series rather than being an expert in it and I have never seen this raised. I don't think, however, that you can go from data aggregated at the quarterly level to the monthly level. Why is it important to your company to answer the question at the monthly level if there are no patterns at the monthly level and thus no predictability? We predict at the monthly level as well, but due to unpredictable changes over time (my organization has no knowledge and limited interest in our spending process since we have little capacity to refuse services) our results are rarely accurate at less than the yearly level which is what I tell the people I report the data to. In response to the IP response. We get asked for monthly data even though it is doubtful we can predict such accurately given the level of variation in our poorly documented process. When you have to do something you do, the key is to point out that what is being asked is not reasonable given the nature of the process. That way decision makers know the limits on what is being provided. Have you considered using exponential smoothing to do predictions (Holt simple, damp trend etc)? Its not a perfect solution (its what we use) but its easy to do, has a good reputation, and can be accurate as long as the basic patterns don't change too much I think.
