It makes sense, but only in situation when there are all possible combinations of those variables in data, that is: when there are cases that have 0;0, 0;1, 1;0 and 1;1 in your data (first number means variable of first possible dummy variable, and second number means value of second variable). In such a situation there can be possibility, that there is different effect of every of these possibilities on dependent variable. Otherwise (let's say in most popular situation when there are no cases that have 1;1 combinations) the interaction variable would be linear combination of the base variables, so in case of logistic regression without regularization model will not converge at all. Also if there are no 0;0, 0;1 or 1;0 it does not make sense, because then also two coefficients would be enough to fit all conditional means of predicted variable within combinations of these two variables. This would also logically make no sense. If there are let's say, employed and unemployed women and employed and unemployed man, it make sense to make model that predict different value for employed woman than for employed man. But if there are no man that have given a birth to a child, it does not make sense to predict different value in model for man who have given a birth to a child and for woman who have given a birth to a child. In model with two dummy variables the effect of all of their combinations is just sum of effect of one of them and the second one: $$ y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\mathrm({x}_{1}=1) + \beta_{2}\mathrm({x}_{2}=1) $$ In such a model for a case who has both variables equal to one model predicts just sum of effects of both variables when predicting his dependent variable value. With interaction term there is also individual effect of having both of them: $$ y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\mathrm({x}_{1}=1) + \beta_{2}\mathrm({x}_{2}=1) + \beta_{3}\mathrm({x}_{1}=1)\&\mathrm({x}_{2}=1) $$ In such a situation model predicts individual, special value to a case that have both variables equal to one, that can differ from just sum of effects of two separate variables.
