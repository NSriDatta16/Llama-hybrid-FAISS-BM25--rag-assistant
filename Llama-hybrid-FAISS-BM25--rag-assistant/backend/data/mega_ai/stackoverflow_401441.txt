C#: Move Controls From Form to tabPage in VS Form Designer

I decided to change a utility I'm working on to use a tabpage. When I tried to drag various controls from the form to a tab page on top of the form, it made copies of the control, giving it a different name. It's easy enough to just remake the form on top of the tab or just edit the source code in the designer to have everything be added to the tab instead (and this is what I did, which worked), but it seems like there would probably be a better way to do this via the gui.
