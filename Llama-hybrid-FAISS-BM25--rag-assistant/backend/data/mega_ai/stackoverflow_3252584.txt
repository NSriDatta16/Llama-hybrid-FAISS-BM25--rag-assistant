I'd like to throw my 2 cents in, but it comes from a slightly different direction and you may or may not have direct resources for troubleshooting - but it's worth thinking about. Generally speaking, though, it is a PHP error and we can rule out client side issues. On top of that, in my day job (network troubleshooting), If something is working and then stops, I immediately think "what changed". If you didn't add anything to the script and there's no way for a user to affect the script at runtime, then I would immediately start thinking "uh-oh, what's up with the infrastructure". This is especially true if something works locally, but not over the internet. Have you checked for bad memory on the server or bad NICs (if bad NICs, that would explain why it works one one interface and not another). Do you have access to this or is it hosted (can your host check)? Next I would start thinking, ok, server memory's fine and it's not likely faulty NIC related otherwise it would fail sporatically and at different places. Still could be networking, though. Is there a security device that can mangle packets anywhere in the mix (NIDS/HIDS, WAF, proxy, etc?) Do you see any network problems with packets (duplicates, out of order, Do Not Fragment, etc...). I'll be honest, if someone called my desk and described your issues to me, first thing I would say is "check the IPS logs" about 85% that's the issue. False positives can do this and all it takes is one auto update on the firewall... I hope that helps.
