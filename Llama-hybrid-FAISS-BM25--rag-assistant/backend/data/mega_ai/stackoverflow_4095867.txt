You need to write an .htaccess rewrite that looks for incoming domains admin.magentostore.com and rewrites it to index.php/admin . If you check the Apache rewrite documentation , you will find plenty of examples of how to achieve it. This isn't actually a Magento question as such, native .htaccess will sort you out. HTH, JD
