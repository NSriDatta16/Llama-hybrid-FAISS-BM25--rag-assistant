Covariate dependent Markov models? Plot state transition probability along gradient of covariate values

fist post here, came from Stack overflow as it was suggested to me this is more appropriate for the kind of question. So, data consists of 4 variable, id, x1 and x2, continuous variables which are correlated with y, a binary variable. 0 and 1 in the binary variable represent different states. Is it possible to use Markov chain models to calculate and plot state transition probability along the gradient of covariate values for each id and subsequently for the pooled data? set.seed(1) id =rep(1, 100) x1 = rnorm(100) x2 = rnorm(100) z = 1 + 2*x1 + 3*x2 pr = 1/(1+exp(-z)) y = rbinom(100,1,pr) a The ideal output would be a figure of state transition probabilities as a function of a covariate as found on link and described in moveHMM package , however, my data doesn't have coordinates as input and I am really unsure on how to proceed.
