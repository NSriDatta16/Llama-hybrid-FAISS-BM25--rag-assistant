Resources and Examples of using MEF for DI/IoC

I've searched high and look for samples about using MEF for DI. I know its not DI but from what I hear (really hear in podcasts) it can be used as such...but I can't find any blog posts or samples. I am using MEF in this project already (to support plugins) and thought it would be nice to leverage for DI also. Maybe I am barking up the wrong tree?
