yes, someone can send the variables using urllib2 in python for instance. This is very easy to do. If you are only going to do one set of validations, do it server side. doing it client side is nothing more than a courtesy to your users. as an example of how easy it is: import urllib2 variables = {'variable1': value1, 'variable2': value2} urllib2.urlopen('http://yoursite.com/index.php/yourform', variables) # your form has now been spoofed. Adding headers and cookie management to spoof any user agent is just as trivial
