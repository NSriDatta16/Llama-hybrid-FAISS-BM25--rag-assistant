Repository organization and selective checkout

I am using TortoiseSVN and I have a SVN repository organized in this way: folder1 folder2 trunk tag branches folder3 trunk tag branches folder4 folder5 trunk tag branches I would like to know if there is a way to checkout only trunk directories, keeping the entire tree under the versioning control: folder1 folder2 trunk folder3 trunk folder4 folder5 trunk In this way I can update all trunks with a single update command on folder1 , without updating tags and branches which can be full of data.
