First, you say "dynamic time warping metric", however DTW is a distance measure, but not a metric (it does not obey the triangular inequality). Paper [a] compares DTW to 12 alternatives on 43 datasets, DTW really does work very well for most problems. If you want to learn more about DTW, you could glance at Keoghs tutorial http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Keogh_Time_Series_CDrom.zip (warning 500 meg) The pass is peggy. There is also a tutorial on SAX http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/SIGKDD_2007.ppt [a] Xiaoyue Wang, Hui Ding, Goce Trajcevski, Peter Scheuermann, Eamonn J.
