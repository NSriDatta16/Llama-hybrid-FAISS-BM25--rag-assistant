See Static Estimation for Test Coverage for a technique that estimates coverage without executing the source code. The basic idea is to compute a program slice for each test case, and then "count" what the slice enumerates. A (forward) slice is effectively that part of a program that you can reach from a specific starting point in the code, in this case, the test code. While the technical paper above is hard to get if you're not an ACM member [or you didn't attend the conference where it was presented :], there's a slide presentation here . Of course, running this static estimator only tells you (roughly) what code will be exercised. It doesn't substitute for actually running the tests, and verifying that they pass!
