When compiling with /clr , your entire program is converted to MSIL unless you use #pragma managed(off) or #pragma unmanaged int is equivalent to System::Int32 char is equivalent to System::SByte (not System::Char !) Both of these types are "primitive". Managed code sees them as managed types and native code sees native types. Native arrays will use unverifiable MSIL (same as C# pointers, for example)
