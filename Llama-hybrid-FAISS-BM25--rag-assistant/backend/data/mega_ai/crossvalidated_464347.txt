after receiving the data from the dropbox , I have some interesting things to report using AUTOBOX , a time series analusis package that I have helped to develop. To some it would appear that differencing is the remedy for the non-stationarity BUT not too all ... Is a time trend a substitute for first differencing? discusses the need for incorporating deterministic time trends ...as needed in this example. It definitely has arima seasonal structure ..... and some short term arima structure AND 5 different trend point changes . AND non-constant error variance requiring weighted least squares following http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html My 81 year old eye failed to identify that there were 5 trends .... In addition there were seasonal parameters and an error variance change breakpoint . following http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html The forecast plot is here The residual ACF suggesting sufficiency is here
