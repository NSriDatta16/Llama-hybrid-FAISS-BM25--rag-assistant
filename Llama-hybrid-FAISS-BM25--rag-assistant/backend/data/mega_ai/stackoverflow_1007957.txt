@Aiden Bell Errm. Depends on the object. If one instance can be shared then you save storage ... but it depends if the object is altered by the user. You will be reading/writing the object creating a bottle-neck. Without more information, you will have to lookup the theory here. â€“ Aiden Bell 11 mins ago -- These instances don't have data that can be altered by the user, however, they would contain data that would be used by users throughout the site. Basically, when it comes down to it, the main question is: Multiple objects in memory, PER user (each user has his own set of instantiated objects) VS Single objects in cached in file for all users (all users use the same objects, for example, same error handler class, same template handler class, and same database handle class) -- Hi, anyone else have any ideas?
