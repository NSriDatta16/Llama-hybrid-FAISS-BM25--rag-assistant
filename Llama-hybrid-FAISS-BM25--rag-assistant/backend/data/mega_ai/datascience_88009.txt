This question is similar to this one and this one , but seems to be ill-posed. Either because it implies an unknown (undefined) way how the neurons process the inputs, or because the provided solution (5, 3) is wrong. Concretely, usual neurons only sum their inputs and the bias and pass the sum through a step function. These are the typical neurons used in practice, so, without further information, educated reader would simply assume such neurons by default. Under this assumption, we need 5 neurons, no matter whether the step function produces {0, 1} or {-1, 1} as the output. See the left part of the figure below. The first layer simply defines two linear boundaries, u (blue) and v (red). In the next layer, we perform logical AND: $w = u \wedge v$ and $z = \bar{u} \wedge \bar{v}$ . $w$ is 1 for the black triangles above the red and the blue line, and 0 otherwise. $z$ is 1 for the black triangles below the red and the blue line, and 0 otherwise. In the last (3rd) layer, we combine these by a logical OR: $y = w \vee z$ is 1 for the triangles, and 0 otherwise. I refrain from explaining how to implement AND, OR and NOT in a neural network. You can look up my explanation here . However, if the neurons are allowed to multiply their inputs (something highly unusual in practice, but theoretically possible), then we can achieve the classification using only three neurons (right part of the figure above). The first layer again defines two linear boundaries, but now the output is +1 if a point is on one side of the boundary and -1 on the other. So, the black triangles above the two boundaries have $(u, v) = (+1, +1)$ , while those below the both boundaries have $(u, v) = (-1, -1)$ . In the second (last!) layer, we simply multiply the two: $y = u \cdot v$ . $y$ is one for the triangles, and -1 otherwise. If this was an exam question, I consider it highly unfair, because it requires highly unusual neurons and there is no hint to that. Actually, if you develop this idea further, you can come up with just a single neuron, one which combines the functionality of the three neurons in the right figure. There is nothing in the question suggesting that neurons cannot do that...
