I tried the key bindings solution, but it I couldn't get it to work. However editing my XCode key bindings works like a charm. Here's how I made it. This solution does not alter the contents of the Clipboard! Open the XCode Key Bindings: In the Edit User Scripts Dialog: Duplicate the "Move Line Down" script and rename it Duplicate the "Move Line Down.scpt" file, rename the script, select file via (double click) in Script Editor Edit the script (Opens "AppleScript Editor") and remove the "delete (paragraphs startLine through endLine)" passage. If you do not want to restart XCode, you seem to have to remove and re-add the script. Be sure that you have "Output" set to "Discard Output", otherwise you will have a "(null)" in your source file I slightly modified the scripts a little bit more to have the right lines selected: Duplicate Line Up: using terms from application "Xcode" tell first text document set {startLine, endLine} to selected paragraph range if startLine > 1 then set theText to (paragraphs startLine through endLine) set theText to (theText as string) make new paragraph at beginning of paragraph (startLine) with data theText set selected paragraph range to {endLine + 1, endLine + endLine - startLine + 1} else beep 1 end if end tell end using terms from Duplicate Line Down: using terms from application "Xcode" tell first text document set {startLine, endLine} to selected paragraph range if endLine
