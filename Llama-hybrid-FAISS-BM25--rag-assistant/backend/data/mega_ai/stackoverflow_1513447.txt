Not very nice, but I think this is the best you can do in MySQL. SELECT p.pID, p.pName FROM ( SELECT ( SELECT pID FROM products WHERE pCategory=p.pCategory AND pDisplay=1 AND pFeatured=1 ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 1 ) AS pID FROM products p WHERE pDisplay=1 AND pFeatured=1 GROUP BY pCategory ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 4 ) c JOIN products p ON c.pID = p.pID (karim79's query can return multiple products from the same category, possibly even products with pDisplay=0 or pFeatured=0. rexem's query handles the pDisplay/pFeatures issue, but can also return multiple products from the same category)
