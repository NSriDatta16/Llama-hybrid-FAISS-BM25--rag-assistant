I would create a light entity that represents the fields you need to display in your grid. BUT! I would only do that if the grid is read-only. If you need to alter objects from this grid, then you end up with an awkward translation layer which could end up being no better for performance. In that case, I would lazy load you domain objects. There are other ways you can squeeze some better performance out of that data pull, like DB tweaks (indexes, checking fragmentation of the indexes, etc. Just check the execution plan after you write the query). You could also implement pagination in your proc if you are returning a large list of these heavy objects so that you only get 10 or 20 at a time, and the user has multiple pages to browse. Rather than load the entire list and page in the code, you could add a column for rownumber and pass the row number start and end that you want to pull as parameters to the proc.
