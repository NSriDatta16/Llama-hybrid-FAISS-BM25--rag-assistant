This should ideally be a comment but I don't have enough reputation. I faced a similar problem with a single object localization data set. I did try regressing modified ResNet-18 (with 4 outputs) with the true label. I could achieve efficiency of around 83% after 30 epochs of training. The best efficiency was around 93%. My thinking was that the multiple image detection and classification pipelines such as RCNN's use a region proposal method under classification/bounding box regression so in the case of a single image localization we could do without the region proposal method. Two things could improve the efficiency: 1. Removing the GAP layer in the end 2. Replacing L2 loss with L1 loss
