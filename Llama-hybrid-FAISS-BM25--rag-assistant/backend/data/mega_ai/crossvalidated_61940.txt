As you noted, (1) an AR model relates the value of an observation $x$ at time $t$ to the previous values, with some error: $$ x_t = \phi x_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t $$ Let's substitute in $ x_{t-1} $, and then $ x_{t-2} $: $$\begin{aligned} x_t &= \phi (\phi x_{t-2} + \varepsilon_{t-1}) + \varepsilon_t \\ &= \phi^2x_{t-2} + \phi\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t \\ &= \phi^3x_{t-3} + \phi^2\varepsilon_{t-2} + \phi\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t \end{aligned} $$ Taking that out to infinity: $$ x_t = \phi^nx_{t-n} + \phi^{n-1}\varepsilon_{t-n+1} + ... + \phi\varepsilon_{t-1}+ \varepsilon_t $$ You can write any (stationary) AR($p$) as an MA($\infty$), though of course you run into a giant pile-up of terms on top of one another with $p>1$. Having seen that, let's rephrase our definition (1) now. An AR process relates the value of an observation $x$ at time $t$ to an infinite sequence of decaying error shocks $\varepsilon$ from prior time periods (that we don't directly observe). So what an MA process is might be clearer now. (2) An MA($q$) process relates the value of an observation $x$ at time $t$ to just $q$ error shocks from prior periods (that we don't directly observe), of which coefficients are allowed to vary more than the exponential decay implicit in an AR model. As you note, it has nothing to do with the usual "moving average" concept. With some conditions on the coefficients $\theta_1...\theta_q$ of an MA($q$) process, we can actually do something very similar to what I showed for an AR process above, that is, write the MA($q$) as an AR($\infty$). So it's just as valid to restate (2) to say an MA process relates the value of an observation $x$ at time $t$ to a decaying sequence of all prior values of $x$. So an ARMA model just combines those two ideas, relating $x_t$ to both an infinite decaying sequence and a defined sequence. ARIMA just adds in differencing to the mix, that is, you run ARMA on $x_t - x_{t-1}$ (or further differences as it may be), to remove trend, as you noted.
