URI fragment identifiers are client-side only, and are not sent over to the server, i.e., if you inspect the HTTP request header, you will not see #_fragment. Additionally, making changes to the URI that only modify the fragment will not trigger any DOM events. While there are workarounds like using a setInterval() call to actively monitor the document.location.hash property, the easiest thing is to simply change the query string arg. For example, instead of: window.location = mywebsite.com/#_fragment include a query string component like: window.location = mywebsite.com/?refresh=1#_fragment The presence of the "?refresh=1" (or any other key/value pair) will cause the browser to make a request to the server, while preserving the #hash identifier.
