I think it is a far question, since we should always try to translate any metric result to a useful interpretation. When talking about regression, we can judge the success of our model by checking whether that MAE or RMSE exceed what we are willing to accept . For instance, if we want to predict the temperature for the next days, and our result (in this case in a time series problem type) is a MAE of about 2ºC (after re-scaling our data to the natural units like celsius degrees), is it enough for our goal? Is a mean (absolute) error of 2ºC above or below the real temperature enough for the case being studied? Maybe it is for an approximate model, but maybe it is not a good result if we want to use it in an environment where tempreature could have more impact on whatever being studied... Another additional chance you have is estimating confidence intervals ( see this answer ) for your model coefficents and, more precisely, prediction intervals (see this other validated answer ) to have an estimate for your prediction together with an interval.
