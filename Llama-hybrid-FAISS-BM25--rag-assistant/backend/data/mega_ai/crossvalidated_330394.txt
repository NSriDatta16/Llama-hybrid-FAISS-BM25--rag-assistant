I found part of the answer I was looking for in this post: Combining probabilities/information from different sources Googling based on that has given me what I think I need, which is the Inverse Variance Weighted Mean: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-variance_weighting Instead of n repeated measurements with one instrument, if the experimenter makes n of the same quantity with n different instruments with varying quality of measurements... Each random variable is weighted in inverse proportion to its variance. The inverse-variance weighted average seems very straightforward to calculate and as a bonus has the least variance among all weighted averages. I realize I've found the answer to my own question, but wouldn't have got there without you Cross Validated. Thanks
