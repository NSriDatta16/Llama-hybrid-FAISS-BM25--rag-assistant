High SRMR despite good fit based on other indices in SEM (latent growth curve)

Context : Latent Growth Curve Modeling for continuous variable with 15 time points. One intercept , two slopes (for first and second half of all time points). N=146, >90% data coverage, MLR estimator in MPlus, no covariates. Problem : High SRMR=0.20 despite good fit based on other indices: chi-square goodness of fit p=.08, RMSEA=0.04, CFI/TLI=0.97. My beginner's attempt : There is one time point where standardized residual z-score for the mean is significant (freeing that time point didn't help resolving this problem), and another time point that had large and significant z-score for standardized correlation residuals with other time points, the combination of the two might have driven SRMR high?? Question : I can't think of any theoretical reason why this is happening... would this affect the overall interpretation of the model? What can I do to fix it?
