From the little i know your question following will help you. You want some validation which should check when you creating object and not when you update it. use validate_on_create and validate_on_update methods for that class Garage has_many :cars def validate_on_create if cars.count == 0 errors.add_to_base("needs at least one car") end end end class Car belongs_to :garage end Hope that helps :) EDITED What you are using to delete the object destroy or delete when you are using 'delete' no callbacks are get fire off when you are using 'destroy' all callbacks and filters are fired off before the object is deleted. so check and use 'destroy'
