The SL4 framework has very powerful animation and storyboard features, but no transitions concepts built in. However the Silverlight Toolkit, which is developed by Microsoft, has a TransitioningContentControl: http://silverlight.codeplex.com/ This will provide nice transitions as you change the content which it contains. See the following tutorial: http://jesseliberty.com/2009/04/29/animated-visual-state-transitions-with-the-transitioning-content-control/
