jQuery UI - dropped element -> from which div was it dragged

I have a problem with jQuery UI and get some information of a dropped item. I have three areas on the screen: In these areas, I put elements which are draggable with jQuery UI. Now if an element is dropped from one to another area, I will not only get the area number in which the element is dropped to, I also want the area number where the element was dropped before the new drop. I created a full working example: http://jsbin.com/iyaya3/ There is a blue draggable element and if I drag it from area1 to area2, I want to have the alert message with "dragged from area1 - dropped to area2". How can this be done? Best Regards, Tim-.
