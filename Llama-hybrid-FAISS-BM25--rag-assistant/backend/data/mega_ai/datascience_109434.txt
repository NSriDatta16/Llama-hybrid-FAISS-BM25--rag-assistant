The term 'deep' in deep learning is not well defined, but is generally meant to apply to networks that have stacked multiple layers on top of each other to create a deep network. It is therefore up for debate when a network is considered deep or not, but you could use the definition that a deep network has two or more hidden layers. From your overview, examples of non-deep networks would therefore be the perceptron and simple feed forward network. The activations used in the network have no relation to whether a model is deep or not as it only relates to the number of layers in the network.
