The cross correlation and covariance functions are used to tell if there is a correlation between two time series, often ofset by some lead or lag as one time series leads the other and the correlation comes from some later time period in the response time series. environmental time series, for example often have this lead/lag relationship where some cause (i.e. temperature change) leads to a correlated time series that lags it (i.e. growth of some type of tree). The CCF can be helpful is showing which time series leads and which lags each other which is often helpful for prediction. The definition of CCF is: Cross Covariance Func: $\gamma_{x,y}(s,t) = Cov(X_s,Y_t) E[(X_s-\mu_x(s))(Y_t-\mu_y(t))]$ Cross Correlation Func: $\rho_{x,y}(s,t) = \frac{\gamma_{x,t}(s,t)}{\sqrt{\gamma_x(s,s)\gamma_y(t,t)}}$ Here's the vignette from R to calculate CCF: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/acf.html And here is it for matlab: http://www.mathworks.com/help/econ/crosscorr.html Here's an idea of what the output looks like: You can also print out a vector of as many lags as you like to see what the correlation actually is numerically between the two series at different lag points. Like I said up top, if you can see which series leads which, and by how many lags, a regression model with lagged observations from the predictor can be produced. $Y_t = X_{t-1} + \epsilon$ Hope this helps. Let me know if this isn't what you were looking for.
