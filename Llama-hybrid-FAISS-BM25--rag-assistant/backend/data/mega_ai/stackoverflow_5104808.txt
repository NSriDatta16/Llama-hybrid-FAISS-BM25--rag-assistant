Elegant solution to no javascript

So I have created a jquery dropdown which looks nice but now I need to handle the noscript users. With Javascript turned off my div is still there and is also displays the alternative bog standard select box. I am looking for an elegant solution to remove all jquery enalbled content, (with css?) and replace them with more baisc HTML.
