Pulling data asynchronously from third-party web service on Windows Azure Platform

I want to pull large amount of data, frequently from different third party API web services and store it in a staging area (this is what I want to decide right now) from where it will be then moved one by one as required into my application's database. I wanted to know that can I use Azure platform to achieve the above? How good is it to use Azure platform for this task? What if the data to be pulled is of large amount and the frequency of the pull is high i.e. may be half-hourly or hourly for 2,000 different users? I assume that if at all this is possible, then the bandwidth, data storage and server capability etc. will not be a thing to worry for me but for Â©Microsoft. And obviously, I should be able to access the data back whenever I need it. If I would have to implement it on Windows Servers, then I know that I would use a windows service to do this. But I don't know how it can be done for Windows Azure Platform if at all it is possible?
