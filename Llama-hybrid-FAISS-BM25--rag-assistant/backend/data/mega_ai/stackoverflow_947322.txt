Hold the recurring item in the events table as normal, but flagged as recurring with the appropriate start/ end dates. If the user modifies a single instance of the appointment, just create a new event, perhaps with a 'parentId' equal to the recurring event's id. Build logic that causes the calendar to override any recurring events on a particular day with events with matching parent IDs. Your question about performance is basically the old speed vs. storage issue. I really don't think the calculation required would exceed the space requirement for storing so many appointments. Just read up on database optimization- indexing etc.
