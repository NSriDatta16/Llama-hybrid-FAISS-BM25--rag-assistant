Is there a fast way to verify y is actually the output of a model on an input?

I have a deep learning model M with set random seed. For a pair (x,y) I want to verify M(x) == y without actually doing the inference process itself because it takes too long. Is there a way to do this? The situation is that I give a client the model M. He will run M(x) with arbitrary x and send (x, M(x)) back. I want to check that he actually ran the model and not just sent some made up value. I also don't want to hire another client to cross-check. The client could include some extra information to the result and not just x and M(x). This seems to be somewhat related to proof as in blockchain's proof-of-work.
