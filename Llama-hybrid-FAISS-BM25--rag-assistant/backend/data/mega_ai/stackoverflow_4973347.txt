What are common technical problems when splitting one Java EE application into multiple war files?

I read a lot about problems when deploying one Java EE application as multiple WAR files. For instance, I know that each WAR has its own session context and therefore keeping state is a little bit tricky. And that there are organizational disadvantages when using exploded WARs. But to make a mature decision about splitting an application or not, knowledge of all technical disadventages would be helpful. Could you list them?
