These are two names for the same thing. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is called a lot of different names. I have seen canonical discriminant analysis canonical linear discriminant analysis descriptive discriminant analysis (see What is "Descriptive Discriminant Analysis"? ) Fisher's discriminant analysis and possibly some others. I suspect different names might be used in different applied fields. In machine learning, "linear discriminant analysis" is by far the most standard term and "LDA" is a standard abbreviation. The reason for the term "canonical" is probably that LDA can be understood as a special case of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Specifically, the "dimensionality reduction part" of LDA is equivalent to doing CCA between the data matrix $\mathbf X$ and the group indicator matrix $\mathbf G$. The indicator matrix $\mathbf G$ is a matrix with $n$ rows and $k$ columns with $G_{ij}=1$ if $i$-th data point belongs to class $j$ and zero otherwise. [Footnote: this $\mathbf G$ should not be centered.] This fact is not at all obvious and has a proof, which this margin is too narrow to contain.
