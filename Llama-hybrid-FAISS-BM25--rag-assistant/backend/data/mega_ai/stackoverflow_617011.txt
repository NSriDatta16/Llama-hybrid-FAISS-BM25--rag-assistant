Anyone know a source for translated Time Zone descriptions?

Does anyone know of a compiled list of translations for the time zone names in Windows? I need all 75 or so of them in German, French and Spanish. Alternatively, how would I use .Net to compile such a list? Example format: (GMT+01:00) Belgrade, Bratislava, Budapest, Ljubljana, Prague
