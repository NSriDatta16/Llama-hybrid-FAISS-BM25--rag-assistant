Thanks! I think I found way to remove (or add) meta information to office documents. There is a Microsoft article here: The Dsofile.dll files lets you edit Office document properties when you do not have Office installed (KB 224351) The Dsofile.dll sample file is an in-process ActiveX component for programmers that use Microsoft Visual Basic .NET or the Microsoft .NET Framework. You can use this in your custom applications to read and to edit the OLE document properties that are associated with Microsoft Office files, such as the following: Microsoft Excel workbooks Microsoft PowerPoint presentations Microsoft Word documents Microsoft Project projects Microsoft Visio drawings Other files that are saved in the OLE Structured Storage format The Dsofile.dll sample file is written in Microsoft Visual C++. The Dsofile.dll sample file demonstrates how to use the OLE32 IPropertyStorage interface to access the extended properties of OLE structured storage files. The component converts the data to Automation friendly data types for easier use by high level programming languages such as Visual Basic 6.0, Visual Basic .NET, and C#. The Dsofile.dll sample file is given with full source code and includes sample clients written in Visual Basic 6.0 and Visual Basic .NET 2003 (7.1).
