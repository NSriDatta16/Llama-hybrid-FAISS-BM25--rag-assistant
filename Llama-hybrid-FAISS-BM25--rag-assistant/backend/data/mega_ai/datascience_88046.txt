Image Dataset for course project

I am currently studying a machine learning course and now we are asked (each student) to find an image dataset to work on for the course project. I am new to ML and it has been a week and I am trying to find a good dataset (easy and not complicated) to work on, but all I found are ones for tough topics such as lung cancer detection, plant disease detection,... etc. So please someone help me to locate a good one for a beginner.
