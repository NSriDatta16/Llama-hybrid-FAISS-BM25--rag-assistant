To handle exception with every form or just at main

I have a question about handling exception. I have a Winform that uses a webservice proxy on each form for data retrieval and processing. Here is where I really got confused and having a long time deciding which is better. A. For each call in the web service do a try catch to display the error message and allow the user to re try the process by clicking the button again. B. Since the error occurred on the web-service and the error was probably because the web service was inaccessible, just make a generic try catch in the WinMain function in the Program.cs and show an error message that web service is inaccessible before the application closes. The main argument in this is A is more user friendly but needs a lot of try catch code. B is easier to code but just lets the application ends. I am leaning on A but am trying to search the net with options how to lessen the code needed to be written to do this. Any ideas there?
