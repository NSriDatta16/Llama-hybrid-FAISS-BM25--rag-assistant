No. C++03 is aligned with ANSI C89/ISO C90, not C99. The upcoming C++0x standard is expected to be aligned to some degree with C99. See paragraph 17.6.1.2 in the current draft which lists ccomplex , cinttypes , cstdint etc. Note that, as AProgrammer mentions, some headers aren't exactly the same; further, that the header cuchar is aligned with the C Technical Report 19769 rather than C99.
