It really depends on which "average" you mean when you say "average". If you specify unambiguously what quantity you need, it will be clear which calculation to do. My expectation (ahem) is that you probably mean "total cost"/"total kg". That's generally what people need more often, and usually what people intend by the term 'average' in this situation, at least if not accompanied by further explanation. It's also (sometimes) known as a 'volume-weighted average'.
