In terms of open source, Pentaho BI Suite is probably the best open source BI suite I've come across and they have the Pentaho Dashboard Designer which is aimed at the power user (so non tech users can use it). I've deployed Pentaho in several medium organisations and have had power users designing reports and dashboards through the implementation period with little troubles (providing some initial training is given). Depending on the format and size of your DWH, you might also find that Excel (assuming you already have licenses) can provide pretty decent drag-and-drop dashboards as well.
