Reading up books on neuron models is a good start, but it may not be the best way to start your journey to be an expert in probability and statistics. Some of the concepts in that area may leave you challenged. A better approach is to pick up something simpler and work your way up.

There is also online course material that covers a lot, but you still need some background learning. e.g. http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/
