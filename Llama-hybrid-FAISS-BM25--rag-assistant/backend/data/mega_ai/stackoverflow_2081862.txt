How do I match unicode characters in antlr

I am trying to pick out all tokens in a text and need to match all Ascii and Unicode characters, so here is how I have laid them out. fragment CHAR : ('A'..'Z') | ('a'..'z'); fragment DIGIT : ('0'..'9'); fragment UNICODE : '\u0000'..'\u00FF'; Now if I write my token rule as: TOKEN : (CHAR|DIGIT|UNICODE)+; I get "Decision can match input such as "'A'..'Z'" using multiple alternatives: 1, 3 As a result, alternative(s) 3 were disabled for that input" " Decision can match input such as "'0'..'9'" using multiple alternatives: 2, 3 As a result, alternative(s) 3 were disabled for that input" And nothing gets matched: And also if I write it as TOKEN : (UNICODE)+; Nothing gets matched. Is there a way of doing this.
