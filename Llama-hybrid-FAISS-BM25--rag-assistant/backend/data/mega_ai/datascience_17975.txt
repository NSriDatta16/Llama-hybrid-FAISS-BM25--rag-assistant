Standard PCA only sees your data as real values and hence doesn't really provide the best low rank approximation. There exist versions of PCA designed for boolean data types. Personally I think the best paper covering the whole broad topic of generalised PCA is Generalized Low Rank Models . In section 5.2 they specifically cover Boolean PCA.
