Create setup for Outlook 2010 Add-in

I have created a outlook add-in and need to create a setup to make it distributable (i am new to this so pls excuse the novice comments ) Outlook -2010 Vs -2010 .Net 4.0 I read some where ,the easiest way to do this would be to just publish. And yes it was that easy. The setup was created and i could install. The catch ,was that in systems which did not have .net 4.0 (or maybe VS 2010), the setup began installing the framework first (which is good .. :)) on restarting system (on complete installation of 4.0). When user tries to install the setup it gives error saying : the following solution cannnot be loaded because Microsoft Office support for the .Net framework 4.0 is not installed The users machine had Outlook 2010 and framework 3.5 initially. I checked and 4.0 client was installed (33 MB approx).
