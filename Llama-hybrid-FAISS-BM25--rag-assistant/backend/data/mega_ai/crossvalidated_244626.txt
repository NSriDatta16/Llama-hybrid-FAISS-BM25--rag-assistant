Controlling variables for different kind of measures

I would like to test group differences for further measures controlling for other variables. However, the measures are from different types : - continuous variables - discrete positive variables (some with a lot of zeros) - dichotomous variables - nominal variables For continuous variables, it is easy, I use linear regression analysis. As for dichotomous variables, I use logistic regression. But for others? For discrete positive variables, do I use Poisson regression models (and zero-inflated models for measures with a lot of zeros)? For nominal variables, do I use multinomial logistic regression? Or is there something I don't understand in controlling variables?
