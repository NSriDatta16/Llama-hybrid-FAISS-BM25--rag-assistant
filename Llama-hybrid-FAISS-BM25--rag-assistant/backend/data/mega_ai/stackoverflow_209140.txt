Based on my experience, I would say the key features of Scrum are: High visibility of progress. Regular feedback from customer. Predictable rhythm. Measurable productivity (via burndown, velocity, etc.). Cross-functional, self-organising teams. Inspect and adapt. Low bureaucratic overhead (meetings, documentation, etc.). Emphasis on face-to-face communication. And these features lead to the following benefits : Project can respond easily to change. Problems are identified early. Customer gets most beneficial work first. Work done will better meet the customers needs. Improved productivity. Ability to maintain a predictable schedule for delivery.
