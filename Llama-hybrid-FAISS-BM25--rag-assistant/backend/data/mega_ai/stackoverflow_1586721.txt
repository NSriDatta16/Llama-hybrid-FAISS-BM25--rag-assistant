Implement find(), save() ActiveRecord methods for ActiveMerchant CreditCard object

What's the best way to implement ActiveRecord's find() and save() methods for an ActiveMerchant ActiveMerchant::Billing::CreditCard object in a Ruby on Rails application? I'd like my credit card objects to inherit from ActiveRecord and ActiveMerchant. Caveat: I understand that saving credit card information to a database is always considered a bad idea, and that it's preferable to use a gateway that facilitates card storage for you. Presume that it's necessary and that suitable security standards are being met (PCI DSS, filesystem and database encryption, network separation etc).
