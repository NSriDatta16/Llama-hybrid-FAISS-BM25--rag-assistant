I use two different techniques for projecting all the data points in an n -dimensional space down onto two dimensions: PCA or MDS (multidimensional scaling). I use PCA if I have an n -dimensional vector that corresponds to each data point. I use MDS if it's more convenient to generate a distance matrix than exact n -dimensional locations of individual items. Once the points are projected into 2-space use color and/or shape to illustrate the clusters. If you have a sparsely-connected distance matrix ( i.e. , most of the entries have no distance and are unconnected), then you could present the data as a sparsely-connected undirected graph. There are hundreds of appropriate graph-layout algorithms you could use. This method isn't terribly useful for identifying the structure of the clusters, but it does at least give you a pretty picture of all your points.
