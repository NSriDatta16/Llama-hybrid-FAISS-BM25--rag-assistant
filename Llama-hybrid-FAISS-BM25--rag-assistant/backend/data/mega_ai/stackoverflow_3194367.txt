Reading MS word file in C# with comments

Currently i have a word document with comments added. The structure of the document is specified in the comment. The document contains embedded images. Now i need to structurally read the document based on the comments and create a html file. The problem is i cant capture the embedded image information currently. Comments comments = doc.Comments; foreach (Comment comment in comments) { String text = comment.Range.Text; String actualText = comment.Scope.Text; } Can someone please help in capturing the embedded images. Also i need the exact "html" format of the document. Currently the text appears plain without any paragraph information.
