That message has to do with the way IE handles pages generated from POST data. In general, to avoid this problem you have to make sure that in the back history, the user will never be able to land on a page that was generated from a POST request. As jspcal suggested, your POST response should be a redirect to another page requested by a GET. This is also considered best-practice since it reduces the risk of submitting a form twice.
