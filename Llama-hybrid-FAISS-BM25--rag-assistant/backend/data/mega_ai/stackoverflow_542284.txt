Preventing webform resubmission on browser refresh without losing viewstate

Duplicate: How can I prevent database being written to again when the browser does a reload/back? Is there a nice elegant way to stop an .aspx page from resubmitting form data if the user requests a refresh from their browser? Ideally without losing the viewstate. EDIT: The most elegant solution for me turned out to be wrapping the relevant controls in an asp.net ajax UpdatePanel. Ta everyone.
