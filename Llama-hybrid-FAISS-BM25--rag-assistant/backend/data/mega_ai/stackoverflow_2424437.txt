match and replace using php

I have a html file that contains urls that start with ftps, http, https, mms, ed2k.. and in certain paragraphs. I need to sort these links and remove all the links that start with mms://. I tried preg_replace but it doesnt work coz many links are too long. can someone suggest a good method to remove the links using php?
