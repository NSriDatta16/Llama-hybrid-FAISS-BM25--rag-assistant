Changing property of multiple ASP.NET controls in one operation

I was wondering whether in ASP.NET it is possible to change properties of bunch of controls in one operation. Of course there are probably many ways around this, but does anybody know an elegant solution to this? Example pseudo-code First Name Last Name protected void ChageMode(bool isReadOnly) { ControlGroups["Editable"].ForEach(c => c.Visible = !isReadOnly); ControlGroups["ReadOnly"].ForEach(c => c.Visible = isReadOnly); }
