jquery: draggable plugin -> remove drag behaviour from html5 video controls?

im working with the jquery ui draggable plugin and i have an html 5 video element with "preload controls" that acts kind of buggy. I $(".thumb").draggable(); if i drag the video by clicking on the video controls and i'm releasing the mouse again, the video still sticks with the mouse. i have no chance to release the video again if i started draggin it at the video controls. any idea how i could fix this! i probaply should script my own video controls to fix this.
