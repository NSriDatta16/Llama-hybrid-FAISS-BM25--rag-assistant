Deep learning is a general term for dealing with a complicated neural network with multiple layers. There is no standard definition of what exactly is deep . Usually, you can think a deep network is something that is too big for your laptop and PC to train. The data set would be so huge that you can't fit it into your memory. You might need GPU to speed up your training. Deep is more like a marketing term to make something sounds more professional than otherwise. CNN is a type of deep neural network, and there are many other types. CNNs are popular because they have very useful applications to image recognition.
