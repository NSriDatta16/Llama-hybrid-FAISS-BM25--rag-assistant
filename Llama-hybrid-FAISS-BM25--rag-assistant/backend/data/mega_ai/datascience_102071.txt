If you want to predict an integer/float, you would need Regression models and if you want to separate into categories you would need Classification models. Since you need to predict price go for Regression models. There are many Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, KNNRegressor, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting models and much more. Now you can create these models in either R language or Python. (I would suggest Python as it is more widely used and has much more libraries than R but its up to you). After selecting the language of your choice, you can do a course on Machine Learning (depends if you are familiar with ML or not). Then start with a simple model (Linear Regression) and then build your way up to the more complex ones like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. As far as software is considered, you just need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where you will type the code and execute it. Do let me know if you have further doubts!
