The short answer is that, usually, autocorrelation does not impact the estimates of coefficients, but impacts the variances. That's why he's saying that point forecasts will not change, but confidences will. Also, in time series regression the residuals are almost always correlated. In other words in a model $y_t=X_t\beta+\varepsilon_t$ , where $\varepsilon_t$ is ARIMA, if you ignore autocorrelation in $\varepsilon_t$ , then your $\hat\beta$ are still Ok, but their p-values and variances $\hat\sigma^2_\beta$ can be messed up. Thus the quip on the point forecast $\hat y_{t+h}=X_{t+h}\hat\beta$ being Ok. He was careful to say "should still be ok," making it not absolute statement, but more of a practical advice, with which I agree. Non zero mean is difficult to detect, because out of regression by construction the residuals will come with zero (unconditional) mean. Non zero mean error is an issue, of course, but it's more subtle than many think. Here's how it's expressed in conditional terms: $E[\varepsilon|X]=0$ . One situation that violates this condition is when errors' mean varies with predictors. For instance, you overestimate for large values of predicted $\hat y$ and underestimates for small values. This is why it's recommended to plot residuals vs predicted chart.
