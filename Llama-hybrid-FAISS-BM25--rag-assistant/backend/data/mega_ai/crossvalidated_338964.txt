You might consider using a dominance analysis instead (see Luchman, 2014 ). This approach would decompose the McFadden's R2 and might, as a consequence, be easier to interpret than the utility-based approach discussed here. That would avoid the 4th categorical value issue and would scale to 100 if standardized based on the McFadden R2. The dominance method is implemented in the R package relaimpo , but has not been extended to accommodate mlogits. The only version I know of that does is in Stata. That said, dominance analysis is not a terribly difficult method to implement. To do so, collect all McFadden's R2's according to each possible subset including or omitting each predictor (in your case 2^5 - 1 different models) and average them as in the linked article (note: the gives some examples along which to follow).
