Bayesian ROPE (region of practical equivalence) for simultaneous comparison of multiple parameters?

I very much like the idea of the ROPE (region of practical equivalence) (e.g. see here ), where you compute the posterior probability that a given parameter is in a previous range that counts as "small" in subject-area terms. (This is not a substitute-for-a-hypothesis-rejection-procedure question; in the particular context I'm working on, the authors want specifically to test for equivalence.) As I have seen it, the ROPE is a univariate procedure, i.e. testing the marginal posterior distribution of some particular parameter. Does any discussion of a multivariate version exist? I can think of some crude approaches (e.g. test for the simultaneous satisfaction of a bunch of univariate ROPEs — probability of being inside a specified 'rectangular' region — or some kind of sum-of-squares/Mahalanobis variant) but am hoping not to reinvent any wheels. (I do see that there are some papers on frequentist multivariate equivalence testing, e.g. Hoffelder et al 2015, perhaps these could be adapted ...)
