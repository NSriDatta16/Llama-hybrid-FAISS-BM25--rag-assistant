Shortcode inside shortcode not working in Wordpress?

I need to add shortcodes such as image , hr and button . However, I also needed to remove the wpautop filter ( remove_filter('the_content','wpautop') ) for hr to work properly. Now, to manually set paraghraps I set a shortcode p to simply convert [p]text[/p] with text . But, inside [p /] the other shortcodes aren't working. I guess that it modifies the content. Here's my simple function: function p_func($atts,$content) { return ' '.$content.' '; } add_shortcode('p','p_func'); I'm getting a bit nervous with this, as my functions.php seems to be full of hacks already. Any advice? Martti Laine
