Use logistic regression. That gives you an estimated probability for membership, not a hard classification. Then, if you need a crisp decision at a later point, use a loss function based on real (say, economic) losses from wrong decisions. There are many similar posts, for instance How does logistic regression "elegantly" handle unbalanced classes? Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? Proper scoring rule when there is a decision to make (e.g. spam vs ham email)
