d sequel At the conclusion of the competition, Netflix announced a planned sequel. It would present contestants with demographic and behavioral data, including renters' ages, gender, ZIP codes, genre ratings and previously chosen movies, but not ratings. The task is to predict which movies those people will like. There would be no specific accuracy target for winning the prize. Instead, $500,000 would be awarded to the team in the lead after 6 months, and another $500,000 to the leader after 18 months. On March 12, 2010, Netflix announced that it would not pursue a second Prize competition that it had announced the previous August. The decision was in response to a lawsuit and Federal Trade Commission privacy concerns. Some participants, such as Volinsky, expressed disappointment about the cancellation. Privacy concerns Although the data sets were constructed to preserve customer privacy, the Prize has been criticized by privacy advocates. In 2007 two researchers from The University of Texas at Austin (Vitaly Shmatikov and Arvind Narayanan) were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database. On December 17, 2009, four Netflix users filed a class action lawsuit against Netflix, alleging that Netflix had violated U.S. fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets. There was public debate about privacy for research participants. On March 19, 2010, Netflix reached a settlement with the plaintiffs, after which they voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit.
