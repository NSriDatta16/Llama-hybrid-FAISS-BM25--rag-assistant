WCF Load Test should be the right tool, however it seem to require Visual Studio Team System . I cannot confirm as the installer didn't work properly on my office machine. wcfstorm seem also to do the job but it's not free (the lite version doesn't seem to have the load testing feature). So far the best was to create it myself. Using some Stopwatch(), using an one threads per client. By varying the number of threads and the frequency of the calls I could get the average response time for example.
