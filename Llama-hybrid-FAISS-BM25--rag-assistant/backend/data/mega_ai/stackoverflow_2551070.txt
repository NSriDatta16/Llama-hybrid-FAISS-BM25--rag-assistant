Let's point out some obvious things. --1 = query when ran alone takes 100+ seconds --2 = query when ran alone takes 19 seconds A full table scan on a USER table should not take 19 seconds. A full table scan on a USER_ROLE table should not take over 100 seconds, even if it has tens of millions of rows. Of course, if you really do have twenty million users then those timings are slightly less unreasonable but still not acceptable. You need to understand why it takes your system so long to do simple look-ups. An EXPLAIN PLAN will hope us understand the joins but that won't solve your core problem: why does it take so long to retrieve the USER_ROLE data? Is it a complicated view? Does it have hundreds of millions of queries? Do you have an index on PARTICIPANT_CODE which is not helpful to this query? What about other queries using these tables? Are they problematic as well? If so, you need to investigate more. Either the system is taking too long to do something or it is waiting too on some resource. What you need to do is run a 10046 trace against this query and establish where the time is going. This trace will report on the wait events for your session. That will give you some decent information on which to proceed. It is much better than guessing. Oracle has exposed the Wait Interface since 9i. Roger Schrag wrote a pretty decent introduction. Read it now . (If you're on 10g or higher you should also read his follow-up article ).
