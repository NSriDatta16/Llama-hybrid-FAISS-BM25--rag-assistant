Characterizing trend of time series in R

I have a fairly basic statistics application question. Lets say I have a set of four fold-change values, representing the abundance of a factor as it passes through four consecutive time points: x And I want to define its "trend" ie, a single-number representation of how it acts during the entirety of the time course. In the example given, x has a general increasing trend. I have tried using trendlines, but I get a lot of over-generalization of the trend, and my info is lost. Is there a more-informative solution to defining a "trend" of values as they pass through a time series?
