Your graph does not have the classical "funnel" shape that one would expect to see in the presence of heteroscedasticity where there is clearly an uneven variance across residuals. The Breusch-Pagan test is a go-to test for heteroscedasticity, and a p-value of 0.040 warrants further investigation. If you are using R, one potential course of action would be to implement a Box-Cox transformation on the data and then generate a QQ plot as well as a plot of residuals vs. fitted values to determine whether variance has become constant as a result of the transformation. Of course, you could also run the Breusch-Pagan test once again to determine whether the p-value becomes insignificant across the transformed data. I suggest referring to the following for further information: R-bloggers: How to detect heteroscedasticity and rectify it? As a final caveat, the source of the heteroscedasticity will also be significantly dependent on your data and model, as a previous comment alluded to - this should factor in to your decision as to what steps you should take following heteroscedasticity testing.
