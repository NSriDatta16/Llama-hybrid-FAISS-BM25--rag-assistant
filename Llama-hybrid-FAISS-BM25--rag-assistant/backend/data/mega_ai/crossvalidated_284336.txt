Averaging over differently-scaled variables can be accomplished with the geometric mean. As you point out, the arithmetic mean of several variables (which is proportional to the sum) is dominated by the "large" variables. If you have one metric that scores in the range 1 to 10 and another that score from 1 to 1,000,000, the first one will be totally insignificant in calculating the total. The geometric mean fixes this, such that a 50% increase in the first variable will result in the same change in mean as a 50% increase in the second variable, regardless of the scale of those variables. It is effectively performing averaging over the percentage change, rather than the absolute magnitude of the change. This is a simple but effective way to combine variables that are on different scales.
