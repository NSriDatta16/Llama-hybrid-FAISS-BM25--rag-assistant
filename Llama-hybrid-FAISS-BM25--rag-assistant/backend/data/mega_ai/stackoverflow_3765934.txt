Does it make sense to add more cluster nodes to an underutilized server?

Let's say I'm running a cluster with two Weblogic server nodes on two servers (Solaris, 4 CPUs, 64 GB RAM each). The heap size is maxed out on these nodes and so each server runs with 40+ GB of free memory most of the time and each server usually has on average 30% CPU utilization. Assuming that the application scales horizontally properly, does it make sense to add more application server nodes on the same hardware to take advantage of underutilized resources? The 2 GB JVM heap limit really limits the maximum number of requests that can be served by one node, right?
