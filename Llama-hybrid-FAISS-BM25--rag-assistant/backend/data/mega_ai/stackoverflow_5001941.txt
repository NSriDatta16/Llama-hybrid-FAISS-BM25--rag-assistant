You are dynamically embedding a youtube video by swfobject. You need an element with id ytapiplayer that will "wrap" the video. Basically, you have to say to swfobject where to load the swf => http://jsfiddle.net/steweb/czEF9/ swfobject.embedSWF("SWFURL","elementID", "width", "height", "8", null, null, params, atts); elementID is the id of your DOM element (it MUST exists) ;)
