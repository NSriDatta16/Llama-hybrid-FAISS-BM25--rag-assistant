Problems with special characters in php soap client

I have a problem related to this question . I have a web service (also using php) that returns some names. When any of them contains Swedish characters (å, ä or ö) and probably others as well i get a soapfault (looks like we got no XML document). I can however see the full (correct afaik) response using $soapcalo->__getLastResponse(). How do I handle the special characters? I have tried adding the encoding attribute (utf-8) on both client and server but without success. Edit: Excerpt of the soap reply: success VIB09SLA9EP Patrik Stenstr&ouml;m Thanks!
