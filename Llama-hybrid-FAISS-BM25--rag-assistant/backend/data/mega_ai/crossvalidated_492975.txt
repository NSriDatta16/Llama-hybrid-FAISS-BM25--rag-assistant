If you can assume normality, which means that the distribution is determined by $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , it is better to estimate these values (e.g. by means of the bootstrap) and base the confidence intervals on these estimators, i.e. $\mu\pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\sigma$ ). If you cannot assume normality, your approach of simply taking the percentiles of the bootstraped computations of the observable is perfectly valid and known as the (non-parametric) percentile bootstrap interval . This method does not assume normality of the parameter distribution, but for unsymmetric distributions, there are examples where this confidence interval does not have a good coverage probability for smaller $n$ . The $BC_a$ bootsrap interval ("bias corrected accelerated") compensates for this and typically has better coverage probability in such cases. Out of curiosity, I had made Monte Carlo simulations to compare the different (non-parametric) bootstrap intervals, and the $BC_a$ bootstrap interval indeed had much faster convergence to the nominal coverage probability (see figures 7(a) and 8(a)): Dalitz: " Construction of confidence intervals.
