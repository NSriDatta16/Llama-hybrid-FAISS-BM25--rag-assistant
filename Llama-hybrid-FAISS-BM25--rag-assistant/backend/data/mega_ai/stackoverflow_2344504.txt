I have a test app with an SD card, so I added your second line to it and it ran fine: File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "tmp.jpg"); Are you sure you created the card correctly, and assuming you're using Eclipse, did you tell Eclipse about the card (-sdcard \sdcard.iso)?
