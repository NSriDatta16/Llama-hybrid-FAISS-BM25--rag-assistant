Let me add some more possibilities: The general idea is that setting a threshold to the distance from the class enables you to decide whether a sample belongs into that class or not, and regardless of whether there are other classes or not. Mahalanobis-Distance => QDA SIMCA (Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogies) uses distances in PCA score space. SIMCA is common in the chemometric literature (though seldom really set up in a one-class way). (SVMs are already treated in @Marc Claesen's answer) Richard G. Brereton: Chemometrics for Pattern Recognition (Wiley, 2009) has a whole chapter about one-class classification.
