How to setup public git repositories?

I recently tried to setup git repo on a linux box and wasted about 10 hours with absolutely no results. There aren't any problems with compilation or anything like that, it's just configuration issue. 2 hours later I got mercurial to do everything i need: public repos web ui push/pull with per-user permissions (not tied to linux accounts) Everything that I can see about git assumes that you are either just running it locally, using github or already have everything setup. I'm either not looking for the right keywords or there just no or very little info on the subject. I do want to try git, but setting it up is a very discouraging experience. Can anyone point to something useful in these terms? thank you!
