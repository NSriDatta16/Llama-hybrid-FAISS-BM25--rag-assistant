Compare variance across time

I have an analysis question. Unfortunately my biostats collaborator is no longer involved in the project. We have a dataset of n=6 people. the study was terminated early due to covid but we are still required to report results despite the very small number of subjects. For each subject we have measured our variable of interest weekly. Subjects then began a 3-month intervention and continued the weekly survey. We want to know if variability in our outcome changed with the intervention. In our SAP my collaborator wrote, “we will compare weekly variance estimates of variable of interest (frequency of a specific behavior occurring)” to test this question. This is asked by a single question where the subject indicates the number or times the behavior occurred during the past week. This question is asked for 16-weeks. The first 4 are pre intervention, the final 12 weeks are during an intervention. This is the only behavior we are asking about regarding variability/variance. It’s not clear to me how to do this statistically given the repeated measure design.
