I've had a few headaches with SVN when I've reorganized the folder layout from within Visual Studio. A folder moved within a solution will literally move the folder in the filesystem, including the hidden .svn folder. This causes commit problems because the .svn data is associated to the old path and I haven't found a way to reassociate to its new path. SVN clean up runs OK but fixes nothing. SVN switch doesn't allow you to change it after the folder was moved. I've only been able to fix this by deleting all .svn folders within the moved folder and its subfolders, then re-add the folder. The problem I have with this fix is that you lose your version trail on those files because SVN sees it as brand new. Also, it doesn't store the file contents as efficiently by storing the diff from the previous version. Per the SVN documentation, it is recommended to allow the svn client to do all your folder move/create/delete to keep everything in sync for the next commit. This isn't always acceptable from Visual Studio. Fortunately, most problem cases are caught during commit-time, particularly if you use TortoiseSVN.
