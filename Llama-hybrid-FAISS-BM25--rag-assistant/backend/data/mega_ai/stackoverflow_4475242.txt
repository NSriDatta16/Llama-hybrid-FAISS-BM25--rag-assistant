To answer the second part of my own question, both qsvn and rapidsvn can be used to view the logs when I've already checked out a working copy. In qsvn , go to Menu -> Working Copy -> Add. In rapidsvn , go to Menu -> Bookmarks -> Add Existing Working Copy. Viewing the log is much slower than in git, as explained by @Raghuram.
