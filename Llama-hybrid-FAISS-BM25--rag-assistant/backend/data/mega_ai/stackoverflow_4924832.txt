Using FileWriter is one of the easiest ways: File dir = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(new File(dir, "name.txt")); writer.append("Hola\n"); writer.append("Hello\n"); writer.append("Etc...\n"); writer.flush(); writer.close(); This will save the file to the SDCard directory, which is accessible by other applications. Make sure to include the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to your Manifest file.
