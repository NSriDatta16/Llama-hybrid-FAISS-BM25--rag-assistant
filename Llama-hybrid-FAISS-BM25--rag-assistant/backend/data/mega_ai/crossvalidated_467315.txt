Iterations vs k-fold cross validation

I'm new to ANN and deep learning, and I have come across the term k-fold cross-validation , which from my understanding is, when you split your dataset into small parts, to find the best parameters to train your model from your dataset (because obviously, we can't use them all). This concept was a bit confusing to me because it sounded extremely similar to iterations when we talk about training a model. iterations in the sense of We can divide the dataset of 2000 examples into batches of 500 then it will take 4 iterations to complete 1 epoch. Are these concepts similar, and used in different scenarios, or are they completely separated?
