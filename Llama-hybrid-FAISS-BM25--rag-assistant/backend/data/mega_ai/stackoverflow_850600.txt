I think you've set the bubbles attribute to false . This will prevent the event from bubbling up any further than the container it resides in. Try this instead: dispatchEvent(new Event("nextPresentation", true)); Also, regarding organization, I'd make a PresentationEvent class and have SKIP_PREVIOUS and SKIP_NEXT event constants on them. This is more consistent with the event model that ActionScript uses and it cuts down on redundancy. This way you can pass the current presentation and other handy presentation-related data as part of the event.
