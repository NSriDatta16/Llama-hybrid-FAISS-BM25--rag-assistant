While you almost never want to parse the userAgent, I'll assume you're operating against one of those rare weird cases where you do. Parsing userAgents is like one big gotcha, so you're probably best off using an existing library. This code at quirksmode is probably a good starting point: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html . It should give you the major and minor version (3.6), so you will need to modify it if you need the .14.
