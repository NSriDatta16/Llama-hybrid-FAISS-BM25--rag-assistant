Coupling time series information from sources with multiple spatial resolutions/scales

I have many satellite raster images available from different sensors. From these, the coarser ones have a very abundant temporal resolution. The medium resolution rasters tend to have less acquisition dates but still some degree of information is available. The finer resolution ones have a very low temporal resolution, spanning from 2 to 6 observed dates in under two years. I was wondering if anyone knows of any efforts to study this type of multi-scale time series in any way? I would be interested in predicting future values at the finer scales using the information available from the coarser ones. It makes sense to me that the data must be related (yes the images cover the same regions) but I have no idea how to start coupling this information in a predictive model.
