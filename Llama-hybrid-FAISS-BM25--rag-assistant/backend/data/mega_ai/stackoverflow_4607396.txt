Re: encrypting an existing database "Out of curiosity, can a database that was created not encrypted be made so afterwards, when it has all sorts of data in it already?" You can't encrypt an unencrypted database directly. You can change a database's encryption key using the SQLConnection.reencrypt() method, but it only works on already-encrypted databases: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/data/SQLConnection.html#reencrypt () However, as a workaround you can open multiple databases within a single SQLConnection and you can copy data and structure from one to the other. I've actually written a utility class that uses that technique to allow you to encrypt an unencrypted db: https://github.com/probertson/air-sqlite/blob/DB-copy-dev/src/com/probertson/data/DBCopier.as
