 the out-of-control hype that built expectations no game could fulfill. He claimed that while the console versions were panned, reviews for the PC versions "were very positive." Sequel and legacy Despite its critical and commercial failure, Mirage released Rise 2: Resurrection in 1996 as a more conventional fighting game with extended features. The story further expanded upon that of the original game. Originally developed for computer systems, it was also ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, again with little success. Rise 2 features an original song by Brian May entitled "Cyborg." The PC CD-ROM version of the game included two audio CD format versions of the track, along with other music from the game. The European-released Director's Cut edition featured a second CD containing two additional versions of the song, as well as computer-altered sound files of May saying various words and phrases from the game. A newer version of "Cyborg" later appeared on May's 1998 album Another World. Jim Murdoch penned a novelization of Rise of the Robots, which was published on February 2, 1995. It was based on the Rise of the Robots characters created by Sean Griffiths and Kwan Lee. Deck13 Interactive stated that this game and the Dark Souls series inspired The Surge.
