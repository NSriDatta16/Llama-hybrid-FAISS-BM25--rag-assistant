How can I apply Bayesian Statistics when the number of data that I have is 1?

I want to show why Maximum Likelihood Estimation is not the right choice when the number of data that I have only is 1. For example, if I have an observed data which is heads from a coin toss. I only toss the coin once and apply Maximum Likelihood Estimation to get the probability of heads. If I apply Maximum Likelihood Estimation to my observed data, I will get 1 for the probability of heads up, tossing the coin only once. How can I apply my prior experience, the probability of heads up is 0.5, to the situation and calculate the Bayesian way of gettting Maximum Likelihood Estimation which is Maximum a Posterior? I am not sure if I should get the mean of the posterior or the MAP.
