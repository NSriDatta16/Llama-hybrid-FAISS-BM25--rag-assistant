Dealing with Simulink libraries

I have a - maybe very simple - problem: I created my own library and dragged my custom blocks into a new model. After closing my library window my simulation didn't find any of those blocks, because it isn't opended as window. How can I workaround this problem by adding a reference or something similar?
