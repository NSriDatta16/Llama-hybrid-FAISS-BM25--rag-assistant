Books in Statistics

I would like to know a good book in statistics, that would interest me. I have before this spent a lot of time spent studying discrete mathematics and abstract algebra and i love its beauty and elegance. However i am yet to find something of the sort in statistics. Could you give me a few pointers? I had taken an introductory course in probability and statistics(point, interval estimation, confidence intervals and all) and aced the exams but i find it to be pretty boring, mainly formulas. The problems(numericals) in statistics are pretty easy (relative to pure math), at least given in standard books. I have a lot of experience with theoretical mathematics and find it to be very beautiful are there something like this in Statistics? I have already taken a glance across Casella and Berger, but the same thing it isnt intellectually challenging, like real analysis or modern algebra or topology I would like to mention i am a dual CS and Math undergrad and i have a huge interest in theoretical Computer Science in general and algorithms in particular, so that you have an idea of my interests
