Welcome to the Site! Assuming that simple neural network means Single layer Perceptron . I think you need to understand this, a simple neural network with a single hidden layer cannot solve an XOR problem. As they are not Linearly Separable . To overcome this, we use Multi-Layer Perceptron , you can go through this Link for better understanding. Regarding your question with respect weights in Neural Network for solving XOR, please go through this lecture , this video , in the video they explain you how the weights are adjusted in every iteration before getting the solution. If you are stuck somewhere do let me know, will try to help you! Other links: Link-1 Another link suggested by @Yves : Link
