I have good news and bad news. good news you can probably more or less disregard the warnings. Where stepwise regression is recommended at all (see below ...), backward regression is probably better than forward regression anyway. you can do forward and backward stepwise regression with MASS::stepAIC() (instead of step ). bad news step probably isn't doing what you think it's doing anyway. Rather than refitting the negative binomial dispersion parameter, it's re-fitting with a fixed overdispersion parameter, which is probably not what you want (there's a classically snarky e-mail from Prof. Brian Ripley from 2006 here that discusses this issue in passing). As mentioned above, stepAIC() works better. if you are only interested in predictive accuracy , and not in anything about confidence intervals or hypothesis tests or measuring variable importance ... then stepwise regression might be OK (Murtaugh 2009) ... but if you care at all about being able to make any inferences about the effects of the parameters, you have too many variables and not enough data . A rule of thumb is that (1) you need at least 10 times as many data points as predictor variables to do reliable inference and (2) doing any inference after selecting variables (via stepwise selection or otherwise) is very wrong [unless you do super-cutting-edge stuff that only works with huge data sets and very strong assumptions]. The big question here is: why do you want to do variable selection in the first place? you're only interested in prediction : OK, but something like penalized regression (Dahlgren 2010) will probably work better you're interested in inference : this is going to be tough; you almost certainly don't have enough data to tell the effects of correlated variables apart. In your situation I would probably compute the principal components (PCA) of the predictor variables and use only the first 5 (which fall within the $n/10$ rule, and explain 99.5% of the variance in the predictors ...)
