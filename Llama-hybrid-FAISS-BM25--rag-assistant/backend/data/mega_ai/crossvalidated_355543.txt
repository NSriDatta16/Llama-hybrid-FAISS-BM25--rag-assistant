Impact of Data Distribution on Loss Functions' Suitability

I read at a place that mean squared loss doesn't work well with multi-modal data. I had heard that it is also not robust to outliers and Mean absolute error is more robust. How do I choose a loss function? How can I systematically think about choosing my loss function for a regression or classification task. Could you explain what differences are there in the behavior of famous loss functions in regression and classification? What is the impact of multi-modality on the effectiveness of loss functions towards guiding the learning in Machine learning? If data is bimodal, I should not use mean squared loss? What are the tests to derive these kind of conclusions about a particular loss function.
