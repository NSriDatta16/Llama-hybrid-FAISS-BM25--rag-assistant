Penalized Bayesian quantile regression with LASSO and adaptive LASSO penalty

I have some questions about penalized Bayesian quantile regression with LASSO and adaptive LASSO penalty: Would you give me a detailed outline for the formula, especially as used in Bayesian inference? What package in R is easy to use and suitable for this topic? Would you give me R code for running inference Bayesian quantile regression with LASSO penalty?
