Effect size in multiple logistic regression

I have one dummy independent variable, one categorical independent variable with six categories, and two continuous independent variables. The dependent variable is binary (yes/no). The interaction term is defined between the dummy variable and one of the continuous variables. Another interaction term I want to examine is between the two continuous variables themselves. Is it possible to calculate effect sizes in a logistic regression, specifically the effect size of an interaction term in a multiple logistic regression model? I would greatly appreciate your guidance on how to perform this calculation. I'm currently using SPSS for my analysis. Additionally, any references you can provide for the calculation method would be very helpful. Thank you in advance.
