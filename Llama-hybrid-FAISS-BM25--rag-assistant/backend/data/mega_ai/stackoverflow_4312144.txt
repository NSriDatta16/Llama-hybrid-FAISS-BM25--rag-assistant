You can host a Silverlight in any Html file. All you need is to use the embed-tag. There is nothing stopping you from hosting Silverlight on Apache running PHP if you want to, but naturally the default is to host it on IIS. Look at this reply to a related question for an example: embedding silverlight, anything like flash? Edit: I see that you changed your question, so this question may belong on another forum. Any computer able to run IIS will be able to host what you ask for. You will probably go for a server running Windows Server 2008, but the hardware specs depend on what your needs are. You should probably aim low first and add more power as you need it. You may also be interested in using a cloud-based service like Microsofts Azure. It is perfect for hosting an application like yours and it is more or less infinitely scalable.
