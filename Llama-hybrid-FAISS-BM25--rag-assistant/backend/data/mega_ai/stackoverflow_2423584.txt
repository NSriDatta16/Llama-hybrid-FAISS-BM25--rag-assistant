Deleting an Image that has been used by a WPF control

I would like to bind an Image to some kind of control an delete it later on. path = @"c:\somePath\somePic.jpg" FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(path); Uri uri = new Uri(fi.FullName, UriKind.Absolute); var img = new System.Windows.Controls.Image(); img.Source = new BitmapImage(uri); Now after this code I would like to delete the file : fi.Delete(); But I cannot do that since the image is being used now. Between code fragment 1 en 2 what can I do to release it?
