You may find this article very interesting: X/HTML 5 Versus XHTML 2 http://xhtml.com/en/future/x-html-5-versus-xhtml-2/ Since W3C is slow in getting an updated spec and the web is not only fragmenting more, but there are needs that can be met that aren't really possible due to the specs being so old, HTML5 is working toward fixing these, such as the canvas tag and having embedded video/audio. This replaces the very overused tag and Flash having to be used instead. The web has gone beyond just serving up web pages, now we have javascript applications, so now we can have more interactivity than was really possible before due to some of the changes not only from HTML5 but the movement toward a newer version of JavaScript. So, HTML5 should be more than just a markup language as the web applications have gone beyond servers just serving static pages, which is what a markup language was good for.
