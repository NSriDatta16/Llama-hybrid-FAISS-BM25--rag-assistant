Unfortunately the information you provide is not enough to give you a precise answer, but I think I can give you an useful hint. SQL Server allows you to view the query plan it uses uses to access the data; such plan will tell you in detail what is accessed, when, in which way, and how many rows are processed in each step. It also tells you how much time/resource consuming is each step, allowing you to find bottleneck easily. To show the execution plan in Query Analyzer, open the Query Menu and click on "Show Execution Plan". Then run your first query and check the plan; in another window, run the second query and check the plan again. This way you can see what's the difference between them, which indexes (if any) are used and get a better understanding of SQL Server. One hint: don't be discouraged if at the beginning everything seems complicated, it's just a matter of taking it slowly. Finally, an useful resource for SQL Server (other than the MSDN, of course) is www.sqlservercentral.com, where you can find answers from users and experts. I hope this helps.
