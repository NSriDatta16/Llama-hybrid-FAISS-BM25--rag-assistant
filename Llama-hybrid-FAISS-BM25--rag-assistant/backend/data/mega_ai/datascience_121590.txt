I think the Open Data Science Conference ODSC is what you are looking for - industry leaders present some tools that they use in their work. The ones you've listed are research oriented, the material presented there comes mostly from research (R&D) departments from companies. There are many other conferences as well, but IMO they are technology specific, e.g., like the Apache Flink Forward conference . You can search for the technology you are interested in and might find some events. Also, the Journal of Open Source Software JOSS might be of interest.
