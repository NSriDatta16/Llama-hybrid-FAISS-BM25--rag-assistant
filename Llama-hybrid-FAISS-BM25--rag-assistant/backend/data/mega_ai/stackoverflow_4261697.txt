The most "elegant" solution to your problem would not be to use .live , which listens to a particular DOM node for changes (always use a context for your selector; the callbacks can slow down a complicated page substantially) and then just applies a normal callback assuming the selector conditions are met. You would want to include the fadeOut with the function that makes the item appear in the first place. namespace.showMessage = function(message) { $(' ').text(message).appendTo('body').fadeOut(function(){ $(this).remove(); }); }
