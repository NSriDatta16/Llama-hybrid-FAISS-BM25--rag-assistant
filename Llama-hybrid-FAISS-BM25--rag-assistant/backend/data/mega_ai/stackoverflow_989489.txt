The subversion book, free online, gives several suggested repository configurations: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ This page gives good links on further reading: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.tour.importing.html#svn.tour.importing.layout One very nice thing about SVN, which is not true for CVS, is that moving around directories is pretty trivial. So don't feel pressured to come up with a "final" organization right of the bat. Do something that works, play with structure till you like it more. One other thing worth mentioning, SVN uses a copy-on-write technique for data. So feel free to make "svn cp" copies of entire directories whenever you need to.
