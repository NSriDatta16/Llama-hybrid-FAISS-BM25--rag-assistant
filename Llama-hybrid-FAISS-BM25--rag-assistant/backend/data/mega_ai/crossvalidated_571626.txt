Does anyone know what kind of model I would use for something like this? ... I was just wondering if anyone know some common approaches. Two approaches you may want to look into: "Self exciting Poisson processes" and similar. Quite a bit of literature comes up on a quick Google/Scholar search. "Species range distribution models." This drops your time series framework, but you might find it interesting to associate geospatial features with the attacks, as done in Elith, Jane, et al. "A statistical explanation of MaxEnt for ecologists." Diversity and distributions 17.1 (2011): 43-57.
