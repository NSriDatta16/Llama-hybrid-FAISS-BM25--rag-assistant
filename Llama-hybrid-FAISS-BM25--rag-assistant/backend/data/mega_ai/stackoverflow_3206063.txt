In chrome my drag and drop Java applet doesn't get the drop events, does chrome not support that on Mac?

I have an applet that accepts files via drag and drop from the OS which works in every browser but Chrome. In chrome if you drag and drop a file from the OS chrome shows you the file in the browser, if you drop a .jpg for instance. Does Chrome not support drag and drop for Java in OS X? Thanks
