why this code runs slow on device but fast on simulator in iphone

Any thoughts on why this code runs slow on device but fast on simulator in iphone, I am making a game in cocos2d, and I am moving an object from one place to another , throught CCTouchBegan , CCTouchMoved, CCTouchEneded (ccp function) and after that I take the action on it, can any buddy tell me what is the main issue to solve this problem,
