Maximum Number of Categorical Outcomes for Multinomial Logistic Regression?

Based on 4 or 5 predictor variables, I would like to determine "affinity" to a group of 26 different non-profits that an individual could potentially donate money to. I have approximately 1 million records but I have not heard of a multinomial logistic regression used for this many categories and I wasn't sure if I should be advised against this approach.
