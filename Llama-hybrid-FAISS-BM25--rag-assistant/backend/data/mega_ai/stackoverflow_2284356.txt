Can't appendChild to a node created from another frame

I have a page with an iframe and would like to extract a DOM node from the child frame and put it on the parent page. This works in Firefox (3.5), but not in Internet Explorer (7). I've broken down the code to the simplest I can. Fragment window.onload = function () { var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); var div = frames[0].document.createElement("div"); fragment.appendChild(div); }; I get an error " Invalid argument " on the " fragment.appendChild(div); " line. The error seems to stem from the fact that I'm creating the document fragment from the iframe's document and the div element from the parent document. This code works if both use the same document. I want to keep any events that might be attached to the DOM nodes, so I don't want to use innerHTML. Anyone know a fix for this?
