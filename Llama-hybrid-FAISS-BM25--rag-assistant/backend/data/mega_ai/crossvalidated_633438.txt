I think you have a couple of options. Since you're only interested in the average customer satisfaction for the month, you could simply ignore the corrupted dates. The estimate would have lower precision due to smaller sample size, but there is no need to model the daily customer satisfaction. You can use the bootstrap or any other technique to estimate the confidence interval for the average rating. If you needed to answer "what would our satisfaction have been on those days where the machines were malfunctioning" you could model the data using an appropriate regression model. The choice of regression model will depend on a lot of things, so I won't get into it here.
