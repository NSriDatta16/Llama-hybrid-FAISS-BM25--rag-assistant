There are many resources online where you can learn more about deep learning. Specially this link has a great collection. I recently forked this repository. You should go through the resources that interest you. Implementing is the best way to learn, where you get to see the results. As @Christopher mentioned, Pyhton is the best to learn for a beginner. Cheers!
