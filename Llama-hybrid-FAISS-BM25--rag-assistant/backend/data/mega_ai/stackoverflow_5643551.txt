instance variables in stateless session beans

I have read this post and it doesn't answer my question. Stateless session bean with instance variables I am reading the JEE5 tutorial and on this page it states http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbly.html " Clients may, however, change the state of instance variables in pooled stateless beans , and this state is held over to the next invocation of the pooled stateless bean " I don't agree with this.. coz i thought keeping 'any' kind of state across invocations of different instance of beans was something you need 'stateful' session beans for. Please help me understand this thx in advance Rooban
