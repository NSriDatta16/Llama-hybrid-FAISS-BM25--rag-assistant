Are dimensionality reduction techniques useful in deep learning?

I have been working on Machine learning and noticed that most of the time, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE are used in machine learning. But, i rarely noticed anyone doing it for deep learning projects. Is there a specific reason for not using Dimensionality reduction techniques in deep learning?
