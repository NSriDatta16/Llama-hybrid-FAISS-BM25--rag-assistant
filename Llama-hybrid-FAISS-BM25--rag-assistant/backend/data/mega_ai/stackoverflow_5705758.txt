I would suggest looking at CloudIQ Storage from Appistry. Its a fully distributed file store. Its accessible via a REST-based API, and can run on commodity hardware. You can define the number of copies retained on a file by file basis. It supports an Eventually Consistent model so you can balance file consistency with performance.
