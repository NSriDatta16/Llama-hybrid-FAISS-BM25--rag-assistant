To put it more broadly, multicollinearity can be an issue when it comes to either linear or generalized linear models (the latter including logistic regressions). First of all, are you using the Kappa statistic as a measure of multicollinearity? If so, then you would be better off using VIF (variance inflation factor), which is included in the car package. The Kappa statistic measures inter-rater agreement for qualitative items, but you can run into issues if some of your independent variables are in interval format. Suppose you have the following regression equation: reg1 To test for VIF, you can simply apply: vif(reg1) In general, if you obtain a VIF statistic below 5 for a variable, then you can make the assumption that this variable does not suffer from multicollinearity and does not need to be discarded from the model. You should observe the theoretical meaning behind each independent variable and how it relates to the dependent, as there can be cases where it makes mroe sense to retain a multicollinear variable if it is of importance in explaining variation in the dependent variable.
