Difference of means in unequal sample sizes, variances for a boolean data type

I would like to test the difference in means of two samples in the same population. These samples come from a time series, but because of the way the data is structured, a reliable time series cannot be built. I thought pooling the data into groups before/after a certain date, and test the difference between these groups. Each element in this group is a boolean: 1 if condition x, 0 otherwise. As they are pooled into the before/after, the histogram of each looks something like this: I thought about Welch's test for unequal samples and variances, but I am unsure of whether this is correct given the constrains. This is the R command I thought should be ran: t.test(before_year, after_year, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE) #for completeness, this is the output of the previous test: Welch Two Sample t-test data: before_time and after_time t = 221.01, df = 28117, p-value Which leads me to reject the null in favor of the alternative. The difference in means is different to 0: The sample in before_time is more likely to be affected by condition 1 . Note that this is the whole actual population divided into two groups. An alternative option would be to actually sample of equal size from both sets, and do a t.test for the sample, but this seems like a wrong approach given the fact that I have the actual population at time X.
