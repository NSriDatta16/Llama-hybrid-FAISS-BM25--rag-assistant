In a header you should include everything, that is necessary for that header to be used separately. If you use std::shared_ptr in a header and that template comes from memory header, include memory header. When you design a header your goal should be to make it complete, so that when someone includes it, he/she doesn't get errors caused by unresolved references. Don't worry that some headers might be included repeatedly. There are other mechanisms to protect against that. BTW, use those mechanisms (like #pragma or #ifndef / #define ) in your header too.
