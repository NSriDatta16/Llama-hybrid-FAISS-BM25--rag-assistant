Ran a logistic regression and calculated the probabilities but they appear too high

I ran a logistic regression in R using driving data from about 10,000 people. The model included age, years of driving experience, as well as 4 driving test results. The dependent variable was whether or not they had been involved in a crash recently (yes or no, a categorical variable). The coefficients of the model are given below: Estimate Std.Err z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.450041 0.207144 -7.000 2.56e-12 *** riding experience -0.014115 0.003697 -3.818 0.000134 *** age -0.034544 0.003608 -9.575 Firstly, with 10,000 people am I right in thinking that p-values aren't going to be that useful? I calculated the probabilities of being involved in a crash with a 1 unit increase in each variable by doing exp(variable) to get the odds and then, probability = odds/(1+odds) . It gave me: (Intercept) 0.1899952 ridingexp 0.4964712 age 0.4913648 test 1 0.5650012 test 2 0.5225104 test 3 0.5569810 test 4 0.5175193 These seem awfully high! It is like saying that an increase in age of 1 year makes you 49% less likely to be involved in a crash? Surely that can't be right.
