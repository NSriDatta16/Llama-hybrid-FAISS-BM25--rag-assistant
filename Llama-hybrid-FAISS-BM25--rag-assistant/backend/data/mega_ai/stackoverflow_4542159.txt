Alternatives to ERB

I'm getting more heavily into RoR development. ERB doesn't quite feel right to me. I did this once before with JSP. Embedding Ruby code within my markup doesn't feel like a good plan even if the logic is view specific. Mayhaps my fears are unfounded but it feels dangerous. Plus, there's lots of typing involved. I've found HAML and I'm giving it some more evaluation. If it is a good alternative, mayhaps you can give some good resources for it. Beyond HAML, what other alternatives to ERB are there for the Rails View layer? Are my fears with ERB unjustified?
