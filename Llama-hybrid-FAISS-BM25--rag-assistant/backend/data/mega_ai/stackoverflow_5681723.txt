I've been wrestling with this same issue. This is as close as I got to consistent results across browsers. I think that the reason you could be having problems is if some PDF's are too large for readfile() to handle correctly. Try this: $file = "path_to_file"; $fp = fopen($file, "r") ; header("Cache-Control: maxage=1"); header("Pragma: public"); header("Content-type: application/pdf"); header("Content-Disposition: inline; filename=".$myFileName.""); header("Content-Description: PHP Generated Data"); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header('Content-Length:' . filesize($file)); ob_clean(); flush(); while (!feof($fp)) { $buff = fread($fp, 1024); print $buff; } exit;
