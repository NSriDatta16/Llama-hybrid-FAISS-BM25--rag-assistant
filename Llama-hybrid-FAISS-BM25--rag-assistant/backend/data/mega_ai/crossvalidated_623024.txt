The interpretation of the exponentiated coefficient from a Poisson regression as a relative risk depends on how data were collected. This paper by GY Zou is a very well known paper for showing that Poisson regression + robust covariance estimation yields estimates of relative risk + good coverage of the resulting confidence interval. The thing to note here is that there is a caveat on the sampling design: the data must be from a prospective study. The procedure would NOT produce valid estimates of the relative risk in, say, a case control design because the frequency of cases may not reflect the true frequency in the population.
