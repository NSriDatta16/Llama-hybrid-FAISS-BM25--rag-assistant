Yes, but this only works if one is grabbing the HttpServletResponse in the controller. In Spring 3 we're being encouraged to avoid references to anything in the servlet domain, keeping things solely to our POJOs and annotations. Is there a way to do this without referencing the HttpServletResponse? I.e., keeping ourselves pure ?
