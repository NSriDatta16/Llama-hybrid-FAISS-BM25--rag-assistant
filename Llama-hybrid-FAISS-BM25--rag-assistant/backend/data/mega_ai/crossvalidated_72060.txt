Log Likelihood for GLM

In the following code I perform a logistic regression on grouped data using glm and "by hand" using mle2. Why does the logLik function in R give me a log likelihood logLik(fit.glm)=-2.336 that is different than the one logLik(fit.ml)=-5.514 I get by hand? library(bbmle) #successes in first column, failures in second Y
