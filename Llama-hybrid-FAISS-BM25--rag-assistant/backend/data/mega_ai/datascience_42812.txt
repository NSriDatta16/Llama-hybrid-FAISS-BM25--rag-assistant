Looks correct. When you use the same branches in a neural network architecture this is called a siamese-type neural network. You can look here for how to implement it in PyPorch. In my opinion, PyTorch has the easiest framework for this task. Also, you can find the implementation of an encoder-decoder network here . This is a frequently used technique when you need to compute, for example, the distance between a few inputs. But, I have doubts about the concatenation part. Which dimension do you need for outputs? If it is the same as the input, then everything looks fine. If it is a different dimension, then just add a fully connected layer after the last convolution.
