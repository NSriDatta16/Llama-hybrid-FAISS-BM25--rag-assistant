You can make use of a background operation that gets pushed into the operation queue: BGOperation *op = [[BGOperation alloc] init]; [[self operationQueue] addOperation:op]; [op release]; I've created specific "commands" that get executed in the background: @implementation BGOperation # pragma mark Memory Management - (BGOperation *)init { if ((self = [super init]) != nil) /* nothing */; return self; } - (void)dealloc { self.jobId = nil; [super dealloc]; } # pragma mark - # pragma mark Background Operation - (void)main { NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]; [appDelegate GetApps]; [pool release]; return; } @end After completion it might be a good idea to send a notification to the main thread because the internal database has been changed.
