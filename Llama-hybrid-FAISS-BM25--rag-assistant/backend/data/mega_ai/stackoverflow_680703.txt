The logic seems sound to me if you're running it from one machine on a single-core processor. I don't know if the same holds for a multi-core processor for successive calls, however. The generated numbers will definitely not be unique across machines, however. Out of curiosity, is there a reason you're not using GUIDs? Or since you are considering keeping the generated IDs in a list to compare, why can't you create a generator? Since you suggest storage is an option, if you store the last used number and increment it every use... You can even store a date and reset the counter every day if you wish.
