Well, one obvious problem is that you're parsing the string for every city for every pixel. I would strongly suggest that the first thing you do is convert your placeDataList into a more sensible format - a List where each city has properties of Latitude , Longitude and Population . I wouldn't be surprised to find that the vast bulk of your time is being spent performing parsing. There are some other calculations you're repeating over and over, such as (24.443136 / size_h) but I doubt those are as significant. If you can work out some very crude measure for which areas will be covered for a particular city, you could avoid calculating the exact distance each time. For example, you could work out the minimum and maximum values for latitude and longitude which might be within 150 miles, and do a very quick test for each city before doing any more complicated maths. Some stylistic issues: Use a foreach loop where you can Follow .NET naming conventions, e.g. GetPixelColor instead of getPixelColor Think about your names - the parameters for getPixelColor aren't really a width and height, are they? They're a position (e.g. x and y) I would generally encourage you to use braces for every loop and every if block. Not everyone goes along with that, but I find this sort of construct to be error-prone and hard to read: for (int i = 0; i
