Gumbo has already explained what P3P is. Now, about your code, session_is_registered is deprecated. You are using pre_myusername as a constant. If it's not defined, PHP will assume a string, but relying on this behavior is discouraged. If you really intended to use constants, use uppercase for clarity. Note that a variable should be prefixed with a dollar ( $ ). Make sure that no content is sent before session_start(); or the session cookie will not be sent. Session variables are available from the $_SESSION array. isset() can be used for checking the existence of a variable (array key in this case). So, the actual code becomes: session_start(); if(!isset($_SESSION['pre_myusername'])){ header("Location: index.php"); exit(); } For examples and documentation of the session functions, visit the PHP Manual .
