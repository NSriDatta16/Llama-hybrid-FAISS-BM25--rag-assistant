You mean you want to hijack the user's screen? Can you not just call requestUserAttention: on NSApplication? If you really must hijack the screen then look into setLevel: in NSWindow. Just keep in mind that any user like myself is going to delete your application as soon as you hijack the screen unless there is a very good reason to do so. Whenever you are thinking about doing things like this look at http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html first, then decide if it is the right course of action.
