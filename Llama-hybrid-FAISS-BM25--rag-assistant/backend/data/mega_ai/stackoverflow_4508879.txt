I think you should be searching for a lemmatizer (which has information about morphology and can handle irregular words) rather than a stemmer (which usually just lops off the ends of words). See this explanation in Manning, Raghavan, and Sch√ºtze's online book on information retrieval. I haven't tried it out, but a quick search came across this English lemmatizer for Ruby: elemma . A commonly-used (non-Ruby) English morphological analyzer that can do lemmatization is morpha .
