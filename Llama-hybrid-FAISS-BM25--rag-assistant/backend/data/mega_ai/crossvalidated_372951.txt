How can I choose what statistical test to use?

Car MPG 1 28.0 2 25.7 3 25.8 4 28.0 5 28.5 6 29.8 7 30.2 8 30.4 9 26.9 10 28.3 11 29.8 12 27.2 13 26.7 14 27.7 15 29.5 16 28.0 How can I answer this: The vehicle sticker information for this model stated a city average of 30mpg. Are these mpg values (Q3Mileage.Rdata) consistent with the vehicle sticker? What type of statistical test do you choose to answer the question? Perform a significance test using the 0.05 significance level (alpha). Be sure to specify the hypotheses. Provide the output, the test statistic, and the p-value. Interpret the statistical output and provide the answer to the question in laymanâ€™s English.
