Is is possible to see the input labels for a randomforest model?

I have a random forest model built like this: from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0) X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y) model.fit(X_train, y_train) Is there any method I can call (or attribute I can use) to see the column names used to make the model? Thanks
