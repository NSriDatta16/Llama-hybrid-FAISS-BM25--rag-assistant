post-hoc analysis for interaction terms in logistic regression: emtrends(), type I error

I built a logistic regression, including the followed variables. And I tried to compare effects of temp among group and habitat using emtrends() in emmeans R package. I have 3 questions about the followed results. First, it feels like that there was type I error in the results. How can I figure out there is type I error or not? Second, I wonder why df is Inf in my results of emtrends() . Third, I ran emtrends() seperately for group variable and for habitat variable. My model included the interaction term between temp and habitat but not a habitat variable. Then, should I ran like this emtrends(fit_1, ~habitat|group, var = "temp") ? > str(dataset) 'data.frame': 1440 obs. of 6 variables: $ habitat : Factor w/ 4 levels "A","B","C",..: 2 2 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ group : Factor w/ 4 levels "red","skyblue","indigo",..: 3 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 1 1 ... $ temp : num 15.5 13.9 13.9 15.4 15.5 ... $ event : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ weight : num 3 3 2.73 3 10 ... $ rain : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... > fit_1 summary(fit_1) Call: glm(formula = event ~ group * temp + rain + habitat:temp + rain:temp, family = binomial, data = dataset, weights = weight) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.6849 -1.7761 -1.1416 -0.2509 8.5246 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
