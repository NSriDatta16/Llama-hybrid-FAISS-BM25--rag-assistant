The best use I have had from Gantt charts in MSProject is for capacity planning in the embryonic stages of a project. You can do broad brush scheduling and what-ifs, moving stuff around, moving people, add in various milestones etc. This can give you confidence that you are developing a reasonable plan. But then using it on day to day tracking of the myriad little tasks that people actually have to do is, as has been mentioned, asking for trouble. What I have used to great effect for managing timescales at this micro level is Fogbugz's EBS stuff. You have to work at it, but it really does help in keeping a handle on things. To summarise by repetition - Gantt is great for developing a software plan, but not for the day to day detailed update of it. As to the page question, most of the plans I've done that have worked best (i.e. communicated the plan to people at an understandable level of detail) can be made to fit into an A3 printout. Occasionally a couple of A3 pages. But A4 is simply too small in most cases in my experience.
