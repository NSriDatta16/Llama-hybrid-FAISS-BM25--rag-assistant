I may try to give some hints from my point of view. At our company we were using the different configuration of the build environment and different target environment. By different configuration I mean different system architecture. And this is a point I would like to describe. (Although I do not know if this is your actual problem). Build of the product was done on build env and to run tests and the product itself it has to be transfered to the target env. Thus it involved cross compiling. We didn't used a commercial or open source continuous integration solution, but we have used set of bash scripts (there was no time to create reasonable solution :( ) Running of the tests (doesn't matter if unit, intergration, sanity, components etc..) has to be done on target. So the question you may ask are - what is development environment? Where would you like to run the tests? (We have been running test on target and small part of the test on the build env as well) Is target environemnt same as devel environment? Do you need to build for different configurations (platform, sw, etc..)? You haven't stated what languages are you using. I know it may be irrelevant, but it is not :) (Even java behaves differently on different platforms (x86 vs x86-64) Anything else like coverage of the code with test, some statical code analysis done during compilation (before..) running documentation task I consider as not very interesting as this tasks can be done as separate plugins.
