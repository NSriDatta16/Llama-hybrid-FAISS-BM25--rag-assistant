How to deal with the callback being called multiple times when animating more than one thing in jQuery

Consider this code... $(function() { for (var i = 0; i ') } $('div').slideUp(1000, function() { $('body').append('done sliding'); }); }); (see it on JSbin ) It creates 10 div s and then slides them up. The callback is called 10 times, when I would prefer it to be called once (after all have finished sliding). I know I could do a Boolean or something, like hasCalledCallback , but is there any other more elegant way to make multiple elements animating call a completion callback only once?
