Something I like to do, especially when trying to coordinate ServiceModel elements between libraries and tests is to use configSource to fragment the config in the target library and simply link / copy always the fragments in my test projects. That way I only maintain in one location. You could take it one step farther and simply have a common directory in the solution and link the fragments in all projects.
