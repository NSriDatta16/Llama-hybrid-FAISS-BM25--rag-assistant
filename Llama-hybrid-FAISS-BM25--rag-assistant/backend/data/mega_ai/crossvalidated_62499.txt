Which is more appropriate in this case -- PCA or Factor Analysis?

Suppose I have an experiment that has 8 factors. These 8 factors are probably related and can hopefully be reduced. For each combination of these 8 factors that I test, I get a single output. My goal is to reduce the 8 factors to a smaller set of variables. In this case is PCA or Factor Analysis more appropriate? I am not too clear on the differences between the two methods. My limited understanding is that PCA is best to reduce multiple outputs into a smaller set of the most important outputs and that Factor Analysis is best for finding relations between many factors. If this is true I would expect Factor Analysis to be the best method for this situation.
