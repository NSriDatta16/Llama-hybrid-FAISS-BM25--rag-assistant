In your formula $SST$ is a constant and is the same regardless of how you want to model your multiple linear regression model. $SSE$ is an non-decreasing function over the number of predictors. It goes up (bounded by $SST$) unless the new predictor is perfectly correlated with existing predictors. You can think like this: in the worse case the new predictor can get a zero coefficient, so adding a new predictor should never worsen the performance. Thus, as you add more predictors into the model the $R^2$ measure never decrease. This is bad for forming a predictive model because $R^2$ encourages overfitting. Adjusted $R^2$ takes that into account and put a penalty for the number of predictors you have in the model. However, if your goal is not to predict but for exploratory analysis. It's reasonable to use the $R^2$ measure.
