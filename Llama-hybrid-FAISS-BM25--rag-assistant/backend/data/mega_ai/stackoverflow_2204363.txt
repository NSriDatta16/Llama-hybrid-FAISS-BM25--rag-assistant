As Pointy said , live() leverages the bubbling of events up the DOM (event delegation). Also, for each $(selector).live(type, handler) call, jQuery only calls handler on the $(event.target).closest(selector) element - that is, the nearest matching ancestor-or-self element of the event target. And, of course, live() doesn't support anything like livequery( matchedFn, unmatchedFn ) . Implications: $(selector).live() still requires a traversal of the DOM (obviously). However, if you load jQuery and attach live() handlers in the document head then there is no document body to search yet. Similarly if you insert new content into the page. live() does less work when being configured - it doesn't have to attach handlers to every matched element live() does more work in handling events - it has to traverse ancestors of the event target, finding elements that match the selector $("div").live() is different to $("div").livequery() as it only works for the closest div to the event target Similarly, $("div, p").live() is different to $("div").live(); $("p").live();
