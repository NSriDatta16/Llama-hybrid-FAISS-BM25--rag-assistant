how to apply MC dropout to an LSTM network keras

I have a simple LSTM network developped using keras: model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(rnn_size,input_shape=(2,w),dropout = 0.25 , recurrent_dropout=0.25)) model.add(Dense(2)) I would like to apply the MC dropout method. How can I enable dropout in the test phase in order to compute the uncertainty? Thanks.
