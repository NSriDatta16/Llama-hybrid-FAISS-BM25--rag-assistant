How to improve performance with our Rails image model and attachment_fu?

I've been trying to improve performance our app. The worst performing area seems to be the creation of our Image model, which uses attachment_fu: class Image :image, :max_size => 100.megabytes, :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => 'public/uploaded/images', :thumbnails => { :small => '75x75>', :medium => '160x120>', :large => '600x600>' }, :s3_access => :authenticated_read validates_as_attachment after_create :move_to_s3 ... We've already moved the move_to_s3 method to a delayed_job. Our apdex score on this transaction is horrible (often How else can I improve the creation of Image records (speed-wise)? I may be able to do without the :small thumbnail? Would it help to drop that? If it helps, most of these files are high-res images. Does the upload time factor into the metrics I have? Is it skewing the reports?
