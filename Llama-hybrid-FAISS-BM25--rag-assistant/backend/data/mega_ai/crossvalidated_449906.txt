Improving accuracy of multi-class text classifier

I am trying to build a text classifier with 4 highly imbalanced classes. Data has around 4000 documents and highly sparse. I have used XGboost and few other algorithms.Highest accuracy is given by xgboost 70%. Please help or share links of articles that can help me improve the accuracy further.
