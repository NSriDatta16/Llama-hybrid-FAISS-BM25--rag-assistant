Since it's a log table, there is no need to make is clustered. It's unlikely that you will search it on Id . Alter your PRIMARY KEY so that it's unclustered. This will use HEAP storage method which is faster on DML : ALTER TABLE FTPLog DROP CONSTRAINT Primary_Key_Name ALTER TABLE FTPLog ADD CONSTRAINT Primary_Key_Name PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED (FTPLogId) , and just issue: SELECT @MaxFTPLogTime = DATEADD(day, -10 , GETDATE()) PRINT @MaxFTPLogId DELETE FROM FTPLog WHERE LogTime
