My temptation would be to say that the int to string conversion would happen in the comparitor code rather than in bulk. Although this may be more elegant from a code-perspective I'd have to say that the execution effort would be greater as each number may be compared several times. I'd be inclined to create a new array containing both the int and string representation (not sure that you need to pad the string versions for the string comparison to produce the order you've given), sort that on the string and then copy the int values back to the original array. I can't think of a smart mathematically way of sorting this as by your own statement you want to sort lexicographically so you need to transform the numbers to strings to do that.
