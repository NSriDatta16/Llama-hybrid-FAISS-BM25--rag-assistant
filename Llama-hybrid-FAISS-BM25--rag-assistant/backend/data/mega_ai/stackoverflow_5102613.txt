This is a situation that's been around in Unices for donkey's years. Your program is exiting immediately as soon as it is invoked, leading to it be restarted over and over by launchd . launchd has noticed this and stopped respawning the program. The standard advice on this goes back many years, too: Find out why the daemon process is immediately exiting rather than running, and fix the cause of that. (It's usually a daemon misconfiguration of some kind.) Yes, technically, in Mac OS 10 speak this is an "agent" rather than a "daemon", but that doesn't change either the nature of the problem or what you have to do to fix it.
