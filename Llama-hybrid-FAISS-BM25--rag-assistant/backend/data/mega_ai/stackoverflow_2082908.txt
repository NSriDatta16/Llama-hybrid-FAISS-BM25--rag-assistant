I had the same error (loaded the "xViewController" nib but the view outlet was not set.) in the debugger. In Interface Builder, I opened the xViewController.xib, right-clicked the View icon, dragged from the circle beside New Referencing Outlet over to the File's Owner icon, then, when the small gray menu appeared, I clicked view. (Then save, rebuild, run, etc...) I'm not clear on what's going on, but that fixed it. From what I understand, if anybody wants to follow-up, the View's outlet (which is named "view") was not set, and by dragging the New Referencing Outlet over to the File's Owner icon, I set the View's outlet. Great.
