The (equal variance) t-test is equivalent to OLS linear regression on a binary predictor (using something called a “Wald test” of the coefficient), and the Wilcoxon test is equivalent to a proportional odds ordinal logistic regression on a binary predictor (using something called a “Score test” of the coefficient). You do not need to separate your thinking into hypothesis testing approaches and regression approaches, since there is an equivalence between the two. Hypothesis testing and regression often get taught as separate areas of statistics, but you end up unlocking a lot of power when you start seeing standard tests as special cases of regression, as that allows for a lot of accounting for additional variables (such as going from ANOVA with just the groups to ANCOVA that considers the groups AND some additional predictor that you believe influences the outcome).
