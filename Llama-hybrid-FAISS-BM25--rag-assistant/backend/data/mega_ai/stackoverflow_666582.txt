Gallery2 is an excellent web-gallery software, suitable for presenting images, videos, and audio. It has a "CheckOut with PayPal" plugin. Gallery2 will require some time to configure, it is unlikely that you will use it "as is" after install. Gallery2 is easily embeddable - provided minimal PHP skills, and good HTML/CSS skills, one can make it fit inside any design (maybe except for the grid-like thumbnails layout, which I guess is possible but harder than average).
