The term "expectation" in statistics means the probability-weighted average over the whole possibility space. It does not mean "the result that will happen with 100% probability". For instance, if you roll a die, the expected value is 3.5, even though the probability of a single die having a value of 3.5 is zero. Going from "the expected number of tails is 1" to "The probability of getting a tail is 100%" is a complete non sequitur.
