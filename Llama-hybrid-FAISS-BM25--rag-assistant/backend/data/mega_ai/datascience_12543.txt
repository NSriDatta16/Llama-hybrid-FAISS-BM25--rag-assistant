The answer to the question depends on the what is done on distributed environment. For example, if the goal is to estimate the mean of the data. Each machine can get one mean value and the number of samples, then a reducer machine could get a weighted average of the means, which is the true mean of all data. While for some algorithm to heuristically merge results from distributed machines, there is no guarantee on quality of the results.
