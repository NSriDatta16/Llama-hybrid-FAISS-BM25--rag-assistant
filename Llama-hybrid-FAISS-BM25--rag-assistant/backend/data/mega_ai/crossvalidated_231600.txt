Along the same lines as gregory_britten and Glen_b , it depends on what you are measuring. Here it seems you are comparing two different distributions. Can you say that the jump from 100 to 1000 in your example 2 is "more significant" than the jump in [1, 1, 1, 1, 10]? To compare the two, you need to compute the mean and std of the joint distribution of a larger recent section of your time series and compute the z-score from that. For example: Time-series: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 100, 100, 100, 100, 1000] Current: 1000 Mean: 140.1 Std: 290.5 Z = (1000 - 140.1) / 290.5 ~= 2.96 Fixing the mean and std are standards in anomaly detection or series prediction, and you can do it a few ways: Compute them every time over the whole series, like above. This gives you the true standouts given all data. Compute them from a reference baseline and use that for all future points. This gives you baseline drift detection and stringent criteria for anomalies. Compute them from a time window. This let's you adjust automatically for baseline drift over time if you compute it over the last N data points, for example the last hour or day (depends entirely on what type of signal you are analyzing). This is what you are doing in your example. The baseline has drifted from example 1, and so the jump from 100 to 1000 is not really meaningful given the drift.
