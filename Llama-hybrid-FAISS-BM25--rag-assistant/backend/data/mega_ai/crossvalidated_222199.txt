How to interpret TBATS model results and model diagnostics

I have got a half hourly demand data, which is a multi-seasonal time series. I used tbats in forecast package in R, and got results like this: TBATS(1, {5,4}, 0.838, { , , }) Does it mean the series is not necessarily to use Box-Cox transformation, and error term is ARMA(5, 4), and 6, 6 and 5 terms are used to explain the seasonality? What does that damped parameter 0.8383 mean, is it also for transformation? The following is decomposition plot of the model: I am wondering what do level and slope tell about the model. The 'slope' tells the trend, but what about level ? How to get a clearer plot for session 1 and session 2 , which are daily and weekly seasonal respectively. I also what to know how to do model diagnostics for tbats to assess the model, except for RMSE value. The normal way is to check whether the error is white noise, but here the error is supposed to be an ARMA series. I plot 'acf' and 'pacf' of the error, and I don't think it looks like ARMA(5,4). Does it mean my model is not good? acf(resid(model1),lag.max = 1000) pacf(resid(model1),lag.max=1000) The final question, RMSE is calculated by using the fitted value and true value. What if I use predicted value fc1.week$mean and true value to assess the model, is it still called RMSE ? Or, there is another name for this? fc1.week
