The specification does not define how to instantiate, configure and start an OSGi framework. Therefore running OSGi framework from your usual Java code is always specific for the given framework implementation (Equinox, Felix, Knopplerfish,...). It's reasonably easy to embed Apache Felix (an open-source OSGi framework) into your application. See http://felix.apache.org/site/launching-and-embedding-apache-felix.html for more information.
