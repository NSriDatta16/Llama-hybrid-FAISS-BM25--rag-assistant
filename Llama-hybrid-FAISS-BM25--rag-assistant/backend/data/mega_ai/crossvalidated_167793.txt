You can derive an average by setting, for example, yes=1 and no=0. Your average will vary between 0 and 1 where values closer to 1 mean more yes responses. However, in this case, the average won't tell you any more than the percentage of yes and no responses. For example, if you had 70 yes responses and 30 no responses, your average would be 70/(70+30)=0.7. Your percentage of yes responses would be 70/(70+30)*100=70%. If you have any other data (e.g. people's gender) you could start to look at more detailed statistics such as whether the rate of yes responses varies by gender. As it stands, all of your data is inherent in your counts. The percentage and average are essentially the same summary of these counts, presented in very slightly different ways.
