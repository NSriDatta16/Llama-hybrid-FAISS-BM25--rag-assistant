You could just write: store | //div[@id='main_content']/div[2]/div[2]/div[2]/div[4]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td/form | myForm assertElementPresent | xpath=${myForm}/fieldset/p[1]/input As Krosenvold said, however, long xpaths can be pretty fragile. If your concerned about readability in your code, and want all your locators in one file where you can make cascading changes, you might want to consider using an UI-Element map.
