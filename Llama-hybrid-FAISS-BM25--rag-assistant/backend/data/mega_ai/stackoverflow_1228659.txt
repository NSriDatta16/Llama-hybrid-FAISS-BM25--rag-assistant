A .pyd file is a DLL. So unless IronPython (which is written in .net) can correctly load C DLLs written for CPython, you might be out of luck. Update In fact, according to the IronPython FAQ , you are unfortunately unable to import .pyd files: Q: How do I build and call into PYD libraries? A: IronPython does not support using PYDs built for CPython since they leverage implementation details of CPython. You can get a similar effect for new "PYD"s you would like to implement by writing them in C# or VB and building a DLL for .NET.
