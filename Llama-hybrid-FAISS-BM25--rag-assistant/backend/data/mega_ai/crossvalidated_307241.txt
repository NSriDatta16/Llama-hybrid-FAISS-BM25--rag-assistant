Several approaches have been discussed, you must determine if the time series is stationary and if it's a long memory process first. Casta√±o (2008) suggest to estimate the model $ARFIMA(p^{*},d^{*},0)$ where $p^{*}=round(T^{(1/3)})$ and T the number of observations, if $0 $Y_{t} (1-L)^{d^{*}} \quad \sim \quad ARMA(p,q)$ for more details go to https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/estad/article/view/29594
