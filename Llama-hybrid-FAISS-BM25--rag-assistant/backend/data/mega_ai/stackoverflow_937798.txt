If you're talking about how likely a straightforward collision is - one where there is no deliberate attempt to cause one - then you're going to be disappointed: You'd need to generate on average 2^64 plaintexts before you can expect to see a collision, and that's substantially more than you're going to be able to do in a reasonable (or really, even an _un_reasonable) time. If you're looking to demonstrate the difficulty of deliberately crafting a collision, other answers have already demonstrated that. The extra constraint of requiring the strings to be entirely textual makes even those approaches largely impractical, though.
