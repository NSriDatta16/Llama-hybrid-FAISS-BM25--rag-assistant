I'm not sure that there's a standard reporting scheme, just the expectations of your readership. Thus, instead of seeking a common reporting standard, I would advise you to understand the needs of your readership and tailor your reports and presentations to them. A report to the parent-teacher's association about the levels of particulate matter in the classroom would be necessarily less technical than a report to an insurance firm, even if you conducted the same analysis. This is not to say, of course, that one group is smarter or more worthy of the full results than the other. It has to do with the way the information is presented and, sometimes, the stats get in the way. I teach my students the 1:2:20 rule of thumb. The one paragraph summary goes to the mayor. The two paragraph summary goes to the media. The 20 paragraph report goes on the shelf. I'm not sure that the mayor or the media care about eta-squared results, so I don't provide it to them, but it's there for them to access in the full report and available should they ask for it. To drive this home, in one of the journals I help edit in which the readership consists mainly of a general medical audience, we would rarely report anything more than a point estimate, the 95% confidence interval and the p-value. For example, "the adjusted odds ratio from the logistic regression was 2.4 (95% CI 1.5, 3.3; p=0.002)". In another journal in which the readership consists of epidemiologists, test scores, degrees of freedom, coefficients of determination and others are reported. For example, "race was found to be associated with disease severity $(\chi_{df=4}^2=24.3; p In these situations, it's not correct to assume that the level of scrutiny is less in the first compared to the second. If we deemed it necessary, we would require authors to present more information about their statistical procedures. In fact, it is more and more common to have supplementary material appended to full manuscripts that describe the statistical methods and results in (often exhausting) detail. I do hope that this helps.
