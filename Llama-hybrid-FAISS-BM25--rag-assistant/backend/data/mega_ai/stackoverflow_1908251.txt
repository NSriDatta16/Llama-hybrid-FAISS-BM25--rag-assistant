Span is completely non-semantic. It has no meaning, and serves merely as an element for cosmetic effects. Paragraphs have semantic meaning - they tell a machine (like a browser or a screen reader) that the content they encapsulate is a block of text, and has the same meaning as a paragraph of text in a book.
