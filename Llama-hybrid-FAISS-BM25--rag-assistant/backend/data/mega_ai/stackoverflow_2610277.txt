What's the best way to deploy localization resource files with Visual Studio?

For my *.resx files in App_GlobalResouces, what should the Build Action be? The defaults for creating a new resource file have Build Action as "Content", Copy to Output Directory as "Do not copy", and Custom Tool as "GlobalResourceProxyGenerator". On certain servers I get an runtime error: "CS0101: The namespace 'Resources' already contains a definition..." that points to a "temporary asp.net files" folder. This makes me think that maybe I should be embedding these files so I don't have to worry about this duplicate registration. Or is my error the only real problem and keeping the physical files in the App_GlobalResouces section is fine?
