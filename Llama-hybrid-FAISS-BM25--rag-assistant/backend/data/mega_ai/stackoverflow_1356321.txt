Loading markers on google maps dynamically on map move/drag/pan

I need to display a set of markers on a google map. In addition, I need to show additional markers, loaded dynamically, when the user pans the maps. The number of markers could be in thousands, out of which 30-50 need to be displayed initially. Other markers need to be loaded and displayed only when user pans over an area that contains markers. I thought about using marker managers but i am not sure if markers can be fed to the marker manager dynamically. I want something more like this map. Notice how images load when you pan the map and garbage-collected when you pan away. Marker clustering is not important but might be nice.
