Relationship between statistical models: mcnemar test vs logistic regression

I always find useful and reliable answers in this forum and I hope this pattern will not change this time. I was spending some time to check whether an intervention program had any effect on an outcome. Unfortunately, all examples I got from stats book did not reply to this question, once the majority of books create "simple" examples very distant from real data or empirical questions. Let's imagine that the goal of qn intervention is to increase an "Assertive" Response and decrease all other responses. To make it clear, let's say 60 participants were submitted to "psychotherapy" vs "Psychodynamics" and we have a "control" group. The participant's attitude was evaluated before and after the treatment using an ordinal category (assertive, passive and neutral). The question is very simple: did the intervention work? I know the Mcnemar test is a right option for this kind of question, however, Mcnemar does not include covariates (such as sex). In addition, Mcnemar does not "adjust" for different baselines. Some participants started with a "passive" attitude, whereas others started with an "assertive" attitude. I have a "feeling" that an ordered logistic regression (considering random effects) can deal with this question, but I'm struggling to figure out how to model that using R. I really appreciate any help and you can reproduce this code in R to clarify my question: The closest we have in this forum is here . Please inform if this question is duplicated or very hard to understand.\ Thanks library(tidyverse) set.seed(123) ds
