The logistic regression model is a probability model. It is inappropriate to think of cutoffs when using it. The use of a cutoff for a decision threshold is separate from the modeling process and makes a strong assumption that the cost/loss/utility function (consequences of decisions) is the same for all observations/subjects. In general, defer thresholding or dichotomization to decision makers. Details are here . A good use of probability estimates from the model is creation of a lift curve whereby observations are ranked by predicted probability and you select the "biggest bang for the buck" based on the budget or time allowed.
