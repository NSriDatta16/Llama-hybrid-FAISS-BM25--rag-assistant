Is there a difference between on-line learning, incremental learning and sequential learning?

What I mean is the following: Instead of processing all the training data at once and calculating a model, we process one data point at a time and update the model directly afterwards. I have seen the terms "on-line (or online) learning" and "incremental learning" for this. Is there a subtle difference? Is one term used more frequently? Or does it depend on the research community? Edit: The Bishop book (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning) uses the terms on-line learning and sequential learning as synonyms but does not mention incremental learning.
