What correlation makes a matrix singular and what are implications of singularity or near-singularity?

I am doing some calculations on different matrices (mainly in logistic regression) and I commonly get the error "Matrix is singular", where I have to go back and remove the correlated variables. My question here is what would you consider a "highly" correlated matrix? Is there a threshold value of correlation to represent this word? Like if a variable was 0.97 correlated to another one, is this a "high" enough to make a matrix singular? Apologies if the question is very basic, I wasn't able to find any references talking about this issue (a hint towards any reference would be a big plus!).
