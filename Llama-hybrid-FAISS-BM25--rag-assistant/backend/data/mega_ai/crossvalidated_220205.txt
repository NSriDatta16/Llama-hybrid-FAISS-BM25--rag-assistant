Having done the two step exercise of PCA followed by clustering more than a few times, I have developed a strong POV. First, there are lots of good reasons for smoothing your inputs with PCA -- most importantly, redundancy is removed. Next and as @hssay notes, the resulting PCA is a linear combination of all of the inputs. Identifying a subset of features that load maximally on them and retaining only that subset for the cluster solution would destroy variance. Given that, my recommendation is that you use the complete set of components as input to your clustering algorithm. Then there's your question of interpretation. It is a fact in the applied world that people (teams) can, will and do spend enormous amounts of time on interpreting the components. To me, this is a waste of time since they are merely a means to an end...the end being a "good" cluster solution. Once you have generated a partitioning of your information that has good statistical properties, create an output file containing the cluster assignments for each object in your data. Next, generate a back-end interpretation based on the original features that ignores the components (since you don't care what they mean). This back-end analysis can consist of a spreadsheet based on the new output file that has columns for the clusters and the rows are an appropriate measure of central tendency, e.g., mean, median, mode, whatever. To facilitate the interpretation, add an index column for each cluster that represents the ratio of the cluster value to the overall (or grand) value -- include the values for the overall data in your sheet in a separate column. By multiplying that ratio by 100 (and rounding), you create a new heuristic that is kind of like an informal t-test or an IQ score. Indexes between 80 and 120 would be considered "normal" behavior, 120+ is a feature or behavior that is distinctively true for a cluster while indexes 80 and less are features or behaviors that are not representative of that cluster. The more extreme the index, the more that cluster deviates from normative behavior. Just use caution interpreting small values in the denominator as the indexes can get quite large. Another problem with this "quick and dirty" approach to interpretation occurs when some of your values are negative. Negative indexes need more careful consideration. The fact is that people typically don't care and don't want to know how you got to a solution. They just want the answer. Sometimes they're willing to work with you on getting to a final answer, other times they just leave the whole thing up to you. Of course, this discussion ignores the question of what a "good" cluster solution is. That's another story.
