I also have good experience with iTextSharp rendering very sharp and clear images. I tried both adding the image directly to the document and adding it to a paragraph first. Both give very clear results. Dim document As Document = New Document(pSize, 20, 20, 20, 20) PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, New FileStream(myPath & "Test.pdf", FileMode.Create)) document.Open() Dim png As Image = Image.GetInstance(myPath & "myImageFile.png") document.Add(png) Dim pgr As New Paragraph pgr.Add(png) document.Add(pgr) document.Close() I normally use .png images, but I have had the same success with jpeg, gif, etc. Are you certain that when you retrieve the image in iTextSharp it is the exact same image that you retrieve when you are in Acrobat? I ask because it is unclear what exaclty is happening in your code: Dim imageFile As String=String.Format(..... EDIT Also, to make sure that the image is displaying at the size you are expecting, save your images at 72dpi. 72 dpi is what iTextSharp uses for everything (images, margins, etc..). That way, a 100px x 100px image will show up as 100x100 on your pdf document. You won't have to worry about scaling or re-sizing then. Any time that you scale an image (up or down) you run the risk of introducing aliasing artifacts (blurriness).
