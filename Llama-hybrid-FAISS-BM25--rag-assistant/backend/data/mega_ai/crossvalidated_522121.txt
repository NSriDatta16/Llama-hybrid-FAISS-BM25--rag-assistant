BART is a method of estimating $E[E[Y|A=1,X]] - E[E[Y|A=0,X]]$ in a highly flexible way, where $Y$ is the outcome, $A$ is the treatment, and $X$ are covariates. BART is one of many such methods that estimate the same quantity, including inverse probability weighting, propensity score methods, TMLE, causal random forests, etc. This is a totally separate matter from causal inference. There is nothing special about BART for causal inference. It is just a regression method. I discuss some of its statistical advantages here . Why do we care about estimating $E[E[Y|A=1,X]] - E[E[Y|A=0,X]]$ ? When certain assumptions are met, including strong ignorability, $E[E[Y|A=1,X]] - E[E[Y|A=0,X]] = E[Y^1] - E[Y^0]$ , which is the average causal effect of $A$ on $Y$ . The assumptions required are about the causal status of the variables in $X$ with respect to $A$ and $Y$ . In particular, they must be a sufficient set of variables required for nonparametric identification of the causal effect. (Note that "nonparametric identification" has almost nothing to do with "nonparametric" used as a descriptor for an estimation method like BART). Some of those rules include, e.g., that no colliders are included, that all backdoor paths between the treatment and outcome are closed, etc. There are a set of rules required for nonparametric identification of the causal effect. These are discussed in most texts on causal inference. BART can't tell you which variables are required for nonparametric identification of a causal effect. It can only estimate the causal effect once you provide it with the correct set of $X$ . No method (to my knowledge) can tell you the causal structure of the variables without any assumptions because each joint distribution of covariates is compatible with many causal structures. Strictly speaking, there is no reason for BART to be in a talk like the one you presented except that the author of the presentation also developed the use of BART in causal effect estimation. Again, there is nothing special about BART in terms of causality. It is a highly effective method for estimating a conditional association, which is what a causal effect is under certain assumptions, but it cannot verify those assumptions. I should note I am a huge fan of BART and this post is not meant to insult it or Dr. Hill, but just to point out that BART has the same causal status as all other regression methods, which is to say, none at all, except that it can be used to estimate a conditional association, which can, under certain (unverifiable) assumptions, be interpreted as a causal effect.
