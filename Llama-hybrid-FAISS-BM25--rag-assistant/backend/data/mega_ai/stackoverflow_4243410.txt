There is also a easy way to hide the keyboard on touchesBegan: when you are using UITextView to enter the data. Step 1. Be sure that you have extended Textviewdelegate while class declaration. @interface YourClassName : UIViewController { IBOutlet UITextView *txtMyView; } step 2. set the delegate to self in view did load function. - (void)viewDidLoad { txtMyView.delegate = self; } step 3. write the similer code in touchesbegan function with you textView name. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [txtMyView resignFirstResponder]; [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } Thanks and regards.
