WindowStyle and AllowsTransparency are the two properties you'll have to change. In order to have your window sit on top of all the other windows, you're going to want to set Window.Topmost to True as well. To move the window, handle one of the Mouse events on the border you added then call Window.DragMove in the event handler.
