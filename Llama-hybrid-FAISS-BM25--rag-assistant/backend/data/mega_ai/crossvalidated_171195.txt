Logistic Regression vs ANOVA for categorical variables

In a problem that I have to predict a categorical variable (0/1) using a set of categorical variables, does it make any difference in prediction accuracy whether I use a logistic regression or ANOVA? How about any differences in other areas such as: Model Assumptions Regression Diagnosis Implementation, etc.
