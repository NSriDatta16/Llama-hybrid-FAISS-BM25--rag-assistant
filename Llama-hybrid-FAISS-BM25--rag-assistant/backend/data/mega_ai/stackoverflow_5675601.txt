The simplest way I can think of is to just check for the traceroute Linux application, execute it, and parse its output. Android has full networking support, however, Java doesn't expose an interface to alter the IP header. Hence, manually crafting ICMP packages is out of the question (JPCAP is no help here, since it relies on libpcap, which I suppose you won't find on any vanilla installation). Another possible solution is to use the NDK and create a small library that handles the low-level number crunching. However, I'm not sure if the NDK would allow you to use setsockopt .
