I don't know much about Window Mobile, but (right now) there is a barrier to compatibility between Android and the iPhone: managed vs. native code. Android highly encourages you to write in Java, whereas the iPhone requires Objective-C or C++ (or C). Though Android does have a native development kit, they don't currently expose many libraries. They will add more APIs over time, but the Android devs will continue to encourage Java development, since Dalvik bytecode will run on any new device. This is just my opinion, but I would focus on just one platform at the start. Pick your primary platform, write your core game code in portable C++ if you can, and keep the platform-specific parts separate from your core game code. Your goal is to get your game published. Once you have some money coming in, then start focusing on your second platform's port.
