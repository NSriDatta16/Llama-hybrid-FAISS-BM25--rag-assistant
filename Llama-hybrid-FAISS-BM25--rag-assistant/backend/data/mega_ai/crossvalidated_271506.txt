I looked extensively into the Caret GitHub repo and couldn't find anything that explained the behavior I described above. So I wrote some code to perform the same analysis without using any of Caret's helper functions. And I got the exact same result. Therefore, the unexpected behavior that I described has a different source than the one I implied in my question, possibly some future-peeking in my slicing and dicing of the time series - although I haven't been able to figure this out yet. I think this question should be closed and a different one asked, possibly on another exchange.
