How do I grab an instance of a dynamic php script output?

The following link outputs a different image every time you visit it: http://www.biglickmedia.com/art/random/index.php From a web browser, you can obviously right click it and save what you see. But if I were to visit this link from a command line (like through python+mechanize), how would I save the image that would output? So basically, I need a command-line method to imitate right clicking and saving the image after initially visiting the site from a web browser. I can already use iMacro to do this, but I'd like a more elegant method. What can I use to accomplish this? Thanks!
