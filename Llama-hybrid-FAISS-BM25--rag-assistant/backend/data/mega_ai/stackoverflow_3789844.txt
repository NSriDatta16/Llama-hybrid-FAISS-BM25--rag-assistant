How to make a greyed-out HTML form?

I'd like to have a group of HTML text 's that can be all greyed-out (disabled) at the same time. I also want the entire area they are in to somehow be greyed-out or at least visibly disabled. I've seen things like this done in desktop applications. Any ideas on an easy/elegant way to do it? I'm trying to avoid manually setting each to disabled="disabled" , and also have an area surrounding the 's that indicates that entire portion of the form is non-editable. EDIT: Sorry, I should mention a few more things... Everything is local. I'm not using PHP or ASP or anything like that... just HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Also no jquery! I want to enable/disable the "area" dynamically with JavaScript It's NOT a , just a bunch of 's
