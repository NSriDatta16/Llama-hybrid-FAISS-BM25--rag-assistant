Isn't that what the HTML option is for? :) Another choice is the styleprops (edit Css Style) , not sure how this works completely, but there is an option on the box tab that will let you set a width. I have removed it to avoid shenanigans! Alternatively you could create several styles which have a width defined and then with the cursor focused on the cell by choosing the style width20percent the box goes 20%.
