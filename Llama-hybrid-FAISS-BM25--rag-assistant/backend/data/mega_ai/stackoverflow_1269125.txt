As others have said, we really need the models, and some explanation of what you're actually trying to achieve. But it looks like you want to do a related table lookup. Rather than getting all the related objects in a separate nested query, you should use Django's related model syntax to do the join within your query. Something like: acceptedFragment.objects.filter(fragment__categories__id = 1)
