As someone who made the shift the other way from SPSS to R, I'd say that SPSS is relatively simple and intuitive relative to R. The menus and dialog boxes guide you through the process. Of course this means that it is also fairly easy to run analyses that don't make sense. And the GUI leads to less flexible analyses and tedious button pressing especially for repetitive analyses. Thus, your approach of taking a dataset and just playing around might be sufficient. There's plenty of how-to books out there, such as: Discovering Statistics Using SPSS SPSS Survival Manual There's also plenty of websites offering tutorials: Andy Field My old notes UCLA on SPSS I'd also recommend that if you are teaching students about SPSS, you encourage them to use syntax. Using SPSS syntax is not as good as using technologies like R and Sweave . However, using syntax is much better than just pressing menus and buttons in an ad hoc way and then wondering later what you've actually done. I wrote a post listing tips for using SPSS syntax in order to approximate reproducible research with SPSS .
