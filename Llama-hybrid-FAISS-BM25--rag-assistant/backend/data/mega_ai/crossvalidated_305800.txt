sampler for univariate random variable

I have a univariate random variable $x$ whose density has the following form $$p(x)\propto \int f(x,y,z) \,\mathrm{d}y \, \mathrm{d}z.$$ And the support for $x$ is bounded, let's say $-1 I want to directly sample from this density, no MCMC. The bivariate integration could be done using numerically evaluated for a specific $x$ value. I am pretty sure that $p(x)$ is uni-modal but it is not necessarily to be log-concave so adaptive rejection sampling might not work here. Is there any sampling algorithm that works for uni-modal univariate distribution with bounded support? Any suggestions?
