Am I causing statistical violations?

I am trying to analyze where the significant differences are between 2 sets of time series. Group 1 (Expert) has 29 trials normalised to 256 points whereas Group 2 (Novice) has 19 trials (see attached screenshot). Essentially I have carried out t-tests at each of the 256 time points and only plotted out (green plot) the data which is significant at p Somewhere in the back of my head I think that I am introducing error by such repeated t-testing. Can someone comment on whether or not this approach can be done? Thanks in advance.
