Freeform drawing canvas (with shapes) in Java

I'm working on an GMF (RCP/EMF/GEF) application that allows users to create design diagrams. As part of that application, we have to allow the user to create their own custom shapes to add in diagrams. We are thinking of using SVG as the storage format for shapes. I'm looking for a Java library that creates such canvases and allows us to export images as SVG files. It should also be able to import SVG files and allow manipulation. Even an Eclipse plugin would do because I'm guessing we should be able to make an Eclipse plugin in an RCP application, as long as the plugin is open source. We will be using Batik for our SVG work in the application. A licensing note: we do not want to have to make our application open source, so libraries with licenses like LGPL that require derivative works to be open source will not work for us.
