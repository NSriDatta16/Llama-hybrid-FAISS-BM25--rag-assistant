From what I understand, you need more than 1-word terms. Thus, it's better to go for n-grams. Start with creating n-grams import re from nltk.util import ngrams s = s.lower() s = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]', ' ', s) tokens = [token for token in s.split(" ") if token != ""] output = list(ngrams(tokens, 2)) You should get 1-gram, 2-grams and 3-grams at least to cover all possible terms. Then you can use a Computer Science Ontology (CSO) which includes about 14k technical terms. An alternative would be to use their own Classifier that gets a text as input and annotate terms on it from the same ontology. You can find a demo here https://cso.kmi.open.ac.uk/classify/ When I try to classify the abstract of Machine Learning from the Wikipedia article, I get the following results Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. 1 :2 Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.[3][4] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics. artificial intelligence computer systems computer vision correlation analysis data mining email inference machine learning optimization unsupervised learning
