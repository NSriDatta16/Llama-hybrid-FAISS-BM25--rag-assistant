To be clear, my response is assuming you have a single event of what appears to be a known and varying treatment intensity. In some applications, say a series of minimum wage hikes or exposure to different concentrations of particulate matter in the air, we can treat the increases/decreases over time as multiple events, especially when we're dealing with multiple level changes over time. It doesn't appear your data fits this pattern entirely, but there are some similarities. You know the event years and the precise exposure post-event. Thus, you're exploiting variation in treatment timing and intensity within and across individuals. My first question is whether Equation (1) is an appropriate generalized DD equation that I can use to estimate the "treatment" effect? Yes. The variable $CT_{it}$ is a policy variable and represents a treatment status change. Include it as you would any other variable. My second question is how can I estimate a dynamic period by period coefficient version of Equation (1)? Assuming you have a lot of observations with treatment histories as defined above, then individuals $i$ may experience no exposure, constant exposure, and/or fluctuating exposure over time, even before the event starts. For some units, the exposure isn't even permanent; it appears the intensity "dies out" as you suggest with unit 1 so long as spending goes to zero. In the extreme case as with unit 4, the variable is a constantly changing continuous variable pre- and post-event. To achieve "time-varying" effects, you need to substitute different time configurations into the model. When we lead and/or lag in a setting like this, we a lose a period. Depending upon the context, we can get away with replacing a missing value with 0, but this is only justified in settings where we know a priori that individuals do not have any treatment intensity before the policy (or after it ends); they are essentially untreated pre-event. In a setting with a continuous policy variable (i.e., constantly changing numeric variable), here is one way to go about estimating time-varying effects: $$ \begin{array}{ccc} i & t & CT_{it} & start & CT_{i,t+2} & CT_{i,t+1} & CT_{it} & CT_{i,t-1} & CT_{i,t-2} \\ \hline 1 & 2000 & 0 & 2004 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{NA} & \text{NA} \\ 1 & 2001 & 0 & 2004 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{NA} \\ 1 & 2002 & 0 & 2004 & 0.3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2003 & 0 & 2004 & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2004 & 0.3 & 2004 & 0.42 & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2005 & 0.4 & 2004 & 0.2 & 0.42 & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0 \\ 1 & 2006 & 0.42 & 2004 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.42 & 0.4 & 0.3 \\ 1 & 2007 & 0.2 & 2004 & 0 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.42 & 0.4 \\ 1 & 2008 & 0 & 2004 & \text{NA} & 0 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.42 \\ 1 & 2009 & 0 & 2004 & \text{NA} & \text{NA} & 0 & 0 & 0.2 \\ \hline 2 & 2000 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2001 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2002 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2003 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2004 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2005 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2006 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2007 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2008 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 2009 & 0 & \text{Inf} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline 3 & 2000 & 0.1 & 2003 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 & \text{NA} & \text{NA} \\ 3 & 2001 & 0.1 & 2003 & 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 & \text{NA} \\ 3 & 2002 & 0.1 & 2003 & 0.6 & 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\ 3 & 2003 & 0.5 & 2003 & 0.4 & 0.6 & 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.1 \\ 3 & 2004 & 0.6 & 2003 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.6 & 0.5 & 0.1 \\ 3 & 2005 & 0.4 & 2003 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.6 & 0.5 \\ 3 & 2006 & 0.2 & 2003 & 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.6 \\ 3 & 2007 & 0.1 & 2003 & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.4 \\ 3 & 2008 & 0.3 & 2003 & \text{NA} & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.1 & 0.2 \\ 3 & 2009 & 0.1 & 2003 & \text{NA} & \text{NA} & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\ \hline 4 & 2000 & 0.3 & 2006 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.3 & \text{NA} & \text{NA} \\ 4 & 2001 & 0.2 & 2006 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.3 & \text{NA} \\ 4 & 2002 & 0.4 & 2006 & 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\ 4 & 2003 & 0.2 & 2006 & 0.5 & 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.2 \\ 4 & 2004 & 0.3 & 2006 & 0.1 & 0.5 & 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.4 \\ 4 & 2005 & 0.5 & 2006 & 0.12 & 0.1 & 0.5 & 0.3 & 0.2 \\ 4 & 2006 & 0.1 & 2006 & 0.13 & 0.12 & 0.1 & 0.5 & 0.3 \\ 4 & 2007 & 0.12 & 2006 & 0.14 & 0.13 & 0.12 & 0.1 & 0.5 \\ 4 & 2008 & 0.13 & 2006 & \text{NA} & 0.14 & 0.13 & 0.12 & 0.1 \\ 4 & 2009 & 0.14 & 2006 & \text{NA} & \text{NA} & 0.14 & 0.13 & 0.12 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ Please note the endpoints. If you do not know individual spending beyond these limits, then they should be treated as missing (i.e., $\text{NA}$ = "Not Available"). With more and more leads and/or lags, a researcher will either restrict the effect window by either binning at the last estimated lead/lag or drop unit-time observations beyond the effect window. By "binning" we assume constant treatment effects beyond the effect window in one, or both, directions. For example, in the case with a binary treatment variable, a final binned lag just changes from 0 to 1 in that period then stays equal to 1 for the remainder of the panel. In the continuous case, a binned lag is forward cumulated (e.g., $CT_{it} = CT_{it} + \Delta CT_{i, t-1}$ ). I rarely observe researchers explain how they treat the end points in their papers, especially in cases with continuous policy variables, so I can't even direct you to a good resource. In most event study applications, it's not uncommon to simply ignore the estimated effects beyond the effect window. If you're working with a panel that is wider than it is long, then I would consider a shorter effect window. On the other hand, if you're working with a much longer time series, then losing a few periods at either endpoint isn't going to matter much.
