how many lines of code does my class library have

for metrics reasons I need to know how many lines of code my class library has. I'm doing this for code coverage.... So if Class library 1 has 50 lines of code and 100% coverage And if Class library 2 has 500 lines of code and 0% coverage My total coverage is 90% Any idea how to do this? Is there a utility or a way to use Visual Studio?
