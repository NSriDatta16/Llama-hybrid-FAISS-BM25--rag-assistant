different drawable resolutions

I want to deploy my application on different screen sizes using the 1.6 feature. I exported the drawable resources with different resolutions in drawable-ldpi, drawable-mdpi and drawable-hdpi folders. On android 1.6 and 2.0 everything looks good. My problem is that on 1.5 the drawable-ldpi resources are used instead of drawable or drawable-mdpi ... the application still works but it renders the images scaled and the image quality is lost. How can I configure the application so that on 1.5 the only the drawable-mdi folder will be used? I'd like to keep the apilevel to 3 so that the same apk will run on 1.5, 1.6 and 2.0.
