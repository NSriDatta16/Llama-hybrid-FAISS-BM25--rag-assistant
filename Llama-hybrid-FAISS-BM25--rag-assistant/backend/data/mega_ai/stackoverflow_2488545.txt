Reading bmp file for steganography

I am trying to read a bmp file in C++(Turbo). But i m not able to print binary stream. I want to encode txt file into it and decrypt it. How can i do this. I read that bmp file header is of 54 byte. But how and where should i append txt file in bmp file. ? I know only Turbo C++, so it would be helpfull for me if u provide solution or suggestion related to topic for the same. int main() { ifstream fr; //reads ofstream fw; // wrrites to file char c; int random; clrscr(); char file[2][100]={"s.bmp","s.txt"}; fr.open(file[0],ios::binary);//file name, mode of open, here input mode i.e. read only if(!fr) cout This code is running fine when i pass txt file in binary mode EDIT : while(!fr) cout I am not able to see binary data in console this was working fine for text when i was passing character parameter in fr.get(c)
