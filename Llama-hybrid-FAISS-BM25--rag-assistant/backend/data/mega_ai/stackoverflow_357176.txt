.net 3.5, does it need your computer to be restarted for it to work?

Hey gang, I need to know if i need to restart my computer to get .net 3.5 to work with my web applications after i install it. My server machine is using IIS. On my local machine the web app works fine. When i browse to it on the server, i'm seeing errors like the Linq assemblies can't be found ... even though the references are in the web.config file and that for classes where i define properties using the snazzy no field generation way, the compiler complains saying i need to specify those very fields (again, this doesnt happen on the local machine when i build the web app). Advice on this would be appreciated.
