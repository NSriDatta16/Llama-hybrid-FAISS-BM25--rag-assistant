GNU debugger doesn't show all data in C++ structure

I have been using the WinPcap library with C++, Codelite and GNU development tools. I have an IP4 structure describing an IP header. When I cast the packet data into the structure, I can't see all of it in the debugger, just random bits of data. For example, the source and destination addresses in the IP4 struct don't show up in the debugger, but when I run printf statements they show up perfectly fine. Why is the debugger doing this? Does the data type in the struct matter? I find it a hassle to printf the structs to make sure that the data is valid. MinGW-4.4.1 and GNU gdb (GDB) 7.1
