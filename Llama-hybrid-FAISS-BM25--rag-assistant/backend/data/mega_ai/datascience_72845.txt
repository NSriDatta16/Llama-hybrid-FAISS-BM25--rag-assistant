Ways to increase recall in SVM

I am training an SVM on UCI's Bank Marketing Data Set , the bank additional-full.csv. As the data is skewed I am also interested in recall. I am getting accuracy of about 87.95% but my recall is around 51%. I want to know ways to increase recall without decreasing accuracy so much using SVM only. My code: from sklearn.svm import SVC svm_clf = SVC(gamma="auto",class_weight={1: 2.6}) svm_clf.fit(X_transformed, y_train_binary.ravel()) Additional info: I have not created any new feature (i.e combining features) and considered unknown as label. I have also removed Duration attribute as suggested by attribute information I have tried different class_weights, so I can increase recall upto 75.32% but then my accuracy drops to 68% How can I increase recall in SVM models without decreasing accuracy so much?
