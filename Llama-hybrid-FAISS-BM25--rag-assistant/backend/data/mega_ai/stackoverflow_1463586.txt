It depends. If you have a WHERE clause such as the following, you will get better performance out an index on (security_ID, date_column) than the converse: WHERE date_column BETWEEN DATE '2009-01-01' AND DATE '2009-08-31' AND security_ID = 373239 If you have a WHERE clause such as the following, you will get better performance out of an index on (date_column, security_ID) than the converse: WHERE date_column = DATE '2009-09-01' AND security_ID > 499231 If you have a WHERE clause such as the following, it really won't matter very much which column appears first: WHERE date_column = DATE '2009-09-13' AND security_ID = 211930 We'd need to know about the selectivity and conditions on the other columns in the index to know if there are other ways of organizing your index to gain more performance. Just like your question is version generic, my answer is DBMS-generic.
