Jquery UI Drag and Drop position of element jumps on first drop

So I have this project that im working on, and now im stuck :( My problem is, when I drag and drop my item, I need to get/set its position relative to a container, not the entire body, so from what I understand I should use position(). I do this using var pos=$(ui.helper).position(); objName = "#leaf"+counter++ $(objName).css({"left":pos.left,"top":pos.top}); Although this introduces a jump just after I drag in the div. I had this working which would give me absolute left and right values using var pos=$(ui.helper).offset(); and setting my containers (#treeContainer) CSS to NOT CONTAIN "position:relative;" although this gave me absolute values relative to the entire page! Many thanks for any responses!
