Looking for somewhat pooling between average and maximum pooling

In the textbook Dive into Deep, there is a question: Is there another operation between average and maximum pooling that you could consider (hint: recall the softmax)? Why might it not be so popular? ( 6.5.5 Exercise 6 ). I have been googling such pooling technique between average and maximum pooling but I still have no idea. Can you provide any source related to such pooling technique?
