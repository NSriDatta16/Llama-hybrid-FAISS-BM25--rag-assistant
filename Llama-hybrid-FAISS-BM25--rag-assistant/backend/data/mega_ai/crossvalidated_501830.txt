Your test set is very small. Model comparisons based on 4 observations are unlikely to be trustworthy. You could do time series cross validation based on rolling windows instead*. Even so I would lean towards AIC rather than time series cross validation, given the discussion in the thread "AIC versus cross validation in time series: the small sample case" , though the case is not clear cut. *See the last section of Rob J. Hyndman "Why every statistician should know about cross-validation" .
