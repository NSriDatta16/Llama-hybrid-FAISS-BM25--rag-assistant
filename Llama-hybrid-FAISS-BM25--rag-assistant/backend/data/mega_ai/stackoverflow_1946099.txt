iPhone + application crash on device

I have developed an iPhone application with Snow Leopard (10.6.2) and Xcode (3.2.1). As many of us know that in this new version of Xcode we get facility of Build and Analyze (to check memory leaks and other issues). When I build and analyze my application, it gives me no error / no warnings. My application runs fine on simulator also. Now, I try to test the application on iPhone device (device configuration: iPhone 2G and iPhone OS 3.0) with 8GB memory. The problem is that application starts well on iPhone device but after some time, it crashes. When I see the console from Window->Organizer->Console. I see following error: Tue Dec 22 17:17:39 unknown SpringBoard[27] : Memory level is urgent (8%) and there are no background apps to ask to exit.
