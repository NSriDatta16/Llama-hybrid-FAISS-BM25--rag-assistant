If I really had to do this, I'd structure the XML so that it took look entries as children of the root element, open the file, readbackwards until I was at the start of the closing tag for the root element, write the new elements, and then write the root element again. Mostly though, I just wouldn't do it. XML is not a good format for log entries (and I'm speaking as a big fan of XML). I might find it useful to have each entry as an XML fragment, but even that is unlikely. If you really need an XML log format, log in a more sensible format for logging, and then produce XML reports on those logs as needed. If you rotate your log files (e.g. writing to appLog20101001.log today and appLog20101002.log tomorrow), then you can optimise by persisting the XML files for logs that'll no longer be appended to.
