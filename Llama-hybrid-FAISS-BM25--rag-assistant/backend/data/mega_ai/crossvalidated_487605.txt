Sampling the hitting time of a Brownian motion with drift

Consider a Brownian motion with drift $\mu > 0$ and variance parameter $\sigma^2$ . Then the pdf of the first hitting time to the value $a > 0$ is $$ f(t) = \frac{a}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi t^3}}\exp\bigg\{-\frac{(a-\mu t)^2}{2\sigma^2 t}\bigg\}, $$ for $t > 0$ . I have a few questions about this distribution: Is this a standard distribution with a name? Right now I'm sampling from this distribution using MCMC methods (the Metropolis algorithm from R's mcmc package). Is there hope to more efficiently sample, e.g. via inverse transform sampling, or am I stuck with MCMC?
