Should a colon character be escaped in TEXT values in iCalendar (rfc2445)?

My understanding from reading the specification ( http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt ) is that the ":" character should not be escaped in text values like DESCRIPTION. From the RFC: The "TEXT" property values may also contain special characters that are used to signify delimiters, such as a COMMA character for lists of values or a SEMICOLON character for structured values. In order to support the inclusion of these special characters in "TEXT" property values, they MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character. A BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92) in a "TEXT" property value MUST be escaped with another BACKSLASH character. A COMMA character in a "TEXT" property value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92). A SEMICOLON character in a "TEXT" property value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92). However, a COLON character in a "TEXT" property value SHALL NOT be escaped with a BACKSLASH character. I ask this because I'm receiving syntax errors in Meeting Maker v8.7.1b63 for Mac OS X due to this character but not for the Windows version of the software (same version number). It's choking on ics files I'm generating from software I've written. Is this a bug in my software of theirs? This is the iCalendar file that is receiving the error: BEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:2.0 PRODID:-//abc/abc//NONSGML v1.0//EN BEGIN:VEVENT UID:1234_abcd@abc.abc DTSTART:20091022T133000 DTEND:20091022T150000 SUMMARY:Special Topics in Power Point LOCATION:The Location DESCRIPTION:Learn how to use PowerPoint as a tool to organize and pres ent your ideas to others.

END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR Note the colon on the third line of the description. Adding a slash to this colon fixes the problem on the Mac but I think this is incorrect according to the standard. Thanks for your help!
