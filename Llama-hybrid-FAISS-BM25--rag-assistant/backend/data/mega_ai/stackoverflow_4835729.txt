Triggering the "stack" option manually on a JQuery UI draggable

I have a quick question about the draggable in JQuery UI. I can set DIVs as draggable and set the "stack" option on the draggable. The stack option makes the DIV that is being dragged automatically come to the front. However, I would like to invoke this functionality manually. I would like to programmatically invoke the draggable's stack function and bring it to the front. Is this possible?
