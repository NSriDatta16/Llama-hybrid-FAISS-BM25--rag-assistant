If your residuals are autocorrelated then this means that there are systematic movements in your time series which your ARMA model has failed to capture. In that sense, forecasts are a risky affair. I know that parsimonious models are usually preferred by researchers but one has to at least make sure that the residuals are white noise in order to have a valid model, even if this means that the AR or MA order have to be increased by a bit.
