There is a bug with the Set Values properties in SQL Server Agent for SSIS packages. You need to save the job step while still on the tab I think(?). I'll see if I can remember and reproduce the steps, but you're not going crazy. ;) You may need to click "OK" for the job step, and "OK" for the job before moving on to any other changes in the job.
