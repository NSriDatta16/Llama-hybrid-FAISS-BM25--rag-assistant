Continuation ratio and Cumulative proportional odds model

I seek the equivalence in terms of parameters of the two models. Consider and i.i.d data set $(x_1,y_1),...,(x_n,y_n)$. Now lets assume first that $Y$ is categorical with say 4 levels. Then a cumulative logistic regression model assuming proportional odds is given $$\mbox{logit}(P(Y\leq j|X)=\alpha_j+\beta X. $$ The forward continuation ratio model is given by $$ \mbox{log}(P(Y=j|Y\geq j,X)=\gamma_j+\theta X. $$ Can some prove to me the relationship between the $\alpha_j,\gamma_j,\theta$ and $\beta$? The equivalence of these two models with the complementary log-log link has been established I just wish to see a similar establishment for the logit link.
