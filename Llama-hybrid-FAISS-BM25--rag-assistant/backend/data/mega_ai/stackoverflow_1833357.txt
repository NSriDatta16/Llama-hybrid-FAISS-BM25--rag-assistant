What is currently the best, free time picker for WPF?

I'm looking for a simple time picker control for WPF. I've found this one: http://marlongrech.wordpress.com/2007/11/18/time-picker/ but it has some issues e.g. you can't type in "00" into it, the second zero won't appear. Silverlight seems to have one: http://jesseliberty.com/2009/03/28/toolkit-control-%E2%80%93-timepicker/ but it's not for WPF . The WPF Toolkit has a DatePicker but not a TimePicker by itself. Or is there a way to allow the user to enter time and date in the WPFToolkit DatePicker? It returns a DateTime in SelectedDate but I don't see how to allow the user to also choose the time with this control. What is the best free WPF control to allow users enter time in HH:MM:SS format?
