This is actually a rather complex problem. There are a few directions you can look into. One way, typically recommended in the forecasting literature, is to optimize for the forecasting error. If you have a specific application in mind you can define your own cost function to optimize. A different view on this is to look at the EWMA as a state space model, then the problem is equivalent to setting up an appropriate Kalman filter which you can do with MLE, see for instance Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods There are other directions you can go, but I think this will give you an idea...
