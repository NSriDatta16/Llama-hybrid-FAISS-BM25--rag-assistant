The flash framework, Gaia, uses separate xhtml pages for it's SEO solution. From it's site: "The Search Engine Optimization Scaffolding engine in Gaia creates an XHTML file for every page you specify in the site.xml, as well as a sitemap.xml file that follows sitemaps.org protocols . The purpose of SEO Scaffolding is to provide search engines and non-Flash users with easy access to the content on your site, as well a convenient single data source for the copy on your site, organized by page. This technique is white hat compliant , and is discussed on the Gaia forums." More information here: http://www.gaiaflashframework.com/wiki/index.php?title=SEO
