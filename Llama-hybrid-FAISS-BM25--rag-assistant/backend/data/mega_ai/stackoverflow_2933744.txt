You probably want to start by setting up your own internal Maven repository using Nexus or Artifactory. Configure it as a repository for your own artifacts, and as a caching proxy for Central and any other external repositories that you need to fetch stuff from. Then create binary only POM files for each of the commercial libraries, including dependencies on the published libraries that they depend on. Upload the POM files and corresponding JAR files to your internal repository in the required structure. Just make sure that these POMs and JARs are not visible outside your group / organization ... depending on what the license for the respective commercial products permit / require. Of course, this means that you won't be able to make your applications (that depend on these libraries) publicly available via Maven. But you've probably already factored this into your planning.
