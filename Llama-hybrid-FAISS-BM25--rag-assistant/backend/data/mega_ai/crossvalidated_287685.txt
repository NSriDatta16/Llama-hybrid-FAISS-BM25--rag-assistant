Any decision-tree based approach (CART, C5.0, random forests, Boosted regression trees etc.) identify homogeneous areas in your data and assign the mean value of the data contained in that region to the corresponding 'leave'. So, they are granular and then, they must show a series of steps in the outputs. Those based on 'forests' do not show that phenomenon pronouncedly but it is still there. The aggregation of a large number of trees nuances it. When a given value is outside the original range the datum is assigned to the ‘leave’ that includes the extreme condition found in the training dataset and the output is consequently the mean value of the values contained in that leave. Thus, no extrapolation is possible. By the way ANNs are poor extrapolators. You can check: Pichaid Varoonchotikul - Flood Forecasting using Artificial Neural and Hettiarachchi et al. The extrapolation of artificial neural networks for the modelling of rainfall—runoff relationships they are very illustrative and are easy to find in the net! Good luck!
