What approaches are there for applying RNNs when there is only a single long sequence?

Most of the applications of RNNs I see are applied to multiple short sequences, such as sentences or market prediction. Each sentence or stock is one observation. But what if you only have a single sequence? For example, 10 years of weather information from different types of sensors? I read this post What is a feasible sequence length for an RNN to model? which says long sequences aren't a problem, but in my case I only have one sequence. I don't know if it makes any sense to try to feed a single sequence into an RNN, for example how would batch updates work? Setting stateful=True (as described at http://philipperemy.github.io/keras-stateful-lstm/ ) seems relevant here, but again, since there's only one sequence, it doesn't exactly make sense immediately. I know that one option is to chop up the time series into multiple small windows and take each window as a separate sequence. But this can disrupt patterns that happen over very long periods of time. Are there any other approaches?
