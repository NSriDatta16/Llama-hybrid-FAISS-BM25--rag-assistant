logistic regression vs support vector machines

I can understand the logistic regression depends on entire data and support vector machines depend on support vectors, but could not understand when and why should I use svm or logistic regression. Can someone shed light on this. Is logistic regression always have a linear boundary and svm has both linear and non linear boundary one of differences between the both?
