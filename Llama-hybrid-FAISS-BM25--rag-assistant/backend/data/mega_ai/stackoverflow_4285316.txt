WPF/Silverlight - Binding Across Multiple XAMLs

. Hello guys, Consider the usual scenario of Prism (WPF/Silverlight) in which we've multiple regions, and in each goes a view (XAML), so a situation might arise when we interact with one view (XAML), either using mouse, or keyboard, we may want to change or update other views (which happen to be different XAMLs) accordingly. For example, on selecting an item from a view, say ItemPanelView , we may want to show the details of the selected item in other view, say ItemDetailsView . So my question is, Would it be a good idea to bind elements from one view (XAML), to the elements in the other views ( different XAMLs), to implement such functionalities? If I'm not wrong, using this approach we would not need to go from one presenter to other (using TwoWay bindings etc), so as to update the view in other region. Or, is there any elegant yet simple way to do this? .
