$\Sigma_{c}p(c|a)p(b|c) = \Sigma_{c}p(c|a)p(b|c,a)$ which is actually the definition of $p(b|a)$. Here, $p(b|c) = p(b|c,a)$ because based on your Bayesian NW figure, conditioned on $c$, $b$ and $a$ are independent. To sum up, $a$ and $b$ are not independent, they're conditionally independent given $c$. By the way, your equation in the update part seems to be wrong.
