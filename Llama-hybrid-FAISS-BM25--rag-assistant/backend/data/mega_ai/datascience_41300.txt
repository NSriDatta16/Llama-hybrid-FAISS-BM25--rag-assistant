Hi this can be approached as a timeseries regression problem. Deep learning (tools like Tensorflow or Keras a higher level API) can be very effective in this. It depends on many factors like the amount and quality of your data, the architecture, the complexity of the problem and hyper parameters whether it will be useful to you. machinelearningmastery.com has many examples of LSTM have a look at it! Maybe start with this . As you can see in the examples in 2 having the numbers you mentioned and the sequence in which they occured could be enough to predict the next number(s). Usually adding more information to your neural network should make it improve.
