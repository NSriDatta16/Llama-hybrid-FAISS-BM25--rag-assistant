welcome to StackOverflow. You are correct in that you cannot display two activities at once. You must instead look into how layouts work in Android by reading some tutorials on the Android developer guide. For your layout, I would recommend using a LinearLayout with four TextView objects inside it containing the questions (and perhaps your EditText objects below them) as well as your timer. Make sure they are all inside a ScrollView so the software keyboard doesn't force it all to be squeezed up. This is how I would approach it, but I encourage you to read about how layouts work and use the XML resources. The Notepad tutorial is an excellent way to get started with views and text entry, as well as using SQLite databases.
