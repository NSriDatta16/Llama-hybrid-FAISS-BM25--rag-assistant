There is a 'Style Organizer' tool within Word which will let you copy styles from one document to another if they are both open at once. In Word 2007: Open the styles dialog (Home tab -> Styles -> Bottom Right button). Click the 'manage styles' button. Click 'Import/Export...' I can't remember what the option is in Word 2003. I think it was Tools -> Style Organizer or similar.
