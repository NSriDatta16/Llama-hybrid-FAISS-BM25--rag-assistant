Are data considered to be "events" or "random variables" in machine learning?

I was sitting at a lecture on Naive Bayes, and the speaker, on a slide, said: Given a feature $x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1, \ldots, x_n \end{bmatrix}^T$ , the probability of the feature belong to class $c$ is given by, $P(c|x) = P(x,c)/P(x) = P(x|c)P(c)/P(x)$ I was a bit surprised by this notation. From Wikipedia, the Bayes rule only apply for either "events" or "random variables". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem#Derivation Is the feature (or data) $x$ considered to be event or random variable in this context?
