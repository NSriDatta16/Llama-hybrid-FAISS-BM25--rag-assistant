You can give raw pixels as your input. As preprocessing step you should adjust your pictures to the same size, probably some small size for the sake of performance. Also convert pictures to black-white, again, for performance and because color doesn't matter that much. But anyway state of the art image recognition is deep learning, so I would better suggest that.
