Summing over all the probabilities that are as or more extreme is perfectly sufficient here, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you have to be careful about what you mean by "as or more extreme" here. If you have a particular reason to believe a cheater would prefer picking green over red, then the probability that two or fewer red would be chosen by chance may suffice, but often you will want to use two-sided p-values: i.e. what are the chances that two or fewer red or green would be picked by random chance? (which here would give a p value greater than 5%) Another important point is as djma mentioned: .05 p-value is arbitrary and has created some serious problems for the reproducibility of scientific experiments. If you set a p-value of .05 as the bar, of true hypotheses you will reject on average one of every twenty! And so really, you should set your threshold for significance on a number of factors, particularly: How bad would it be to reject a true null hypothesis? (In your toy model, this would be considering the consequences of accusing someone falsely of cheating) How bad would it be to accept a false null hypothesis? (In your toy model, this would be the consequences of failing to catch a cheater) Prior probabilities: a priori, how likely do you consider it is that the null hypothesis is false? Are you subject to the look-elsewhere effect? (In your toy model, if you are a casino and you are subjecting many people to this test, at a low significance level you are bound to falsely accuse many of cheating, but a lower significance level may be more reasonable if this is a one-off thing) Many more points I'm sure I'm not thinking of.
