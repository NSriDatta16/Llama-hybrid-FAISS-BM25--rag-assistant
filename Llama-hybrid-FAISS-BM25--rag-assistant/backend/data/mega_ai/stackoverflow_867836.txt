I don't know what you mean with 'drawing mode'. However, if you want to change the appearance of your mouse cursor, the property you are looking for is Application.Cursor You can set it to one of four predefined values: xlWait, xlNorthwestArrow, xlIBeam and xlDefault . If you want to display other cursors, have a look this article on how to display a custom cursor in Access. Since it uses the WinAPI, the solution should work equally in Excel. Edit: In response to your edit: I don't think that it is possible to do what you want. The macro recorder doesn't pick it up because there is no VBA command that can do it. Depending and what you are trying to achieve by switching to design mode, there may be other ways though. If you want to keep the user from changing the data in your workbook, you can hide the complete Excel window using the Application.Visible property. If you want to keep the user from selecting or changinganything, but still display the data, have a look at ActiveSheet.Protect or ActiveWorkbook.Protect , available under Tools - Protection . If you want to move or resize some controls in your workbook, you can do that programmatically by changing the Left , Top , Height and Width property of the control, you don't need to switch to design mode in order to do this from your macro.
