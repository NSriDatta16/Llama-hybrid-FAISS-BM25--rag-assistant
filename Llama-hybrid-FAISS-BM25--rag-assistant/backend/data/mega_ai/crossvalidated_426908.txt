If $K$ is a Markov kernel(with density $k$ ) with stationary distribution $P$ (with density $p$ ), then, if $(X_t)_t$ is a stationary Markov chain associated with $K$ , \begin{align*}\mathbb E\left[\frac{p(X_{t+1})}{p(X_t)}\right] &=\int_{\mathfrak{X^2}} \frac{p(x_{t+1})}{p(x_t)} p(x_t)k(x_t,x_{t+1})\text{d}\lambda(x_t)\text{d}\lambda(x_{t+1}) \\ &= \int_{\mathfrak{X^2}} p(x_{t+1}) k(x_t,x_{t+1})\text{d}\lambda(x_t)\text{d}\lambda(x_{t+1})\\ \end{align*} Unless $k$ is symmetric and with a support at least equal to $\mathfrak X$ , the support of $p$ , there is no reason for the ratio to be of expectation one.
