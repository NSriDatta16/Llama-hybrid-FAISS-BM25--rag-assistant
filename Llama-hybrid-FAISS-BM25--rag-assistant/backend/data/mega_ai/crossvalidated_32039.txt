AIC and BIC are used for constraining the complexity of a range of models competing to explain the same data. Following on the heels of results in complexity theory and machine learning, there is reason to believe that in some scenarios, using these proxies for complexity gives useful info about the model that explains the data best while having the smallest generalization error. In this case, you would first need to propose some model that produces the graph spectra you are seeing. You could postulate some different components that produce the graph you see, such as a mixture model. For example, if you were working with the common telephone data set from Belgium (where there is a trivial cut to make between those who speak French and those who speak Dutch), you would need to postulate the mechanism (language preference correlated to region or something) that actually causes the two different segments of the graph. Then, once you have a model, you would use AIC or BIC as a means for optimizing the parameter choices for fitting that model with your observed graph data. If the number of different causal clusters is something you include in the model, then it's something your optimization routine will spit back out under AIC or BIC constraints. But it's not really the same thing as normalized cut, which does not exactly model anything about the graph. Normalized cut (and other spectral segmentation methods) proposes a cost function that may or may not be related to anything about your graph, and then makes cuts so as to minimize the cost. If the cost functional used by the segmentation method does not meaningfully correspond to aspects of the data generating process that gives rise to your graph, then the segmentation performance can be arbitrarily bad. As you say, this is a reason why one-size-fits-all graph cutting procedures must be used delicately, with careful consideration of what the cost functional means for your data. I have a few sources for this, and I'll come back and document it later this evening.
