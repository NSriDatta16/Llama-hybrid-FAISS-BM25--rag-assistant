One of the things I find with backups is that people typically don't run them frequently enough - especially when it comes to log file backups. And it sounds like you're correct, that the log file isn't being truncated regularly (which means you're likely wasting premium disk space [ 1 ]). More importantly though, that's leaving you completely exposed from a recoverability standpoint.) Happily though, getting things up and running as you need them isn't so hard.
