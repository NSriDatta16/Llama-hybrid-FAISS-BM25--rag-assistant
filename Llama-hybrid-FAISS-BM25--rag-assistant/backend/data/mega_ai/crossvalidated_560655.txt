Are there classifiers with infinite number of classes?

I am writing something about time series classification and wrote the following: A classifier is a function that for given input $x_1, ..., x_n$ (in this case representing data stored in audio file) returns $y \in C = \{c_1, ..., c_k\}$ , where $C$ is a finite set of classes (like $\{M, F\}$ ). But then I realised that it might not be true. However, I can't think of any example of a classifier with an infinite possible number of classes. Do they exist? If so, what are some examples?
