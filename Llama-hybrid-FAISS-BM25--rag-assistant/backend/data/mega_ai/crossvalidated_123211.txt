You were correct in your third paragraph. You are attempting to fit a logistic regression model where every response is the same (accident). Think about what you are feeding into the model: You are giving it 24,000 records with varying variable values for "Pothole", "Rain", and "Snow" that ALL result in an accident. Your model has no built-in knowledge that some weather conditions do result in NO accident, yet alone the frequency of accident to non-accident at varying levels of weather conditions. Intuitively, your model knows of no conditions that can result in NO accident. Since your data points are not linearly separable, you cannot get convergence of the algorithm. Ideally you would want a random sample of all trips for which you are interested along with associated weather conditions and the result of the trip (accident/no accident). Practically, this random sample is very difficult to acquire so you will likely need a workaround to get pseudo-absences, but this is a different question in and of itself.
