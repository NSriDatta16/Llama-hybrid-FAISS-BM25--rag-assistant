All of this manual encoding and decoding is unnecessary. The HTML is lying to you when it says that the page is encoded in windows-1255; the server says it's serving UTF-8, and it is. Blame Microsoft HTML-generation tools. Anyway, since the server does return the correct encoding, this works: my $response = LWP::UserAgent->new->get("http://www.msn.co.il/"); my $content = $res->decoded_content; $content is now a perl character string, ready to do whatever you need. If you want to convert it to some other encoding, then calling Encode::encode on it is appropriate; do not use Encode::decode as it's already been decoded once.
