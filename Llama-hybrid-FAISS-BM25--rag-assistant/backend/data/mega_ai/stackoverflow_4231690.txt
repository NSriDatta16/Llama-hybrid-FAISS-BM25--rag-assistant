What's the appropriate collection for calculating a running mean?

I'm sifting through some of my old bugs and while reviewing some nasty code I realized that my averaging or smoothing algorithm was pretty bad. I did a little research which led me to the "running mean" - makes sense, pretty straightforward. I was thinking through a possible implementation and realized that I don't know which collection would provide the type of "sliding" functionality that I need. In other words, I need to push/add an item to the end of the collection and then also pop/remove the first item from the collection. I think if I knew what this was called I could find the correct collection but I don't know what to search for. Ideally a collection where you set the max size and anything added to it that exceeds that size would pop off the first item. To illustrate, here is what I came up with while messing around: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { LinkedList samples = new LinkedList (); // Simulate packing the front of the samples, this would most like be a pre-averaged // value from the raw samples for (int i = 0; i As you can see I am manually handling the removal of the first item. I'm just asking if there is a standard collection that is optimized for this type of use?
