They're not the same quantity. One is geometric mean and the other is arithmetic, but in an empirical setup the difference can be indistinguishable. Important! - since we're talking about the values I assume we're dealing with estimator of the first moment, not the first moment itself. The first moment is a characteristic of the distribution (population), it's unknown. We can estimate it though. Its common estimator is the arithmetic average $\bar x=(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n \ln x_i$ The geometric mean is given by formula $\mu=(\prod_{i=1}^n x_i)^{1/n}=\exp \left[(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n \ln x_i\right]$ So, clearly $\mu\ne\bar x$ , hence geometric mean is not equal to the arithmetic average. I've been careful so far to not make a statement about relation of geometric mean and first moment because the latter cannot be known, only its estimator can be calculator. Moreover, there usually are multiple estimators of the same population parameter, that are optimal under different conditions. So, here's the punchline. In empirical setup the geometric mean can be as good of an estimator of the first moment as a more common arithmetic average. Particularly, when there is high degree of uncertainty about the variance of the distribution.
