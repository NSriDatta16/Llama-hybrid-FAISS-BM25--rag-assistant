Interpretation of Relative Difference in Differences Results with Relative Units

I am writing a paper using a difference-in-differences analysis. My control and treatment groups are groups of 7 or 6 states that either do not or do undergo a certain policy. I ran my difference-in-differences regression and ended up with the equation I am confused on the interpretation of my results for the actual DID coefficient of .022. This is because average spending is measured relative to the month of January 2020. Any help on the interpretation of this coefficient would be much appreciated. Thank you.
