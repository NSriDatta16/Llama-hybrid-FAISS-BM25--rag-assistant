Conditional structure with 4 conditionals in JAGS

I'm using JAGS for Bayesian estimation. Ideally, I would like to define 4 different scenarios (x=a, x=b, x=c, x=d). Depending on the scenario, some different actions should be done. My problem is that JAGS seems to lack if-else statements that serve to control flow. How should I write a conditional statement with four options?
