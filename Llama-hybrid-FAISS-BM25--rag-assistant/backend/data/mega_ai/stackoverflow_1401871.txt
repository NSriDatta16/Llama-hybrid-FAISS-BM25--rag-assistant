Tab Bar on TableView?

Expecting your well advice! I have a TableView(Grouped Table created via I.B). I'm showing some data on the table when code executes using Navigation Controller view. I want to add a "Tab Bar" in my Table view whether through I.B (or) Programmatically. For ex: Launch built-in "Clock" app, where you can see a Tab Bar which has options of 'World Clock', 'Alarm', 'Stop Watch' and 'Timer' in single view itself. I tried to create like same by adding a 'Tab Bar' in I.B, but drag and drop of Tab Bar doesn't sit in the Table View. I don't know why. (or) else i even tried programmatically to create it in the Table View, but not succeeded. Is it not possible? Can anyone please help me on pointing out the code or samples? thanks. Calve/
