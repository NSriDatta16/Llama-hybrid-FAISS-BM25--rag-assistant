The order in which you enter the variables (into a single model) does not matter. The logistic regression model of a binary response, $Y$, with three predictors $X_{1},X_{2},X_{3}$ - $$ \log \left( \frac{ P(Y=1) }{ P(Y=0) } \right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \beta_{3} X_{3} $$ will give identical results to the "re-arranged" logistic regression model $$ \log \left( \frac{ P(Y=1) }{ P(Y=0) } \right) = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} X_{2} + \alpha_{2} X_{3} + \alpha_{3} X_{1} $$ with the coefficients re-arranged appropriately. Here some R code that verifies this: x1=rnorm(100) x2=rnorm(100) x3=rnorm(100) y=-.3 + .5*x1 + 1.2*x2 - .75*x3 + rlogis(100) y=(y>0) g1=glm(y~x1+x2+x3,family="binomial") g2=glm(y~x2+x3+x1,family="binomial") summary(g1) summary(g2) The code generates from the model $$ \log \left( \frac{ P(Y=1) }{ P(Y=0) } \right) = -.3 + .5 X_{1} + 1.2 X_{2} - .75 X_{3} $$ The estimates for the coefficients of $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ (and their significance) is the same regardless of what order you put the variables in. I'm not sure why you'd be finding results that disagree with this. A coding error may be the culprit. Edit: Based on the comment discussion, it appears that perhaps you are using a categorical predictor and the variables you're including are dummy variables, indicating levels of the predictor. In that case, the order does matter because, in R , the first one entered will be chosen as the "reference" level of the variable and all comparisons are made with respect to it. So, if you change the reference level, you also change the thing the coefficients are being compared to, therefore the estimates and $p$-values can certainly change.
