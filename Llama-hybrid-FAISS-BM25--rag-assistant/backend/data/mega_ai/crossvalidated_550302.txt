First of all, supervised learning is commonly used in recommender systems. One of the most popular examples of recommender system model is matrix factorization, where we predict ratings of items by the users (labels!). Basic models like matrix factorization are often extended by including additional features , such models do not differ very much from any other supervised machine learning model. Standard machine learning models are sometimes used for this purpose, but they often underperform as compared to the models designed for this purpose.
