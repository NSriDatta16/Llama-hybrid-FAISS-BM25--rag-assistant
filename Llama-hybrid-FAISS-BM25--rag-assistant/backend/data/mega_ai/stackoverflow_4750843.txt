How to create a Wufoo-like (form builder) web application with JQuery and Rails?

I'm looking for some guidance on how to implement a Wufoo-like builder in a Rails 3 application with JQuery on the client side. Basically allow a user to build something (a form in the case of Wufoo) in "offline" mode then save all user edits to the server in one batch by clicking a Save button or similar (e.g. could be an auto-save triggered by the browser every 30s or so). I'm leaning towards using the HTML5 local storage at this point. The "builder" would essentially store user edits locally in the browser local storage in JSON format. A click on the Save button would then HTTP Post the content of the local storage to the Rails app, again in JSON format. Does this sound about right? Any advice, suggestions? Some additional considerations/questions: What about older browsers that do not support HTML5? Should there be a fallback plan that uses cookie storage? Any JQuery plugin that can help with some of this? e.g. abstract HTML5 local storage as primary storage and cookie storage as secondary/fallback storage. Any Rails-specific considerations to be aware of? Note: The following question addresses WYSIWYG form builder specifically and doesn't really provide any good solution. Creating WYSIWYG form builder (รก la Wufoo) in Rails Thanks!
