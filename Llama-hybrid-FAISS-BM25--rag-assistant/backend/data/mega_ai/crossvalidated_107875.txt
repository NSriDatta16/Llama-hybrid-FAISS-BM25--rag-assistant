Sounds like an interesting set-up. Just to re-state your plan, you're creating two populations -- healthy and Alzheimer's. You ten plan to use a 5-fold cross-validation method on only the healthy group. You then plan to fit a model to the training portion of the fold and finally compare the error when applied to the testing portion of the fold versus the Alzheimer's. If that's correct, I think the simplest approach would be to train your 5 models, apply them against the respective testing sets as well as the Alzheimer's pool. At least initially I would look at the comparison between populations on a per-fold basis. If the results are consistent, I think you're in fine shape. Otherwise, you might do a comparison of the coefficients of the various models you've trained. I would only follow-up on the penultimate paragraph if your results are very strange.
