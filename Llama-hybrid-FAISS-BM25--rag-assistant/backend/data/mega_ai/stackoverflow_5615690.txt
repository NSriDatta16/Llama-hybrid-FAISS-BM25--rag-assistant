Without any other context, this seems like a textbook problem. If you're using C, you could do it this way: char *myptr = my_given_addr; myptr[0] = 0x90; myptr[1] = 0x90; myptr[2] = 0x90; There's probably a more elegant solution but this gets the general gist. I'm new to SO... is there a homework tag?
