C# LINQ Ignoring empty values in datatable

I have a datatable that I have grouped as follows: var result = from data in view.AsEnumerable() group data by new {Group = data.Field ("group_no")} into grp select new { Group = grp.Key.Group, PRAS = grp.Average(c => Convert.ToDouble(c.Field ("pAKT Total"))) }; Now, the average function is also counting the empty cells in it's calculation. For example, there are 10 cells with only 5 populated with values. I want the average to be the sum of the 5 values divided by 5. How can I ensure that it does what I want? Thanks.
