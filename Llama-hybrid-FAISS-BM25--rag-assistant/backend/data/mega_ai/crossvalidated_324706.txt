On-policy methods estimate the value of a policy while using it for control. In off-policy methods, the policy used to generate behaviour, called the behaviour policy, may be unrelated to the policy that is evaluated and improved, called the estimation policy. An advantage of this seperation is that the estimation policy may be deterministic (e.g. greedy), while the behaviour policy can continue to sample all possible actions. For further details, see sections 5.4 and 5.6 of the book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Barto and Sutton, first edition.
