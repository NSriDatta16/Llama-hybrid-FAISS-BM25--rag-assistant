Causal impact relies on two ideas: (i) Kalman Filters and (ii) Bayesian Variable selection. Both of these ideas can easily be extended to multidimensional settings. Koopman and Durbin (2012) is the foremost textbook on Kalman Filters. To answer your question, Causal Impact does not allow for multiple outputs. It's possible but would require someone re-deriving the underlying distributions of Causal Impact for a multivariate case. If you have some free time in a PhD, go for it! Otherwise, have you considered looking at frequentist approaches like gsynth by Xu (2017)?
