AVG is a grouping function, which means it will sum all the rows in the table and divide by the row count. But it sounds like you want the average of two different columns, reported individually for each row. In that case, you should just compute it yourself: (date1+date2)/2. (MySQL may want some extra syntax to add those columns properly.) The code you've written will give you the table's average elapsed time between date1 and date2.
