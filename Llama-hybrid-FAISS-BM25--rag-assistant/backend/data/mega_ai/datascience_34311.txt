GAN for inpainting an image

Is it possible to train a GAN model to inpaint an image taken from a specific setting(e.g. an office, woods, beach ...) after we have cropped out people of it? For example, I used this repo 's pretrained GAN model on Places2 I used a MaskRCNN model to segment people, and then cropped them out : But when I fed the image to the mentioned GAN model, results weren't so great : If it's possible, what is the best GAN architecture to use?
