I think it depends on the attitude that already exists. If there are many conflicts, then removing all the names is useful, because the code stands for itself. However, if the names are put on the tests (as with code) then the developer is taking ownership. Taking ownership is always a good thing because it encourages the developer to make it as perfect as possible. It also helps when you need to ask a question about the test, or if the test is failing, and you can't figure out why, you'll be able to ask the expert on the subject. However, if there is a darker atmosphere, more about developers who are defensive, and are trying to undermine each other, then the names will cause them to focus on 'who made this code wrong' or 'this test failed because X coded it badly' rather than focusing on the error that the test might be detecting. So there's always a balance when explicitly attaching names to tests like that. And as Andy mentioned, there's always source control if you REALLY need to know who wrote something.
