This issue was mentioned for a migration from drools 3.06 to 4.0.7 , so what version of eclipse and drools are you using? This might be related to a classpath issue : Using the debugger I realized that the Drools PackageBuilder tried to load the classes from the Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(); This ClassLoader does not contain my agent classes! Even the system class loader does not contain my classes. The solution was: Instead of creating plain PackageBuilder and RuleBase instances, one has to create them with a PackageBuilderConfiguration and a RuleBaseConfiguration both with the current classLoader configured: ClassLoader classLoader = this.getClass().getClassLoader(); PackageBuilderConfiguration configuration = new PackageBuilderConfiguration(); configuration.setClassLoader(classLoader); PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder(configuration); builder.addPackageFromDrl(source); RuleBaseConfiguration ruleBaseConfiguration = new RuleBaseConfiguration(); ruleBaseConfiguration.setClassLoader(classLoader); ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase(ruleBaseConfiguration); ruleBase.addPackage(builder.getPackage());
