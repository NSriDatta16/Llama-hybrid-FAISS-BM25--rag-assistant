XGBoost Predictions

I am working on a multi-class classification task for 24 classes using XGBoost. I am training the model as follows: param = {'max_depth': max_depth, 'eta': learning_rate, 'silent': 1, 'objective': 'multi:softmax', 'num_class': 24} bst = xgb.train(param, dtrain, num_round) bst = xgb.Booster({'nthread': 4}) predictions = bst.predict(dval) I am getting the predictions as this array: [ 0.5 0.5 0.5 ..., 0.5 0.5 0.5] I don't know why it's predicting all classes as 0.5 instead of one of the indices in 0 to 23. Do I need to use any other objective parameter?
