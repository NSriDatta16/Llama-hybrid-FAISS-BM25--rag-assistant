To your main point, in Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd ed., 93), Gelman also writes From the perspective of Bayesian data analysis, we can often interpret classical point estimates as exact or approximate posterior summaries based on some implicit full probability model. In the limit of large sample size, in fact, we can use asymptotic theory to construct a theoretical Bayesian justification for classical maximum likelihood inference. So perhaps it's not Bayesians who should "admit" that there are, in truth, single real parameter values, but frequentists who should appeal to Bayesian statistics to justify their estimation procedures! (I say this with tongue firmly in cheek.) As an aside, I object to the blanket statement that Bayesian statistics is premised on subjective probability, and implication that Bayes is subjective while other inferential paradigms are not. That is certainly one argument that can be posed, perhaps also including the perspective of the "coherence of bets" argument, but see Gelman who here defines "Bayesian" as a statistician that uses the posterior distribution $\Pr(\theta|y)$ , and here where he argues against overly restrictive definitions. But the idea that there are single parameters in nature or in social systems is just a simplifying assumption. There might be some ornate process generating observable results, but discovering that system is incredibly complicated; supposing that there is a single fixed parameter value simplifies the problem dramatically. I think that this cuts to the core of your question: Bayesians shouldn't have to "admit" to making this simplification any more than Frequentists should.
