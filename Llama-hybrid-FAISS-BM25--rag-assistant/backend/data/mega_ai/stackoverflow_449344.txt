ASP.NET DataList - defining "columns/rows" when repeating horizontal and using flow layout

Here is my DataList: [Contents Removed] This generates markup that has each item wrapped in a span. From there, I'd like to break each of these spans out into rows of three columns. Ideally I would like something like this: Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Item 6 [etc] The closest I can get to this is to set RepeatColumns to "3" and then a is inserted after every three items in the DataList. Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Item 6 This gets me kind of close, but really doesn't do the trick - I still can't control the layout the way I'd like to be able to. Can anyone suggest a way to make this better? If I could implement the above example - that would be perfect, however I'd accept a less elegant solution as well - as long as its more flexible than (such as inserting a instead of ).
