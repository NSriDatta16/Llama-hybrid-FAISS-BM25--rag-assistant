How to choose estimates after Bayesian regression?

In a Bayesian logistic regression with two predictor variables $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ , I did MCMC (2000 samples) to estimate posterior distribution. Now it's done, how can I choose the final estimates for $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ ? Do I choose the $\beta_{1}$ which corresponds to the mode of the 2000 samples of $\beta_{1}$ (could be the 47th sample for example) and do the same for $\beta_{2}$ (could be the 1628th)? If yes, I don't understand as I thought the estimates found on sample $i$ are not independent of each other, aren't they? I mean, $\beta_{1}^{i}$ (the $\beta_{1}$ estimate on sample $i$ ) depends on $\beta_{2}^{i}$ , no? It seems to me it would be more correct to choose the couple $(\beta_{1}^{i},\beta_{2}^{i})$ that maximizes some quantity, am I wrong?
