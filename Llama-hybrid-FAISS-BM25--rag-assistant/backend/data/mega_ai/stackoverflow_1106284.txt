Setting proportional image widths for browser resize

If I have an image combined with a style: img.test { width: 50%;} The image resizes to 50% the width of the box containing it, as well as resizing vertically, maintaining the aspect ratio. This seems to require the enclosing DIV to be set to a particular width and height value. But if you want the enclosing DIV to resize automatically as the browser is dragged smaller or larger, wouldn't this be a problem?
