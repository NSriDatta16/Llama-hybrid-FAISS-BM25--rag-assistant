The two approaches should give the same answers in the discrete case. But you canâ€™t literally apply the second method in the continuous case and get something useful, assuming the values of B are distinct, as they would be in general. So in the continuous case, you could use logistic regression. Alternatively, you could extend approach #2 by doing the same computation over observations with similar values of B; for example, within some range of B. This is a nonparametric approach, in contrast to the parametric approach of logistic regression, and it's essentially a kind of local regression.
