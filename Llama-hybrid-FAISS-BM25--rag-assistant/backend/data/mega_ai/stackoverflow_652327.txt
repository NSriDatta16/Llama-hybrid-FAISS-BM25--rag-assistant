The training process of a back-propagation neural network works by minimizing the error from the optimal result. But having a trained neural network finding the minimum of an unknown function would be pretty hard. If you restrict the problem to a specific function class, it could work, and be pretty quick too. Neural networks are good at finding patterns, if there are any.
