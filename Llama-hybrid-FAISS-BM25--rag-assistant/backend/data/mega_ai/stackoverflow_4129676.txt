Taxonomy is for organizing your content. You can create either a fixed or fluid vocabulary list and attach it to your content type. Content types are not limited as to the number of vocabulary lists that can be attached. If you want a particular content type to only appear on the front page, than from the content type administration page (admin -> content management -> content types) set your work flow options to be promoted to front page. You can also just selectively choose which 'article' you want to appear by setting this option when you create the content. No need for a vocabulary with this. Views, of course, gives you much more power and flexibility. I've used views and hidden vocabulary lists to filter content on several sites. Very easy to do.
