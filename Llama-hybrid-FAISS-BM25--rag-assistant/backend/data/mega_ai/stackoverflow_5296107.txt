I would explain this through the usage. Abstract class can be used when there is only one hierarchy, additionally without default implementation; while interface can be used across hierarchies (horizontally), often referred to as a behavior. Interface is also an abstraction and in c# substitutes multiple class inheritance, so this may be confusing, but you have to distinguish when to use what. Hope this helps, Robert
