You can work around cross-domain restrictions by using a technique called "script tag injection". That is, you can manipulate the document to insert a tag with a "src" attribute pointing to an off-site domain, along with whatever query string parameters you wish to pass. When you inject the a tag like the one shown above into your document, the browser will hit that URL to retrieve whatever might be there; and you can take the opportunity within "someScript" to save the passed value, or whatever else it is you wish to do. Fortunately, you're not the first person to run into this problem, and much of the hard work has already been done. Take a look at jQuery's $.ajax() method, which has built-in support for JSONP . This will allow you to easy leverage the technique.
