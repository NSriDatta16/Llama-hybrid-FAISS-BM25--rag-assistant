At least in C++0x, you can rely on all zero-initialization being performed before any other initialization code runs. From the C++0x FCD, section [basic.start.init] Variables with static storage duration (3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place. If you're considering using this variable from other initialization code, then an explicit constructor would be a big mistake, as it would run sometime mixed in with other initialization code, and overwrite whatever changes have already been made by other initializers.
