Cross-process interaction under C++

Please help, how can I organize the process-process data exchange (in Windows, if that matters)? I have process1.exe which calls process2.exe with a few command line arguments. I want to track "progress" of process2 from process1 (say, some int value). It (that int value) can be accessed from process1 permanently or each X ms - doesn't matter. Will be useful any solution: WinApi or Qt. Thank you everybody! All answers are very useful! :) Many thanks!!
