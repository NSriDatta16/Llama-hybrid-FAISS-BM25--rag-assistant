Inverse Gamma Posterior variance derivation in Tobit model

I have a doubt about the posterior distribution of the variance parameter for the Tobit model as provided by Koop, Poierier, Tobias (2007) in "Bayesian Econometrics Methods" page 221 . Posteriors for parameters in Tobit model are derived by using the auxiliary variable: $$y_z=Dz+(1-D)y $$ where $D=1$ when observations $y$ are censored and $z$ are latent data: $z_i=x_i\beta+\epsilon_i$ with $\epsilon_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. Given the prior on variance $ IG(a,b)$, the posterior is directly provided as: $$ \sigma^{2}|\beta,z,y\sim IG\left[\frac{n}{2}+a,\:\left(\frac{\sum_{i}(y_{z_{i}}-x_{i}\beta)^{2}}{2}+b^{-1}\right)^{-1}\right] $$ When I try to derive it, I use the normality assumption on the latent variable and, because of the conjugacy with the inverse gamma prior for variance, its posterior turns out to be: $$ \sigma^{2}|\beta,z,y\sim IG\left[\frac{n}{2}+a,\:\frac{\sum_{i}(y_{z_{i}}-x_{i}\beta)^{2}}{2}+b\right] $$ Why should it instead be like the first one? What is the density for $y_z$ that they use? I guess it is because I am neglecting somehow the censoring and considering variable $y_z$ as it were an uncensored one, so that my posterior for $\sigma^2$ has the same form of that for a regression with continuous dependent variable. My doubt is feeded by the fact that the posterior for $\beta$ they provide is actually the same as that for a regression with uncensored dependent variable, except for the use of $y_z$ instead of $y$. Thanks
