jQuery UI Sortable php/mysql

I have been working on a sortable list. I want to implement a sortable list like this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists-through-tabs It is the ajax communication, that I'm really stuck with. I have set up a jsfiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/pnrAx/ , showing my current code. (Note, it is copy and paste with loads of junk, cleanup needed) The fields, updating the information on each row are working fine, no problems there. The sorting also works on the screen, I can drag-n-drop items nicely. To boil the problem down, how can I get the sorted elements from the page, with ajax (json?), into an array on a php page? From there, it should be pretty easy to update the table.
