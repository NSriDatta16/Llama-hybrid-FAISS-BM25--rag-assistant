The problems that we usually face, are that (a) we don't have enough data to estimate the conditional distribution in multivariate scenario (curse of dimensionality) and (b) we want to extrapolate beyond the data we've seen. Regression models solve both problems by approximating the distribution (it's expectation) with a linear model. So assuming that you have enough data for precise estimate of the empirical distribution, it could work better then logistic regression if the relation is far from linear. On another hand, it will not let you extrapolate.
