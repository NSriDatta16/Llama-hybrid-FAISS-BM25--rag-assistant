The heading "negative binomial regression" is a puzzle here as the distribution is defined only on the grades 0, ..., 6, so can't be negative binomial on that ground alone. However, your calculation of the discrete probability distribution strikes me as exactly right and that suggests showing two histograms, which is only a step away from your probability distributions. It would be widely conventional to show bars with a little space between them to show that the scale is discrete. In fact some would go further and prefer the bars to be shrunk to spikes. In the thread pointed to by Dimitriy Masterov, the proposals of table-like plots are essentially identical in spirit. A Mann-Whitney test is quite encouraging here. This isn't, in my view, a correlation problem at all. You have two distributions of ordinal (graded) variables.
