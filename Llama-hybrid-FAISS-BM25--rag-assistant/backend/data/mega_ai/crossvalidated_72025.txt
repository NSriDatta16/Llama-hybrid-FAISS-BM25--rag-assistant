Probability of always more heads than tails

A coin that comes up heads with probability $p$ is flipped $n$ consecutive times. What is the probability that starting with the first flip there are always more heads than tails that have appeared? I have seen hints that this is Bertrand's ballot problem in disguise . Here is my attempt: Let $X$ be the number of heads in $n$ tosses with a coin of probability $p$. Let $Y$ be the number of tails. Let $s=\text{floor}(n/2)+1$ $\begin{align*}P(\text{Always more heads}) &= \sum_{k=0}^n P(\text{Always more heads}|X=k)P(X=k)\\ &= \sum_{k=s}^n P(\text{Always more heads}|X=k)P(X=k)\\ &= \sum_{k=s}^n \dfrac{k-(n-k)}{k+n-k}{n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\ &= \sum_{k=s}^n \dfrac{2k-n}{n}{n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} \end{align*}$ That doesn't seem very simple too me. Is there a better way to do this? Thanks.
