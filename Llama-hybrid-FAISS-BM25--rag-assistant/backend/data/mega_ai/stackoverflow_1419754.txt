Use uri fragments as the link addresses for the gwt view locations and implement a history listener. With this approach your gwt app does not bind events to the menu and instead just responds to the uri fragment changing (via history listener) As an example the links in the menu might point to: /staticPage1.html /staticPage2.html /gwt.html#token1 /gwt.html#token2 Then you can have some links in the menu point to non-gwt pages and other point to a page that hosts your gwt app. Your history listener can then trigger the views in your gwt app. I am currently using this approach with a css menu and gwt.
