You need to calculate the running average of the values. To do this you need to store the last n values in an array, and then push and pop values off the array when ever you read the accelerometer data. Here is some pseudocode: const SIZE = 10; float[] xVals = new float[SIZE]; float xAvg = 0; function runAverage(float newX){ xAvg += newX/SIZE; xVals.push(newX); if(xVals.length > SIZE){ xAvg -= xVals.pop()/SIZE; } } You need to do this for all three axis. Play around with the value of SIZE; the larger it is, the smoother the value, but the slower things will seem to respond. It really depends on how often you read the accelerometer value. If it is read 10 times per second, then SIZE = 10 might be too large.
