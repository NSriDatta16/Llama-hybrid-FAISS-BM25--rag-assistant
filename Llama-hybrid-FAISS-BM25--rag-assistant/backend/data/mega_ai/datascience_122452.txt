Survival analysis on time series data for predictive maintenance

I want to train a survival analysis model for predictive maintenance on an asset (confidential, let's say it's a motor). The dataset consists of hourly readings of multiple sensors, the type of motor, motor ID, and whether it failed or not. The dataset is mostly right-censored. As such, we have the following example of a hypothetical dataset: index | time | motor ID | motor type | vibrations | temperature | failed 0,12-01-2023 09.00, 1, type1, 1531564, 19, 0 0,12-01-2023 10.00, 1, type1, 153, 19, 0 0,12-01-2023 11.00, 1, type1, 19235651, 19, 0 # right censored 0,12-01-2023 9.00, 2, type2, 205654684, 19, 0 0,12-01-2023 10.00, 2, type2, 205654684, 19, 0 0,12-01-2023 11.00, 2, type2, 205654684, 19, 0 0,12-01-2023 12.00, 2, type2, 205654684, 19, 1 # failed How would you input this time series data into a Survival Analysis model in Python, such as Cox Proportial Hazard Rate or GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis ? I see some examples around that convert this time series into one row with multiple lag features, but this drastically increases the number of features in the dataset.
