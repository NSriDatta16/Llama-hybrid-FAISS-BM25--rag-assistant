I want the background to be visible where the foreground picture has no color(or White). You have two choices, the simplest one is to use alpha testing and add an alpha channel for your foreground image so that each white pixel (or no color zones) has a special value, let' say 0.0f and all other 1.0f. Then when rendering the foreground you enable alpha testing with glEnable(GL_ALPHA_TEST) and set alpha function with glAlphaFunc(GL_GREATER, 0.5f) This will accept/draw only fragments that have an alpha value greater than 0.5f and discard/not draw all fragments that have an alpha value less than 0.5f. Second choice is to use blending as you did, but you will need also to add extra alpha channel to your foreground and set glBlendFunc properly.
