There are at least two possibilities: The parameterization of the categorical variable may not be what you think it is. SAS PROC LOGISTIC, in particular, has defaults that are (to me and many other) counter intuitive in many cases. R can also do some counterintuitive things with factors. If that isn't it, then bear in mind that your logistic regression has other variables included. So, it is controlling for those variables. This has been discussed here multiple times.
