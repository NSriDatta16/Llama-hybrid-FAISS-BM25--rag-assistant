I would suggest you look at CloudIQ Storage from Appistry. Its a fully distributed data store that runs on commodity hardware. You can define the number of copies of a file it maintains across nodes on a file by file basis. So if you write a file once, but have many concurrent reads, you can set the value of N (number of copies of a file) to a large number to get greater concurrency. The system implements a REST based interface for PUT's and GET's, and meta data is returned in JSON, so there are many good libraries available in .NET.
