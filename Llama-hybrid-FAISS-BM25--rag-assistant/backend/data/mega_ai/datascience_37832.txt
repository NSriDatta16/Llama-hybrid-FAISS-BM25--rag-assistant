Deep learning model performance for different datasets?

I have a question that my single deep neural network model gives above 90% accuracy for one data set and the same model gives an accuracy between 70-80% for the other data set. I want to know why this variation in accuracy happens in spite of the fact that i am using the same deep neural network model.
