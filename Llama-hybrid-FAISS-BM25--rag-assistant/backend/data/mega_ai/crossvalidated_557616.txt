You've invented something very much akin to permutation testing . This is often done by Computing the statistic of interest between the true groups. Randomly shuffling the data into "surrogate" groups. Recomputing the statistic on those groups. Repeat steps 2-3 a large number of times (or until you've exhausted all possible permutations of the data) Compare the true different from Step 1 against the distribution of surrogate differences created in Steps 2-4. The shuffled data literally implements the null hypothesis--you know there's no difference between the surrogate groups because you've randomly assigned points to them. The differences between different surrogate groups, collected across many repetitions, therefore provide a distribution of your chosen statistic under the mean. A "significant" difference, in the NHST sense, would be way out in the tails of that distribution. Bootstraping is a related concept, more aimed at assess uncertainty than inference. I found Randomization, Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology by Manley and Alberto to be really helpful (you do not need much biology background to make sense of it).
