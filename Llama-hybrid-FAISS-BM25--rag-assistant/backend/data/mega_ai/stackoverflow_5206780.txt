PHP: Average of multi-dimensional array

I'm trying to build a tool to average values from a multidimensional array in PHP. Array sample: $t[1][1]=2; $t[1][2]=3; $t[2][1]=5; $t[3]=6; $t[4][1][1]=9; $t[4][1][2]=10; $t[4][2][1]=12; $t[4][2][2]=13; Notice, too, that parents have no value (Since they have children). I have this: function chklevel($s) { $l = explode(".",$s); } Which gives me the ability to call chklevel as chklevel("4.2.2") and have it return 13, but I also want to be able to call chklevel("4") and have it return 11 (Which is the average of 4.1.1(9), 4.1.2(10), 4.2.1(12) and 4.2.2(13). Any thoughts?
