How should I present a cost field to the user, and store it in the database?

Right now I have two fields for cost. One for dollars and one for cents. This works, but it is a bit ugly. It also doesn't allow the user to enter the term "free" or "no cost" if they want. But if I only have one field, I might have to make my parser a bit smarter. What do you think? On the server side, I combine dollars and cents to store them as decimals in my database. Mainly so that I can gather statistics (cost averages, etc.) quickly. Do you think it is better to store the cost as a string? Then whenever I actually use the cost for stats or other purposes, I would convert it to a decimal at that point. Or am I on the right track?
