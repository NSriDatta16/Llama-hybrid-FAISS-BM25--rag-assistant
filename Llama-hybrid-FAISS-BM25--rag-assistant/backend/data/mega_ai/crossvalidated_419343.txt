If you know some of the standard errors but not all of them, here is a solution: (1) assume the unknown SE is drawn randomly from the same distribution as the known SE's or let the distribution of the SE of the estimates of the papers with unknown SE be a free variable. If you want to be fancy, you can use model averaging over these options. (2) estimate via maximum likelihood If your study with unknown SE is an 'outlier' the model will explain the anomaly in a combination of these ways: (a) the study likely had a high SE for its estimate (the study likely has low power) (b) the study likely has a large random effect component (the researcher picked a data set or method etc. which gives an atypical result) In effect, this model will reduce the effective precision of the estimate with unknown SE as it becomes more anomalous. In this respect it is highly robust to the inclusion of 'outliers'. At the same time, if you add lots of studies with unknown variance but with results that are typical, the SE or your final estimate will fall.
