How to change Image Loading Order (for Lightbox)

I've got a page with a lot of images (thumbnails). You should be able to expand the images via Lightbox. I need to encourage the browser to load the image in the Lightbox before any other image (thumbnail). I remember some articles (I can't find anymore) on how to influence the loading mechanism of the browser (use a different subdomain to allow another thread), but I'd like to know whether there might be other options (i.e. without additional subdomains). To clarify the issue: Example (how I'd like it to behave) I visit the page I click on the 3rd picture thumbnail The 3rd picture is shown (while the remaining thumbnails are loading) Example (how it behaves right now) I visit the page I click on the 3rd picture thumbnail A spinning wheel is shown until all thumbnails are loaded The 3rd picture is shown Are there any tutorials/papers/views on this issue?
