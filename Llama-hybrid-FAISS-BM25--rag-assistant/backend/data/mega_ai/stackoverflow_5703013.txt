Large Scale Image Classifier

I have a large set of plant images labeled with the botanical name. What would be the best algorithm to use to train on this dataset in order to classify an unlabel photo? The photos are processed so that 100% of the pixels contain the plant (e.g. either closeups of the leaves or bark), so there are no other objects/empty-space/background that the algorithm would have to filter out. I've already tried generating SIFT features for all the photos and feeding these (feature,label) pairs to a LibLinear SVM, but the accuracy was a miserable 6%. I also tried feeding this same data to a few Weka classifiers. The accuracy was a little better (25% with Logistic, 18% with IBk), but Weka's not designed for scalability (it loads everything into memory). Since the SIFT feature dataset is a several million rows, I could only test Weka with a random 3% slice, so it's probably not representative. EDIT: Some sample images:
