Objective reasons for using a wiki tool over Sharepoint?

Duplicate Developer Documentation: Sharepoint Document Management vs. ScrewTurn Wiki I have been tasked with picking a wiki tool for a development organization, comprised of several different development teams. Sharepoint is installed and upper management would prefer this to be used, but in the past it has only used when PMs are forced to use it. None of the developers will update it with content that needs to be shared. I developed in Sharepoint and I liked it, so I have nothing against it. But for this to work I need something I can get everyone using, so Sharepoint will not work. Step one is to convince management why Sharepoint will not work. We need the typical wiki features: WYSIWYG, Clean interface, Easy to use, Attach Files to pages, Support for groups of users, Open source, Hosted Locally. (Maybe others I am not considering now?) Can anyone provide a list of objective reasons why Sharepoint is not the solution we can use to take our first step? There are many such products out there so step 2 should be easier.
