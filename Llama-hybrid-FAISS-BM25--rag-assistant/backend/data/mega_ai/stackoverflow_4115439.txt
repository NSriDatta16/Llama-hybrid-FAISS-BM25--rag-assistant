Not the answer you are hoping for, bit not AFAIK (unless you handle all the xsd ect manually, which is a lot of work). The most pragmatic option (to expose such an enum) is probably to introduce a dummy method that includes the enum, but which you never expect to be called in reality (just throw an Exception).
