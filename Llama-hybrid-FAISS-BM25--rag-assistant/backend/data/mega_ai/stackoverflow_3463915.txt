What does it mean when IE reports two versions in UserAgent?

I'm seeing cases where the IE useragent string has multiple parts reporting to be different versions. For example: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; {B93AEBFF-7B72-44EA-B006-8CB078CC1911}; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) So this is claiming to be MSIE 8.0, but also MSIE 6.0 . Does this mean anything special? Is it a stock IE or is there something special about it? I ask because I'm seeing strange behavior with the browser that reports multiple versions but not with another IE8.0 that claims a single version: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C) Not sure if the useragent has anything to do with it, but I thought I'd ask. [Update] Note that I'm not coding against particular browser versions, I just noticed this as a difference between the browser that was behaving strangely and the ones that were not. I wanted to know what would cause some IE8.0's to report they're also IE6.0 others not.
