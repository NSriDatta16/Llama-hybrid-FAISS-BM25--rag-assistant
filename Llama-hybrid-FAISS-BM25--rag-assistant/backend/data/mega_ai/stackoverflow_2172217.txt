Delete specific row from database

I am trying to delete a specific row in database. Using the following query: Uri myUri = Uri.parse("content://com.idan.datastorageprovider/maps"); this.getContentResolver().delete(myUri, "ROUTE_NAME="+routeName,null); In my database I have 2 columns: ROUTE_NAME , ROUTE_PATH . I want to delete a row by the column ROUTE_NAME , while I give it a value of which row in that column I want to delete. I don't errors, but the row is still there.. What am I doing wrong? Thanks. Idan.
