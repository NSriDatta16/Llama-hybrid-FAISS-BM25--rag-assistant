Similarity between variables when using calibration curves

I'm reading through a text that is explaining calibration curves, and the following description is provided: To be well-calibrated, the probabilities must effectively reflect the true likelihood of the event of interest. Returning to the spam filter illustration, if a model produces a probability or probability-like value of 20 % for the likelihood of a particular e-mail to be spam, then this value would be well-calibrated if similar types of messages would truly be from that class on average in 1 of 5 samples. What I don't understand is the "similar types of messages" part. How do calibration curves determine similarity between observations?
