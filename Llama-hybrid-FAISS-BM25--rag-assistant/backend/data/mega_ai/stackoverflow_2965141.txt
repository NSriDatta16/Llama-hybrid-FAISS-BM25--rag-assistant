Making interactive touch objects on Android

I've never built a game before, and I've not programmed for Android before but am looking to do so over the summer by building a game. What type of object do I use for a shape that I want the user to be able to drag around the screen for instance using touch gestures? How do I tie together the MotionEvent, View and Graphics2D to make objects drawn on screen that can be interacted with? I imagine this will use ActionListeners / Handlers but I'm a bit confused at this stage... A simple breakdown of steps would be much appreciated. Thanks
