Delay function from running for n seconds then run it once. (2minute question)

TLDR I have a function that runs on the end of a pan in an openlayers map. Don't want it to fire continously. I have a function that runs on the end of panning a map. I want it so that it will not fire the function until say 3 secconds after the pan has finished. Although I don't want to queue up the function to fire 10 or so times like setTimeout is currently doing. How can I delay a function from running for n seconds then run it only once no matter how many times it has been called? map.events.register("moveend", map, function() { setTimeout(SetLocation, 5000); }); Moveend: moveend - triggered after a drag, pan, or zoom completes The code above even using setTimeout(func, delay); still fires multiple times when it runs. How can I prevent this?
