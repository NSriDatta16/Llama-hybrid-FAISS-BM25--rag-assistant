This code will work in all situations, and also performs the load at compile-time, as other modules you are building might depend on it: BEGIN { if ($^O eq "MSWin32") { require Module; Module->import(); # assuming you would not be passing arguments to "use Module" } } This is because use Module (qw(foo bar)) is equivalent to BEGIN { require Module; Module->import( qw(foo bar) ); } as described in perldoc -f use . (EDIT, a few years later...) This is even better though: use if $^O eq "MSWin32", Module; Read more about the if pragma here .
