What is a good method for applying grid search on ensemble models?

I built an experiment where i am studying the performance of ensemble models for a classification task. Basically, i'm comparing Random Forest with Adaboost. However, Adaboost is built with a mix of different base classifiers (i.e. neural networks + decision trees + any other classifier). I can explore Random Forest through grid search just varying the number of decision trees that are used. However, i have no clue about how to properly explore this "mixed" Adaboost models, since its performance doesn't vary only with the number of estimators, but also with the hyperparameters of the base classifiers as well. I mean, i could just explore the best hyperparameters for each classifier individually and then just run grid search varying the number of base classifiers, but the idea of using ensembles is that simpler classifiers - when combined - perform better than a single robust one. I'd like to know if anyone has a good method for this case. I'd like to combine many different classifiers with Adaboost.
