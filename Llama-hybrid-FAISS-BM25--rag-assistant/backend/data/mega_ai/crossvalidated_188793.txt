There are many details missing your question - however it appears to me that you are not talking about test set all. If you intend to demonstrate the generalizability of your model (which is primary use case for an ROC curve), you are expected to present the ROC derived from a test set, not validation or internal validation set. or an average ROC derived from multiple test sets. Hence it is important you find a way to generate test sets, and take it from there. A good reference to learn ROC analysis (and how to create average ROC curves) is: Fawcett, T. (2006).
