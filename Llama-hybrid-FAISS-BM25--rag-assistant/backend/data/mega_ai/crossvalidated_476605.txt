The way to do this as sketched above - " Another simple approach to handling continuous predictors is to bin your continuous variables " - is available in a ready-to-use webservice . Real-valued numeric variables are 'binned' while maximizing the retained discriminative performance with respect to the classifier outcomes to predict. After this preprocessing step, the classifier is built 'on-the-fly', and its generalization ability tested with N-fold cross validation . You can try this webservice yourself at Insight classifiers . When you want real insight into how classification takes place in your domain, you need to substitute continuous-valued classifiers such as neural networks and support-vector machines with discrete classifiers. A multivariate mixture distribution that comprises discrete and continuous predictive variables - any mapping of this to the classification outcomes involves complex probability integrals Egmont-Petersen et al . And in most classification domains, these probability densities are not Gaussian. So performance-retaining discretization of the predictive variables ensures a distribution-free (non-parametric) classifier, which is also a white-box . This means that you can comprehend the classifier and thereby the underlying domain.
