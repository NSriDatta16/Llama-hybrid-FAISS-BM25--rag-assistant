The rules of Java state that you should never pass 'this' to another method from its constructor, for the simple reason that the object has not been fully constructed. The object it references may be in an inconsistent state. I'm surprised that the actual 'this' reference is null, but not at all surprised that some member of 'this' is null when it is passed to setTopWorldAgent, and that the method is throwing the exception because of this. Usually you can get away with passing 'this' from constructors as long as you don't actually access any members or call methods for example if you want to set a reference to 'this' in another object. In this case of course the argument is unnecessary as the method already has a reference to 'this'.
