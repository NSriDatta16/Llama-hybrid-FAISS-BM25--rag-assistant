iis7 delegate windows authentication user to the application pool to access sql backend

The way our organization handles security is all based in SQL Server. Basically users are added to Active Directory Groups, then these groups are associated with databases. So i have an Intranet based Silverlight RIA application. It's config is set to use windows authentication and impersonation. The web server it is hosted on is set to use impersonation and windows authentication. As this application accesses a SQL Server back-end, how can i pass the authenticated users details to the application pool. So the application queries the database under their credentials? Or how can i query the database using their credentials through IIS 7. Thanks
