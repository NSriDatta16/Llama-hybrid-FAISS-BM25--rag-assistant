Yes, you'll need to do the same "trick". When you rename the referenced table, foreign key constraints still refer to it under its new name. Since SQLite doesn't support "DROP CONSTRAINT", you'll have to rebuild the referencing tables with the corrected foreign key constraints, too. In fact, you won't be able to drop the old table until you correct the foreign key references. As long as PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON; , SQLite3 won't let you drop a table that still has foreign keys referencing it.
