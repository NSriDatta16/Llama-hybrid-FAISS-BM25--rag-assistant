How can I highlight noisy patches in a time series?

I have lots of time series data - water levels and velocities vs time. It is the output from a hydraulic model simulation. As part of the review process to confirm that the model is performing as expected, I have to plot each time series to ensure that there are no "wobbles" in the data (see example minor wobble below). Using the modelling software's UI is a pretty slow and laborious way to check this data. I've therefore written a short VBA macro to import various bits of data from the model including results into Excel and plot them all at once. I'm hoping to write another short VBA macro to analyse the time series data and highlight any sections that are suspect. My only thought so far is that I could do some analysis on the slope of the data. Anywhere that the slope rapidly changes from being positive to negative multiple times within a given search window could be classed as unstable. Am I missing any simpler tricks? Essentially, a "stable" simulation should provide a very smooth curve. Any sudden changes are likely to be the result of an instability in the calculations.
