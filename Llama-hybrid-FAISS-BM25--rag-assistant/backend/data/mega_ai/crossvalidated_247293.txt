Who was W.I.E. Gates?

According to, e.g., this link , he is the author of the quote Then there is the man who drowned while crossing a stream that was, on average, 6 inches deep. The quote is to illustrate that location measures like the mean ought to be complemented with dispersion measures like the standard deviation. My question: who was (is?) W.I.E. Gates? My search only reveals his name in the context of this quote.
