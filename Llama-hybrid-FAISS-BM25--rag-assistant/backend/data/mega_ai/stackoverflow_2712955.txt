Facebook Graph API and ActionScript

I'm setting out to develop a number of Facebook applications/games, which make use of some Facebook user information and stores game info in a database backend etc, in ActionScript 3.0. How can one leverage the new Graph API Should I use JavaScript or PHP as a "middle layer" or should I go with the ActionScript Client Library ? Are there other libraries (Facebook / database / multiplayer related.) that could simplify the development of these Facebook games?
