You don't want your plot of Y conditional on X to be bimodal, as that suggests the regression isn't meaningful: the predicted response will be in the middle of the two modes, corresponding to neither. In other words, there is systematic variation remaining in the response after the effect of the X's has been removed. The exception is logistic regression with a binary response (event vs non-event), because the middle is meaningful in this case: it's the probability that an event occurs. But your data doesn't seem to fit this description.
