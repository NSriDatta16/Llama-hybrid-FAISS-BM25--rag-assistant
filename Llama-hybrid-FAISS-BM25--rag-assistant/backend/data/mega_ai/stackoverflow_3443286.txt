If your footer is simple like the one in the example, then you are in luck. When you know the height of the footer, either in px or em, you can absolutely position it at the bottom of the page and add the footer's height in bottom padding to #frame. If the footer is very fluid, then you will have trouble forcing it down and there is no properly elegant solution for the layout you are describing (flexbox will do it on WebKit and Gecko though; just wait until IE catches up).
