Macro to delete all repeated instances of text in word doc

I'm looking for a simple way to delete repeated text in a Word 2007 document. If there are some shortcuts with the Find/Replace commands, I'm not seeing it. Otherwise, can someone recommend how I might write a macro that works like the following: 1- Select a block of text (could be mulitple paragraphs, have bullet points, etc). 2- Run the macro or do the command. 3- The macro or command deletes all instances of the selected text block. Any insight here?
