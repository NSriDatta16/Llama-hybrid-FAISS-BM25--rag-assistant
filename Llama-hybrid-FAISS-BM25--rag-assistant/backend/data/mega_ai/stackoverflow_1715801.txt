Using YUI in Javascript, How do I draw overlays on datatable/ScrollingDataTable?

I need to draw overlays spanning one or more rows on YUI datatable/scrollingdatable based on the mouse activity ( drag and drop ). I have no issues with drawing overlays on top of datatable. But I want the overlays to be moving along with the rows when I scroll the datatable. As of now after drawing the overlays they remain static irrespective of the movement of the datatable scrollbar?
