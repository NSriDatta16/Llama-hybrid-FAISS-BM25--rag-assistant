I've never heard of Go, but I can tell you that Bamboo has some severe quirks. Depending on your source control system, your mileage may vary. It takes sort of a least common denominator approach to dealing with all the SCMs it hooks to, so for us using perforce, we lose out on some things we should be getting for free. Here are a couple of the annoying things that still have not been fixed: Setup a build agent to use a particular client (must already exist, of course, grr). Now suppose the client is rooted at c:\buildarea. You MUST manually create the c:\buildarea folder otherwise the agent will give you some ridiculous error about not being able to extract the files to the client root. Obviously 'p4 sync -c YOURCLIENT' would do that, but Bamboo does something dumber. Another thing that it can't do is properly build from an existing label. Let's say you have a cross platform build, and you want to build say linux and windows both from the same exact changelist/label, there is no trivial way to do that in Bamboo. You can fire off the builds at the same time and pray. You can have one sync out the files for the other, but there is no way to build using a label. One last thing that is a little dumb (but not terrible) is the way it sort of assumes everyone uses CVS in the way that it 'tags' builds. When a build contains a large number of changelists, rather than just call it a changelist and number it once, it lists the "version #" for every file in a changelist. Obviously, not a deal breaker, just a little odd for p4 users. All in all, none of these issues have killed us, and we use it for several hundred builds per day, and have somewhere in the order of 200 build plans active at any given time. I'm sure I could think of other issues, but many things have been addressed.
