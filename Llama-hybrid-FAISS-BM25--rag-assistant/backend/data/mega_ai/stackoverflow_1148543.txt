As far the database design goes, you have a fairly solid (and standard) design. You could combine your ProductImageLinks and Images tables as long as it's a 1:1 relationship to save some queries. As for your product line image retrieval, you have a couple of options that would drastically reduce the number of queries required: Create a new table in your database called ProductLineImages. Instead of picking the image randomly from the associated products, load a set of images in there that you can choose randomly from. It won't be as dynamic this way, but this is the most efficient method. You can do all of what you described in a single (but less efficient than #1) query.
