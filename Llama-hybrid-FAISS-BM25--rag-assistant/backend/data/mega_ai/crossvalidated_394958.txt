A "good" way to estimate the a subpopulation is to have a model for birth and death rates. Here is such a model. To estimate the size of an age-based subpopulation $N(1 \le a \le 18)$ given some value $N_0=N(0 \le a \le 19)$ in 2014, we need a birth rate model $b(t)$ for the period (1995-2014) and a hazard function $H(a)=P(death~at~age=a|still~alive~at~a).$ Let's say that still-alive-at-time-age- $a$ is given by $S(a)$ , and death-at-age- $a$ is given by $f(a)=-S'(a)$ , so the hazard function is $H(a)=f(a)/S(a)=-S'(a)/S(a)$ . This is enough for us to build a semi-reasonable model. Now three big assumptions. a constant absolute birth rate $b(t)=B_0$ (probably wrong) constant hazard function $H(a)=H_0$ ( not taking into account the naturally-elevated infant mortality !!! ) no immigration or emigration ( only Switzerland and the Andaman Islands? ), We can derive some approximate relations $$ H(a)=-S'(a)/S(a)=H_0 \implies S(a)=exp(-H_0a) $$ So survival is an exponentially decreasing function of age. The surviving cohort in any year is just $B_0exp(-H_0a)$ . So the survivors of all cohorts is $$ \sum_{a=0}^{19}B_0~exp(-H_0a)=B_0\frac{1-exp(-20H_0)}{1-exp(-H_0)}=N_0 $$ We do need to know at least the average birth rate $B_0$ in addition to the population-under-20 $N_0$ in order to estimate $\hat{H_0}=H_0(B_0,N_0)$ numerically. Once we've done that, the population in the age range from 1 to 18 is just $$ \sum_{a=1}^{18}B_0~exp(-\hat{H_0}a)=B_0\frac{1-exp(-19\hat{H_0})}{1-exp(-\hat{H_0})}-B_0 $$ Note that in the limit that $\hat{H_0} , the problem simplifies to the rather pedestrian solution $N(1 .
