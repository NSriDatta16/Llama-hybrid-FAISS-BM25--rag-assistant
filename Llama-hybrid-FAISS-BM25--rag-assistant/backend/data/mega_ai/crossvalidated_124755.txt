RBM stands for Restricted Boltzmann Machine . It is a kind of artificial neural network. Specifically, an RBM is recurrent (cyclical rather than flowing in only one direction) and is subject to the restriction that all nodes are in only one of two layers, where each node cannot be connected to itself or another node in the same layer.
