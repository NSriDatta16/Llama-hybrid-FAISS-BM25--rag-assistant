For the Eclipse (Rich Client Platform) it does not matter where or how you store data. It is just a framework which helps deliver a rich client interface. What other functionality will be required by the users of the data? Apart from getting new data in (is client application the right thing fro that anyway). And searching for certain data? If there is a lot of interaction with the data, draw some possible screens, to get an idea about how it should be implemented in eclipse (eclipse plugins). There are several plug-ins / extensions which can help you getting the data storage functionality implemented.
