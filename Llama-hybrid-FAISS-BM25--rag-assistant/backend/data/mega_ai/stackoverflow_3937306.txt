Multi level grid in Expression Blend

I have been playing with Expressions Blend 4 for the past few days, and I'm starting to get a hang of it. I just recently started playing with the Data binding and find it really easy and powerful. For prototyping purposes, there is no better application. I'm currently prototyping a Silverlight screen with a potential multi-level grid. Is there any way to do this with Blend? I tried creating a multi-level data sample (I added a collection data to a collection data) and dragged it to a datagrid. Only the first level appeared. Any help would be appreciated.
