What steps should be taken to convert my XML into Core Data objects?

I have an XML file which contains lists of stores, a simplified version is below. What I would like help with is some high-level ideas on the simplest ways to move this data into objects for storage in Core Data. I see suggestions around key-value pairs but as you can see in my example below, I have child elements with the same name/key and there can be an arbitrary number of these for each store element. I intend to store these objects within the app for future use (they will be annotations on a map). So, each duplicate field needs to be stored, one of them will not suffice. I know how to model it in Core Data I believe, I'll have a phone-number entity and a store entity and will just relate the two based on . I'm just trying to use a simple method to move them from XML to Core Data via some other data structure. XML sample: 1 Dublin 011234567 011234566 Joe Bloggs 2 Cork 019876543 019876542 Joe Bloggs If key-value pairs are the way to go, please point me to a method where I can account for the duplicate elements. If there's another way, I'm all ears. Thanks
