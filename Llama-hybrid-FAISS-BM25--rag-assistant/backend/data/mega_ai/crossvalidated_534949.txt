Predicting Repurchase Curves next value based on usual functional form

Some definitions first: Acquired customers: Customers placing an order for their first time. Cohort: Group of customers that have been acquired during the same time period. Repurchase: An order placed by a customer that had previously placed at least one order. Repurchase Rate: Repurchases / Acquired customers Repurchase Curve: Sequence of repurchase rates for a cohort in time. The problem: For each cohort I have a repurchase curve. Say we take the first 60 days to plot the repurchase curves. Cohorts with an age of at least 60 days will have a full plot I’ll call these “Full cohorts”. “Younger” cohorts will show a shorter line. I’ll call these incomplete cohorts. My objective is to use the information of full cohorts to train a model which I can use to predict the next value of all incomplete cohorts, no matter their length. I want to take this approach given that all cohorts seem to behave in a very similar way. The ideal scenario would be a model being able to use available information of incomplete cohorts to approximate the following repurchase curve value. Below you can find: An example of full repurchase curves An incomplete repurchase curve (in light-blue) for which I would like to predict its next value. I have this idea but I don't know how to move further. I thought about an exponential regression, but I'm not sure how to leverage the information that's available for each incomplete curve... What kind of model do you think would be a good choice? Please, any suggestions, comments or alternative approaches would be much appreciated. Thanks!
