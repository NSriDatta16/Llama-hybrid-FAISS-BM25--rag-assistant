Linker problem in Release when trying to add GLUI library to project

I try to add the GLUI library to my project. Compiling in Debug mode runs fine. But if I compile in Release, it gives me a bunch of LNK2005 errors saying things like: error LNK2005: _realloc already defined in Libcmt.lib(realloc.obj) ok - i already got some similar Linker problems before because I use both CRT and MFC in my app but i could resolve this problem using this guide: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/q148/6/52.asp&NoWebContent=1 therefore in my Project settings in the Linker->Input panel i have additional dependencies: Nafxcw.lib Libcmt.lib ignore libraries: Nafxcw.lib;Libcmt.lib so - this used to work fine. but now that I added the glui32.lib (it actually gets loaded in the glui.h header using a #pragma statement) to my project, i get those linker errors. Any advise on what I can do? Thanks!
