This function would give the name of the NamedRange the cell belongs to: Public Function CellName(oCell As Range) As Variant Dim oName As Name For Each oName In ThisWorkbook.Names If oName.RefersToRange.Parent Is oCell.Parent Then If Not Intersect(oCell, oName.RefersToRange) Is Nothing Then CellName = oName.Name Exit Function End If End If Next CellName = CVErr(xlErrNA) End Function It loops through all the names in the workbook, and then for each name it checks if it refers to any thing in this the sheet input parameter is from. If it is then it checks if the input cell and the rages referred by the name intersect. If they do it returns the name of the range.
