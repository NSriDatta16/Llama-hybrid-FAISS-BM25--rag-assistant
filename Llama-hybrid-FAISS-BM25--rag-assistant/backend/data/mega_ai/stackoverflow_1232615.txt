Compute statistical significance with Excel

I have 2 columns and multiple rows of data in excel. Each column represents an algorithm and the values in rows are the results of these algorithms with different parameters. I want to make statistical significance test of these two algorithms with excel. Can anyone suggest a function? As a result, it will be nice to state something like "Algorithm A performs 8% better than Algorithm B with .9 probability (or 95% confidence interval)" The wikipedia article explains accurately what I need: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance It seems like a very easy task but I failed to find a scientific measurement function. Any advice over a built-in function of excel or function snippets are appreciated. Thanks.. Edit: After tharkun's comments, I realized I should clarify some points: The results are merely real numbers between 1-100 (they are percentage values). As each row represents a different parameter, values in a row represents an algorithm's result for this parameter. The results do not depend on each other. When I take average of all values for Algorithm A and Algorithm B, I see that the mean of all results that Algorithm A produced are 10% higher than Algorithm B's. But I don't know if this is statistically significant or not. In other words, maybe for one parameter Algorithm A scored 100 percent higher than Algorithm B and for the rest Algorithm B has higher scores but just because of this one result, the difference in average is 10%. And I want to do this calculation using just excel.
