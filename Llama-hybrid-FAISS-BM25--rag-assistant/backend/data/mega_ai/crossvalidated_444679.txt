a question about the ELBO surgery in VAE

In the paper "ELBO surgery: yet another way to carve up the variational evidence lower bound", Hoffman et al, propose to rewrite the ELBO, say $KL(q(z|x)||p(z))=KL(q(z)||p(z))+ I (x;z)$ . In the derivation, they use $p(z|x_n)=p(z)$ . I want to know why $p(z|x_n)=p(z)$ . Anybody can help me?
