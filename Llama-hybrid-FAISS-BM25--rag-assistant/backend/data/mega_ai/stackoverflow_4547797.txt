No, you are running out of magic here. You took the bluepill to solve your problem, the real issue is that the background image is too expensive to draw. Next workaround is to not have the panel resize itself when the user resizes the form. Reset the Anchor and/or Dock properties, override the form's OnResizeEnd() method to change the size of the panel. It now snaps into place as soon as the user stops dragging, there's only one paint instead of many.
