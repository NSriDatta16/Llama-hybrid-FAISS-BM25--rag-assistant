Create image Thumbnails before or after upload the best way?

Imagine you have a classifieds website... When searching ads you want image thumbnails of the "real" image which displays in its real size after clicking the ad... Would it be faster to create the thumbnails per search, or create the thumbnails on and then just display them? Storage is not a problem on my server... Thanks
