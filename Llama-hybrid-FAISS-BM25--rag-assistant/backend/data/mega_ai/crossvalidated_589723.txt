Your alternative form is often written braced form as $$ f(x)=\begin{cases} p & \text{if $x=1$} \\ 1-p & \text{if $x=0$} \end{cases} $$ and there is nothing wrong with that. It might be useful, for instance, for programming and for elementary exposition. But if you want to do any form of algebra or calculus, it is inconvenient, so the other form is preferred. But both forms are equally valid, it is only a pragmatic question of what works best for whatever you are doing with it.
