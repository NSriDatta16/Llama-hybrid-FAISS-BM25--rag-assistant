Am i doing the right test? does this hypothesis make sense?

My study is investigating the effect of 6 IV's on a categorical DV (yes/no- yes is coded as a higher score i.e 2) in 2 countries to see which of these IV's is a most important in predicting the DV in each country. A logistic regression stratified for each country shows me some variables had an effect (i.e predicted) the DV in one country but not the other. However, a independent samples t test showed me one of the country's had a significantly higher scores on the 6 IV's than the other (disregarding the DV here) For my hypotheisis, how should i pose my research questions should it be like this... a higher score on these 6 IVs will predict the DV (yes) - without indicating a differences between the 2 countries as my logistic regression was not comparable as i had to stratify it for each country seperatley. Overall country X will score higher than country Y on all the IV's. Country X will have more respondents reporting yes (to the DV) i am very confused on how to link this all together, i would appreciate if you could take the time to understand the study and the findings to help me phrase my hypothesis correctly.
