CKEditor Header Styles - h1 is applied to entire paragraph block and not just the selected text

I'm using CKEditor in OpenCart 1.4.9.3. My problem is with the paragraph tags it automatically add and how it handles applying header tags. Say I have this text: Example text here This is some example text. CKEditor has them both in the same paragraph block even though they're on different lines. I highlight Example text here and select h1. It makes both lines h1 instead of just my selected line. How can I fix this? I imported over 1000 products so I can't very well go through and replace every p with a br, especially since in any new product, the editor will add p tags anyway. I am aware I can add the header styles in Source, but my coworkers can not handle html. They need to be able to highlight a line and change it to h1 or h2 without hassle. Thanks!
