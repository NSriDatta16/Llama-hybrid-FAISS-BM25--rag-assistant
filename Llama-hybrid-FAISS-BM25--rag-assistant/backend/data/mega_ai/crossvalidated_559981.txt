If all you care about is the proportion of binary "true positives" estimated by 4 different methods, then you have a pretty simply logistic regression model.* The binary outcome for the regression would be success/failure, with a "true positive" being a success and all other results being failures. The 4 methods would be treated as 4 levels of a single categorical predictor variable. As the different methods evidently evaluate all the same images/patients, you need to take the repeated measures on the same images/patients into account. Treating the images/patients as random effects within a mixed-effect model would be a way to handle that. That's analogous to the "one way repeated measures ANOVA" that you mention, but uses an analysis that's suited to binary yes/no outcomes. The links about "mixed effect models" on this UCLA web page can provide guidance. If the model indicates a significant association of your categorical method predictor with outcome, then you have evidence that the methods do differ. A simple post-hoc comparison would be to do all 6 pairwise comparisons between the 4 methods with Wald tests, then do a correction for the multiple comparisons . That type of analysis should be possible with standard software packages. Otherwise, the 3 comparisons of other methods against the reference level of method would typically be reported directly in the summary output of the model. Comparisons of the non-reference levels against each other would use the modeled coefficient covariance matrix together with the formula for the variance of a weighted sum . *As indicated in my comment, I'm not so sure that a sole focus on true positives is wise. This is how to proceed if you are nevertheless convinced that it is.
