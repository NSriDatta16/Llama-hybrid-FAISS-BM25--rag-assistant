What are some great but little known libraries for Lua?

A common statement said regarding Lua is that it doesn't come with batteries included; meaning that it lacks a lot of extra libraries. I think there are a lot of Lua libraries out there and more are being developed all the time, but it is likely people don't know about many of them since the Lua community in general is very pragmatic about getting work done and doesn't waste a lot of time with self promotion. So what are some great Lua libraries that more people ought to know about?
