What's the best way to copy/fill a large array with a smaller array in C#?

I have a large int[] array and a much smaller int[] array. I want to fill up the large array with values from the small array, by repeat copying the small array into the large array until it is full (so that large[0] = large[13] = large[26] ... = small[0] etc.). I already have a simple method: int iSource = 0; for (int i = 0; i = sourceArray.Length) { iSource = 0; // reset if at end of source } destArray[i] = sourceArray[iSource++]; } But I need something more elegant, and hopefully faster.
