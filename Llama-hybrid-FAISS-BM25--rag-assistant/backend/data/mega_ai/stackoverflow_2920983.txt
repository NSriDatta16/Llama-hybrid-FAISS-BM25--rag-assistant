Create a T4MVC ActionLink with url fragment

Is there a way to create a strongly typed T4MVC ActionLink with a hash/pound/fragment in it? For example, here is the link I'd like to create: Feed me But there's no extension to the T4MVC object that can do this. So, what I end up having to do is create an action, and then embed it that way: "#food>Feed me This isn't very desirable. Anyone have any ideas/suggestions? Thanks in advance
