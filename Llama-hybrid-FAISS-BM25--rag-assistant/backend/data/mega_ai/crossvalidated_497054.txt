Do I have to apply the same kind of transformation and scaling to all data?

I'm new to machine learning and currently learning it, and I do not quite understand the topic of continuous data transformations for machine learning. If I have 6 pandas columns of continuous data, for instance: [age, weight, mean_blood_glucose, std_blood_glucose, skew_blood_glucose, kurt_blood_glucose] , when I apply a Box-Cox Log Power Transform to mean_blood_glucose since it's heavily skewed, would I also have to apply the same transformation to all other continuous data, or is it alright to use different transformations based on the skewness and outliers of a specific column? Same with scaling, for instance, Normalization or using MinMax scaler, is it good to scale every feature between ? Also, what about the columns X_blood_glucose?.. They're all related, is there a special approach to dealing with data that are strongly mathematically related in such way?
