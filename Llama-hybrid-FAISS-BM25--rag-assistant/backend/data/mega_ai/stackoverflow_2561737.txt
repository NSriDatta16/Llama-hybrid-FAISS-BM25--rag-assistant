So the question is do "display:none"= hidden Elements also "count/matter" in regard to the rule Yes. CSS doesn't affect whether a node is considered to be part of the document. You can only have multiple Elements with the same ID when they're not both contained within the hierarchy of the same Document (or DocumentFragment), eg. when you've just used JavaScript to createElement a new node but not appendChild â€‹ed it into the document yet.
