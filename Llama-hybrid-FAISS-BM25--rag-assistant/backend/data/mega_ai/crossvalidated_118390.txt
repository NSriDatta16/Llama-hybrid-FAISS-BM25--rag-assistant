Probability distribution of binary time series

I am unable to understand concepts related to the probability distribution of binary time series. This is from the book Binary time series by Benjamin Kedem, vol 52 Let $X_t$, t =0,1,... be a binary stationary Markov chain of $p^{th}$ order, such that $Pr(X_t = 1) = p, Pr(X_t=0) = q,$ $p+q =1$ We define, $Pr(X_t = x_t|X_{t-1} = x_{t-1},\ldots,X_{t-k} = x_{t-k}) = p_{x_t x_{t-1}\ldots x_{t-k}}$ Consider a stationary AR(1) process $Z_t = \phi Z_{t-1} + u_t$, where $|\phi| such that the second product is over all $2^i$ 0-1 tuples $(y_i,y_{i-1},\ldots,y_1)$ and $I_i = x_i$ if $y_i = 1$ otherwise $I_i = 1- x_i$ if $y_i = 0$ This is the joint distribution of any 0-1 time series $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ provided $Pr(X_1 = x_1) = 1/2$ and the products $I_tI_{t-1}\ldots I_1$ are the sufficient statistics for the chain. My problem is that I have never seen any notation given in Eq(1) and I am unfamiliar with this kind of distribution where there is something on the power of probability. Can somebody please explain to me what is the meaning of the expression in Eq(1) and the notations $I$, power of probability? I remember reading about binomial distribution where the probability is raised to a power. But, this distribution and the meaning is complex to understand. Thank you for help.
