This is something that should really be handled in the template. Here's one way to go about it... You can make a whole other model called "Description", then make "Item Type" as an entry in that table. From there, you can check out the permalink decorator http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/instances/#the-permalink-decorator which will allow you to create permalinks to any given "Description" object. Finally, look into http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/ref/contrib/admin/#overriding-admin-templates for modifying admin templates. Where you are editing the class A objects, you can insert an anchor to the permalink of that Description object. What you are looking to do is definitely possible. You just need to reorganize your thinking. Good luck!
