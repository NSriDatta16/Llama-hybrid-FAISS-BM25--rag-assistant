How do you know that SVD and NMF are by far the most used matrix decompositions rather than LU, Cholesky and QR? My personal favourite 'breakthrough' would have to be the guaranteed rank-revealing QR algorithm, Chan, Tony F. "Rank revealing QR factorizations". Linear Algebra and its Applications Volumes 88-89, April 1987, Pages 67-82. DOI: 10.1016/0024-3795(87)90103-0 ... a development of the earlier idea of QR with column-pivoting: Businger, Peter; Golub, Gene H. (1965). Linear least squares solutions by Householder transformations. Numerische Mathematik Volume 7, Number 3, 269-276, DOI: 10.1007/BF01436084 A ( the ?) classic textbook is: Golub, Gene H.; Van Loan, Charles F. (1996). Matrix Computations (3rd ed.), Johns Hopkins, ISBN 978-0-8018-5414-9 . (i know you didn't ask for textbooks but i can't resist) Edit: A bit more googling finds a paper whose abstract suggests we could be slightly at cross porpoises. My above text was coming from a 'numerical linear algebra' (NLA) perspective; possibly you're concerned more with an 'applied statistics / psychometrics' (AS/P) perspective? Could you perhaps clarify? Lawrence Hubert, Jacqueline Meulman and Willem Heiser. Two Purposes for Matrix Factorization: A Historical Appraisal. SIAM Review Vol. 42, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 68-82
