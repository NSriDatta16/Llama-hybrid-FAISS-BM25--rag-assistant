Use of Mann-Whitney w/ Ties

I am tracking the results of a test between a control group and 1 variant group. Each group contains (an unequal quantity of) users whose order count we're now tracking. The histogram is heavily weighted toward 1 order for both groups, so not normally distributed. If it were, I'd just want to run a t-test to see if the variant group places more orders on average than the control. Based on some research, it seems like the M-W test is best to answer this, but I just want to confirm that the "ties" I have aren't going to skew the result - I've seen some contradictory info. I've calculated using wilcox.test in R. I also looked at a chi-squared test, but it didn't seem to be the right format for my dataset. Thanks in advance for any help!
