Using django aggregates as filter clauses

Is there a better way to do this? # Get an instance of the class I am interested in. It has a manytomany relation instance = Class.objects.get(pk=1) # Get the highest start date out of all the objects in the manytomany set max_date = instance.related_set.aggregate(Max("start_date")) # Return the object with the highest start date in the manytomany set query_result = instance.related_set.filter(start_date=max_date['start_date__max']) There must be a more elegant way to do this right?
