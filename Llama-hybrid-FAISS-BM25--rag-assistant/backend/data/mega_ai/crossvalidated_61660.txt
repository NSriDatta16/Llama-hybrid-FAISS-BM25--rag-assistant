Lets start with the good news: The proportional odds assumptions does not require that the distances between categories are the same. So what does the proportional odds assumption imply? Say we have three ordered outcomes (1, 2, 3), then we could model the choice of 1 versus 2 or 3 and the choice of 2 versus 3. The proportional odds assumption says that the effects of all explanatory/independent/x-variables are the same across these two choice comparisons. This is not a trivial assumption, but you obviously can't get the simplification of getting one set of parameters for multiple outcomes without making some strong assumptions. Test exist for this assumption. The one I most often come across is an approximate test by Brant (1990). Alternatives are the closely related Wolfe and Gould (1998) test and the usual Wald, likelihood ratio and score test. Richard Williams and I have been doing simulations comparing these different tests, to investigate under which circumstances these tests perform well and when they break down. We recently presented first results at the 2013 German Stata Users' meeting, and the slides are here: http://www.maartenbuis.nl/presentations/gsug13.pdf Brant, R. (1990).
