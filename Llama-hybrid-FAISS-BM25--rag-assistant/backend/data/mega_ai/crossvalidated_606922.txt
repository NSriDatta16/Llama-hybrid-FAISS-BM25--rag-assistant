What Bayesian priors are diffuse on the log scale?

I am trying to come up with priors for the intercept and coefficients of a Bayesian regression model on the log scale, but I can't get the resulting distribution of the prior to be diffuse once I log transform it. The model attempts to estimate the abundance of several bird species at a number of points, and assumes that the mean abundance of each bird species follows a normal distribution from some grand mean, and there is a random effect on abundance at each point. Here's a simulation of 100 runs for priors I have tried (in R): ### Priors mean_alpha0 Distribution of priors after log transformation As you can see from the histogram, the resulting distribution does not appear diffuse at all, with distribution weight in a range that is completely unrealistic for bird abundance. What are some priors I can use that will create a more diffuse distribution on the log scale for this model? Also, if anybody has resources on good systems for determining priors for transformed scales, please let me know, because what I've found online has been very sparse.
