The formal name for your concern is "multicollinearity". This can be a concern in statistically based techniques. There are formal tests that you can perform to assess multicollinearity like Variation Inflation Factor . That said, many machine learning techniques are indeed not that sensitive to multicollinearity, so it may not matter if for example, you were training a neural network. To answer your direct question, the terms you highlight are probably not so correlated that I would remove them. HTH
