Can't find GridView in ASP

I am brand new to asp and downloaded some example code of a shopping cart. When I created a new project in Visual Studio, added all the files in and tried to compile I got the following error. Error 1 The name 'gvShoppingCart' does not exist in the current context c:\users\slaphappysmoker\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\Shopcart\Shopcart\ViewCart.aspx.cs 21 3 Shopcart However I can see where gvShoppingCart gets defined in the ViewCart.aspx file. Shopping Cart Shopping Cart &lt; Back to Products '> ' style="font-size:12px;"> Here is the code that is calling the GridView in the ViewCart.aspx.cs file: protected void BindData() { // Let's give the data to the GridView and let it work! // The GridView will take our cart items one by one and use the properties // that we declared as column names (DataFields) gvShoppingCart.DataSource = ShoppingCart.Instance.Items; gvShoppingCart.DataBind(); } How can I get the ViewCart.aspx.cs code file to recognize the ViewCart.aspx and the GridView contained within? Edit: Added the function that calls the gridview.
