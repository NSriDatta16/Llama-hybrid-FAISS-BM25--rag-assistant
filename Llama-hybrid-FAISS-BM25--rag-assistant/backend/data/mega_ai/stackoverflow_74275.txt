If you can't get xinclude to work and you're using Ant, I'd recommend XMLTask , which is a plugin task for Ant. It'll do lots of clever stuff, including the one thing you're interested in - constructing a XML file out of fragments. e.g. (warning- the above is done from memory so please consult the documentation!). Note that in the above, the file pack1.xm l doesn't have to have a root node.
