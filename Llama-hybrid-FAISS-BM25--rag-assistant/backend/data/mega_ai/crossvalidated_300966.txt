Compare how one time series affects another and which tests are needed?

Context According to Becker (1968) and Elrich (1996) criminality study, the entrance of low income refugees with relatively lower scholarity than UK population would increase crime in the region. The main purpose of this work is analyzing if the entrance of refugees in UK statistically affected the criminality levels in UK. Data So, I have series with 52 observations, from 2003Q1 to 2015Q4, with UK's number of refugees, lots of criminality indicators like Burglary Offenses, Sexual Offenses, Robbery, and many more. Also, I know that number of police officers, gdp/capita and unemployement should affect crime. The number of refugees was converted from anually to quarterly using cubic spline method. All the data is added here: Google Sheets Log(Refugee) and Log(Robbery) graphs: Problem Is there a simple model that would explain how refugees entrance changed crime levels in UK? How can I avoid spurious relation among those variables? I tried a simple ARMAX model like the one in the following image, but I suspect important variables are ommited! Thanks for the help!
