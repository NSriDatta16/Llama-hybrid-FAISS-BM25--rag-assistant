In terms of the strategy from the VAE paper, no there's not a straightforward way of using a gamma distribution (as guy explained). However, there's a lot of research that's gone into other strategies for reparameterizing gammas to use in the VAE type framework: This paper by Knowles https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01631.pdf This paper from Blei's lab https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02287.pdf This paper from Deepmind https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08498.pdf This paper from Uber AI https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01851.pdf You could alternatively use BBVI (here's the original Blei lab paper http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/RanganathGerrishBlei2014.pdf ), as demonstrated in this tutorial http://ajbc.io/resources/bbvi_for_gammas.pdf
