Is it worth the effort to write tests that work with the browser (like using selenium or something)?

It's pretty clearly worth it to write tests for stuff that happens on the server side, but I've heard that it is really hard to write unit test for UI stuff and that they are fragile and unreliable. I would love to have more confidence that changes that I make don't break major parts of import pages on my site though. Any thoughts or experiences?
