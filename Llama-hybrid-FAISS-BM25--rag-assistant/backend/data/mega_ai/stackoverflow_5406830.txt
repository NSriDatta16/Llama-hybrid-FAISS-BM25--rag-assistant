The simplest solution to this question would be to handle the click event and set the visibility property on the elements you want to show/hide in the event handler. The link that @Robert provided is about "navigation" in silverlight, you can achieve your end goal using it and if you're planing a large application i'd say it's definately something you should look at but it'is a fairly complex subject. Depending on your current level of silverlight knowledge and the scale of what you're trying to achieve with your silverlight application it might or might be better to take the simpler button click approach.
