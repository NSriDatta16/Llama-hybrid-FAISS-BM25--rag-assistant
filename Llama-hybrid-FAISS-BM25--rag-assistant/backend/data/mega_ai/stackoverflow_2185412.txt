Draggable nested inside Draggable drags both when dragging child in IE

I'm building a seating application using jQuery. I have tables with chairs around them, which may have guests seated at the chairs. Each table has a wrapper div which is draggable. Inside the table are any number of chair div's. Inside any chair div a guest may be seated. Guest are also a div which is nested inside the chair div. Here is a sample for the markup of one such table. This table has 8 chiars with two guests seated at the first two chairs. Table 1 The div.table-wrapper is a draggable and so are the div.guest's. The idea is that you can drag a guest from one chair to another, or drag the entire table to a different location. The problem I am having is in IE, where if you click and drag a guest, both the guest and the table drag at the same time. Does anyone know how I can fix that? Thanks, ~Matt
