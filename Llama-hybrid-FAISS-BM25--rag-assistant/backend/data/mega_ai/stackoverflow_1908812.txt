The datetime module has the standard types for modern Python handling of dates and times, and I use it because I like standards (I also think it's well designed); I typically also have timezone information via pytz . Most DBs have their own standard way of storing dates and times, of course, but modern Python adapters to/from the DBs typically support datetime (another good reason to use it;-) on the Python side of things -- for example that's what I get with Google App Engine's storage, Python's own embedded SQLite, and so on.
