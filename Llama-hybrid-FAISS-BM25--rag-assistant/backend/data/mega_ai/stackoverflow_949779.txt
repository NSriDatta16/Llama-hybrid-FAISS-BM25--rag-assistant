Setting a global variable in Magento, the GUI way?

I've recently started using Magento for a client's webshop, and still need to get to grips with its systems. The webshop should have several links to and also grab info from another domain, where the corporate website is located. I would prefer not to hardcode the domain name or URL but instead define it at some place and use that value in the phtml templates throughout the webshop. This makes it easy to adjust it when we move the site between dev, staging and production URL's. Can anyone suggest the Magento way of doing this? Preferably we could add a field to the Store's Config GUI in the backend, similar to the way the {{base_url}} is set. Or maybe I'm thinking the wrong way?
