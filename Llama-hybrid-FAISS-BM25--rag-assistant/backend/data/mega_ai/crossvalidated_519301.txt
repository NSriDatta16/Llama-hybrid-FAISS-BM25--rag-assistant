In Bayesian Networks, there are three types of junctions, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network . In your case, you have a Fork junction, $Storm \rightarrow Burglar \ \& \ Storm \rightarrow Cat.$ Each junction case has some conditional or unconditional independence properties. For your case, the Fork junction has $$Burglar \perp Cat \ | \ Storm $$ which gives you the conditional independence of the densities. And I think the Bayes rule comes in the following way: $$p(A|S=T) = \frac{p(A,S=T)}{p(S=T)}=\frac{\sum_{B}\sum_{C}p(A,B,C,S=T)}{p(S=T)}$$ where $p(A,B,C,S=T)$ can be read out from the directed graph and by using the Fork junction independences, $p(A,B,C,S=T)=p(S=T)p(C|S=T)p(B|S=T)p(A|B,C).$
