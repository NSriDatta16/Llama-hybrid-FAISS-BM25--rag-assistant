For small numbers of bins a sorted linked list will be most elegant. You scan over it and when you find a number bigger you have the range. For very large numbers it is worth putting them in a BTree or similar Tree structure in order to get O(log(N)) performance. In Java you can use a TreeSet for this. lowerBound = boundaries.headSet(yourNumber).last(); upperBound = boundaries.tailSet(yourNumber).first(); or similar will be O(logN) for large numbers.
