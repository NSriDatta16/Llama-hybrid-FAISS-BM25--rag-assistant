Usually "authorization" is used after login to determine which directories, resources, etc can be used by the given user. Have you looked at creating a role for the "main" directory and a second role for the "sub" directory and then applying the authorization tag (i.e. in the web.config)? You will need to implement an authorization provider, but that sounds like it might be a better long term solution than having multiple user tables. Clarification Regardless of authorization (i.e. credential check or password, etc) you would still need to define the user roles somewhere, so for the sake of argument lets assume a "user table". (Nothing stops this from being an XML file in isolated storage if you wish.) NB It doesn't actually matter that the users come from different sources. This should be reflected in the schema for the user table (i.e. a flag or another column, etc). If you fight this common pattern you will likely end up doing more work in the long run. When there is one exception, there is likely to be another in the future....
