ASMX file download

I have an ASMX(no WCF) webservice with a method that responses a file that looks like: [WebMethod] public void GetFile(string filename) { var response = Context.Response; response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream"; response.AppendHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" + fileName); using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(Path.Combine(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("~/"), fileName), FileMode.Open)) { Byte[] buffer = new Byte[256]; Int32 readed = 0; while ((readed = fs.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0) { response.OutputStream.Write(buffer, 0, readed); response.Flush(); } } } and I want to download this file to local filesystem using web reference in my console application. How to get the filestream? P.S. I tried download files via post request(using HttpWebRequest class) but I think there is much more elegant solution.
