JQUERY UI Dialog Form is losing buttons actions at close event

first my code: var form = $("#form_usr");//An empty div to load an html fragment var url = (rol==1)?"/page/form1.php":"/page/form2.php"; form.load(url); form.dialog({ autoOpen: false, open: validator, close: cleanner, buttons { Ok: save_function, Cancel: function(){$(this).dialog("close")}} }); $("#btn_open").click(form.dialog("open")); My problem here is the assigned functions to events and Buttons only work the first time the dialog is opened. Any advice would be apreciated. nt: Sorry about my english
