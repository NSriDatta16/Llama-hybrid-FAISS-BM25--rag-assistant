You can't. strtok does the splitting by replacing the delimiter with a '\0'. Without doing that, no splitting would happen. You could, however, create a function that did splitting kind of like strtok does, but by finding where the string should be split and (for example) allocating storage and copying the characters up to the delimiter into that storage. strcspn or strpbrk would probably be a useful start at this.
