I know google app engine is quite restrictive, it will involve opening up the source and removing everything that attempts to write to the file system, and changing your database interaction. You can checkout this thread and group as a resource for Open BlueDragon as well as the wiki . Looks like they have a branch already which is working towards GAE compatibility. On the Railo side of the CFML open source pond you can reference this article from help compiling Railo on your own from the source . Joining both of their respective google groups and asking questions should yield fruitful as well. Good Luck!
