Best reconstruction loss for RGB images?

Which loss works the best for pixel-wise RGB image (3, width, height) reconstruction loss? It seems there are several options Regression way. The input image has dimension (3, width, height) with values [0,1] . Apply sigmoid to the last layer in the generative (CNN) layer such that the output image has pixel values [0,1] for each channel, and simply use pixel-wise L1 (or L2) loss. Multi-class cross entropy way - treat each channel as one of 255 classes. Apply softmax to the last layer and use cross entropy loss to predict the class label [0,255] . What is the de facto loss for rgb image reconstructions?
