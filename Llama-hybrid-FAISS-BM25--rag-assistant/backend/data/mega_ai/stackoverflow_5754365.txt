I'm sorry it took so long to respond, but my schedule has been very hectic. We managed to get ZipKit working under XCode 4 and be able to build for both the simulator and devices. Here's how we did it: We opened the Demo project from ZipKit and went all the way down to find the included ZipKit.xcodeproj. Once we had that, we opened our project and [dragged ZipKit into the frameworks folder of our project. https://i.stack.imgur.com/zcbYR.png We changed the build settings of both the targets in our project (as well as the static library touchzipkit ) to Build Active Architecture Only . We were then able to build everywhere. In fact, last night we were about to send the app update to Apple, but when trying to create the archive we got a linking error! But that's a question on its own . Thank you all for trying to help!
