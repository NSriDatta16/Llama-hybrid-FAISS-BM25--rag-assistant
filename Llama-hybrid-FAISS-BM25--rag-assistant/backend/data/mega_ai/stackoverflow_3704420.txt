I second Rayne's recommendation on Moustache. Right now, we are using Ring (base layer, middleware), Moustache (routing), Hiccup (html generation). We just began using Compass for CSS ( http://compass-style.org/ ). So far, I'm happy with this collection of small libraries rather than a big "complete stack" framework (Django, Rails, ect...).
