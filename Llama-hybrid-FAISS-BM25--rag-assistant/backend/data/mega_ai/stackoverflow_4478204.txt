Most websites use cookies to store session id. You can save cookies using QList QNetworkCookieJar::allCookies () const and load them back using void QNetworkCookieJar::setAllCookies(const QList & cookieList) You can get QNetworkCookieJar using QNetworkCookieJar * QNetworkAccessManager::cookieJar () const and you can get QNetworkAccessManager being used by QWebPage using QNetworkAccessManager * QWebPage::networkAccessManager () const Session id can be also stored as part of url or in the hidden form field on the page. If the site uses the former it's enough to save the url and if it uses the latter you have to save the page itself, too. The task gets more complicated now, when the Web Storage could be used. If a site makes use of the web storage you should take care of saving and restoring it in addition to all of the above data. You can set the location for offline storage using void QWebSettings::setOfflineStoragePath(const QString & path) and get it using QString QWebSettings::offlineStoragePath () You might get some more information on webkit-qt mailing list and on #qtwebkit IRC channel on freenode.net
