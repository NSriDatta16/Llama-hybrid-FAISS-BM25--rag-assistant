In response to your first question .... when dealing with time series it is often possible to misuse regression. Consider y and x unrelated for a period of time and an exogenous (unknown to the analyst) variable causes an increase in x and simultaneously an increase in y. Overall there is now a correlation between y and x (GLOBALLY) but not locally. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as Simpson's Paradox , spurious correlation , lurking variable phenomenon , etc.. Good analysis of this time series regression problem might unveil a level shift variable (step) which would then possibly eliminate the spurious correlation between y and x. You probably need to learn about time series methods and about Intervention Detection http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf . One simple place to start is here http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting and more specifically here http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/24-regression-vs-box-jenkins See the comments regarding the Slutsky-Yule effect . In 1927 Slutsky showed that subjecting a sequence of independent random variables to a sequence of moving averages generated an almost periodic sequence
