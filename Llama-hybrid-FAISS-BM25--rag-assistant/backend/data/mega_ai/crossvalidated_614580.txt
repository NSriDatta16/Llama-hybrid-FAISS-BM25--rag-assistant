This does not really make sense to me. Modelling a count of things (e.g. patients) as Poisson, Negative binomial or a version of these with overdispersion, and possibly with an offset for number of days or the like (these are, after all, distributions for counts - you could also truncate them, if you want to reflect that the total number of beds is limited). Modeling a percentage as Poisson (NegBin etc.) when you know the denominator makes no sense to me (your model doesn't even respect that a proportion needs to be in [0,1] / percentage in [0, 100]). If a known denominator, a percentage is better modelled as a binomial outcome (e.g. using a form of logistic regression) e.g. as X out of available bed-days (=number of beds times days). If you didn't know the denominator, something like beta-regression is an option. Also, there's presumably some correlation (patients likely rarely stay one night, which you are not modeling, which you could try to do). It can often be a good idea to write down the data generating process and describe all of it using distributions that make sense.
