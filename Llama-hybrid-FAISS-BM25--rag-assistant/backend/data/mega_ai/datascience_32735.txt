You can try dimensionality reduction on those tuples. Draw each tuple-valued feature separately on a 2-dimensional plane. If the (x,y) points follow a line (maybe a curved line), then the tuple can be replaced with a single value. One point on the line is taken as an origin, and all other (x, y)-points are replaced with the distances to the origin along the line. If the line is curved, the distances are also curved, not the Euclidean distances. If (x,y) points in a feature don't follow a line, but spread inside a two dimensional region then it is safe to treat them as two separate features.
