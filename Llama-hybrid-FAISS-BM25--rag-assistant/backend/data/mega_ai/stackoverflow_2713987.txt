There is no Java-like naming convention for Python packages. You can of course adopt one for any package you develop yourself, but you might have to invasively edit any package you may adopt from third parties, and the "culturally alien" naming convention will probably sap the changes of your own packages to be widely adopted outside of your organization. Technically, there would be nothing wrong with Java's convention in Python (it would just make some from statements a tad longer, no big deal), but in practice the cultural aspects make it pretty much unfeasible.
