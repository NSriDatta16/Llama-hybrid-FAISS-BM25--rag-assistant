Typically when I run across this issue I will Disconnect the device Clean the projects Delete the device from the Organizer Restart Xcode Reconnect the device Then the majority of the time the device will be recognized again. I do find it strange that even iTunes can't recognize it though. Maybe try restarting the device even?
