Wow. This is so dependent on the device, connection method, connection type, ISP throttling, etc. involved in the end-to-end link. To try and work out an average speed would be fairly impossible. Think, fat pipe at home (8Gb plus) versus bad wireless connection provided for free at the airport (9.6kb) and you can start to get an idea of the range of connections you're trying to average over. Then we move onto variations in screen sizes and device capabilities. Maybe trawl the UA stings of incoming connectins to get an idea of the capabilities of the user devices being used out there. Maybe see if you can use some sort of geolocation solution to try and see how people are connecting to your site to get an idea of connection capabilities as well. Are you offering the video in a fixed format, i.e. X x Y pixel size? HTH. cheers, Rob
