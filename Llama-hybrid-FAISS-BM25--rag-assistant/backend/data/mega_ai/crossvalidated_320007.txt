How to test for significant differences in R?

I want to test whether there are differences in the parameters of the Bass diffusion model (m, p, q) for Food products compared to Non-food products. My data looks as follows (including 3223 products, both food and nonfood and many more variables such as product category etc.): barcode m p q Food 12000028632 35.299941 0.028328659 0.246649286 Food 672935819363 26.714539 0.037432801 0.003112476 Nonfood I want to find out whether the m, p and q of Food products are significantly different from Non-food products. I thought ANOVA would be the best to do that, but when I perform an ANOVA test: anova(lm(p ~ Food , TotalBassModel1)) I get this output, which does not say anything: Analysis of Variance Table Response: p Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) Food 1 0.0137 0.0137247 10.783 0.001035 ** Residuals 3221 4.0998 0.0012728 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Who has a suggestion how to do this type of analysis?
