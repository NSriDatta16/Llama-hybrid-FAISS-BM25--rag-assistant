INVALID LABEL error for JSON response against WFS request of Geoserver using Jquery

I wrote this code: function json() { var url="http://192.172.2.23:8080/geoserver/wfs?request=GetFeature&version=1.1.0&outputFormat=json&typeName=topp:networkcoverage&CQL_FILTER= topp:CELL_ID='410-07-301-31781' Or topp:CELL_ID='nnn'&callback=?"; jQuery.getJSON(url,function(data){alert("Symbol: " + data.type + ", Price: " + data.bbox); }); } And got an error in FF : Error: invalid label Source File: http://192.172.2.23:8080/geoserver/wfs?request=GetFeature&version=1.1.0&outputFormat=json&typeName=topp:networkcoverage&CQL_FILTER=%20topp:CELL_ID=%27410-07-301-31781%27%20Or%20topp:CELL_ID=%27nnn%27&callback=processJSON Line: 1, Column: 1 Source Code: {"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","id":"networkcoverage.13333","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[33.67787000000004,73.02342000000004],[33.68024256600006,73.02193745600005],[33.68066767800008,73.02342000000004],[33....... I was happy with XmlHttpRequest until I came across cross domain problem... I've tried all sorts of libraries, and its the same error with all JSON functions. I thought there might be something wrong with the response but I put the response on this webs utility to check well formedness, and it was working fine on this URL http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/vector-formats.html What am I missing here?
