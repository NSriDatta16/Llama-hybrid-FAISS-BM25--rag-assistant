MS Chart, X axis dates and cursor interaction when X value is indexed

Good afternoon, Wow what a title. Basically here is the thing. If have a time series which is not continuous. Hence, since I use the IsXValueIndexed property of the Series (set to true) to collapse the space between the separate points. That works fine, however I would now like to be able to recover a point's detail in from the graph (X and Y values) and display them in a label on the form. Hence, I use the following event: void myChart_CursorPositionChanging(object sender, CursorEventArgs e) { if (!double.IsNaN(e.NewPosition)) { if (e.Axis.AxisName == AxisName.X) { lbl_selDate.Content = DateTime.FromOADate(e.NewPosition); } else { lbl_selValue.Content = e.NewPosition; } } } The problem is that the date is incorrect... I cannot find the right conversion method to recover this damned timestamp. Can you by any chance help me out? Thanks! Jeremie
