Since you say you are interested in probabilities (and not just prediction) this will impact your choice of algorithm. You really have to choices: Use a classifier that predicts well-calibrated probabilities. Use any multiclass classifier and attempt to calibrate the probabilities using something like Platt scaling or isotonic regression, see section 2.2 of the paper Calibrating Random Forest for a brief description of the techniques and related references. I would probably start with the first option using Multinomial Logistic Regression and then maybe a Neural Network if I felt I was underfitting. As someone said in a comment, random forests seem like a good option, but you'll likely need to calibrate them somehow (using the technique in the first paper I linked?). Another good reference for getting probabilities out of supervised classifiers is the aptly titled Predicting Good Probabilities With Supervised Learning .
