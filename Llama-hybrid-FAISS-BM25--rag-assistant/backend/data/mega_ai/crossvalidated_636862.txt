How to calculate the score of a new datapoint by a score based diffusion model(song & ermon, 2019)?

I have a pretrained score based diffusion model trained on 64X64 images. Now I want to calculate the score of a new image(of same dimension) through this pre-trained neural network. The score network takes two inputs : x_t : Sample at timestamp t t : timestamp How should I calculate the score of a new image via this pre-trained neural network ?
