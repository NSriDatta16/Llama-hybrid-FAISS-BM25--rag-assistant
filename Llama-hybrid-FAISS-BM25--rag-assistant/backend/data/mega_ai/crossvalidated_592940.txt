The condition $\pi(\theta|x)=\pi(\theta)$ means that $$\pi(\theta)=\frac{\pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)}{\int_\Theta \pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)\,\text d\theta}$$ i.e., $$f(x|\theta) = \int_\Theta \pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)\,\text d\theta$$ which can only hold when the density of $X$ at this realisation $x$ does not depend on $\theta$ . Looking at limits of posteriors to define "objective" or "non-informative" priors is found in the theory of reference priors, see e.g. Berger, Bernardo, & Sun (2009) . While using the posterior as prior and iterating the action leads to the notion of prior feedback for deriving maximum likelihood estimators. I developed this method (later revamped as data cloning (Lele, 2007) and MCMC maximum likelihood (Jacquier et al., 2007) ).
