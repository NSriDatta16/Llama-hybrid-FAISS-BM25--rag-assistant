So some of this comes down to organization. Like Julien mentioned, you'll want a YouappnameApplicationDelegate class - in fact, Xcode will create and set this up for you when you create a project. implement the applicationDidFinishLaunching method (which also should be provided by what Xcode gave you), and implement your logic for steps 1 and 2 there (and steps 7, 8, 9). Steps 3 thru 5 you'll probably want to implement in another class. RegistrationWindowController, or something like that. You may even want to create this window in another nib file (not inside the MainMenu.nib file that Xcode gives you). In the YouappnameApplicationDelegation's applicationDidFinishLaunching method you'd load this nib (see code sample below). That way your code is well organized - which is what Cocoa really guides you to do. Ok, so now how to load that new nib file: myInstanceVariable = [[RegistrationWindowController alloc] initWithWindowNibName: @"MyNibName"]; [myInstanceVariable showWindow: self]; RegistrationWindowController should be a subclass of NSWindowController. That should take you a pretty long way into your research, hope it does help!
