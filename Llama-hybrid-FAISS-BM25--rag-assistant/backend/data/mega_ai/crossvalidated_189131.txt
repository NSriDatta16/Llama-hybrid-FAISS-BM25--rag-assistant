If you are analyzing each matched pair, then no, you should not include the matching variables in the regression model, but you should be using conditional logistic regression. If, instead, you are using matching just to ensure a "balance" of covariates between cases and controls, you can help address some additional residual confounding by including those matching variables in the model. You do not have to do so, but it protects against failures in the matching process.
