No real answer to your question but: Generally relying on the clients IP address is in my opinion not a good practice as it is not usable to identify clients in a unique fashion. Problems on the road are that there are quite a lot scenarios where the IP does not really align to a client: Proxy/Webfilter (mangle almost everything) Anonymizer network (no chance here either) NAT (an internal IP is not very useful for you) ... I cannot offer any statistics on how many IP addresses are on average reliable but what I can tell you that it is almost impossible to tell if a given IP address is the real clients address.
