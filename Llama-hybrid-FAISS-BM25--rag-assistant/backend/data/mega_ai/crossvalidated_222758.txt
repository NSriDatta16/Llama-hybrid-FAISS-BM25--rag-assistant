Relation of pooled logistic regression to time dependent Cox regression analysis

I found on this paper (D'Agostino, et al. 1990) that pooled logistic regression is close to the time dependent covariate Cox regression analysis. I would like to be able to reproduce estimates obtained from a pooled logistic model with those from a time dependent Cox regression analysis. My data looks like this : A id age female time0 time1 death 1 1 20 0 0 1 1 2 2 21 1 0 1 0 3 2 21 1 1 2 0 4 3 19 0 0 1 0 5 3 19 0 1 2 1 6 4 22 1 0 1 0 7 4 22 1 1 2 0 8 4 22 1 2 3 1 9 5 20 0 0 1 0 10 5 20 0 1 2 0 11 5 20 0 2 3 0 12 5 20 0 3 4 0 13 6 24 1 0 1 0 14 6 24 1 1 2 0 15 6 24 1 2 3 0 16 6 24 1 3 4 1 I tried to fit these 2 models : glm(death~ age + female, data= A, family=binomial) coxph(Surv(time0,time1, death) ~ age + female, A) Estimates of the 1st model are : Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.65425 12.06138 -0.220 0.826 age 0.08814 0.61009 0.144 0.885 female -0.59971 2.17734 -0.275 0.783 Estimates of the 2nd model are : coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p age -0.140 0.869 0.622 -0.23 0.82 female 0.156 1.168 2.121 0.07 0.94 I dont understand why I get very different estimates with the 2 models (I also had the same problem with different datasets). Do you have any idea ?
