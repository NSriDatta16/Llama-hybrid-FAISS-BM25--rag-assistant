Does logistic regression with a count predictor imply a monotonic function on the outcome?

a simple question I suspect. I have a logistic model with a count predictor (#times some event happened) as a predictor of a binary outcome. Am I correctly interpreting the odds ratio as 'the constant and linear increase in the likelihood of being in the category coded as a '1' on the outcome for each additional event'..?
