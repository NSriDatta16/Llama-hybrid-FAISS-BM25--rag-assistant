Although this is obviously related to my previous answer, I think it's different enough to be considered separately. Given a point in an $n$-dimensional cloud of iid standard normals, shrink it radially a chosen proportion of the way to the corresponding fractile of a uniform distribution in the unit-radius $n$-ball. For iid standard normals in $n$ dimensions, the distance from the origin has a $\chi_n$ distribution. Let $F_n(d)$ denote its cdf. For a uniform distribution in the unit-radius $n$-ball, the cdf of the distance from the origin is $d^n$, and the inverse cdf is $p^{1/n}$. So multiply each point's coordinate vector by $1 + \alpha(F_n(d)^{1/n}/d - 1)$, where $\alpha$ is the chosen proportion and $d$ is the observed distance of the point from the origin. EDIT -- A minor improvement, that makes the results easier to interpret: Scale the ball so that the mean square distance of the points from the origin is the same as the normal, $n$. The corresponding multiplier on the vector of normals is $1 + \alpha\,(F_n(d)^{1/n}\sqrt{n+2}\,/d - 1)$. I have no proof that the marginal distribution is unimodal, but I have looked at histograms of marginal distributions with $\alpha = 0, .05, \ldots, 1$ for $n = 1, \ldots, 10$, and they all look as they should, varying smoothly from $\mathrm{N}(0,1)$ to a shifted and scaled $\mathrm{Beta}(\frac{n+1}{2},\frac{n+1}{2})$. For $n = 2$ I have also looked at scatter plots with the same set of $\alpha$-values, and they too look as they should, with no "bald spot" in the middle. Here is Mathematica code whose results are organized to facilitate exploring the effect of $\alpha$. {m, n} = { sample size, # of dimensions }; z = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {m, n}]; y = z * With[{dd = Total[z^2, {2}]}, CDF[ChiSquareDistribution[n], dd]^(1/n) * Sqrt[(n + 2)/dd]]; Then x = alpha*y + (1-alpha)*z will be a matrix that varies smoothly with alpha between iid normal ( alpha = 0 ; pure z ) and a uniform n-ball ( alpha = 1 ; pure y ). Here are scatter plots of 5000 points in 2 dimensions for alpha = {0, .25, .50, .75, 1} .
