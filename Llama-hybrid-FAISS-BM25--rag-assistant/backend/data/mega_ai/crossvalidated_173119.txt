How to derive marginal probability in hybrid bayesian networks?

Suppose I am having the following hybrid network where $A$ is boolean and $D, E \& G$ are continuous random variables, Also suppose the following: p(A) True 0.0948 False 0.9052 And µ(D) var(D) A=True 7.3555 0.27055 A=False 12.3433 0.10864 And $E$ is described as a linear gaussian given its parent $D$ with $$N(0.995 + 2.351 D; 13.732)$$ And $G$ is described as a conditional linear gaussian under all possible configurations of $A$ given its continuous parents $D\&E$ $$N(4.9491 + 1.002E + 2.252D; 11.356) \text{ when } A = True$$ $$N(2.384 + 1.0001E + 4.066D; 47.008) \text{ when } A = False$$ Now I am really confused about how to calculate the following marginal probabilities: $$P(G ≥ 30)$$ $$P(G ≥ 30 | E I have pretty much surfed the whole internet and I didn't find any clear example on how to calculate them all the examples are on discrete bayesian networks, so any help would be appreciated as stats exchange is my last resort now.
