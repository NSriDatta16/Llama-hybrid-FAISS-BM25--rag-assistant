The things you really notice in the syntax are the print statement, and the change in the exception syntax. 2to3 will handle all that. That won't cause you any headaches though. Those generally come from the split of strings into binary bytes and Unicode strings. 2to3 doesn't handle that. So the changes in syntax aren't really what you need to worry about. :) Then there are some minor changes in the syntax, tons of small changes in various functionality and a huge reorganization of the standard library, most of which 2to3 handles. There isn't any canonical summary of all changes afaik, although I've tried to make one in my new book . There may be some misses, but there you go.
