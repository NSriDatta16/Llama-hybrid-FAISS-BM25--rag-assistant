How to compare the degree of dispersion of different distributions?

I don't know if it is a good question or a well-defined question, but I really need some suggestions! Any suggestion is valuable for me! Very much thanks! The question is: There are many attributions of a research subject, which can be quantified as variables such as X , Y , Z , and they may not necessarily have the same units. Every variable has its unique distribution of course. Now I want to know which variable is more consistent or invariant for the research subject . I've considered several methods to do that, for example: (1) Randomly choose m values and repeat it n times(bootstrap), then I get n sets of sampling data. Since every set of sampling data has a distribution, calculate the pairwise distances between the n distributions. The fewer the distances are, the more invariant the variable is. (2) Train an LDA classifier to classify the subclass of my research subject with a variable. The worse a variable shows to be in classification, the more invariant the variable is. I believe there must be some very elegant method in statistics however I'm poor in statistics so I really need help!!!
