SQL Agent Job - to execute as queue

I have a SQL Server job which is calling 10 other jobs using sp_start_job. The job has 10 steps, each step is again calling sub jobs. When I execute the main job, I can see it started with step 1 and in a few seconds it shows 'Finished Successfully'. But the jobs take a long time time to run, and when I verify the logging information, it shows the all the 10 steps are running simultaneously at the back, until it finishes after few hours. My requirement is that it should finish step 1 first and only then step2 should start.
