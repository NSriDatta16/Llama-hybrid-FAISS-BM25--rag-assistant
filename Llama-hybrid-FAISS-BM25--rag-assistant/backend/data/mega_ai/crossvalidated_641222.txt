Can we use dummy variables to capture the nonlinearity in Age, Period, and Cohort effects?

According to the chapter Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort Models written by Ethan Fosse, the Classical APC Regression Model is the method I referred to in the question. In my specific case, I opt to set the period effects for the years 2000 and 2005 as equal, imposing constraints during model estimation. The rationale behind selecting these two periods lies in my assumption that their effects are highly similar. Hereâ€™s how the implementation will proceed: set.seed(123) period_test = rep(seq(2000, 2020, 5), 3) age_test = c(seq(30, 50, 5), seq(50, 70, 5), seq(70, 90, 5)) cohort_test = period_test-age_test period_test = period_test %>% fastDummies::dummy_cols() %>% modify(as.factor) period_test $period_2000_2005 = period_test$ period_2000 + period_test $period_2005 period_test$ period_2000=NULL period_test$period_2005=NULL names(period_test) = names(period_test) %>% gsub('.data_','period_',.) death_data = c(rpois(5, 30), rpois(5, 20), rpois(5, 20)) testing = data.frame(period_test, age_test, cohort_test, death_data) tt = glm(death_data ~ period_2000_2005 + period_2010 + period_2015 + period_2020 + as.factor(age_test) + as.factor(cohort_test), family = poisson, data = testing) The result is as below: Call: glm(formula = death_data ~ period_2000_2005 + period_2010 + period_2015 + period_2020 + as.factor(age_test) + as.factor(cohort_test), family = poisson, data = testing) Coefficients: (Intercept) period_2000_2005 period_2010 3.66537 -0.29808 -0.52988 period_2015 period_2020 as.factor(age_test)35 -0.52988 NA -0.14842 as.factor(age_test)40 as.factor(age_test)45 as.factor(age_test)50 0.04256 0.19671 -0.48732 as.factor(age_test)55 as.factor(age_test)60 as.factor(age_test)65 -0.37609 -0.44967 -0.44967 as.factor(age_test)70 as.factor(age_test)75 as.factor(age_test)80 -0.72824 -0.18924 NA as.factor(age_test)85 as.factor(age_test)90 as.factor(cohort_test)1950 NA -0.52988 -0.04676 as.factor(cohort_test)1970 NA Degrees of Freedom: 14 Total (i.e. Null); 0 Residual Null Deviance: 16.68 Residual Deviance: -1.554e-14 AIC: 103.1 There is still NA in the result, which indicates that the model has more parameters than can be estimated from the data. So we may need to impose more constraints on the variables. One more thing to note is that, since Age, Period, and Cohort effects are in the same model, they are highly nonlinear (Mason, Mason, et al. 1973: 246). I have another new question: Can we use dummy variables to capture the nonlinearity in Age, Period, and Cohort effects?
