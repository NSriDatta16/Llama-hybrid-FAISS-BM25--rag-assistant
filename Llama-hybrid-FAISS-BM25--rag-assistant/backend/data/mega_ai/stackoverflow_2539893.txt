What do I have to expect when building a huge web app in COBOL? It will take a long time. Frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails or CodeIgniter are designed specifically to create web sites in very little time. Most of these frameworks can build working dynamic content web sites in 20 minutes. COBOL cannot. Unless you can type really quickly, you'll probably have very little workable code in the time you could learn and build a site with any more modern tool. Are there web frameworks for COBOL available? Some sort of MVC? Asking this question now indicates that the choice of using COBOL is a really, really bad idea. The usual strategy is to chose the framework first. After making the framework choice, we endure the language required to leverage that framework. However, there's always http://www.coboloncogs.org/HOME.HTM Are there any good resources for practical web-development with COBOL? http://search.barnesandnoble.com/COBOL-Programming-Using-the-NET-Framework/Ronald-D-Reeves/e/9780130668431 Practical web development is done with web-specific frameworks. Any of the dozens of Python web frameworks, Ruby on Rails, any of the PHP frameworks, any of the Java frameworks. They're highly specialized to build web sites quickly and cheaply. COBOL is not highly specialized for this. Nor (outside the i-Series) does anyone seriously consider COBOL for web development. Your best hope would be to use as many external libraries as possible and write as little COBOL as possible. You have to make heavy use of the COBOL to C features of OpenCOBOL to work with the C-language API's and -- in effect -- build your site in C with a COBOL wrapper.
