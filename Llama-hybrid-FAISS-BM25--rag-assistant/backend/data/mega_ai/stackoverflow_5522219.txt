Can I render an HTML form inside a Raphael entity?

I want to draw draggable entities with Raphael, but some of these entities should support handling user input (text lines, forms, etc). The user input could be done in regular HTML (open to alternatives), but I was curious if Raphael can handle dragging non SVG objects.
