A representative sample is one which is drawn without bias from the population of interest. For example, suppose I want to find out how many people drink milk with breakfast. If I am a vegan, and I ask a random sample of my friends and associates (many of whom are also vegans), then the sample I have taken is not representative of the population as a whole: I will of course find that a low proportion of people drink milk with breakfast, but this is an artifact of my choice of sample, not because so few people do in reality. Basically, if there's any factor which causes us to select our sample in a non-random way, the inference is questionable. In the example above, a representative sample is one drawn randomly from all raids. We could also draw samples only during winter, in which case we might get a skewed result (maybe the cold makes people less prone to cooperation). Hope that clears things up a bit...
