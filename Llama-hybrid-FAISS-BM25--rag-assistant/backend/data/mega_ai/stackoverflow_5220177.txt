The code as written was not really what the others on SO were attempting to encourage you to do. function __construct($mysql_handler){ $this->mysql = $mysql_handler; } This is passing in the parameter into the object scope at construction. When you create an instance of your object, you would pass in the MySQL handle. $mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "user", "pass", "db"); if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { printf("Connect failed: %s\n", mysqli_connect_error()); exit(); } $u = new User($mysqlli); Then you should be able to call mysqli member functions on the property itself. Your constructor is also misspelled. It will only work properly with the magic method name __construct() .
