Quick note: when including simulation code please always remember to set a seed so that others can reproduce your data. Shouldn't I see a lot of zeros? You didn't include a plot, but I will use your code to simulate, run a hurdle model and then make predictions and plot them. Note I do not use brms so I will simply use two generalised linear models, one to model the zeros and non zeros and one for model the non zeros as a gamma model. This should also help in understanding hurdle models: set.seed(15) N Note also that I have renamed your reponse variable to y in accordance with common convention. I am also including x as an index. So, first we fit a logistic regression to obtain the binomial distribution coefficient, then we fit a gamma glm on the non-zero values to obtain the gamma parameter. m1 Here we can note that these are the values we were expecting (0.1 for the binomial and 2*2 = 4 for the gamma. So now we can make some predictions using these values and plot them: pred.non_zero $non_zero non_zero) ggplot(pred.dat, aes(x, y, colour = non_zero)) + geom_point() As expected we do see a lot of zeros.
