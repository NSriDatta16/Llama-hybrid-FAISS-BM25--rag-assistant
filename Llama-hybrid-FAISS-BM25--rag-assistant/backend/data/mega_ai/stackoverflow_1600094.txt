How do you set CacheMode on an element programmatically?

Silverlight 3 introduced the CacheMode parameter on elements. Currently the only supported format is BitmapCache . In XAML this value can set as the following: I would like to do the same thing at runtime but have failed so far, neither of the following examples work Image image; image.CacheMode = ?? // Could not find any enum to set it to image.CacheMode.SetValue(CacheModeProperty, "BitmapCache"); // Does not work I'm looking for someone to provide code or workaround for dynamically creating an element (e.g. Image ) and setting its CacheMode to BitmapCache .
