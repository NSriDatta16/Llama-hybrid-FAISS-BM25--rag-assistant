Well well it seems the answer is in the documentation. In particular Organizing Projects outlines how we can bind different widgets to different id's on the page. So I can effectively do something like: # html # java t = new FlexTable() RootPanel.get("id_table").add(t); nextbtn = new Button("next"); RootPanel.get("id_next_button").add(nextbtn); Wohoo!
