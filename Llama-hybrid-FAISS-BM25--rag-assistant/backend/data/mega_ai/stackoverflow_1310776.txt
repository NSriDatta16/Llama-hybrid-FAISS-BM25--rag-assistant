How to slice a factless fact table on time dimension? (SSAS)

Starting with the customary - "please excuse me as this is my first post and i'm a relative beginner" disclaimer, i have the following question... I work for a not for profit campaigning organisation, I've set up an SSAS solution to measure campaigning actions (e.g emailing the priminister) taken by a set on campaigners (customers) the main fact table has a count of actions as its measure, and is sliceable by say time and geography.... ... but I also want to have another factless fact table that can show a count of how many campaigners are in what mailing segment... so i think what i need to do is basically dump a copy of my campaigner dimesion (which is slowly changing for people moving geography etc) into its own factless fact table... columns being FK_campaigner, segment_id, start_date, end_date but then how do i link that into the time dimension as it doesn't have an FK_time (merely a start and end time)... i guess what i want to do is relate the factless table to the time table on a "when PK_time > start_date and many thanks to anybody who can point me in the right direction either structurally (is the broad approach wrong?) or even better in the practicalities of actually doing it in SSAS..
