X and Y are different explanatory variables, while the output appears coded as blue / red dot. The decision boundary is what you should get after calibrating your model and selecting a threshold for classification, here it appears plotted trough the calibration process. It is misleading for a least two reasons : y is traditionaly used to denote the output. Axes should be $X_1$ and $X_2$ , two explanatory variables, and the output, y, should appear in the legend (red : y = 1, blue y = 0). The exemple does not really provide an explanation as to why logistic regression is better, or how the model is calibrated. Evolving boundaries would better illustrate the functionning of a SVM for exemple.
