@Frederik, if you use option b) and you have a LOT of field variables, the constructor will become a quite unwieldy block of code. Sometimes you just can't help but have lots and lots of member variables in a class (example: it's a domain object and it's data comes straight from a very wide table in the database). The most pragmatic approach would be to modularize the code as you need to.
