It might just be anemic now? For instance, once time I was developing a meeting/conference registration site. It started with only one meeting. There was still a meeting class and only one instance, but the next year we held the conference, it was expanded and new properties were added (to hold two back-to-back meetings), so clearly it was just not fully developed yet, as we then added meeting groups which could contain multiple meetings. So I think it's important to keep in mind that domains change over time and your model may end up being refactored, so even if you might think it's anemic, it might just be a little too forward-looking (like your organization class will start to get some settings, rules or preferences or something).
