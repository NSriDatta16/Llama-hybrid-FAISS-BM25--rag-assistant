If arithmetic mean is your reference point, try to use its extension - the Ordered Weighted Averaging operator (OWA) defined as: $$OWA_w(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i*x_i^*$$ $\text{where} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i=1, w_i \in [0,1]$ and $x^*$ is $x$ sorted in the non-increasing order. OWA is the arithmetic mean when $w_i=\frac{1}{n}$, for $i=1,\dots,n$. Try to experiment with weight vector $w$ to suit your needs. Assume that the bigger the $x_i$ the bigger weight is used. For example: Given $n=5$, $x=(2,3,3,4,4,5)$ define $w=(\frac{6}{21},\frac{5}{21},\frac{4}{21},\frac{3}{21},\frac{2}{21},\frac{1}{21})$. Then $x^*=(5,4,4,3,3,2)$ and your average is $$OWA_w(x)=\frac{6}{21}*5+\frac{5+4}{21}*4+\frac{3+2}{21}*3+\frac{1}{21}*2.$$
