Another solution that basically does much the same as the earlier offered solutions: In C1, enter the following formula: {=SUM(IF(($A$1:$A1>=($A1-6))*($A$1:$A1 And then just drag the formula down. If you're not familiar with array formulas, the {} outer brackets just indicate that the formula is an array formula. To get it to execute correctly, you need to copy the part inside the {} brackets into the formula bar, and then hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter to indicate that it's an array formula.
