unable to parse XML in pig

I have a XML file has this structure (not exactly a tree though) I am using apache pig to extract just the "Text" part using this code grunt> A = load 'hdfs:///parsingdemo/PostHistory.xml' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.XMLLoader('posthistory') as(x:chararray); grunt> result = foreach A generate XPath(x, 'posthistory/Text'); this returns "()" (null) Upon examining the XML file, I learnt that my XML file should be in this format: ..... But my XML data file (stackoverflow data dump actually) is not in this format. Is there a way the tree structure can be imposed? what is wrong with my pig query?
