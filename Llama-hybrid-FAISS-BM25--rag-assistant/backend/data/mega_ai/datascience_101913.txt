The only case where I would consider resampling data is when there is a requirement to improve recall for a particular class. Thus the goal would be to force the classifier to predict this class more often, even though it usually means decreasing performance in general. Resampling is an easy method but rarely the optimal one. In general I'd first do an analysis of the errors made by the classifier, possibly consider alternative designs and/or feature engineering.
