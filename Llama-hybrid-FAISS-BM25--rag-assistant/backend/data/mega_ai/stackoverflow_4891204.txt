Good question, there may not be an elegant answer. The best I can find to point you on your way is the net share command-line statement. If you can capture and digest the text produced by this command programmatically, you can map network shares 1:1 to their local destination folders. Then you can look for instances of those share maps in a given path and replace them with the local folder equivalents before performing a basic string comparison.
