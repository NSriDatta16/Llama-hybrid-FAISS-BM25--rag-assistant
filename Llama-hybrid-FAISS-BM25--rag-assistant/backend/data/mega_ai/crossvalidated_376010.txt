Your null hypothesis is that there is no Gragner-causality. You are finding that you reject the hypothesis on 4 of the 23 series. Note that the probability of rejecting, given the null hypothesis is true, is $0.05$ . So rejecting 4 or more (incorporating more extreme events) out of the 23 series has probability becomes the value of the binomial distribution with $n=23$ and $p=0.05$ : $$P(N_{rej}\geq 4) = 1- P(N_{rej} \leq 3) = 1- F_{Bin}(3)=1-\sum_{i=0}^3 \left(\begin{array}{c} 23 \\ i \end{array} \right) 0.05^i (1-0.05)^{23-i}$$ This is the probability of this event or a more extreme occurring. Depending on your significance threshold we either reject or do not reject the null hypothesis here. Assuming you set your confidence level to 5\% we get $0.025815$ which means we reject the null hypothesis.
