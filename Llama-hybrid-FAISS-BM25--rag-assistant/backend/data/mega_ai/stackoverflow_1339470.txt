How to get the address of the std::vector buffer start most elegantly?

I want to use std::vector for dynamically allocating memory. The scenario is: int neededLength = computeLength(); // some logic here // this will allocate the buffer std::vector buffer( neededLength ); // call a function that accepts TCHAR* and the number of elements callFunction( &(buffer[0]), buffer.size() ); The code above works, but this &(buffer[0]) looks ugly. Is there a more elegant way to achieve the same?
