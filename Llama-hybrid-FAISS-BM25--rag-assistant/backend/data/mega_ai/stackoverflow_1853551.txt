Draw to offscreen renderbuffer in OpenGL ES (iPhone)

I'm trying to create an offscreen render buffer in OpenGL ES on the iPhone. I've created the buffer like this: glGenFramebuffersOES(1, &offscreenFramebuffer); glBindFramebufferOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES, offscreenFramebuffer); glGenRenderbuffersOES(1, &offscreenRenderbuffer); glBindRenderbufferOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, offscreenRenderbuffer); glFramebufferRenderbufferOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_OES, GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, offscreenRenderbuffer); But I'm confused on how to render the storage. Apple's documentation says to use the EAGLContext renderBufferStorage:fromDrawable: method, but this seems to only work for one render buffer (the main one being displayed). If I use the normal OpenGL function glRenderBufferStorageOES, then I can't seem to get it to display. Here's the code: // this is in the initialization section: glRenderbufferStorageOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, GL_RGB8_OES, backingWidth, backingHeight); // and this is when I'm trying to draw to it and display it: glBindFramebufferOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES, offscreenFramebuffer); GLfloat vc[] = { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, -10.0f, -10.0f, -10.0f, }; glLoadIdentity(); glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, 0, vc); glDrawArrays(GL_LINES, 0, 4); glDisableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY); glBindRenderbufferOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, offscreenRenderbuffer); [context presentRenderbuffer:GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES]; Doing it this way, nothing is displayed on the screen. However, if I switch out the references to "offscreen...Buffer" to the buffers that were created with the renderBufferStorage method, it works fine. Any suggestions?
