In order to run decompose() or its cousin stl(), you need to have at least two complete periods of data. Period is defined as 1/frequency. So if you are working with weekly data, where frequency=52, your period is one year and you need two years of data. For example, running decompose() with data set of 103 weeks will fail: decompose(ts(runif(103), frequency=52)) Error in decompose(ts(runif(103), frequency = 52)) : time series has no or less than 2 periods But running decompose() with 104 data points works: decompose(ts(runif(104), frequency=52)) $seasonal Time Series: Start = c(1, 1) End = c(2, 52) Frequency = 52 [1] -0.015447737 0.392006955 0.185528936 0.372505618 -0.079588619 [6] -0.351928149 -0.472617951 -0.306461367 -0.475596801 0.266197693 [11] 0.167468113 -0.332837411 -0.427845149 -0.001199151 0.276361737 ... $type [1] "additive" attr(,"class") [1] "decomposed.ts" PS. You may also want to have a look at acf() which will compute autocorrelation. This will work even if you have less than two complete years of data. For example: acf(ts(runif(100), frequency=52))
