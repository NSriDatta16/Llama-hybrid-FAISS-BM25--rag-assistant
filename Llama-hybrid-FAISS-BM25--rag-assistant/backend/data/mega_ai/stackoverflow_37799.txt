GCOV for multi-threaded apps

Is it possible to use gcov for coverage testing of multi-threaded applications? I've set some trivial tests of our code-base up, but it would be nice to have some idea of the coverage we're achieving. If gcov isn't appropriate can anyone recommend an alternative tool (possible oprofile), ideally with some good documentation on getting started.
