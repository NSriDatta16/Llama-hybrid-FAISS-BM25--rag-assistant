All of the solutions so far ignore the fact that the second array can also have elements that the first array doesn't have. Chuck has pointed out a fix (see comments on other posts), but there is a more elegant solution if you work with sets: require 'set' teamOne = "Billy, Frankie, Stevie, John" teamTwo = "Billy, Frankie, Stevie, Zach" teamOneSet = teamOne.split(', ').to_set teamTwoSet = teamTwo.split(', ').to_set teamOneSet ^ teamTwoSet # => # This set can then be converted back to an array if need be.
