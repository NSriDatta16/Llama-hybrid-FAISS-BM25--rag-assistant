Dataset and why use evaluate()?

I am starting in Machine Learning, and I have doubts about some concepts. I've read we need to split our dataset into training, validation and test sets. I'll ask four questions related to them. 1 - Training set : It is used in .fit() for our model to learn parameteres such as weights in a neural network? 2 - Validation set : Can also be used in .fit() . The validation set is used so we can validate our model at the end of each epoch (to tune some hyperparameteres, like the number of nodes in a hidden layer)? 3 - If 2 is correct (i.e, the validation set was already used in .fit() ), do we still need to use .evalute() ? And why? 4 - Test set : New inputs ( x ) never seen by the model, so i can make predictions on them? Used through the .predict() function?
