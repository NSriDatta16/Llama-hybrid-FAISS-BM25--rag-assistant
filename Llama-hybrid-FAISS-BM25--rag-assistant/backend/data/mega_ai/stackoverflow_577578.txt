If it's not an issue of changing only the NT Username, then it does seem that the authentication service is caching the old username. You can define this to be disabled, go to the Local Security Settings (in Administrative Tools), and depending on version/edition/configuration the settings that are possible relevant (from memory) are "Number of previous logons to cache" and "Do not allow storage of credentials...". Additional factors to take into account: Domain membership might affect this, as member servers may inherit domain settings You may still need to restart the whole server once for this to take affect (but then you won't have to worry about updates in the future). Logon performance might be affected. As such, I recommend you test this first before deploying on production (of course).
