How to "flick" a UIImageView?

I've got some UIViews that I'd like the user to be able to "flick" across the screen. They're not scroll views. They simply contain a raster image (png). Can anyone point me to some sample code, etc to help get me started? Something a little more heavyweight than "MoveMe" out there that helps detect a "flick" (vs a "nudge" or a drag and drop) and then carries the view off in the direction of the "flick"? OpenGL probably overkill. If possible I'd like to stay w/in the realm of Core Graphics/Animation.
