Well, the first thing I'd do is "select" the columns that you want into an anonymous type (or a named type) - this means you are getting rectangular data, and you don't have to worry as much about lazy loading. Secondly, you need a list for the grid. Try something like: using(NorthwindDataContext db = new NorthwindDataContext()) { var query= from od in db.Order_Details join o in db.Orders on od.OrderID equals o.OrderID where od.UnitPrice == 14 select new {o.OrderId, o.Customer.CustomerName, od.UnitPrice}; // etc ultraGrid1.DataSource = query.Distinct().ToList(); }
