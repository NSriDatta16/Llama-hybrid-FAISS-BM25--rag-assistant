Because you have $family=Poisson$ , both models assume that $vDeaths$ follow a Poisson distribution. The mathematical model of your first example is $$\log E[vDeaths]=\log (vExposures)+ c,$$ where $c$ is a constant to be estimated. For your second example, it is $$\log E[vDeaths]=\log (vExposures)+ \beta_x, $$ where $x$ is each age level: age 35,45,...,105. In fact, your first model estimates a constant $c$ which is the average death rate across all ages. Your second model estimates a death rate for each age level (8 in total). -1 means that there is no intercept and 1 there is an intercept. An offset is a covariate for which there is no related parameter to be estimated.
