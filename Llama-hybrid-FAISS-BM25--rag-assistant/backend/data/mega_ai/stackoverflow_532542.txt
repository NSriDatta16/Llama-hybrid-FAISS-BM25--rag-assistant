As far as I know, Google Reader addresses the problem in this way: The user agent string of their client includes the number of subscribers reading this feed through their reader. I don't know if FeedBurner or other tools interpret this, but it is at least theoretically possible to get accurate statistics from the http log files this way. Edit: According to the official Google Reader documentation the User-Agent header of their feed fetcher looks like this: User-Agent: Feedfetcher-Google; (+http://www.google.com/feedfetcher.html; 4 subscribers; feed-id=1794595805790851116)
