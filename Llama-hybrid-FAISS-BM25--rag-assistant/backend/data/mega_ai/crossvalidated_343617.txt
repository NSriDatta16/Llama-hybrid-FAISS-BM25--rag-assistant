Seasonal trend loess (STL) decomposition around holidays

I am seasonally adjusting a weekly transaction time-series. The seasonal adjustment works great, except for on and around closed days. At and around these points there are serious errors. What is the proper way to decompose a time series for these localized closed days? I can think of a couple options on closed days the seasonal adjustment = the observation on closed days the seasonal adjustment = trend remove closed days and days around closed days For more information, I am using decompose(type = "multiplicative") . I have tried additive , but had much worse performance.
