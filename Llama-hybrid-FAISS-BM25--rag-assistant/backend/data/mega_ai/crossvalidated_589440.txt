The problem is that categorization is a premature decision and makes it difficult to bring in the right utility/cost/loss function. Classification also invites you to make classifications when you shouldn't, e.g., when the probability of class membership is far from 0 or 1. If you estimate the probability of membership of all classes (using e.g. multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression) and come up with utility/cost/loss functions you can make optimum decisions. Your problem as stated would be well served by your translating the various classification error importances to a utility function to plug into the optimum Bayes decision that maximizes expected utility.
