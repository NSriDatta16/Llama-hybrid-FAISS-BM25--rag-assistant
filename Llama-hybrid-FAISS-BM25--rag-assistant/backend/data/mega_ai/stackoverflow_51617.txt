I'd think about putting in place some sort of general archiving functionality. How you implement that depends on your specific retrieval needs. For example if you wish just to retrieve emails sent to a particular customer for a certain month then stocking them in an appropriate heirachy on the File System (zip them up if necessary) should be simple to do. You might want to record a list of sent emails in a database table with a pointer to the appropriate directory but a naming convention for your directories and files might be sufficient You might not need to access very old emails very infrequently so you might archive these to DVD for example if online storage is a problem If you're wanting to often search the actual content of emails then your going to have to put the content in a DB table or use an indexer like Lucerne to examine the files stocked on disk
