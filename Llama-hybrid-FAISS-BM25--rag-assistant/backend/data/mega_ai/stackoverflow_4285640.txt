Something like this should be much faster: var ul = $(" "); for (var i = 0, l=topics.length; i ", { text: result.Name, "class": "example" }).appendTo(ul); }; $("#searchResults").append(ul.contents()); By using a document fragment ( $(" ") ) and appending to it, then appending at the end, we're not messing with the entire DOM each append. Also we're not repeatedly selecting #searchResults each loop...or checking .length would could also be expensive. Note: this method still uses the DOM to create elements (as opposed to a string), eliminating issues of result.Name having HTML that could screw things up, etc.
