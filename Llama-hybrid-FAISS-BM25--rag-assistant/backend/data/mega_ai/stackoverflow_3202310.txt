If your system handles card data then its in scope of PCI and must be PCI compliant. Q: To whom does PCI apply? A: PCI applies to ALL organizations or merchants, regardless of size or number of transactions, that accepts , transmits or stores any cardholder data. Said another way, if any customer of that organization ever pays the merchant directly using a credit card or debit card, then the PCI DSS requirements apply http://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/pcifaqs.php Edit; "eWays" as your gateway provider are Tier 1, and its belholden to them to actually ensure your PCI compliant, so its a bit dodgy of them to palm you of with the SSL spiel.
