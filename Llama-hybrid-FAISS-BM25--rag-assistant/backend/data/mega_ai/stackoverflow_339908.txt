Using hash functions for file storage?

A common technique for storing a lot of files/blobs in a filesystem is to use a hash function to determine the filepath; eg hash(identifier) -> "o238455789" -> o23/8455/789 (there is often a hash-collision strategy too) Does this technique have a name (is it a 'pattern'?) so that I may find it with a search of ACM Digital Library or similar online database of computing literature. Are there any books/papers that explore the problem/solution? PS thanks for the helpful notes - but none address the technique given above.
