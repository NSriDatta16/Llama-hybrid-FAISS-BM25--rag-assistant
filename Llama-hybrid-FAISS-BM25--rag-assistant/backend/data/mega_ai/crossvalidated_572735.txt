If you set as a prior for the ID coefficients a uniform distribution between -5 and 5, this means that these coefficients are assumed to be in the interval $[-5,5]$ , other values are impossible . These cannot become possible during the MCMC algorithm, because you have specified these values as a priori impossible. As the frequentist analysis estimates these values outside that interval, the Bayesian analysis will necessarily deviate quite a bit from the frequentist one. The way you generated the data implies (as confirmed by the frequentist analysis) that there are so big differences between the ID means that $[-5,5]$ is not enough of a range to fit them. In other words, choosing the prior like this actively prevents the Bayesian analysis from finding the "correct" coefficient values. This is no longer the case for a uniform on $[-100,100]$ . By the way, also the priors for alpha and beta look very restrictive, even though the normal distribution at least doesn't make any value totally impossible. In a proper Bayesian analysis you need to choose the priors so that they allow the data to have enough influence to put the parameters anywhere where they could realistically occur. Overprecision in the priors is not good.
