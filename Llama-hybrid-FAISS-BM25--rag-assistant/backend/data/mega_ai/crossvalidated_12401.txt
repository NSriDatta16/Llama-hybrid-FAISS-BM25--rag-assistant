Wavelet analysis of EEG

I want to do a time-frequency analysis of an EEG signal. I found the GSL wavelet function for computing wavelet coefficients. How can I extract actual frequency bands (e.g. 8 - 12 Hz) from that coefficients? The GSL manual says: For the forward transform, the elements of the original array are replaced by the discrete wavelet transform $f_i \rightarrow w_{j,k}$ in a packed triangular storage layout, where $j$ is the index of the level $j = 0, \ldots, J-1$ and $K$ is the index of the coefficient within each level, $k = 0 ... (2^j)-1$. The total number of levels is $J = \log_2(n)$. The output data has the following form, $(s_{-1,0}, d_{0,0}, d_{1,0}, d_{1,1}, d_{2,0}, \ldots, d_{j,k}, \ldots, d_{J-1,2^{J-1}-1})$ If I understand that right an output array data[] contains at position 1 (e.g. data[1]) the amplitude of the frequency band 2^0 = 1 Hz, and data[2] = 2^1 Hz data[3] = 2^1 Hz data[4] = 2^2 Hz until data[7] = 2^2 Hz data[8] = 2^3 Hz and so on ... That means I have only the amplitudes for the frequencies 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 4 Hz, 8 Hz, 16 Hz,... How can I get for example the amplitude of a frequency component oscillating at 5.3 Hz? How can I get the amplitude of a whole frequency range, e.g. the amplitude of 8 - 13 Hz?
