I agree with Tobias - making your own memory manager is an excellent way to do this. I know only a few developers I would trust to write this kind of code though... Another possibility is to do your own sort of garbage collection/consolidation on your objects every now and then - at low loads... i.e. your service can be inactive for a while while it "defragments" the memory it uses but I am not sure you can guarantee the behavior you want without your own memory management.
