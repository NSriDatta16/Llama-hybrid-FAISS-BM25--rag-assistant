Is there a library that can perform packet analysis and block certain packets from being sent?

I found Jpcap , however it only meets half my requirements - it does not allow me to block packets, as stated in the FAQ . I would prefer a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) solution, but if one does not exist, OS-specific solutions would be acceptable. My goal is to, under certain conditions, block access to certain Internet and network resources by finding out where the packets are going and blocking the ones that meet specific criteria, regardless of how the resource was accessed. Perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way, so any advice would be appreciated.
