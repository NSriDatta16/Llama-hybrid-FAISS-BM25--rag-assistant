Did someone use ClickAndHoldAction, MoveMouseAction and ButtonReleaseAction methods as a replacement for drag and drop in Selenium?

Searching for implementations of drag and drop in selenium I only found the deprecated methods dragAndDropOn and dragAndDropBy. Documentation says to use ClickAndHoldAction, MoveMouseAction and ButtonReleaseAction instead of the deprecated methods. Don't know how to use them. Didn't found any good example. Did someone use these methods? Maybe there are some better ways to drag and drop using selenium on Java?
