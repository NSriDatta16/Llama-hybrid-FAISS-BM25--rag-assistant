I haven't worked with Rails3 so no guarantees. but it looks like this has to do with the fact that your method returns a list. Rails will usually format internal data structures for output by escaping the special characters and displaying the html escaped interpretation of your data. Try tacking a .join onto the end of your map call to return a string [:en, :de].map{ |locale| link_to locate.to_s.upcase , { :locale => locate } ... }.join(" ") Also rwilliams aka r-dub's suggestion to use raw will probably be necessary addition to this code. raw on a list however may give you an undesirable result probably because of an internal to_string call. Which is an implicit join(""). So add the raw to the method call in addition to returning a string.
