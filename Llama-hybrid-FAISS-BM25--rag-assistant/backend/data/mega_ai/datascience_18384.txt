How are the positions of the output nodes determined in the Kohonen - Self Organizing Maps algorithm?

In the Cooperative stage of Kohonen's SOM, the neighborhood for a winning neuron(output node). In most cases, the neighborhood function happens to be the Gaussian Function. For example, $$h_j,_i = exp(-d_j,_i^2/2*\sigma^2)$$ where $h_j,_i$ is the window function ($i$ is the index of the winning neuron and $j$ is the index of the encompassing neuron), $d_j,_i$ is the lateral distance between the winning neuron $i$ and the excited neuron $j$. Now the user who is going to implement the SOM has the input data and the randomly initialized weight vectors. How is $d_j,_i$ determined? Is it randomly initialized too? Also what is the relation between the weight vectors of the output nodes and their positions? The figure below is just to give a visual representation of the organization of the input and the output nodes
