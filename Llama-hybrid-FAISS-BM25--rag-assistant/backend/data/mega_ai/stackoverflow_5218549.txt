Operation CRUD with edmx and objectdatasource error Idisposable

I have 3 tiers apps. In the Persistance layer the is just the drag 'n' drop Entities.edmx file. In the Presentation layer : And a gridview that connects to this objectdatasource. In my busines logic layer, when I use it like this: public IEnumerable Get_All_Tva() { FaExpedEntities oEntite_T = new FaExpedEntities(); var query = from o in oEntite_T.T_TVA select o; IEnumerable LesTva = query; return LesTva; } It works, but when I use like this: public IEnumerable Get_All_Tva() { using (FaExpedEntities oEntite_T = new FaExpedEntities()) { var query = from o in oEntite_T.T_TVA select o; IEnumerable LesTva = query; return LesTva; } } It does not work. It said that the instance of ObjectContext has been deleted and cannot be used for operations that require a connection. Why? What is the difference such that using " using " syntax fails and not using " using " works? Which is the better approach, with or without the " using "?
