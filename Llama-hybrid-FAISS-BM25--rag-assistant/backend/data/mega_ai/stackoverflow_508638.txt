Just do it... If it's part of your personal process for any new code, you'll at least have that covered. You'll probably never get permission to add unit tests to cover all your code ever but you can at least be sure that no future changes undo work from a given point in time. Think of it from the business side, why do you need to write code to prove the code you've already written is correct? Why is it wrong? Getting 100% coverage would be nice but take your time getting there and don't write tests for existing code that isn't currently wrong; write the tests as it breaks so you at least never undo something unintentionally.
