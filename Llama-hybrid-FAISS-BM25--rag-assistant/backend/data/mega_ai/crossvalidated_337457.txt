Unusual transformation of percentage data

I am reviewing some support vector machine (SVM) work by someone who has left my company. The target data is a heavily left skewed set of percentage values. He chose to make an unusual transformation that I don't understand - and can't find anywhere else. transformed_x = log10(max(x) - x +1) This appears to be a more successful way to make the data normally distributed than more common transformations such as logit and arcsin - but I don't really understand why? Only power transformations determined from Tukey/Box-Cox (x^19.3 !!) seem to do better. As a side question - is it only the target data in SVM that should be normally distributed, or should I also address the input variables too? He has only done the target variable.
