Java public classes with private dependent classes

One thing that has always bothered me in Java is: How do you create a single public class that should be used by downstream consumers but then nicely organize the classes it depends on in packages? For example (somewhat contrived), I have a class UserDao that relies on LdapPersistenceHelper and DBPersistenceHelper. The UserDao class is sitting in a package called com.company.dao and i would like the two helpers to live in a package called com.company.dao.persistencehelper. However, I do not want to make the two helpers generic enough that they could be used by others. How do I that? If I make the helpers "protected" (really, no modifier) then I can't reach them from the UserDao. If I make them public, someone else might use them.
