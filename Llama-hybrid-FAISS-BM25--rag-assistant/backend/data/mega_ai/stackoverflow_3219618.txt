fd is correct. The options read out of a jar and applied to the JVM being launched are pretty minimal... but there may be another way to approach this. You can use the javaws command to read a JNLP file that will create a JVM that is much more customized. If your users will have access to a common site, you can probably just distribute the jnlp file and let javaws handle accessing the jar file for your app. If users will not have access to a common server, you will want to distribute both files (jnlp and jar) and let them install them together.
