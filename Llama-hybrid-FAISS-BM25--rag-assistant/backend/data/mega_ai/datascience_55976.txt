For an odd-sized filter, all the previous layer pixels would be symmetrically around the output pixel. Without this symmetry, we will have to account for distortions across the layers which happens when using an even-sized kernel. Therefore, even-sized kernel filters are mostly skipped to promote implementation simplicity. If you think of convolution as an interpolation from the given pixels to a center pixel, we cannot interpolate to a center pixel using an even-sized filter. source: https://towardsdatascience.com/deciding-optimal-filter-size-for-cnns-d6f7b56f9363
