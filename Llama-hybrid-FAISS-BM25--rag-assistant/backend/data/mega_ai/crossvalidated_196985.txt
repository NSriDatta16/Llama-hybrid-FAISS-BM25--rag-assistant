Fit a trend to Time Series Data

I have got two time series data sets for 63 years. I want to fit a trend line to them. Here is what am doing: I first estimate a linear (y=a+bt+e) and an exponential model (y=at^b) as the graph shows that the data is rising) but the Durbin Watson is very low (it is 0.8). So I check the data for autocorrelation in Eviews using the LM test. There is positive autocorrelation. I then include 2 AR terms in my linear and exponential regression models. When I get the results of both these models I select the one with the smaller AIC abd BIC criteria. (which is the linear one) The Durbin Watson is now 1.8 As I am new to time series regression please let me know if my procedure is correct or whether I am missing something. Also as I am regressing the dependent variable on only time (as the independent variable) is the presence if autocorrelation correct?? Most textbooks refer to independent variable other than time when explaining autocorrelation. This is my data. Thank you Area 9357 12690 12321 13283 13784 13921 13981 14105 14300 14899 14840 14795 15111 15270 15442 15170 15357 15474 15648 15868 16478 16972 16658 16799 18377 18660 18934 19047 19201 19543 19596 19630 19865 20237 20458 20631 20879 21168 21299 21258 21219.8 21464.6 21771.6 22210 22556 22362 22554.056 23138.164 23345.748 23598.183 23751.836 23914.204 24119.436 24516.211 24760.722 24992.725 25445.042 25881.998 26210.913 26157.423 26398.806 26309.387 26453.969
