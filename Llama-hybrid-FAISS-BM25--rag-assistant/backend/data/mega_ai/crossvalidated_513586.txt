You need to take some course in logistic regression and not only follow tutorials as the one you linked. Several points: You seem to bin continuous variables before using them as predictors. That is mostly a bad idea, a better idea is to model using regression splines. See What is the benefit of breaking up a continuous predictor variable? and Violation of linearity assumption in Logistic Regression (and search this site). You say I want to convert these values into scores, but I am not sure how to accomplish this , which is strange. The predicted value for each case in LR is a probability value , and that is your score. See Why P>0.5 cutoff is not "optimal" for logistic regression? and Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification?
