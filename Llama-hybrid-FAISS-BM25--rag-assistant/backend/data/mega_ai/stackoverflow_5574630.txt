The Firefox uses his own certificate storage, whereas the IE8 uses windows storage. This explain why the certificate can be valid for Firefox and untrusted for IE8. To resolve the problem try to import certificate including whole chain into Windows certificate store (I don't think you would use IE on another OS). Maybe you will be force to mark the root certificate as valid (you can do it also for your certificate without chain). Also check the compatibility of sign algorithm with your OS. For example Windows XP (before SP3) cannot handle SHA-2 algorithm.
