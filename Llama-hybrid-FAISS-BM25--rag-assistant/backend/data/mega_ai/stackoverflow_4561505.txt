Cannot drag and drop to debugged-application run from a privileged-run Visual Studio 2010

I'm debugging my application which has drag-n-drop features in Visual Studio 2010. I have to run the IDE in privileged mode since some of my project required so. My problem: I can drag-drop when run the .exe file normally (run from Windows Explorer (WE)) but when debugging in VS2010 I cannot do drag-dropping between my app and WE. I tried to open WE in privileged mode but still cannot debug either. Do you have the same problem? If you do, do you have any work-around for it? Please share.
