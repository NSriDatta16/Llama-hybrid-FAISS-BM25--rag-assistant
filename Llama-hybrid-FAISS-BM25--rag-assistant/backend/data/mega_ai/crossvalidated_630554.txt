References for translating between ML/AI and stats disciplines

Do you know great resources (books, blogs, applications, youtube) for translating between the disciplines of statistics and machine learning/artificial intelligence? Some call it cultures , and they seem to exist on SE . I'd like to be better able to understand when different labels are used for the same concepts.
