SQLIte for .NET should work for you! SQLite is a small C library that implements a self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine. Features include: Transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) even after system crashes and power failures. Zero-configuration - no setup or administration needed. Implements most of SQL92. (Features not supported) A complete database is stored in a single disk file. Database files can be freely shared between machines with different byte orders. Supports databases up to 2 terabytes (241 bytes) in size. Sizes of strings and BLOBs limited only by available memory. Small code footprint: less than 30K lines of C code, less than 250KB code space (gcc on i486) Faster than popular client/server database engines for most common operations. Simple, easy to use API. TCL bindings included. Bindings for many other languages available separately. Well-commented source code with over 95% test coverage. Self-contained: no external dependencies. Sources are in the public domain. Use for any purpose.
