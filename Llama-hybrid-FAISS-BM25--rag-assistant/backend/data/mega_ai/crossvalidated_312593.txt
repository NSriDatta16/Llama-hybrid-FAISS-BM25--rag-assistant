Yes, it is definitely possible. Yes, it is sometimes useful. To "transform to z-scores" means to extract mean from your data and divide it by standard deviation. As long as your data has average and standard deviation, it is possible to transform it to z-scores :) However, both bivariate correlation and linear regression will ignore your transformation. This is because Pearson correlation coefficient ($\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{var(X)var(Y)}}$) and prediction of pure OLS linear regression ($X(X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$) will not change if you multiply $X$ by a constant. So for these purposes you don't need z-transformation. For other purposes, however, z-transformation can be useful, regardles of having log-transformed data. They include training neural networks or regularized linear regression, and application of unsipervised algorithms like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
