In case of logistic regression, you have a response variable $y_i$ that is 0/1 and (in the univariate case) one explanatory variable. So you have, for each case in your sample, a binary outcome $y_i$ and a value for $x_i$ . The idea is that the outcome 0/1 is the outcome of a Bernoulli variable with success probability $p_i$ that depends on $x_i$ . For the case $i$ the probability that the outcome is $y_i \in \{0,1\}$ is $p_i^{y_i}(1-p_i)^{1-y_i}$ . Indeed, the probability of $y_i=1$ is $p_i$ , obtained by substituting $y_i=1$ in $p_i^{y_i}(1-p_i)^{1-y_i}$ , and the probability of $y_i=0$ is $1-p_i$ , obtained by substituting $y_i=0$ in $p_i^{y_i}(1-p_i)^{1-y_i}$ . It is further assumed that the probability $p_i$ depends on $x_i$ , i.e. $p_i(x_i)$ . So for case $i$ , the probability to observe the outcome $y_i$ is equal to $p_i(x_i)^{y_i}(1-p_i(x_i))^{1-y_i}$ . The probability to observe all the $y_i$ for all cases in your sample is thus ( if all the observations are independent ) $\prod_{i=1}^n p_i(x_i)^{y_i}(1-p_i(x_i))^{1-y_i}$ . This is the place where the link function comes in: It is assumed that the dependence of $p_i$ on $x_i$ has a very particular functional form namely : $p_i(x_i)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}$ . So the probability to observe all $y_i$ for all cases in the sample is given by: $\prod_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right)^{y_i}\left(1-\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right)^{1-y_i}$ . Note that the parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are what we are looking for and if we see this probability as a fuction of these unknown parameters, then we get the likelihood function: $L(\beta_0, \beta_1)=\prod_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right)^{y_i}\left(1-\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)}}\right)^{1-y_i}$ . As the $x_i$ and $y_i$ are known from our sample, we can find the values $\hat{\beta}_i$ that maximise the likelihood. So, as you observed (and as @Scortchi said), you can not simply transform the zero and one , but instead you have to model each case in your sample as a Bernoulli variable with a success probability that depends on $x_i$ and estimate the parameters by maximum likelihood estimation .
