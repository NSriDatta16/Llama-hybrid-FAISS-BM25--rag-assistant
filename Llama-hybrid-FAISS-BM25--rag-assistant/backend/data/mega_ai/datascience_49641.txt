retrieve food groups from food item list

I have a dataframe of food items as follows: I have to create a food_group list that gives the food group it belongs to, for-example all type of yogurts should be in one group called yogurt. I used a snippet to take the first segment of the comma separated name, but I do not get the result like putting all yogurts in one group food_group_0 = [i.split(',') for i in data['name']] food_group = [item[0] for item in food_group_0] #To count how many of each entry there are in the list you can use the Counter class in the collections module: from collections import Counter c = Counter(food_group) print(c) the dataframe 0 4-Grain Flakes 1 4-Grain Flakes, Gluten Free 2 4-Grain Flakes, Riihikosken Vehn√§mylly 3 Almond 4 Almond Drink, Sweetened, Alrpo 5 Almond Drink, Unsweetened, Alrpo 6 Amaranth Flakes 7 Anchovy 8 Apple, Average, With Skin 9 Apple, Domestic, Without Skin 10 Apple, Domestic, With Skin 11 Apple, Dried 12 Apple, Imported, Without Skin 13 Apple, Imported, With Skin 14 Apple Chips 15 Apple Crisp Delight, Apple, Oat Flakes 16 Apple Jam 17 Apple Juice, Unsweetened, Vitamin C 18 Apple Kissel, Apple Soup, Dried Apples 19 Apple Kissel, Apple Soup, Fresh Apples 20 Apple Pie, Basic Sweet Dough, Gluten-Free, Con... 21 Apple Pie, Basic Sweet Dough, Low-Fat Milk 22 Apple Pie, Basic Sweet Dough, Naturally Gluten... 23 Apple Pie, Basic Sweet Dough, Whole Milk 24 Apple Pie, Shortbread Crust 25 Apple Pie, Shortbread Crust, Gluten-Free, Cont... 26 Apple Pie, Shortbread Crust, Naturally Gluten-... 27 Apple Pie, Shortbread Crust With Sour Milk 28 Apple Pie, Soft, Low-Fat Milk 29 Apple Pie With Quark Filling, Shortbread Crust ... 4068 Yoghurt, Plain, A+, Fat 2.5%, 1 Ug Vitamin D, ... 4069 Yoghurt, Plain, A+, Fat 2.5%, Lactose-Free, 1 ... 4070 Yoghurt, Plain, A+, Fat 4%, 1 Ug Vitamin D, La... 4071 Yoghurt, Plain, A+, Fatfree, 1 Ug Vitamin D, L... 4072 Yoghurt, Plain, A+ Greek, 2 % Fat, Lactose-Fre... 4073 Yoghurt, Plain, Ab, 0.2% Fat, Probiotics 4074 Yoghurt, Plain, Ab, 2.5% Fat, Probiotics 4075 Yoghurt, Plain, Activia, 3.4% Fat 4076 Yoghurt, Plain, Arla Protein, 1% Fat, Lactose-... 4077 Yoghurt, Plain, Bulgarian, 9% Fat 4078 Yoghurt, Plain, Fat-Free 4079 Yoghurt, Plain, Fat-Free, Lactose-Free, 1 Ug V... 4080 Yoghurt, Plain, Fat-Free, Low-Lactose, 0.5 Ug ... 4081 Yoghurt, Plain, Greek, 7% Fat, Lactose-Free 4082 Yoghurt, Plain, Organic, 3% Fat 4083 Yoghurt, Plain, Pirkka Reducol, 2.5% Fat, Low-... 4084 Yoghurt, Turkish/Greek, 10% Fat 4085 Yoghurt, Turkish/Greek, 10% Fat, Lactose-Free 4086 Yoghurt Sauce 4087 Yoghurt With Jam, Fat-Free 4088 Yoghurt With Muesli, A+, Fat 3.5%, Low-Lactose 4089 Yoghurt With Quark, Flavoured, Arla, 1.4% Fat,... 4090 Yoghurt With Quark, Flavoured, Luonto+, 1.2% F... 4091 Yoghurt With Quark, Flavoured, Valio, 1.7% Fat... 4092 Zander, Pike-Perch 4093 Zucchini, Boiled Without Salt 4094 Zucchini, Summer Squash 4095 Zucchini Filled With Minced Meat 4096 Zucchini Filled With Soya And Rice 4097 Zucchini Filled With Vegetables
