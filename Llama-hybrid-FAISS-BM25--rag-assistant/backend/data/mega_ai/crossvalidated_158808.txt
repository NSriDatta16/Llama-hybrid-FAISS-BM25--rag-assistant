Ok, thanks - though I'm not sure I follow the theory of how a Chi-Squared Independence test applies to the data. I've used the 'answer' field to respond as this might be the correct solution. Let me know what you think. Let's say I set hypotheses as follows: Null: variation in signups-per-call by agent is a result of chance. Alternative: variation in signups-per-call by agent is statistically significant and not a result of chance. And in Python (SciPy) construct the test: ag_1 = [326, 1908] ag_2 = [263, 1478] ag_3 = [81, 750] ag_4 = [53, 339] ag_5 = [45, 199] data = [ag_1, ag_2, ag_3, ag_4, ag_5] stats.chi2_contingency(data) Results: X-squared = 21.407 Degrees of freedom = 4 p-value = 0.0002629 So I reject the null: the variability in signups-per-call by agent is statistically significant. At least in theory anyway. In reality, as this is an observational study, I think there's a whole host of confounders that muddy the inference.
