I used to implement the general additive model to detect the non-linear relationship between two variables, but recently I've found out about the non-linear correlation implemented via nlcor package in R, you can implement this method in the same way as Pearson correlation, the correlation coefficient is between 0 and 1 and not -1 and 1 as in Pearson correlation. A higher correlation coefficient implies the existence of a strong non-linear relationship. Let's assume two time series x2 and y2 , the nonlinear correlation between the two time series is tested as follows install.packages("devtools") library(devtools) install_github("ProcessMiner/nlcor") library(nlcor) c The two variables seem to be strongly correlated via nonlinear relationship, you can also obtain the adjusted p-value for the correlation coefficient c$adjusted.p.value [1] 0 You can also plot the results print(c$cor.plot) You can view this link for more details
