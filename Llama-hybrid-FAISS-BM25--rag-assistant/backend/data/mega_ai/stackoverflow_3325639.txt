As calmh references the docs, here's the paragraph: Do not make any OpenGL ES calls from your code. You must not create an EAGLContext object or issue any OpenGL ES drawing commands of any kind. Using these calls will cause your application to be terminated immediately. Not sure why you would want to draw in that case anyway. As for the "stepping through a few screens"... Why not save the current state when exiting the app and restore this later anyway?
