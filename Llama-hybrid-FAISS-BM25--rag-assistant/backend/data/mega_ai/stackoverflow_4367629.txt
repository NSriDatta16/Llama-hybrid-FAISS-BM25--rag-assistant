How to get a member of a pointer to an instance of a structure?

I have a callback function called got_packet: void got_packet(u_char *args, const struct pcap_pkthdr *header, const u_char *packet) { WMShark *shark = (WMShark *)args; WMPacket *foundPacket = [[WMPacket alloc] init]; foundPacket.packetNumber = [[shark capturedPackets] count]; foundPacket.timeStamp = header.ts; // I get a compile error error: request for member 'ts' in something not a structure or union on the line foundPacket.timeStamp = header.ts; . The documentation says: ... a const struct pcap_pkthdr pointer to a structure with the following mem-bers: ts â€” a struct timeval containing the time when the packet was captured ... How can I access ts ? Thanks. For the die-hard C-developers, the square brackets are used in Objective-C, a superset of C. You can ignore this, they're initializers in this case.
