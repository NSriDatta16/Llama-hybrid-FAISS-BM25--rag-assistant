It's a complex problem, the standard method is to train a model which represents this semantic similarity function using a large text corpus (i.e. not only the tags themselves), by considering that the meaning of a word is provided by its context words. A more direct approach is to use a pre-trained word embeddings vectors that can be compared directly to find their similarity. A similar idea is to use WordNet , which is a database of words with their semantic similarity to each other.
