I don't want to rain on your parade, but in my experience trying to get non-programmers (or folks for whom programming is not their primary 'thing') interested in something as relatively arcane as writing good template code in C++ is a Sysiphean task. Heck, I work in a department with a large number of very good C++ programmers, and even so, getting the organization to commit to adopt new technology is not always easy. If your folks are good mathematicians and know enough programming to get by, trying to impose a mandate on them that they need to write generic C++ instead is going to be a very tough sell. I'd try hard to follow Mykola's advice and try to come up with some sort of generic algorithmic framework that minimizes the raw template coding they need to do; that might be the best way to overcome the resistance to the inevitable perception that you are simply shoveling more work at them.
