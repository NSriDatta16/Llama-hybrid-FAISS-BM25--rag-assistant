Pooled autocorrelation and AR model coefficients in a multivariate time series

I'm reading a paper where the authors generate AR(p) data for use in a sensitivity analysis. They get the coefs for the model by estimating the "pooled AR coefficients from the multivariate time series." I know from earlier in the paper that the multivariate time series goes something like this in R : A The paper says they "estimate the pooled autocorrelation and AR model coefficients." I'm not sure what they mean by that. How does one pool AR coefficients across the columns of x ? Any help appreciated.
