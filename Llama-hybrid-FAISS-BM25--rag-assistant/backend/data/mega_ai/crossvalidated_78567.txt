I can think of at least two native Java alternatives that you might look into. The first one is the cern.jet.stat package. It's part of a much larger project called Colt . The second one is Weka . It's mainly conceived as an end-user GUI for machine learning, classification and clustering problems and the like, but it also supports more basic statistical operations, and crucially, it exposes an API . I can pretty much guarantee you that neither of these will be particularly easy for you to learn to use well. If you want a really basic intro to Weka, there is actually a 5-lesson MOOC ; it's no longer running but you can still view the videos, and each lesson is about an hour long and is further subdivided into about a half-dozen 10 minute videos. I'd recommend viewing the first two or three of these (i.e., 20-30 minutes of your time in total) from lesson one, in order to get a good intro to what Weka is and what it can do. After that you can probably skip the rest and move directly to the API in order to retrieve the classes that you would need to do your work.
