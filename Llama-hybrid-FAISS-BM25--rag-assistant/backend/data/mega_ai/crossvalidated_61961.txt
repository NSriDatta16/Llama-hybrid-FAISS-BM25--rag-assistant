Skewed but bell-shaped still considered as normal distribution for ANOVA?

This could be a pretty basic question, I'm a little rusty on my stats knowledge. Background: I am monitoring website load time performance. To do so, I have a script running and capturing data points (About 400) on load time through various Agents. Every Agent is located in different geographic locations, but they measure the same steps. I would like to determine if there is statistical difference between the agents. So if one is consistently reporting slower load time performance I would like to know if its because of the Agent or not. I would include images but I need 10 reputation points and I just found out about this website. Problem: I have two sets of data from different agents measuring the seconds it takes a website to download, both are bell-shaped but are heavily skewed to the right. Can I still perform ANOVA to determine if there is difference, even though they are skewed? Thanks in advance
