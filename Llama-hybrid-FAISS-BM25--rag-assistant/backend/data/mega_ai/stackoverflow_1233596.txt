WPF/C# - test connection string and fail elegantly

I've got a WPF application that uses LINQ to SQL DataContexts. What's a "best practice" way of testing the database connection and letting the user know that the connection is either bad or the network is down, etc, so that the app doesn't just bomb. Right now, I get the Splash Screen and then a "Program has stopped working" while "Windows is checking for a solution to the problem". Thanks!
