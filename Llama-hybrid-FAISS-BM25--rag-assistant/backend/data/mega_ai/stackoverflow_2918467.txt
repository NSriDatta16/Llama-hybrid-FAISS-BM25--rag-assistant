The primary use of JavaScript is to write functions that are embedded in or included from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. Some simple examples of this usage are: Opening or popping up a new window with programmatic control over the size, position, and attributes of the new window. Validation of web form input values to make sure that they will be accepted before they are submitted to the server. Changing images as the mouse cursor moves over them: This effect is often used to draw the user's attention to important links displayed as graphical elements. Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than on a remote server) it can respond to user actions quickly, making an application feel more responsive.
