Commanding - your 'SomeEventHandler' needs to be a class that implements ICommand ... there's a heap of literature available online... Also - I would consider getting a free, lightweight 'mini' MVVM framework, such as MvvmFoundation , which provides the RelayCommand for just such a purpose (without the complexity/overhead of learning PRISM) EDIT: Have a look at this blog for attaching command to any event... It is incredibly powerful, as I mentioned, but I guess you do need to make a judgement call if this is what you want, compared with something like attaching an old-fashioned event, and using a super-slim event handler in your code behind that simply invokes some method on your ViewModel, something like: public void SomeEventHandler(object sender, SomeEventArgs e) { MyViewModel vm = (MyViewModel)this.DataContext; vm.HandleLoadEvent( ); } pragmatic vs Best-practise... I'll leave it with you ;)
