In my opinion, if the data is a time series data, forecasting based confidence intervals give a good idea of whether a point is an outlier or not. For non time series univariate data, multiple methods can be tried out - Z-score based method(this resembles your idea of using points farther from the expected value as outliers) Tukey's Method MAD(Median Absolute Deviation) Out of the above methods for univariate data, I would recommend tukey's method because it is relatively robust. For Multivariate Data, I would recommend methods like LOF, Elliptic Envelope (which uses the Mahalanobis distance internally - implemented in scikit-learn).
