Place the directory outside of the document root (and outside of directories aliased into the document root or any directories mapped via mod_rewrite). Apache and the Perl script will be able to read/write to this location (given the full path to the location and with correct file permissions, of course), but it will not be accessible via a URL. There's an important caveat! Files outside of the document root aren't directly accessible via a URL, but if the Perl script is displaying content from the files then you have the usual security concerns of XSS and information disclosure. You'll also want to pay attention to how filename "uniqueness" or lack thereof impacts this design, e.g. a user might try to intentionally overwrite a file or guess file names.
