Instruct the browser not to wait for more content while processing continues

How do I instruct the browser not to expect any more content to be coming down the line? Kinda like the server saying “I got what I need, you don’t need to wait while I finish the processing of the page”. I have a server-side task, which is initiated when a certain page is hit. The task may be time-consuming, but the rendered HTML will always be the same, i.e. like a “Thank you for starting the task” message. I’m considering starting a new thread to handle the task, but I believe there must be a more elegant solution, where you just send the right headers/instructions to the browser and then continue processing. Any ideas?
