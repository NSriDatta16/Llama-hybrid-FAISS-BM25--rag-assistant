This depends on the classifier you are using. For classifiers like logistic regression, you can calculate this quantity, if you have a threshold defined (for example, saying that p=50% is your threshold). If the coefficients are in a vector B, you can to solve the equation $1/(1+e^{-Bx}))=threshold$ for x, and this gives the dividing point. For more complex classifiers that might not be solvable, you can get a range of numbers (using numpy.arange) and run the classifier on each. The cutoff point is between the two points where the classification changed from one class to another.
