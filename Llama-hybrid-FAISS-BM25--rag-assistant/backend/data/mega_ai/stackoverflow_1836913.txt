There is be a Firefox option in about:config to turn this off - nglayout.enable_drag_images - but obviously that will only work for you. I'm guessing you want to remove it for all visitors? If you want to do drag & drop, maybe try jQuery UI or another JS library? You should be able to move other elements quite easily, and you could use a background image like Tim said on one of those. Another advantage to that is you can use CSS sprite effects to reduce HTTP requests. I made a jigsaw puzzle with jQuery UI, which is actually only one image, but it looks like several.
