Apply two conditionals to a singel attribute in a Magento collection

I am currently trying to get products that are of a certain price range in Magento. I tried the first two logical ways I could think. The first one being to add two addAttributeToFilter() statements to my code. $products->addAttributeToFilter('price', array('gteq' => $r['price_low'])); $products->addAttributeToFilter('price', array('lteq' => $r['price_high'])); No dice. This just gave me the second one. Then what I decided to try was adding both conditionals to a single addAttributeToFilter() like this: $price_array['gteq'] = $r['price_low']; $price_array['lteq'] = $r['price_high']; $products->addAttributeToFilter('price', $price_array); Again just the high end. I did a getSelect() on my collection and confirmed it in the query that it is only applying the high end. Does anyone know how I can get products that have a price range.
