Some of your jQuery shenanigans must be applying the background colour as an inline style. This is what I get in IE 8's developer tools for the spans: filter: alpha(opacity=100); ZOOM: 1; background: #fff; Update: here it is. In fadelinks.js var bgcolor = "#fff"; // unfortunately we have to set bg color because of that freakin' IE *!$%#!!?!?%$! //please use the same background color in your links as it is in your document.
