It looks like a classpath problem the way you're starting the applet. If you start the applet using NetBeans Run file, Netbeans probably takes your project classpath as classpath for the Applet and not what you've specified in the HTML page of the Applet. As you can see the classloader is com.sun.enterprise.loader.ASURLClassLoader which is not the standard classloader (URLClassLoader) that Applets use. Run your applet using the browser or the appletviewer or jnlp (Java webstart).
