I have an exception to @Andrew's rule: I've been using GridView in an ASP.Net form and binding a recordset to it dynamically for debug purposes (I didn't specify anything for it but an ID). When you drag the GridView to your form, it creates an code. I found out that if I drop the closing tag and close the opener with />, the GridView does not get displayed. On the same note, check my question from last week , where people correctly commented that in HTML/XHTML, some tags (like DIV) must have a closing tag.
