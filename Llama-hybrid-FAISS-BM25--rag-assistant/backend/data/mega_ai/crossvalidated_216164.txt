How do I perform Bayesian Updating for a function of multiple parameters, each with its own distribution?

I have a variable that is a recursive function involving other variables with known distributions (see problem below). Let $b(t+1) = b(t) + C \sqrt{b(t)}$ where I know $C \sim N(1.82, .0298)$ and the initial value of $b$ [$b_{initial} \sim N(.02,0.0036)$]. My observation for updating is a discrete value of $b$ for a certain '$t$' (say $b(1500) = 0.005$) but I need to find posterior distributions for $C$ and $b_{initial}$. Any thoughts or resources that can be directed my way would be extremely helpful. Thanks
