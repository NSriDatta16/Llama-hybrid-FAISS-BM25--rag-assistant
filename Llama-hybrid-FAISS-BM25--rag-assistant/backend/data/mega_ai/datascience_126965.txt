How does ROC work with SVM?

Could someone please explain how ROC works with SVM? Specifically i'm using RocCurveDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, y_pred, ax=ax[1]) which works fine. Since the data for y_pred is not probabilities, but rather a vector that contains 0 or 1, is threshold constantly 0.5?
