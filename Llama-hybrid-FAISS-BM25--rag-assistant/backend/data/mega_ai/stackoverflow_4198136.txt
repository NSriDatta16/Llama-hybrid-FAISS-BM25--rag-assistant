Classic ADO.NET or Entity Framework better for larger scale database transactions?

We just started on a project to develop a web portal using .NET 3.5 and MSSQL 2008. A question was raised on which is the sensible choice to handle data access which involves tens of thousands of records up to hundreds of thousands? I saw a table somewhere that compared ADO.NET, EF and LINQ to SQL and it seemed like LINQ to SQL is the slowest by average but ADO.NET choked on large operations. By the way, what are your thoughts on using NHibernate on a large scale?
