Non-negative matrix factorisation seems suited to this kind of problem; alternatively, give Random Forests a go, but I generally use R and am not sure if Python implementations do pattern discovery (clustering). The matrices would be tumour type along one dimension and the percentage of cases that fall into a particular age group on the other - if a particular age isn't represented in a tumour you need to set the count of that bin to 0. To use an example Age_Bin(Features) BRCA ACC Colorectal Cancer Kidney Cancer 30-40 8 0 24 10 40-50 54 20 35 30 50-60 24 35 35 40 et cetera. NNMF will then attempt to split the tumour types into clusters based on features defined by age bins; so, to apply the method, a good starting point would be to identify all bins represented in the dataset, set counts to 0 for those tumour types that have no representation in a bin, and then apply the algorithm to find clusters; as has been done here, to use an example... http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/analyses__2014_04_16/reports/cancer/HNSC/miRseq_Mature_Clustering_CNMF/nozzle.html The methods section in that report explains how to select the optimal number of clusters et cetera. Additionally - here is a package for NNMF using Python should you be interested http://nimfa.biolab.si/
