If you have a means to get an alert when a file does not change in some time, then I have a less elegant, but probably simpler solution: try to find out the filename where Postgres stores the table in question (someone should dig into system tables in Postgres - maybe ask this in a separate question) and then have your monitoring tool set up to watch the modify time of that file.
