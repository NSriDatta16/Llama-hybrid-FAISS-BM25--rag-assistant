Creating composite index using PCA from time series links to http://www.cup.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SEICUPWebsite_10April13.pdf . In that article on page 19, the authors mention a way to create a Non-Standardised Index (NSI) by using the proportion of variation explained by each factor to the total variation explained by the chosen factors. This NSI was then normalised.
