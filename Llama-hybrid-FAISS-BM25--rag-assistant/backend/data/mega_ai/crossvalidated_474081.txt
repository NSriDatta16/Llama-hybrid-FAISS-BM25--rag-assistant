I just wrote a blog post on that topic ! In short, I write about different methods for dealing with the problem of sparse / irregular sequential data. Here is a short outline of methods to try: Lomb-Scargle Periodogram This is a way of computing spectrograms on non-equidistant timestep series. Data modeling with Interpolation networks You really don't want to interpolate naively between timesteps, but training a network to interpolate for you might help! Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models Neural networks that can work with continuous time can naturally work on irregular time series. Add timing dt to the input as an additional feature (or positional encoding in Tensorflow) Methods for dealing with missing values This is only viable if you have vast amounts of data Hope this helps point you to the right direction :)
