You can use TimeSeriesSplit , which is precisely a function to perform the split of time series to train and test sets. Please note that in a time series, you cannot use a common split, as the data is fixed in time and therefore you cannot suffle it. Or, you can use a percentage of the end of the time series as a test set. For example: Train your data on data from the first 10 months and then test on data from months 11 and 12.
