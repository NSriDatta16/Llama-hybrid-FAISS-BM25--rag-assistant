Why are hidden Markov models considered 'mixture models'?

I'm a bit confused by the conception of "mixture model" I'm studying hidden Markov model, which is frequently referred to as a "mixture model". But I don't know what the term "mixture" implies. Suppose the HMM has state variable sequence $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_t$, $v_i\in\{1,\dots,k\}$. The emission model has pdf $f(y_i\mid\theta_{v_i})$. For each state $m$, the emission probability is a gaussian mixture $f(y\mid\theta_m)=\frac{1}{3}\mathcal{N}(\mu_m,\sigma^2)+\frac{1}{3}\mathcal{N}(\mu_m-10,\sigma^2)+\frac{1}{3}\mathcal{N}(\mu_m+20,\sigma^2)$ Why is it a mixture model? Is it because it has multiple states and each state has its own emission probability? Or is it because each state uses a Gaussian mixture? According to Wikipedia , the second understanding is more probable. However, intuitively, I think the first understanding is more reasonable. ---------------added on July 13, 2015-------------------------- I know the definition of mixture model in Wikipedia. I (think I) know what is a mixture model. Now I need to know what is not a mixture model. Is a multi-state model a mixture model in general? Another evidence to support the first understanding. In the first three paragraphs of section 7, the paper claims the observation $y_{t+1}$ is drawn from the mixture component indexed by $v_{t+1}$. Here, $v_{t+1}\in\{1,\dots,k\}$ is a state variable, and given the realization of the variable, $f(y_{t+1}\mid\theta_{v_{t+1}})$ is an emission probability. Hence this multi-state model is called a "mixture model" and each probability (corresponding to a state), without being summed up, is called a "mixture component" in the paper. Moreover, there might be a way to "mediate" the two understandings: if each state $m$ has an occurrence probability $\pi_m$, then, the marginal emission probability (state variable is integrated) is $\sum_{m=1}^k\pi_mf(y\mid\theta_m)$, this is obviously a mixture model. Hence we have a general claim: a multi-state distribution can also be called a mixture model due to the above transformation. Is this claim valid? Why?
