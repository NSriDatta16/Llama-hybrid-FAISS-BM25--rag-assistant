I think this comes from the rule of thumb for using the normal approximation for a confidence interval (cf. @AlecosPapadopoulos' answer ). In short, it is recommended that [the smaller of] $np$ [or $n(1-p)$] be greater than $5$ for the normal approximation to be used. If this condition holds, it is often considered that the normal approximation can be used, and tests that implicitly rely on it can be used instead of exact tests*. This does not guarantee that you will see a defect, but seems to work pretty well. We can determine the probability you will see a defect by using the binomial distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF). Here I use R to do so: 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+01, prob=1e-01) # [1] 0.9948462 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+02, prob=1e-02) # [1] 0.9934295 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+03, prob=1e-03) # [1] 0.9932789 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+04, prob=1e-04) # [1] 0.9932637 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+05, prob=1e-05) # [1] 0.9932622 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+06, prob=1e-06) # [1] 0.9932621 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+07, prob=1e-07) # [1] 0.9932621 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+08, prob=1e-08) # [1] 0.9932621 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+09, prob=1e-09) # [1] 0.9932621 1-pbinom(0, size=5e+10, prob=1e-10) # [1] 0.9932621 Since we want the probability of getting anything but $0$ defects, we calculate the probability of getting exactly $0$ and subtract that from $1$. The analytical solutions are listed to the right. They seem to converge to $\approx 99.33\%$ as the defect probability decreases (and $N$ necessarily goes up). Some meta commentary: A standard paradigm contrasts accuracy vs. precision . Because common statistical procedures privilege unbiasedness (cf. maximum likelihood vs. shrinkage estimators), the process of determining the appropriate sample size ( power analysis ) tends to focus on getting an acceptable level of precision. In your case, this seems to be whether an interval estimate (e.g., a 95% CI) will have an accurate level of coverage . * Technically, since the rule of thumb is $>5$, and not $\ge 5$, this would be based on an analogy to the lower limit of the rule of thumb, but then rules of thumb by their nature shouldn't be taken as so exacting.
