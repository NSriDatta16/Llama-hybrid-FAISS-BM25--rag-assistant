Want some ideas on how to develop a image retrieval system

I just want to study more on how Google can search images. I know it is too complicated for me,but I want to try to do it on my own set of images. This is how I propose: For a large set of random images in a folder, I could use some keywords (maybe not appropriate, subject to change based on your ideas), to search some images and sort them, just like what google image does. I've talked with some Graphic people on how to determine the similarities between images, they told me something like: Global Color Histogram Image Layout and block-based histogram (which I am not very familiar with) RAG-based description. So, now I really need your idea, I don't need any code or something, just could you please share what you may think of in designing such a local-image-search system, how would you define similarities between images, how would you represent images, etc. I will continue to talk to some graphic people to learn, but I also really want your ideas to get me started.
