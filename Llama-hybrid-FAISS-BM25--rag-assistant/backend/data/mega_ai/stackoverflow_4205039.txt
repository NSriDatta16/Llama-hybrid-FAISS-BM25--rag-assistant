You misinterpret the return value. TRUE doesn't mean memory leak, it means there're some unreleased blocks in the heap, that might just as well be pointed to by some pointers in the program. Those objects might be created by CRT startup code and by the static objects constructors. If you're still suspicious - set an allocation hook and inspect when objects are created. To do this early enough you'll need an object with constructed during startup - use #pragma init_seg( compiler ) for that.
