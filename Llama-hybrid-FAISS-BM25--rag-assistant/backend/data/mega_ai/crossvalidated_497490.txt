What does it mean if no lag lies outside the 95% confidence interval in the PACF plot?

I have time series data and started to test for autocorrelation with the help of the ACF and PACF plot after differencing my dependent variable (diff_gap). I type in the following code: acf(final_dataset_diff$diff_gap) pacf(final_dataset_diff$diff_gap) then I got the following plots: So, my question is, how I should interpret the PACF Plot where no lag is outside the blue line? How can I now say which number of lagged variables could be appropriate for my ARIMA model (I want to refine it with the AIC later)? Thanks for your comments!
