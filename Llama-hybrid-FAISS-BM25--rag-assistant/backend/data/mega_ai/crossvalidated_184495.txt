Class imbalance problem and baseline classifier

I have a dataset with four numerical attributes and a class (target) variable. There is an enormous imbalance between positive and negative instances according to class variable. To cope with imbalance I use undersampling strategy; I randomly delete negative instances. Then I applied several machine learning algorithms and obtain quite promising results. However, the reviewer suggests that I should apply baseline classifier (e.g., ZeroR) to assess the classifier results. But isn't such approach misleading? Accuracy of ZeroR will be 0.5 by default. What do you suggest?
