Sensitivity Analysis of ANN models

I am a beginner in neural networks. I have split my data into training, validation and testing (out-of-sample hold-out set) and trained several models using MLP in Dell Statistica. I want to test sensitivity of the selected models implemented. Which dataset should i use?
