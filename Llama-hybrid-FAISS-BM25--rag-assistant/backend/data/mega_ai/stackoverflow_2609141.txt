Is it possible to have a JPanel over JTable

I have a JTable whose associated TableModel could be initially empty. Therefore, it currently shows a JTable with its columns and no rows. In order to fill this JTable , I want the user to drag and drop elements from another component. The problem is that I would like to hint the user that he/she should drag elements to this table, with some message like "Drag xxx here to add a row" . I thought that I could achieve this by putting a panel over the JTable , but I don't think it is possible with any java layout. Does anyone know how to do this? Or should I stick to a CardLayout to switch to/from the hint and the JTable? Thanks a lot
