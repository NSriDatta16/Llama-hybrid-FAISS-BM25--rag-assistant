Best way to analyse categorical data?

I'm fairly new to data science so forgive the newb question, but: what's the best way to work with categorical data when doing exploratory data analysis? Is there a dedicated field for that? In this case I've got a set of Covid-19 patient data: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/ Besides the obvious that there are only a couple of numerical fields, I'm wondering if there's a "best practice" for making some insights there? To check the value_counts for each column seems an obvious one, and make sure that the data are good by checking null values. I might check correlation between different columns but that doesn't work here. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! Matthew
