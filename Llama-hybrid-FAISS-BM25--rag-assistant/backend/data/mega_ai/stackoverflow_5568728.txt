have you tried passing false into .clone()? That bool stands for withDataAndEvents, so you're inheriting all the same events that are also attached to the old object. Edit: if you need withDataAndEvents for other reasons, you can try using draggable("destroy") on the original right before you do the clone, then make it draggable again after? Not the most elegant but it works: http://jsfiddle.net/GheD5/
