The reason lies in the types of the variables: mfx is insensitive to type, and treats a binary variable as a boolean, even if it is numeric; whereas margins treats differently factors or boolean from numerical variables. In particular, the marginal effect computed for binary numerical variables is the predicted output $y$ when the variable $x$ equals 1 minus the predicted $y$ when $x$ equals its average , instead of subtracting the predicted output at $x=0$ , as in mfx or when $x$ is a factor or a boolean. Hence, if you change the types of $x$ and $y$ to logical (or factor), you should retrieve the results of mfx . To conclude, the most intuitive and consistent definition is probably the one of mfx .
