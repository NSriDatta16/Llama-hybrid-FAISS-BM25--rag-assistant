Comparing LM, LR and Wald Test in Logistic regression model

I want to test omitted variables and I perform 3 tests: $Wald$ , Likelihood Ratio ( $LR$ ) and Lagrange Multiplier ( $LM$ ) test. My model is a linear model with a polynomial element ( $x^2$ ). I found a source saying that with a linear model, $Wald\geq LR\geq LM$ but I found $LM$ is slightly larger than $LR$ . Is it an implication for a wrongly specified model?
