Dead code identification (C++)

I have a large legacy C++ project compiled under Visual Studio 2008. I know there is a reasonably amount of 'dead' code that is not accessed anywhere -- methods that are not called, whole classes that are not used. I'm looking for a tool that will identify this by static analysis . This question: Dead code detection in legacy C/C++ project suggests using code coverage tools. This isn't an option as the test coverage just isn't high enough. It also mentions a -Wunreachable-code. option to gcc. I'd like something similar for Visual Studio. We already use the linker's /OPT:REF option to remove redundant code, but this doesn't report the dead code at a useful level (when used with /VERBOSE there are over 100,000 lines, including a lot from libraries). Are there any better options that work well with a Visual Studio project?
