You can detect this kind of bounce with a moving average (MA) model. A moving average model is based on predicting $Y_{t}$ by using the past errors in estimation: $Y_{t}=Y_{t-1}+\theta_{1}\epsilon_{t-1}+...+\theta_{q}\epsilon_{t-q}+\epsilon_{t}$ Where $\epsilon_{t-1}$ was the error in estimating $Y_{t-1}$. If there is a shock in period t-1 and that causes an unexpected fall in the value of a companies stock then you'll have a positive error $\epsilon$ in time period t-1. If you have rebound (or otherwise called a dead cat bounce) in period t you'd expect $\theta_{1}$ to have a positive coefficient, i.e. overestimating $Y_{t-1}$ would lead to a correction in estimating $Y_{t}$. A moving average model of order one, MA(1), looks at just the error in the previous period. A moving average model of order MA(q) would look at the errors in predictions of the last q periods. For more details have a look at ARIMA modelling (the MA standing for moving average), here's a good place to start: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8 Technical Disclaimer : the above formulae is actually more than just a moving average as it in effect includes a first order difference term, $Y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}$, assuming your data is stationary after being differenced. The following model would be actually be considered a ARIMA(0,1,1) model: $Y_{t}=Y_{t-1}+\theta_{1}\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}$ I only mention this as knowing when to difference your time-series is a really important part of ARIMA analysis. https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8
