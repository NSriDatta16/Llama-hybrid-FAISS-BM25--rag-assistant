SELECT COUNT(*) may be faster. That is because using * gives the optimizer liberty to choose any column to count on. Say you have a primary key on a INT column, and a non clustered key on a different bigint column. But the primary key is likely the clustered index, and as such it is in fact significantly larger than the nonclustered bigint index (has more pages). So if the optimizer is free to choose the bigint non-clustered index, it can return the response faster. Possible much faster, depending on the table. So overall is always better to leave it as COUNT(*) and let the optimizer choose.
