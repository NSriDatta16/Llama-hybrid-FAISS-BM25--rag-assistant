order of the time series model

I am kind of new to time series modeling. I am trying to fit a model for a time series variable. I am trying to fit a ARMA model. I am using R to do the analysis. When i estimate the model using both yule-walker method and maximum likelihood method, the output says that i need to estimate 10 coefficients. It seems strange for me to estimate 10 coefficients. my question is , is this a possible situation or is this due to something wrong in my method? This is the link for access the data : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WfaDUB2NnhIUsRggm9eITq7D-L55u0IP this is my code so far, aus_indata
