It's advised to scale all inputs to a set interval ($[-1,1]$ or $[0,1]$ are popular choices). That way you won't get any bias towards specific inputs which happen to have large values. Scaling can have a large effect on accuracy. Make sure to use the same scaling factors on both training and testing data. For more information, you can have a look at a practical guide to SVM classification .
