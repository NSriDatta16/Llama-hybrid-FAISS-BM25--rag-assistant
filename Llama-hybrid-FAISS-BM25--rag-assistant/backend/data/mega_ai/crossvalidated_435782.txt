reference request for the impact of priors in bayesian statistics

It is well known that in bayesian statistics, the prior believe can have a large impact on the estimation result. For example if you flip a coin ten times to determine whether it is loaded, a prior $p(loaded) = 1$ will result in estimates of $\hat{p}(loaded) =1$ irrespective of the data. I am looking for a reference which discuss the impact of the prior on bayesian estimation results in some detail, focusing not only on the extreme case provided in my example (ideally a text book or a paper, something citeable).
