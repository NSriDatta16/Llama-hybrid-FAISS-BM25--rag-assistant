Is n_estimators in BaggingRegressor() the number of trees or data subsets?

I'm learning about using the BaggingRegressor() from scikit learn ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingRegressor.html ) Its n_estimators parameter is defined as: n_estimators: int, default=10 The number of base estimators in the ensemble. Am I right in thinking this changes the number of tree-based models running in total? For example, I am using xgboost, If I set BaggingRegressor(n_estimators=100) is it changing the n_estimators in xgb to be: xgboost.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=100) or does it do xgboost.XGBRegressor()*100 ? Also what within BaggingRegressor() decides the number of random subsets to be created if it's not the number of base estimators?
