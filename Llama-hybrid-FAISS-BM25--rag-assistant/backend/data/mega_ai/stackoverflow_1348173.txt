How would you use Entity Framework (1.0) with ASP.Net Membership?

I'm trying to design an entity model for an application that uses ASP.Net membership for it's user authentication. In most of the database schemas I create, records typically end up related to users via the UserId field on the aspnet_users table. That's worked fine for me in the past, but now that I'm using EF, I'm having some conceptual issues with figuring out how I'm going to reference the user from an entity. For example, let's say we have a "post" entity that contains a "postedBy" property. I'd LIKE to be able to do get the username of the user that created this post with something like post.user.username, but I'm wary of creating an entity based on the aspnet_user table for fear of creating a model that let's me bypass the Membership class when making changes to the database. I've considered just leaving the post.userId field as a guid and then requiring that any code that needs to know the username use that guid to get the user from the Membership class, but that seems "ineligant". Does anyone have any recommendations for entity model designs that integrate with Membership? I'd be reasonably happen with a "read-only" user entity.
