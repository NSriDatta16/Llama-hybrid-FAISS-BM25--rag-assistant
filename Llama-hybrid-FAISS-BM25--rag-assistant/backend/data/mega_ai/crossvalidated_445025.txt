Likert scale question as a dependent variable

I have a questionnaire with many items. The researcher defined several items to be dependent variables of interest for analysis. Some of them are represented by a single likert scale question with a , i.e, categorical variable with 5 levels: 5 - strong disagreement 4 - disagreement 3 - medium agreement 2 - agreement 1 - strong agreement Unfortunately, with no other questions, using Cronbach's alpha and then averaging the scores is not plausible and I will need to analyze a single question. Since the dependent variable is ordinal, I could do an ordinal regression. More than that, I could recode the values so groups 1-2 are together and so are 4-5. However group 3 is "medium" and I do not know where to put it, so I remain with an ordinal regression. Ordinal regression is not intuitive to people, and I wish to avoid using. Is there another way to handle this analysis (assume various independent variables, categorical or continuous). I was thinking maybe some transformation and then assuming that the latent variable behind the likert scale variable is continuous, but this is a shot in the dark. How should I analyze this ? Example data is attached in the table below:
