Ordinal Logistic Regression model in R

I am running an ordinal logistic regression model in R. My dependent variable is a categorical variable with 4 levels. I have six independent variables. When I run the ordinal logit, one of the six independent variables gets split into two with each having its own coefficient. I was wondering why this could be happening?
