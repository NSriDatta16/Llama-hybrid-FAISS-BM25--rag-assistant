Indeed the identity monad is very useful as a base in a monad transformer. For instance the maybe monad transformer (maybe-t) allows for a nothing value other than nil: 1:2 => (use 'clojure.contrib.monads) nil 1:3 => (domonad maybe-m [a 1 b 2] (+ a b)) 3 1:4 => (domonad maybe-m [a 1 b nil] (+ a b)) nil ;; Domain uses the :fail keyword as the nil value: 1:6 => (domonad (maybe-t identity-m :fail) [a 1 b :fail] (+ a b)) :fail Note that using maybe-m as the base monad would shortcut on both :fail and nil, instead of just :fail.
