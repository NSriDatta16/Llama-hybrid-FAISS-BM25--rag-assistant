java - get mouse events outside of a component

i'm having the same issue as the person here , in that i need to track a frame location while it is being dragged on OS X. The question had not been resolved there, so: how do i tell a frame that a mouse down event happened on its (OS-native) title bar or, more generally, that a mouse down event happened somewhere on the screen?
