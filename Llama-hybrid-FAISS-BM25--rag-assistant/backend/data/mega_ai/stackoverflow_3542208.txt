As of 1.6.0_18+, JWS offers the IntegrationService . The IS can not only install/uninstall desktop shortcuts and menu items, but will report the success or failure of attempts to create/remove them. Some minor points on standard use of shortcuts (through the JNLP file) using Windows and Linux. JWS will prompt the user only if the app. is sand-boxed. If the app. is trusted, it will go ahead and attempt to create the shortcut. On Ubuntu Linux the menu items will fail silently, but the desk-top shortcut works. I have been meaning to investigate whether Ubuntu menu items will work better using the IS, by targeting the sub-menu to one of the standard sub-menus offered. If that is the case, menu items might be installed by the application targeting different menu structures on different OS'.
