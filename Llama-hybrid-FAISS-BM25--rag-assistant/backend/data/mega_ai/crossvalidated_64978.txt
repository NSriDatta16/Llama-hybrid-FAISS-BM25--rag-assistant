Modeling seasonality in sales time series

Suppose I have 5 years of weekly sales data for a particular product. I also have other variables such as weekly unemployment rate, weekly coupon rates, and percentages of marketing amount spent on internet, TV, and mail advertising. Suppose I want to determine whether season has an effect on sales. Would it be best to treat season as a dummy variable where season takes values: Winter, Fall, Spring Summer, or would it be better to perform spectral analysis on the sales time series and determine seasonality that way? The current setup I have is: $sales_{t} = week_{t}+ unemploy_{t} + coupon_{t} + internetprop_{t} + TVprop_{t} + mailprop_{t} + season_{t} + w_{t}$ where $w_{t}$ is white noise. I run a linear regression first and depending on the ACF and PACF charts, I choose a model for the error term. Is the correct approach? I am unsure of how to model seasonality.
