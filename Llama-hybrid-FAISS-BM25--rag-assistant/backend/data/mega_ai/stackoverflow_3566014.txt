The use of traps with SNMP is considered unreliable. You really should not be relying on traps. SNMP was designed to be used as a request/response protocol. The protocol details are simple (hence the name, "simple network management protocol"). And UDP is a very simple transport. Try implementing TCP on your basic agent - it's considerably more complex than a simple agent coded using UDP. SNMP get/getnext operations have a retry mechanism - if a response is not received within timeout then the same request is sent up to a maximum number of tries.
