Instead of trying to use a regex to match the URLs you want to allow (as the other answers seem to try), use a regex to match the URLs that you want to block: \.(?!html$)[^./]*$ This regex matches the extension of a URL, unless the extension is .html . URLs without an extension or an .html extension are not matched. Your examples don't include URLs with queries ( ?param=value ) or fragements ( #anchor ) so the regex does not account for those. I'm also assuming your regex flavor supports lookahead .
