char[] (c lang) to string (c++ lang) conversion

I can see that almost all modern APIs are developed in the C language. There are reasons for that: processing speed, low level language, cross platform and so on. Nowadays, I program in C++ because of its Object Orientation, the use of string, the STL but, mainly because it is a better C. However when my C++ programs need to interact with C APIs I really get upset when I need to convert char[] types to C++ strings, then operate on these strings using its powerful methods, and finally convert from theses strings to char[] again (because the API needs to receive char[]). If I repeat these operations for millions of records the processing times are higher because of the conversion task. For that simple reason, I feel that char[] is an obstacle in the moment to assume the C++ as a better c. I would like to know if you feel the same, if not (I hope so!) I really would like to know which is the best way for C++ to coexist with char[] types without doing those awful conversions. Thanks for your attention.
