Unless you are developing a really BIG website, one database is the way to proceed (by the way, did you consider the possible issues that may raise when working with various databases?). If you are worried about performance, you can always configure different tablespaces on several storage devices in order to improve timings. If you are worried about security, just increase it (better passwords, no direct root login, no port forwarding, avoid tunneling, etc.)
