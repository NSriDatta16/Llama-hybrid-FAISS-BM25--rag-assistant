Here you have designed a simple ANN architecture. Anyhow if you want to build CNN architecture(Refer https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/ ) RNN architecture(Refer https://keras.io/api/layers/recurrent_layers/ ). My suggestion would be better to have an understanding of compete architecure of any version of NN before you apply.
