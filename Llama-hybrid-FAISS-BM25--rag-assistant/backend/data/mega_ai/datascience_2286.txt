The basic thing, you can do in that situation, is to split your query into N simple sentences each of which should be processed in order to receive YES/NO answer considering if the sentence is a query. That way you will receive following results: Input: Gandhi is good guys, Where he was born? -> Gandhi is good guys - not query Where he was born? - query === 1 query Input: who is MGandhi and where was he born? -> who is MGandhi - query where was he born? - query === 2 queries This approach will require anaphora resolution (in order to convert he into Gandhi in first example) and a parser to correctly divide complex sentence into simple ones.
