Can you check available hard disk space with Adobe Air?

We have an Adobe Air app that downloads a large amount of images into application storage. I've scanned the docs and found no sign of this, but I thought I'd double check: anyone know if it's possible to see how much available storage space the user has on their HD so we can warn them they don't have enough room?
