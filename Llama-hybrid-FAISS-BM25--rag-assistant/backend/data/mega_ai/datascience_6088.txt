Training and testing AdaBoost for low probability classification

I have a dataset that I want to classify as fraud/not fraud and I have many weak learners. My concern is that there is much more fraud than not fraud, so my weak learners perform better than average, but none perform better than 50% accuracy in the complete set. My question is whether I should set up testing and training sets that are half fraud and half not fraud or if I should just use a representative sample.
