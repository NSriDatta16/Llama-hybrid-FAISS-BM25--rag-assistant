Eliminating Ugly Switch Statement When Retrieving Resources

I am adding a splash screen to a .NET compact application and am wondering if there's an elegant way to access the correct bitmap (based on screen resolution) for the splash screen. e.g. My resource bitmap properties are named like this... Splash640480 Splash480640 Splash480480 Splash320240 Splash240320 Splash240240 ... etc I tried making a generic dictionary but loading the generics library on a Pocket PC is quite slow - it took 6 seconds before the splash screen displayed vs 2 seconds when simply assigning a bitmap. Would reflection be a fast option and if so, what's the best way to go about it?
