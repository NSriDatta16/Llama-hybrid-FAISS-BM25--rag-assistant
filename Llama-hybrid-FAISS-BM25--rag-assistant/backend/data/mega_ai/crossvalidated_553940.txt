Is there such a thing as an order-$k$ RNN?

In HMMs it's common to include edges from previous layers of the model. Looking back at the previous $k$ layers creates an order- $k$ Markov model. Is this commonly done in RNNs? Have you ever seen this? What was the advantage for that specific application? In probabilistic graphical models like HMMs, order- $k$ models can be reduced to order-1 models on transformed variables with higher-dimensional support ( i.e. , the tree decomposition of the order- $k$ graph). Is there a corresponding equivalence for order- $k$ RNNs, where the RNN accepts edges only from the previous layer, but where each layer has greater complexity?
