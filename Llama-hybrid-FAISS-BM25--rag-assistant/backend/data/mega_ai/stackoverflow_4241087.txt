ScrollViewer with Canvas, auto-resize canvas to content including negative space

I have a canvas in a scrollviewer. To be able to use the scrollviewer, I've overridden the Canvas's MeasureOverride method to return the size of all children. This works fine, except that the canvas can only contain items in positive space for the scrollviewer to work correctly. I'd like the user to be able to drag elements around without the restriction of them having to be on the positive side of the canvas's origin. So basicly I want to be able to position the elements anywhere, like at (-200, 10) or (500, -20) , and be able to scroll from the most left element (-200) to the most right(500), and from top to bottom. To complicate matters the canvas can be scaled using the LayoutTransform, and I'd like to include the view-area in the scrollbars, so not only the min/max bounds of the children are taken into account by the scrollbars, but also the min/max of the current view-area. Does anybody know how to make this work ?
