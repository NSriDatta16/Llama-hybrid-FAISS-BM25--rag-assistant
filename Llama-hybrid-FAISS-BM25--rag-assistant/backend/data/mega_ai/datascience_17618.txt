Prove that the expected value of the training error is equal to generalization error for a class of binary clasiffiers

Take $ H $ to be a class of binary classifiers ever a domain $X$. $D$ is a unknown distrbution over $X$, and $f$ is the target hypothesis in $H$. If we fix some $h$ $\in H$ we have the expected value of the training error equal to generalization error, that is: $\mathbb{E}[L_S(h)]=L_{(D,f)}(h)$ Could you please come up with the proof of this statement? Would you recommend another page inside stackexchange for these theoretical questions about machine learning? Thank you.
