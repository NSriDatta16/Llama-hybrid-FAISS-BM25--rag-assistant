Best technology to allow consumers of my website to incorporate dynamic data into their website

What I am asking, is what is the best way (i.e. the way that is easiest for neophyte web developers) to consume/integrate data that I make available on my website, into their own website. I have a website written in asp.net/sql server back end. I have clients that would like to be able to incorporate selections of data (say for example a table of data and some images that varies in length and is different for each user) into their website, so that the data looks like it belongs to them, and is branded by them (ideally the data would come to them with default css formatting, but they could customizing as much as they want). When the data on my website changes, the data on their website needs to change. I'd like the user of my data to come to my website, login, and then be able to " copy" a customized script/code from my website, paste it into theirs and then just have it work, no matter what their website is written in (i.e. pure html, php, asp.net or others). I am assuming that a some sort of javascript script would be the best way to go, but I am at a loss as to how to make this completely simple for the user and what the script might contain (javascript is not my strong point yet). I.e. can I get a javascript on a clients website call a asp.net script on my server and then stream HTML back to their website.. I am sure there must be examples of this done elsewhere, can someone point me in the right direction? EDIT: Let me try to give a better example of what I am trying to do . My app is not a real-estate app, but lets assume it us (pretend realtor.com the MLS database). Now every realtor in the country has their own website, and they are written in all kinds of languages so I can't assume anything about the consumer of the data, nor can I assume they have any programming expertise. If I was realtor.com owner, I'd like every realtor to be able to come to my website, copy a snippet of code (like I said, perhaps some javascript but I am not sure), go back to their website and paste it into the source of their page and then when one of their users goes to "Joesrealty.com" and clicks on "Show all properties for sale" the script/code/page would actually pull html down from my site by executing something on my website (realtor.com) and retrieve a list of all properties that that agent had for sale (say a table with accompanying picture). I know I saw a great implementation of this somewhere on a big name site, but for the life of me can't remember where I saw it, and never bothered at the time to try and see what technology they used.
