MCMC autocorrelation

I have a MCMC simulation that tries to fit a line to a linear set of data. The auto-correlation is very high for the slope parameter (~0.9), and low (~0.05) for the bias What does a high auto-correlation say about a MCMC run? Is it necessarily a negative thing? What are the main causes of high auto-correlation?
