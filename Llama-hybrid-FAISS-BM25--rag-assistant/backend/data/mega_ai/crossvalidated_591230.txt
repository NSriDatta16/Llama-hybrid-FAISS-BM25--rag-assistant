For linear regression, the intercept can be positive or negative (or 0), and simply represents the value of the mean of Y when the hyperplane (your linear relationship) passes through the point where all of the explanatory variables are 0 (i.e, x=(0,0,...,0).) If you have data around (0,0,...,0), this point is meaningful, otherwise it's just a starting point for estimating the value of y for any x in your data range and doesn't have much practical value, itself. For a logistic regression, it can also be positive or negative (or 0). Being negative, here, means that the probability (e^B0/(1+e^B0)) at x = (0,0,...,0) will be 0.05. Again, though, its practical value will depend on whether you are interested in (and have data around) that point. Side note: I can't tell from the original question whether you are confusing variables and coefficients, and possibly missing that they are two different but required elements. For example, we might normally see: y = intercept + B1X1 + B2X2 + ... + BnXn + noise where each Bi is the coefficient (slope) of the corresponding Xi variable. The intercept is often written as B0. The sum of the coefficients (your "coeff sum"), then, would only matter if you happened to be looking at the point where all of the X's have a value of 1. That's a very, very specific case that is rarely of particular interest (even with all binary variables, that's just one particular case.)
