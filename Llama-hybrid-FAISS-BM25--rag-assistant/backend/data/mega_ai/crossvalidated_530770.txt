MLE vs. OLS Outputs Differ In R For AR(1) Time Series Model

I am trying to fit an AR(1) model to some data in R. I would expect the estimates from the OLS and MLE estimation procedures to be equal for both fits (as the function that needs to be maximised using both methods is the same when we assume the errors are normally distributed). However, I don't seem to understand why they differ. In R, the function ar.ols fits an intercept term to the AR(1) model, but this can be set to zero so that the model being fitted has the same structure as when using the MLE method. Based on this, I am trying to fit (as per the R documentation): $$X_{t+1}-\mu=\phi (X_t-\mu)+\epsilon_t.$$ Some example code: some_data And some output: Call: ar(x = some_data, order.max = 1, method = "mle") Coefficients: 1 -0.5443 Call: ar(x = some_data, order.max = 1, method = "ols", intercept = FALSE) Coefficients: 1 -0.5803 As you can see the values for $\phi$ differ. But as the MLE and OLS methods should be invariant, this makes me question what is wrong here? The documentation for ar and ar.ols are here and here respectively.
