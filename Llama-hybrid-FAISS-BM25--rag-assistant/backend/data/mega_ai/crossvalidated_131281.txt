Dynamic Time Warping Clustering

What would be the approach to use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to perform clustering of time series? I have read about DTW as a way to find similarity between two time series, while they could be shifted in time. Can I use this method as a similarity measure for clustering algorithm like k-means?
