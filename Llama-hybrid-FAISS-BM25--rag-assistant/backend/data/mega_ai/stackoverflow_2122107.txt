Creating Silverlight UserControl

I'm creating a silverlight user control that I should be able to drag and drop via blend. But this control needs to accept a map that is already on the page. For eg. Main.xaml contains a map control. MapEditor.xaml contains buttons and other controls. In the .cs file, it needs to access a map control (the one in Main.xaml). How do I go about getting this done? I was thinking about adding a parameter in the contructor for MapEditor but how would I pass in the map as a parameter in design mode? Thanks. ps. I'm going to break out this control into a silverlight library so it could be used in multiple projects later.
