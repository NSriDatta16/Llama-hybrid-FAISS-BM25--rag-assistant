There are multiple way of doing so 1) visualization - you can plot the abundance/frequency of each selected feature within each group as a bar plot. I assume visually the top feature will be more abundant in one group comparing with the other groups. 2) Exhaustive way - build 3 Random Forest model on each pair of two labels. Rank the features in each combination and eventually plot the result and see if gini scores for feature x is higher on both combinations.
