Basic Ruby on Rails Question about routing

I have a controller without any related model. This controller is to span some information from various models. I have lots of actions there, which define certain views on the page. What would be the best way to organize routes for this controller? What I would like is to have /dashboard/something point to any action in the dashboard controller. Not actions like new/edit but arbitrary (showstats, etc). With trial and error I made something like this: map.dashboard 'dashboard/:action', :controller => 'dashboard', :action => :action Now it is possible to access those URLs using the helper: dashboard_url('actionname') This approch seems to be working ok, but is this the way to go? I am not quite sure understand, how are the helper method names generated. How to generate same helper names as in basic controllers "action_controller_url" ? That would be more generic and made the code more consistent. Thanks in advance.
