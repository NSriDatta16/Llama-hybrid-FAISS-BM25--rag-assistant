Why robust PCA results change with each run?

According to Filzmoser et al. 2009 , the best way to conduct a principal component analysis for compositional data with outliers is: using a robust PCA method and using the isometric log ratio transformation (instead of the centred log ratio transformation, see also the discussion here ). The function pcaCoDa() from the R package robCompositions can do both things. However, every time I run the function, I get a different result... how is that possible? Examples from four different runs: In some of the biplots above, it's just a matter of the components being rotated, but for others, I don't think that's the case. Also, for what I understand checking help(pcaCoDa) , the data set that you provide to the function must not be transformed - the transformation is done internally. But how about scaling? Should we scale the matrix before running the pcaCoDa() if the different columns use very different units?
