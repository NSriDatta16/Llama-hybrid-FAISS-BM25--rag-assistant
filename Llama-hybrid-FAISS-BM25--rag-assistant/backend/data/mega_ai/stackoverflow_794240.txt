Good Zend Framework example apps to learn from

Do you know of any open-source Zend Framework applications besides Magento that show in a good OOP-way how to develop big apps with Zend Framework? My problem right now is, that I'm pretty good at PHP and OOP, but I don't have enough knowledge of the Zend Framework and how things should be solved in it. So do you know any good applications that showcase best-practices for ZF? Thanks!
