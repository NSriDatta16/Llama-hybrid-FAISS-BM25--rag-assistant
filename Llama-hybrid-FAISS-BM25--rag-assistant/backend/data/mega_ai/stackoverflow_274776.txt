Pay attention to the man behind the curtain. : The thing that Release Early - Release Often practice wants you to do is to have fail early and fast instead of at the end of the project, when its too late. It gives you more opportunities to show what you are building to the end customer, get valuable feedback and adapt at a lower cost. The person in the 'customer' role must be able to easily obtain the latest release; play with it and respond with constructive feedback as regularly as possible. In case you're building something critical e.g. something that monitors or controls a power plant, you'd probably want to be careful with this practice. You don't want people out with torches as feedback for your new release. In such cases, it makes sense to deploy regularly to a test bed, watch it for X days (as per your confidence level) and then go LIVE! You can give your customer access to this test bed to play and build up his confidence meter. If its a non-critical application and you've had a good historic record of good releases, do something like ClickOnce.. but also make sure its equally easy to rollback for the customer.
