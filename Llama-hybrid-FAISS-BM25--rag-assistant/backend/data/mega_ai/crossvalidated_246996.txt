How do I Calculate the odds ratio for a circular predictor variable using the coefficient(s) of a logistic regression?

Using a logistic regression I have modelled the habitat characteristics of a dataset existing out of GPS positions. To visualize the results I want to calculate the odds ratio for each value in my predicting variables. However, one of my variables is circular; aspect (in radians). Aspect is included in the model as two separate variables, namely sin(aspect) and cos(aspect) to account for that. I would expect to have to calculate the odds ratio for aspect as $y= e$ $\beta_1 \sin(\chi)+\beta_2\cos(\chi) $ . Unfortunately the result I am getting does not match what can naturally be expected; a western orientation is preferred whilst my expectation is north/ northeast. As I haven't found any literature on calculating the odds ratio for a circular variable, I don't actually know if the above mentioned equation is correct. Therefore my question is; how do I calculate the odds ratio for the circular variable; aspect? Edit: Some clarification on the use of a circular predictor in linear regression is already offered in these posts; Use of circular predictors in linear regression Predict magnitude from angle in linear regression Edit: Some literature that explains the use, or uses, circular variables as predictor(s): Cox, N.
