One-Step ahead predictive likelihood for time series forecasting

I am still new to Bayesian forecasting, so I am hoping to get some clarification on a simple concept (by the sounds of it). Suppose that we are interested in forecasting some time series one-step ahead. For simplicity, we can assume the time series itself came from a normal distribution with known parameters. The one-step-ahead predictive likelihood (as I understand) is: $ PL = p(y^{o}_t|y^{o}_{t-1}) = \int_\theta p(y_{t}^o|y^o_{t-1},\theta)\times p(\theta|y^o_{t-1})d\theta$ Which can be approximated by $M^{-1}p(y^{o}_{t}|y^{o}_{t-1},\theta^{(m)}_{t-1})$, for $m$ MCMC loops. How is it possible to calculate $p(y^{o}_t|y^{o}_{t-1})$?! It's the probability from a normal distribution (i.e. 0). Unless this has some relationship to the likelihood being evaluated at some point, I have no idea what to do here or evaluate this with a given posterior. Thanks in advance.
