Any metadata associated with the view is on the view server side, where the view storage are kept. The one file which could be the closest from the creation date would be the .hostname file within a view storage. It is only created and updated on the view creation, and never change unless the view is unregistered, and then re-registered (very rare). view.dat is also a good candidate (but can also be regenerated, and is for snapshot view only) This IBM article lists all relevant files: Files that are regenerated automatically when the view is restarted: # .access_info # .pid Files that can be regenerated with ClearCase commands: # .compiled_spec -- regenerate by running cleartool setcs -current # .hostname -- regenerate by unregistering and re-registering the view # view.dat -- Snapshot views only: can be regenerated by running the "regen_view_dot_dat.pl" script found in \etc\utils See technote1204161 for more details on the regenerating the view.dat file. Files that can be manually replaced by making a new view on the same machine as the same user, and copying the affected file(s) to the view storage: # config_spec # groups.sd # identity.sd # view_db.state (as long as the view is not in the process of being reformatted); see technote 1134858 for more information # db/view_db.dbd (for schema 9 views only; 2002.05.00 and earlier) # db/view_db_schema_version # .view - The copy obtained from the new view must be edited to contain the correct information for the old view as described below. The correct information can be obtained from the output of "cleartool lsview -long ". Line 1: the location of the view storage directory, in hostname:pathname format Line 2: the view's UUID (unique identifier), which must not be changed Line 3: the hostname specified in line 1 Files that cannot be replaced: # All other files in the db directory except the ones mentioned above ( view_db_schema_version and view_db.dbd)
