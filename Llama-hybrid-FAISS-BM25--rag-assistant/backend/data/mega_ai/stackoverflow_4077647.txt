Want to change URL pattern

These days, I've seen a URL pattern like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/How-to-do Not a usual and old one like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions.php?id=123 or http://stackoverflow.com/questions.php?q=How-to-do As you know, the difference is that the former is using / directory pattern, and the latter is using ?key=value&key=value.... I guess it's something to do with server config. My language is JAVA and PHP, and Web container is TOMCAT6. Please teach me how to change URL patter. Because it looks more organized and brand new. Thank you.
