Place a movie clip on the stage via Actionscript

I have an assignment where at one point, I have to put a movieclip on the stage. I can't just drag it and place it and set it to visible at some point in time, I have to use Actionscript to pull it from the library and make it appear on the stage at certain X/Y coordinates. My assignment says that the function attachMovie() would be useful, but I don't see how, since that's used for attaching movieclips to other movieclips... Can anybody help here?
