Is there a Windows Phone 7 reference application?

Are there any solid Windows Phone 7 reference applications that demonstrate core APIs and best practices for Windows Phone 7 + Silverlight? Specifically, I think there are a few major concepts that are not well-documented or well-built-out. Rather than fall back to frameworks, I'd like to have a better understanding of how these should operate in Windows Phone 7. Navigation - Navigating between pages, especially passing state information (like viewmodels) MVVM - I know there are frameworks out there, but I'd like to see a clean reference implementation of it Structure - I'm curious how best to organize the application, resources, etc. Is there anything out there that really covers these concepts? I've reviewed countless web sites talking about them, but no one really seems to have elegant solutions.
