I use a combination of var_dump with xDebug and Magento's Mage::Log method. Mage::Log is particularly nice, as it'll do some auto-expanding and pretty printing of objects if you pass them in (I'm not sure if that's the logger, or just Magento's __toString implementation). If I'm on my local development box I use Console.app to keep an eye on the log file, otherwise it's a simple tail -f /path/to/log/file That combined with some custom modules I've built for debugging the config and layout keep me happy. (although I prefer a light weight text editor toolchain vs. the One True IDE tool chain, so your results may vary)
