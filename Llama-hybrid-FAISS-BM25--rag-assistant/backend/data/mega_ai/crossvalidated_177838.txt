In R, I would use the following methods: correlation plots (corrplot via corrplot ) interaction plots (interaction.plot via stats ) PCA (PCA via FactoMiner ) hierarchical clustering (hclustvar via ClustOfVar ) 3 and 4 aren't primary intended to examine interaction but can still provide useful insights into potential interrelationships.
