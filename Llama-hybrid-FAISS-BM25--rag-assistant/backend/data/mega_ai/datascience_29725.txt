Is there any standard pattern recognition algorithm in predicting an item which a user will be buying next, given I have the history of the purchases

I am having a list of 10 different items a user has bought in the past. Each item has been bought multiple times. I would like to find a pattern in which the user buys a particular item and predict what he will be purchasing next. For example I am running a cloth factory and sell clothes to different retailers. I would like to identify what clothes a particular retailer might be asking me next, based on the history of how the retailer has purchased different clothes. We cannot use time series as the date of purchases has no equal intervals. Also I feel simply passing the sequence of purchased products ordered by date to a neural network will not be of much help. Is there any standard algorithm to identity a pattern? I am having two columns in my data: 1. item_id 2. date_of_purchase I would like to create a model which will predict top 3 items which the user will be buying again next. Input to my model will be present date. Output should be top 3 items which the user might be interested in buying.
