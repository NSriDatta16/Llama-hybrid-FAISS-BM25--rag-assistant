Assumed Density Filtering approximates the Bayesian posterior to a distribution we wish to assume. If we assume the posterior to be a Gaussian Approximation, then it can be called Gaussian Density filtering. So to approximate it, we only need to compute the mean and variance of the resultant distribution and use them as parameters of the gaussian posterior. Hence the name moment matching. Gaussian-density filtering computes an exact one-step posterior p(θ) and then approximates it to get qnew(θ) which is a Gaussian Distribution. So essentially, we want- A more detailed explanation of this can be found in T.Minka's paper - https://tminka.github.io/papers/ep/minka-thesis.pdf To see one application of assumed density filtering, you can read this article Understanding the Working of Multi-Armed Bandit in VWO
