So let's do an experiment to see if it is possible.. I created the following stored procedure in a SQL 2008 database: CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.StackOverflow3668337 AS BEGIN SET NOCOUNT ON; SELECT 'First bit'; SELECT 'Second bit'; END Then I created a new project in VS2010, and added a DataSet item to the project. I created a connection to the database in the Server Explorer, and dragged the 'StackOverflow3668337' item onto the DataSet designer surface. This is the result: So that would be just one DataTable. So unfortunately I think the answer is out of the box, "No". I think the main reason for this is that the TableAdapter classes that are generated are just tied to a single DataTable. You can have multiple TableAdapters for a single DataTable but they all need to return the same data. There is no capacity for a single TableAdapter to interact with additional DataTables.
