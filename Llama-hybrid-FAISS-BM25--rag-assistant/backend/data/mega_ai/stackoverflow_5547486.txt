Based on your question, it sounds like you're trying to build an ACL and a metadata storage system at the same time. This can be a little tricky to sort out. Generally in a role-based system you have several patterns to follow, but usually some combination of the following: Users have system-wide privileges based on a type of authentication level. Users have system-wide privileges that are granted by the user having one or more roles. Users have different privileges based on their authentication level in the context of specific resources. You might be describing the first or second case depending on the nuances of it. Here's an example of the first: class User The second is a bit more flexible, but is also slower when trying to resolve a simple yes/no case because more roles must be checked. class User :grants end class Grant If you need to have some kind of configuration or meta-data stored about what each role provides for the user, put that into the Grant model as additional fields.
