Why is "weight clipping" needed for Wasserstein GANs?

I am reading the original paper on the Wasserstein GAN: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf and I came across this paragraph: I don't understand the statement: " $\mathcal{W}$ is compact implies that all the functions $f_w$ will be $K$ -Lipschitz for some $K$ that only depends on $\mathcal{W}$ ". Here, we are talking about a family of functions $\{f_w\}_{w \in W}$ . Why does the index coming from a compact space means that the functions will be $K$ -Lipschitz continuous? If I can understand this, then I can understand why we need to clip the weights to a compact space such as a box.
