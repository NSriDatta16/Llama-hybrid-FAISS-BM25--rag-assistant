Strategy to unit test and refactor existing Grails app

What strategy would you recommend to unit test an existing Grails app? I've just read Beck Kent's book on TDD and would like to apply similar approach to my app. My aim is to unit test the entire code base and to be able to refactor the code and make it "cleaner". By "cleaner" i mean I want to reduce duplication, make my controllers slimmer by extracting common logic into services and so on. So where should I start? Models? Controllers? What is your "bad" and "good" experience doing similar thing? @PÃ©ter. My app is not too big in my opinion. it consists of 12+ models, similar amount of controllers, few services and around 15 utils classes. One of the main reasons I want to have full unit test coverage is that in many cases the system just works. While it's good from the user point of view from developer point of view such code is a nightmare to change and maintain. Another important thing I would like to make small and fast regular releases (new little features and/or improvements), but without unit test coverage it would be almost imposible. So the question is not: "Do i need to do it?", but " How can I do it ?"
