github: No supported authentication methods available

i use github and have successfully added and synched files on my laptop in the past. as of recent i started getting " PuTTY Fatal Error: Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available " after running: git pull origin master (or push) however ssh git@github.com returns the correct response: ERROR: Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access Connection to github.com closed. after digging around on github i found this morcel: No supported authentication methods available You should be aware of the environment variable GIT_SSH, which is used by git to find your ssh-speaking client, if ssh doesnâ€™t work for you. The git install may be using plink.exe (via GIT_SSH) to perform the authentication. If so, make sure you have pageant.exe running, and the key you created for github loaded into it. This provides the key to plink.exe; without it, the above error will occur. not sure what plink.exe or peagant.exe is.. and the fact that ssh git@github.com seems to authenticate correctly makes me wonder what the best solution here is.. i certainly don't want to overcomplicate my setup if not necessary.
