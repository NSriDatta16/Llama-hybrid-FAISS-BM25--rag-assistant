Gesture recognizer for mouse down and up in iPhone SDK

I want to catch both mouse down and mouse up using gesture recognizer. However, when the mouse down is caught, mouse up is never caught. Here's what I did: First create a custom MouseGestureRecognizer: @implementation MouseGestureRecognizer -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; self.state = UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized; } -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; self.state = UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized; } @end Then bind the recognizer to a view in view controller: UIGestureRecognizer *recognizer = [MouseGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleGesture:)]; [self.view addGestureRecognizer:recognizer]; When I click mouse in the view, the touchesBegan is called, but touchesEnded is never called. Is it because of the UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized?
