After much searching I found the answer here - http://tammersaleh.com/posts/managing-heroku-environment-variables-for-local-development The trick is to remove the S3.rb file altogether and just refer to the ENV variables in the model like so: has_attached_file :photo, #... :storage => :s3, :bucket => ENV['S3_BUCKET'], :s3_credentials => { :access_key_id => ENV['S3_KEY'], :secret_access_key => ENV['S3_SECRET'] } Anyway, David, thanks for your suggestion. I don't know if you want to update the Heroku docs to say that some users have had to do it this way. Thanks again though.
