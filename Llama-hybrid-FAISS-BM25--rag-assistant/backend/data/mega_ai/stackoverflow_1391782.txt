My guess is that the JVM reaches that wall of text and, much like us, has no idea what to do with it, nor any desire to. That, or you're using & instead of && . But honestly, if you're looping through and applying a gigantic branching else-if ladder, you've done something pretty severely wrong. Even if you get it to work, this kind of code is hell on the processor, not to mention being a pain to maintain. My recommendation: refactor.
