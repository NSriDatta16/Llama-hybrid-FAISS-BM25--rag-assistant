Understanding declared parameters in my Conv2d layer of my convolutional neural network

I am trying to understand the architecture of my keras model implemented by the sequential model. Here is a piece of the code : model = Sequential([ #block1 layers.Conv2D(nfilter,(3,3),padding="same",name="block1_conv1",input_shape=(64,64,3)), layers.Activation("relu"), layers.BatchNormalization(), ....... My question is why the two parameters input_shape and name are declared in the layer conv2D while they are not included in the set of defined parmeters for Conv2D() in this link https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/
