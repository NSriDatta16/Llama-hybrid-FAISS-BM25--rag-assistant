Using PHP to post an XML buffer to an HTTPS page

I am using php 5.2.9 I have an XML buffer which I need to post to some HTTPS URL. What is the correct way of doing that? I see various examples on the web, and none of them seem to be working for me: Some define the cURL headers like so: $headers = array( "POST " . $page . " HTTP/1.0", "Content-type: text/xml;charset=\"utf-8\"", "Accept: text/xml", "Cache-Control: no-cache", "Pragma: no-cache", "SOAPAction: \"run\"", "Content-length: ".strlen($buffer), ); Where $page holds the request on the server and $buffer contains the XML data. The actual $buffer is sent as the value as: curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $buffer); But I don't see how this can work, as CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS expects its value to be an array and not a buffer. Then I saw several ways of configuring the SSL aspects of the call: curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSLVERSION,3); curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2); Are all of these needed? I saw examples where the following was also set: curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_BASIC ); curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_USERPWD, "username:password"); Can someone post a complete working example that explains what needs to be done in order to post an XML buffer using cURL to an HTTP URL? Thanks in advance
