Random Forest can work good here since it is a decision tree. Before you call RandomForest , you will have to OneHotEncode your categorical variables e.g. Butter Flour Eggs ... because the Regressor or Classifier (whichever you fancy) cannot work with string and NaN values. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html
