For that first iterate? That shouldn't matter, since in effect it just affects your starting point - as long as subsequently you sample correctly, everything should still work as intended - the convergence still works and so on. (It's useless but should be harmless.) If after that first time through, your scheme is doing one of these: (1) $\theta_1^{(i+1)} \sim f(\theta_1 | \theta_2^{(i)}, \text{Data})$ $\quad\,\,\theta_2^{(i+1)} \sim f(\theta_2 | \theta_1^{(i+1)}, \text{Data})$ OR (2) $\theta_2^{(i+1)} \sim f(\theta_2 | \theta_1^{(i)}, \text{Data})$ $\quad\,\,\theta_1^{(i+1)} \sim f(\theta_1 | \theta_2^{(i+1)}, \text{Data})$ then you have a Gibbs sampler and from the convergence of the Markov Chain to its stationary distribution, you'll in the long run be sampling from $f(\theta_1 , \theta_2| \text{Data})$. It shouldn't matter that you did something nonstandard on the first step.
