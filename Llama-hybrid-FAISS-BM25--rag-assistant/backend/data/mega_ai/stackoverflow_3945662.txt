XAMPP: can't get PHP to work

I saved a .php file to file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/tester/tester.php, and though my XHTML and CSS are working, my PHP is not. I put as the first line of the body, and echo " Hello World "; ?> a couple of paragraphs in. But when I view the page, nothing for phpinfo() shows up at all, and the Hello World bit shows up as: Hello World"; ?> Apache and MySQL are running. I've scoured the internet and can't find a solution, but I feel like it's probably something very basic that I'm missing.
