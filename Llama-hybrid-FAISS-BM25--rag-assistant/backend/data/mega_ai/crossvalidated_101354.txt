How to detect polarized user opinions (high and low star ratings)

If I have a star rating system where users can express their preference for a product or item, how can I detect statistically if the votes are highly "divided". Meaning, even if the average is 3 out of 5, for a given product, how can I detect if that is a 1-5 split versus a consensus 3, using just the data (no graphical methods)
