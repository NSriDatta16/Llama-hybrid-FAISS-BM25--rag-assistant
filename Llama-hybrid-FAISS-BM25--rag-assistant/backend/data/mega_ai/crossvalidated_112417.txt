ARMA(p,q) model interpreting PACF and ACF

Here I have two time series (ACF, PACF), one on the left and one on the right. I have difficulties interpreting the results. Both PACF/ACF couples look the same and I can't distinguish any geometric decay or cutoff points. Would this be a AR/MA or ARMA model and how many lags would you specify for p and q??
