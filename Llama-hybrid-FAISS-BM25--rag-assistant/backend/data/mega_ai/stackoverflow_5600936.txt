I would guess that you didn't set the ViewController to be the TableView's delegate. To check, open your ViewController xib-file and rightclick FilesOwner . Under Referencing Outlet you would usually have both delegate and data source" connected to your TableView . If that is not the case, drag New Referencing Outlet to your TableView. If I'm wrong and they are all connected, you might want put a breakpoint at the beginning of your didSelectRowAtIndexPath method. Does the debugger stop there, once you select a row? It might also be worth mentioning that a breakpoint at @implementation usually doesn't make much sense, you would rather want to place it in a method like init. Also, even though you are using Xcode 4 now, this is unlikely to be the cause of your problem, it looks more like an implementation issue. Hope this helps, if you need further help just let me know!
