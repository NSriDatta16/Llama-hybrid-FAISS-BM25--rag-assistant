If you are having difficulty with sIFR, you might try Cufon instead. It's very easy to integrate and gives very good results. To be on the right side of the law, you have to make sure that the fonts you use allow web embedding. You can read more about it here - Cufon home: http://cufon.shoqolate.com/ Cufon documentation: https://github.com/sorccu/cufon/wiki You should also look into Typekit here. Typekit is an elegant, although not free, solution from Jeff Veen and Small Batch: http://typekit.com/
