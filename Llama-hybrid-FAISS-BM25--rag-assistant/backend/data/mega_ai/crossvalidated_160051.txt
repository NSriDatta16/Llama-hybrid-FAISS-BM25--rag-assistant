Variables for Local Economic Environment

I'm working on a regression to explain store sales (cross section data over a number of stores in one time frame only). Some of my variables are 'min distance to competitor x'. However, the results keep showing that the closer a store is to competitor x, the higher sales are. This is clearly a wrong sign, likely due to competitor x putting their stores in areas with a better economic profile. However, every time I try to include a variable to capture local economic effects, nothing seems to fix the wrong sign (have to go at zip code level; I've tried local average tax returns, local business payroll, etc). Any thoughts on what I could due to fix the wrong sign I'm getting here? Thanks.
