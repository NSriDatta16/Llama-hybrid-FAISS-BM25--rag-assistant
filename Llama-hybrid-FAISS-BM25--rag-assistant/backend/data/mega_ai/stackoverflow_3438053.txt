Simply link to them in either PHP or jQuery and then visitor to the site can click to download them; this is complicated by the server/client model of served pages, in that you're trying to get the client to download the videos, not the server. Also, if their default viewer is something like Windows Media Player, this will manage the downloading for you/them. Unless you're talking about embedding the video into the page and streaming the content when the page loads, or an event is fired (jQuery, etc)? Hope this helps.
