Optimal selection with multiple parameters

I have a problem of optimal selection given many parameters. I will try to simplify my problem in this example below: Suppose I have a basket with 100 balls in 10 different colors (not equally distributed and I know how many balls of each color there are). In one of these balls there is a winning lottery ticket. I am allowed to chose 5 (an arbitrary number, is always less than or equal to unique color count) balls and open them. Given that I have the probabilities of every color group containing a winning ticket , how many of which color I should choose these 5 balls from to maximize my winning chance? My variables are: $N$ = 100, $C$ = 10, $n$ = 5, and probability vector $P$ which shows $P_c$ = 1 $\forall c\in C\cdots$ where 1 stands for winning ticket. Which approaches I should take in order to solve this? My intuition is that it is kind of multivariate hypergeometric distribution and maybe using some kinda Bayesian approach would allow me to solve it. My end goal is to come up with an optimal choice strategy here. thank you beforehand! Edit: added info about color distribution
