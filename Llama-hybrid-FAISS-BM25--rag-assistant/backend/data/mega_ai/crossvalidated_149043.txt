Assuming the values you're getting are numeric, so that it makes sense to talk about averages, and if the resulting contaminated distribution still satisfies the conditions for some version of the CLT, that CLT should still apply -- in that appropriately standardized sample means will still go to a standard normal (in the limit as $n\to\infty$). However beware -- the distribution that you use to standardize it will be the contaminated one, not the 'good' one; in some cases that may not be useful.
