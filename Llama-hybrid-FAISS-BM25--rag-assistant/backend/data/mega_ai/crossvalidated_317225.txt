Online quiz using reinforcement learning

I am developing an online quiz program using reinforcement learning. Assume that we have 1000 questions in hand and 25 questions to be asked in each quiz. Instead of asking questions at random, program has to learn from the way user answer and ask next question. Quiz master should be a reinforcement learning agent. How to design the solution and which are the reinforcement learning techniques to be used ?
