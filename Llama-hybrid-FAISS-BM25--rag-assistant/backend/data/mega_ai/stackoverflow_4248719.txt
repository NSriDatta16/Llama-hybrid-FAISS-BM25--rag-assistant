I use Amazon S3 for storage. How can I create a backup of that data?

What is the most efficient way to backup data store in Amazon's S3 service? is it to copy to another bucket? What are some tools for doing this? or should I just code for it? is it to copy to another service? or just copy an archive in a data center? Is there an easy way to do it incrementally? Amazon has a system for you to send them a drive but that seems inefficient.
