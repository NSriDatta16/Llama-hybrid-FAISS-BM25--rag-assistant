Question about Xgboost paper weights and decision-rules

Can someone please explain what the weight $w$ is doing and how it works here? I also didn't understand how $q$ transforms an $m$-dimensional vector to $T$. Edit Answer by usÎµr11852 is pretty good. I also recommend anyone referring this question to refer this detailed explanation. It should put a full stop to most of the questions on boosting.
