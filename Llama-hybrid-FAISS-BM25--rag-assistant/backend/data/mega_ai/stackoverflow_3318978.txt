Joachim's answer solved the problem for me. The server-side web framework (PHP5 / Expression Engine 1.6.7) was sending a Pragma: no-cache on every request (even though my web-query results page set Pragma: public, I guess the framework overrode it). Once I removed it, everything started working. IE and Office behavior for Pragma: no-cache is similar to that described in MS KB Article: Internet Explorer is unable to open Office documents from an SSL Web site See also this caching tutorial's Warning: Pragma no-cache Deprecated . With this in mind I set Expression Engine' Output and Debugging > Generate HTTP Page Headers? option to No. (Other frameworks have similar config options). But some of the other automatically sent headers were needed for successfully caching the rest of the site, so I opted for commenting out the Pragma: no-cache lines in the framework source code. If you do not have the option of modifying the HTTP headers sent by your web server / framework, the only MS-Office-client-side-only option will be to use VBA macros to automate an Internet Explorer component to get around Office's caching behavior. See Different Ways of Using Web Queries in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 as a starting point.
