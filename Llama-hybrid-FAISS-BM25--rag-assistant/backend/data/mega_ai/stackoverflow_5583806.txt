What you are searching for is called the transpose of a matrix. Here is a previous answer on StackOverflow: Is there better way to transpose a PHP 2D array? I take the liberty to directly copy the solution from that thread ($array_of_arrays is your original array, $transposed_array is the result): $transposed_array = call_user_func_array('array_map', array_merge(array(NULL), $array_of_arrays));
