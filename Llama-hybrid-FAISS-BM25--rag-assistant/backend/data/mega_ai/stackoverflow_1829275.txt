working with select boxes (RoR)

I created an application in Rails and generated two models, one for students and one for awards. rails students script/generate scaffold student given_name:string middle_name:string family_name:string date_of_birth:date grade_point_average:decimal start_date:date script/generate scaffold award name:string year:integer student_id:integer Each student can have many awards, so I added has_many :awards to the student model. I also added a select box to the view that lets the user create new awards: My question: If I wanted to give the user the option to create an award without specifying a student, how would I modify the select box to allow them to do this? I'm brand new to Rails. Thanks!
