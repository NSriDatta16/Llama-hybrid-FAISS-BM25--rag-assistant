Michael, thank you for your investigation and comments! The code I'm using is from http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/ . The situation described by you in the third and fourth paragraph is exactly what's happening. I've checked some solutions and a simple one seems to work for me: I waiting till the send function (and SetEvent) has finished. All my tests with this solution were successful till now. I'm going to do a larger test over the weekend.
