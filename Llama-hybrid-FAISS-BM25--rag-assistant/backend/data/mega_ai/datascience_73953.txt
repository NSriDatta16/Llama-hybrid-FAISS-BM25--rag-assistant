Is my model to big? I am trying to predict orders for a company, and I don't know if there are typical values for macroparameters

I am building a model to predict orders, from its time series (univariate), for a company. I am working with 30 layers of 400 LSTM neurons each with the activation function hyperbolic tangent of Yann Lecun, 1 layer of 400 LSTM neurons with the relu activation function, and 3 layers of 500 neurons each, with a Relu Activation Function. These values have had the best performance yet, but I don't know if there are typical values for training, or if it is an abnormally huge model.
