Python or SQL Logistic Regression

Given time-series data, I want to find the best fitting logarithmic curve. What are good libraries for doing this in either Python or SQL? Edit: Specifically, what I'm looking for is a library that can fit data resembling a sigmoid function, with upper and lower horizontal asymptotes.
