Rather than give you a specific design, I'm going to suggest a different way of looking at the problem. Make your xaml. Now, if it could have the data organized in any way exposing any set of methods it wanted, what would that look like? Don't even think about the real structure of the entities when imagining this. More inheritance? Less? Up to you - whatever would be best for your View. Okay, whatever you just described is your ViewModel. Write the public API for that. Then, hook it up to the actual underlying entities.
