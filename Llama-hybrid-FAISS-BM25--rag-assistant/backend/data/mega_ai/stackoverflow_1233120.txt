For what it's worth (Even though I flagged your post as "should be moved to ServerFault"), I think you should start by switching client storage from Registry to Database. As pointed out in your other question , with database connection pooling the extra database hits are fairly minimal -- and use of the Registry is unsupported on Linux; which should throw up a red flag for you.
