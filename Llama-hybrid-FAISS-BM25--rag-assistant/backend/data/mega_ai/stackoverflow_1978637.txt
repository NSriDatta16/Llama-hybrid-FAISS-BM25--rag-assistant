How to become a good javascript coder

I'm a self learner in javascript and I'm currently following the lessons in the book named "Beginning javascript 3rd edition" by Paul Wilton. So far I've advanced myself towards chapter 4: Javascript - An object based language, and I did follow and solve the exercises provided inside the book. I tried to write a calculator myself, and by modifying and changing the code, every time I learn something new to enhance it. How can I become good in javascript coding? Is there any special approach? Is there any concept or things I should learn first? What kind of study/career path should I follow for javascript? Anything I should be aware of? I really have the courage to continue learning javascript, I just need some guidance. I don't mind any expert opinion given, or pointing out any mistakes regarding this question, as I know that through my mistakes, I always learn something.
