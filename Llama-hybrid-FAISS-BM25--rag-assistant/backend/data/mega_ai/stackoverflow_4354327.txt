Each file is one person's session and should last no longer than session.gc_maxlifetime seconds - the garbage collection - set in the server's php.ini file or overridden in an .htaccess file. Lowering this value means fewer sessions will accumulate. Magento has another trick concerning sessions; In the /app/etc/local.xml file the session_save value can be changed to db meaning the database will be used instead of files but will still respect the aforementioned garbage collector lifetime. Also memcache can be specified if you have set that up (see /app/etc/local.xml.additional ). Both are very useful if the server is a cluster.
