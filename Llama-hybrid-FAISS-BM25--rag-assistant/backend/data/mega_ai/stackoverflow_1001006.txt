Gcov works fine for multi-threaded apps. The instrumentation architecture is properly serialized so you will get coverage data of good fidelity. I would suggest using gcov in conjunction with lcov . This will give you great reports scoped from full project down to individual source files. lcov also gives you a nicely color coded HTML version of your source so you can quickly evaluate your coverage lapses.
