How to use the data after missing values imputation (using mice)?

This question is related to how to get a complete data set from one containing missing values, and how to impute new cases. The mice R package impute missing values. Its algorithm produces M completed data sets, where all non-empty values remaing the same, but the empty are reeplaced based on a set of conditional densities based on certain distributions. The doubt is: If it is needed to create some predictive model, is it valid to create the training data by averaging all values across M data sets, so the non-empty values will remain the same and the imputed cases will be averaged? That is for numeric variables, for categorical the mode can be used. Other approach could be to append all cases to a "big" data set, and train the model with this set. Finally once the model is running live on production, new cases will be imputed with the same criteria. Does it makes sense? The mice paper can be found at: https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v045i03/v45i03.pdf library(mice) # do default multiple imputation on a numeric matrix, 5 imputation data frames imp The grouping can be done using .id and .imp variables, or just use the final data as it is: data_all .
