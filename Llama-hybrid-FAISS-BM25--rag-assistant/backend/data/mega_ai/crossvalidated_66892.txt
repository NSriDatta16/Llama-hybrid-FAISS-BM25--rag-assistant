how to solve this probability question

I have a question regarding how to solve this problem: There are two predictors A and B. If A is positive, there is 60% chance of raining. If B is positive, there is 60% chance of raining. A and B is independent decision maker. What's the chance of raining when both A and B are positive. How to think about this problem in the bayesian framework? I guess there is not enough condition to solve this problem, but can we build some sort of confidence interval? thanks
