A time series can have 1) short term arima structure ; 2) seasonal arima structure ; 3) seasonal deterministic structure ; 4) one or more level/step shifts ; 5) one or more deternnistic trends ; 6) one or more pulses ; 7) changes in model parameters over time ; 8) changes in model error variance over time. Are these the kinds of inferential features that you wish to use to classify your data or are you just trying to use basic descriptive statistics like the mean,mediation,range,standard deviation, coefficient of variation et al.
