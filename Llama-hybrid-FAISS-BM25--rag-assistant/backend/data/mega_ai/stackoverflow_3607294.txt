You can use WinPcap to monitor the Ethernet traffic on your network in the same collision domain. So you could learn all the MAC addresses just as a switch does. You could also fake some DHCP messages in order to create some traffic. But this only works with PXE (which is actually made for this scenario) and in your own collision domain.
