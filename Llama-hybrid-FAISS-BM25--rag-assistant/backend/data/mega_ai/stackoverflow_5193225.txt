The easiest way would be can create a csv, which is readable by Excel. It's essentially a comma seperated list of values. Each line representing a row. The first line can optionally be the column headings, eg: $string = '"Organisation","Address","Postcode"' . PHP_EOL; $string .= "\"$member_organ_field\",\"$member_address_field\",\"$member_post_field\"" . PHP_EOL; file_put_contents('myfile.csv', $string); // write file Be sure to quote field names and values as a stray unquoted , (comma) would mess up your columns. Other wise there is an PEAR library for write excel files. You can them email the file as an attachment using the built-in mail function , see example here Or using Swift Mailer , see example here UPDATE This is the general gist of what you need, the code may not be perfect to please read over it and don't copy and paste.
