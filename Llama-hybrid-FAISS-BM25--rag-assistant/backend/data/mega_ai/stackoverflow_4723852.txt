How can I test my application's network footprint?

I have no experience in network administration, so apologies if this is a clumsy question. I have a .NET application to deploy locally at my client's site. They have the hardware to do this, but have concerns about the network capability. Infrastructure My client has a 2mb upload/download network connection. They currently serve webmail to 260 users. Web app The web application will be used by ~200 users Each user will probably log in a couple of times a week, no spike time of day. An average usage would probably involve the download/upload of about 5 fairly small form pages (5-15 fields) My gut feel is that this is very low usage, and shouldn't cause much impact on their current setup. However, I would like to verify this if possible.
