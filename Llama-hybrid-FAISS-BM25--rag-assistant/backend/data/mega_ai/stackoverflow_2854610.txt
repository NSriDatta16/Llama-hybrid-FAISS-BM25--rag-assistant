Yes... check out the UIScrollViewDelegate spec, implement the methods including the two below, and set your UIScrollView's delegate accordingly: // User stops dragging the table view. - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate; // Control slows to a halt after the user drags it - (void)scrollViewDidEndDecelerating:(UIScrollView *)scrollView; You will probably be most interested in scrollViewDidEndDecelerating. These also work in UITableView which is where I originally found them (UITableView inherits from UIScrollView).
