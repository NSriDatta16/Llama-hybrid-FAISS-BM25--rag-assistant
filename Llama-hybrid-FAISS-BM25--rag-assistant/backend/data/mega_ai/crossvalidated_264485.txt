How to detect multivariate binomial distributions?

I tried the hartigans dip test, and it works well for univariate distributions. However, when i tried taking each variable (dimension) and applied hartigans dip test (assuming that if along one dimension/variable its bimodal the whole distribution is bimodal) it did not work. As an example, this is how my bimodal distribution looks like. Can you please help me with any other way in which i can detect multimodality in my data?
