Well, PHP >= 5.1 apparently also has a DocumentFragment , which has an appendXML function: http://php.net/manual/en/domdocumentfragment.appendxml.php . Maybe you can use that? I'm not sure if it has a string representation of itself, but who knows. EDIT: Well, that doesn't work :) What you could do, though, is use SimpleXML, either directly or by creating a DOMElement and then using simplexml_import_dom($domelement)->asXML() : http://php.net/manual/en/function.simplexml-import-dom.php . Good luck! :)
