A regression model is the perfect fit for your question. The simplest is the linear regression model which can be estimated with ordinary least squares, see the lm() method in R or the regress command in Matlab. Since the outcome (recycle or not) is binary, this is called a linear probability model. The coefficients on the predictor variables can be interpreted as the change in the expected probability of recycling. Once you get familiar with the linear probability model you'll want to experiment with a generalized linear model such as logistic regression (logit model) or its near-equivalent, the probit model, see the glm command in R. Here the estimated coefficients are difficult to interpret so to best understand the estimates you'll need to look into marginal effects: Marginal effect of Probit and Logit model
