How to find all classes of a particular interface within an assembly in .net

I have a scenario whereby I want n amount of classes to look at the same data and decide if any work needs to be done. Work is done by a team, and multiple teams can work on the data at the same time. I was thinking of creating a class for every team that would implement the CreateWork interface. All CreateWork classes must have their say. At the moment there are only a few but in the future there will be many more. Sudo code for my planned solution For each CreateWork class in assembly class.CheckAndCreateWork(dataIn,returnedCollectionOfWorkToBeDone) Next Is there a design pattern that can accomplish this in an elegant way? Seems a bit messy to loop round every class in the assembly. Cheers
