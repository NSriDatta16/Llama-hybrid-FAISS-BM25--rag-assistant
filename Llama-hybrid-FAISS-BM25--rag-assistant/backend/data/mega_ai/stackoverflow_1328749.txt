Debugging Code-Signing errors

How can one debug errors related to code-signing and missing certificates? Can I do the process from command line? In XCode under 'Organizer > Provisioning Profiles', I get 'A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain'. How can I debug this problem?
