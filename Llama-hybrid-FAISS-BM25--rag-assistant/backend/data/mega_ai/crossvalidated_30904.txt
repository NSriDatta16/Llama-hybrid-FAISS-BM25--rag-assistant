without a clear response variable, i would rule out regression of any type. as stated, the problem here is the summarization of measures from a variety of instruments. to that end, both PCA and FA methods are appropriate, however, it should be acknowledged that the purposes (and subsequent inferences) differ for these two methods. PCA seeks to reduce, or summarize, a number of measures according to composites of the observed variables (well, the coefficients resulting from the estimated components). factor analysis, on the other hand, presumes an underlying or latent distribution which is manifest through the various measurement results. both of these methods allow for "noisy" and correlated data - in fact, they are premised upon covariance analysis - but they do require some assumptions about the normality of the observations. i'm not so sure about PCA, but FA methods are reasonably robust to violations of normality; in conditions of extreme non-normality there are alternate procedures and adjustments that can be applied (finney & distefano, 2006). simply: if your goal is to reduce the number of measurements, PCA is your friend. if you're attempting to explain an underlying phenomena through multiple measures, FA is likely your best choice. note: noise may be used to describe random variation or non-systematic bias, which is expected by both PCA and FA. systematic bias, however, is troublesome for most measurement problems.
