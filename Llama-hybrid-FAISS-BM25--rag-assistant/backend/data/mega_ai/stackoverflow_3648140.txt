Google Maps slow when markers on it

Im writing a small webapp based on the idea of openspot for training proposal. When I open the map with my desktop pc everything is fine, but when I open it with my HTC Desire and add a marker the map hangs. You can find a demo here (in german) http://park-a-lot.de Just go to "eintragen" and set a marker. Then go hack and click on "parkplatze". You'll see the issue. Its ok that the toolbar at the top hides when you move the map, because of a jqtouch bug with Google maps. Thank you in advance.
