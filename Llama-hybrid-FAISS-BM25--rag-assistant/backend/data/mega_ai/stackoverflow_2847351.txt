Page zoom slows down page rendering

I'm building a map viewer much like Google maps and i've run into an interesting performance problem when a page is zoomed (i.e ctrl + OR ctrl -). It seems to affect all major browsers but Firefox has the worst problems as far as I can tell. The problem is that when the page is zoomed panning by dragging the mouse seems really sluggish. This can even be seen on Google maps. Pan the map left and right and note how smooth it is. Now press ctrl+ (3 or 4 times). Now pan the map left and right in the same way. Notice the difference? Does anyone know how I can minimize this problem?
