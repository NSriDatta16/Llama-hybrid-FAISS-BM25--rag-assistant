Linux optimistic malloc: will new always throw when out of memory?

I have been reading about out of memory conditions on Linux, and the following paragraph from the man pages got me thinking: By default, Linux follows an optimistic memory allocation strategy. This means that when malloc() returns non-NULL there is no guarantee that the memory really is available. This is a really bad bug. In case it turns out that the system is out of memory, one or more processes will be killed by the infamous OOM killer. [...] Considering that the operator new implementation will end up calling malloc at some point, are there any guarantees that new will actually throw on Linux? If there aren't, how does one handle this apparently undetectable error situation?
