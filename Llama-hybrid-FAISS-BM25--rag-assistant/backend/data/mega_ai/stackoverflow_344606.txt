Perl 5: All the really good stuff nowadays seems to require mod_perl, which has low availability everywhere I want to go. Some really incredible functionality can be encapsulated in modules, but what is under the hood is often fragile or frightening: source filters, typeglobs, whatever Moose is doing... DateTime is brilliant but still made some very bad design decisions ( not returning a stopwatch duration when subtracting two DateTime objects ) Dual-lifed modules in core and on CPAN still cause conflicts module authors still put interactive stuff in their module configuration scripts so that they can't be automatically installed
