I guess you need to re-think your architecture and identify layers in your system. The first would be connection - ok, it seems you got it. Then you want to present some logic to the user, moreover, you want to give him unique instance of that.. Just spawn it. If it is separate from the rest of the functionality it is going to be trivial. If I ware you, I would read one of Eralng/OTP books (Joe Amstrong, Thomson&Cesarini, Logan recently) to understand nature of Erlang systems and managing processes.
