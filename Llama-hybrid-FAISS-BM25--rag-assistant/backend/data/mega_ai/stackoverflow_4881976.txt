Silverlight 'user initiated' security feature explained

When programming for the Silverlight platform, I've found that I can't call two functions needing user initiation in the same user initiated event, one right after the other. For example, suppose I want to call IsolatedStorage.IncreaseQuotaTo and SaveFileDialog.ShowDialog in the same button click event. I can't because if the IncreaseQuotaTo call is made then the showdialog (or openfile) call throws a 'Must be user initiateted' exception. The problem is that it is user initiated, except that it has a call to a user initiated function before it. In a user initiated event, I should be able to call as many of these 'user initiated only' functions as I want, however, I am limited to only one. It seems that Silverlight is monitoring the call stack for these functions and ensuring that only one gets executed. Is this a bug?
