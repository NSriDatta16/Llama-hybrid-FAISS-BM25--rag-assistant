CFString release, why only on ipad?

I have the same project, that at the beginning, it worked also on ipad, but now it works only on iphone devices, not ipad ones. It's a project iphone/ipad compatibile. Probably i edit something but i don't know how! The returned error in DEBUG || RELEASE mode on ipad DEVICE was the classic: *** -[CFString release]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x110500 ...but on iphone, it's all ok. I can't able to debugging because it show me only assembly code and i don't know where is the issue... Is this problem appened around? It's my problem or ipad issue? What could be different on these devices? thanks, alberto.
