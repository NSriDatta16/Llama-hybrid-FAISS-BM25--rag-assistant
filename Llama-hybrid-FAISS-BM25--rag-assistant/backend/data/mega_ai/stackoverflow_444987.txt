If you are sure your team will follow such a heavyweight template, fine, use it as shown. Otherwise, it looks like JavaDoc. One of the nice things about Doxygen is how good a job it does without having to use use such strong markup. You don't need to use @name and with the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF setting you can skip @brief - just make sure the first line of the comment is a reasonable brief description. I prefer descriptive names over enforcing documentation and encouraging people to add comments only when they add significant value. That way, the valuable comments aren't drowned out by all the noise.
