PCA: Out of Sample Variance Explained

The eigenvalues of a PCA model can be used to calculate the variance explained of each principal component. I'm curious how one might train a PCA model on a subset of data, and then use the eigenvectors of that model to calculate the variance explained on unseen (out-of-sample/ test) data. Any suggestions for python or R implementations would be highly appreciated.
