Interpreting a Schoenfeld plot for Cox PH univariate model and correcting for violation of PH assumption (R)

I am having trouble understanding how to interpret a Schoenfeld plot and how to correct for the violation of PH assumption in Cox PH model when using continuous numeric covariates. Here is the code I am using to call the model, the variable I am investigating is average spring/summer precipitation (AS_avg_total_p_mm) over the study period (10 years): The image and plot below is the output of the cox.zph() test, and the test graphed using ggcoxzph(). While the statistics indicate the model violates the PH assumption, I am unsure how to correct for this. I have read about introducing a time interaction variable into the model (either by var:time, or tt(var) and adding a tt function), but I am unsure how to do this properly. My knowledge of statistics and modeling is very basic. When I add the var:time variable to my model, the covariate and the interaction are significant, but even further fail the cox.zph() significance test (image below). I have also read that this might be an inappropriate approach. Introducing a tt(var) hinders me from using cox.zph(), as the function does not support the use of this. Therefore: How can I implement a time interaction and still test that my model is following the rules? How do I interpret a Shoenfeld plot that looks like mine? Most that I see example wise are scattered or follow some specific pattern. What should a "good" plot look like? Is the failure of this assumption drastic enough to warrant changes to my model? Is this up to my interpretation? Does my sample size play a role in how these tests are behaving? It is quite large. Please let me know if any additional information is needed here and forgive me if my question is redundant. I have tried many examples to solve my problem. Thank you for your time!
