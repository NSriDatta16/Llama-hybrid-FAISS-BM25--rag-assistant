I found this site that has some pretty decent information. What exactly are you trying to do? Here FRESH! Look here: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/runtime.html Your IO Operations are limited as follows (beyond disabled modules): App Engine records how much of each resource an application uses in a calendar day, and considers the resource depleted when this amount reaches the app's quota for the resource. A calendar day is a period of 24 hours beginning at midnight, Pacific Time. App Engine resets all resource measurements at the beginning of each day, except for Stored Data which always represents the amount of datastore storage in use. When an app consumes all of an allocated resource, the resource becomes unavailable until the quota is replenished. This may mean that your app will not work until the quota is replenished. An application can determine how much CPU time the current request has taken so far by calling the Quota API. This is useful for profiling CPU-intensive code, and finding places where CPU efficiency can be improved for greater cost savings. You can measure the CPU used for the entire request, or call the API before and after a section of code then subtract to determine the CPU used between those two points. Resource| Free Default Quota| Billing Enabled Default Quota Blobstore |Stored Data| 1 GB| 1 GB free; no maximum Resource |Billing Enabled| Default Quota Daily Limit| Maximum Rate Blobstore API Calls |140,000,000 calls| 72,000 calls/minute Hmm my table isn't that good, but hopefully still readable. EDIT: OK, I understand. But sir, you did not have to use the "f" word. :) And you know, it's kinda like the whole 'teach a man to fish' scenario. Google is who I always ask and that's why I'm answering questions here for fun. EDIT AGAIN: OK that made more sense before the comment was tooked. So I went and answered the question a little more. I hope it helps.
