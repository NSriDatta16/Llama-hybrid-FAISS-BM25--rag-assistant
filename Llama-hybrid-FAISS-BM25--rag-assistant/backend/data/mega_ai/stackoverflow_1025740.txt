Note that the site Robert Harvey suggests is an excellent starting point for the layout and typography of your site. Add on top of that http://colorschemedesigner.com/ to pick a nice set of coordinated colours, and you are most of the way there to having the building blocks to make your own customised site design. Keep in mind that in most cases not over-designing is the best way to get something stylish together. Note: Worth a special mention is the 'Simulate color vision deficiency' option at the bottom-left of the colour scheme designer... especially if you have important meaningful colours it pays to check that everyone is likely able to discern it.
