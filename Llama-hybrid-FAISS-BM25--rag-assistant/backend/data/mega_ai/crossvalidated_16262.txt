How to test whether variance explained by first factor of PCA differs across repeated measures conditions?

Context: I have a study where six numeric variables are measured in each of two repeated measures experimental conditions (n = 200). Lets call the conditions $A$ and $B$ and the variables $A_1, A_2,..., A_6$ and $B_1, B_2,..., B_6$. Theoretically, I expect that in condition $B$ more variance in the variables should be explained by the first factor of a principal components analysis (PCA). Typical values would be: First factor of PCA on $A_1, ..., A_6$ accounts for 30% of variance First factor of PCA on $B_1, ..., B_6$ accounts for 40% of variance. Questions: How can I test whether this difference is statistically significant? How could this be implemented in R?
