How to rank a feature importance?

If I trained a network using Neural Network classifier, how can I know which feature was most important for predicting the target variable? I mean how to create a "feature ranking" among the features (from high importance value to low). I have seen some literature about decision trees/AdaBoost but I am typically interested in Neural networks especially for classification purpose. To make it more clear, an example is shown in the figure.
