A bit more info would be useful such as the types of polygon your using, your graphics card and what version of WPF you're using. I tried your example and didn't have any problem with 500 simple polygons. (Core 2 Duo, 8800 GTS). Your example and other times when you have fairly complex content that doesn't change very often but you are transforming it can greatly benefit from a BitmapCache . With a BitmapCache you should be able to transform as many elements as you would want, although you will still have a performance hit whenever they need to be re-rendered. If you're using complex paths you could also try freezing them.
