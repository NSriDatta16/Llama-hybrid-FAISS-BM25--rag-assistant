I've done this several times now at different places (see Steve Rands' answer below) and I would strongly urge you NOT to use normal replication - especially if there are going to be several databases involved. The reason I say this is that in my experience replication isn't smart enough to deal with the problems that can arise when you bring a remote site back online (or when you decide to add a new site to the overall network). Replication is fine for this kind of thing if you only have 2 or 3 different databases but if you are talking about lots of different locations that can be online/offline at any time, and information can be added (or deleted or amended) at any of those locations, it won't take you long to get something into a confused state. It's not a very technically satisfying thing to say, but you will always be able to think of special cases where you wouldn't want the replication to do what it will, by design, want to do. If you're only dealing with 2 databases then obviously the replication problems become much more straightforward and you will probably find that you can use merge replication for the job (though you have to watch your database design). I've just bought a second-hand copy of the Apress SQL Server 2005 Replication Bible (not in the office so don't have the author to hand but it's a well-recommended, monster tome) - within the first couple of chapters I began to realise that replication is not a magic bullet solution if you're really changing data at two (or more) ends. :-)
