Trouble Using JQuery UI.Resizable() and UI.Draggable() with an iFrame

I'm trying to create a dialog window using JQuery. I'm making progress so far, but running into some issues w/ the iframe... I know that iframes are usually frowned upon, but they are the only things that will meet the requirements of the project. Anyway, I can successfully implement the resizable and draggable plugins, but I run into issues if the user drags to fast and mouses over the iframe that is contained in the dialog's inner div. Kind of difficult to explain, but the code below should help show what is happening. It almost seems like once the mouse crosses over the iframe, the iframe steals the focus of the mousedown event. I'm wondering if there is any way around this. Thanks, Chris $(document).ready(function() { $("#container").draggable(); $("#container").resizable( { alsoResize: "#if" } ).parent().draggable(); } ); EDIT: In order to run the app, the jquery files referenced in the code will need to be downloaded. The code should be backwards compatible with previous versions though. EDIT: I changed the code up a bit to simplify things a bit. EDIT: I found an alternative method to solving this problem by using the prototype-window libraries. I would much rather use jQuery over prototype since many of the benchmarks are a lot better, but due to my time crunch the protype route will do. I'm still interested in figuring this out though if anyone has some advice. Thanks again for all your help. EDIT: If I change the iframe to a div, the code above works flawlessly. The issue only appears to be the way that the draggable and resizable extensions function when and iframe is involved.
