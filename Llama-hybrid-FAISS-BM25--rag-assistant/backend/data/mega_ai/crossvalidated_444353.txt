If you want to provide evidence for equivalence (by contrast with evidence for difference), you can perform a t-test for equivalence using TOST . (In the below " $\theta$ " is the difference between groups you are estimating a la $\bar{\mu}_{1} - \bar{\mu}_{2}$ or whatever.) General 'negativist' null hypothesis: $H_{0}^{-}: |\theta| \ge \delta$ , with $H_{\text{A}}^{-}:|\theta| . This general null hypothesis requires two one-sided null hypotheses to actually test: $H_{01}^{-}:\theta \ge \delta$ with $H_{\text{A}1}^{-}:\theta , and $H_{02}^{-}:\theta \le -\delta$ with $H_{\text{A}2}^{-}:\theta > -\delta$ . If you reject $H_{01}^{-}$ , then you conclude $\theta$ is less that $\delta$ . If you reject $H_{02}^{-}$ , then you conclude $\theta$ is greater than $-\delta$ . If your reject both these then you conclude $-\delta . What is $\delta?$ It is a priori (i.e. before you perform the test) the smallest difference in your measures (i.e. $\theta$ ) that you actually care about. The above graph gives an imaginary distribution of $\theta$ to illustrate the rejection region (the green shaded region, which is both less that $\delta$ , and greater than $-\delta$ ) for two one-sided tests for equivalence for a $\delta=.536$ . The t-test statistics are $t_{1} = \frac{\delta - \theta}{\sigma_{\theta}}$ and $t_{2} = \frac{\theta + \delta}{\sigma_{\theta}}$ . Both these statistics have been constructed to obtain p-values in the right-tail of the distribution, therefore… Obtain p-values as $p_{1} = P(T_{df} \ge t_{1})$ , and $p_{2} = P(T_{df} \ge t_{2})$ . ( $p_{1}$ and $t_{1}$ are for $H_{01}^{-}$ and so forth.) Decision to reject for $H_{0}^{-}$ is based on $p_{1} \le \alpha$ and $p_{2} \le \alpha$ ( not $\alpha/2$ ). Conclusions are: Reject $H_{0}^{-}$ (i.e. by rejecting both $H_{01}^{-}$ and $H_{02}^{-}$ ), then conclude "found evidence of equivalence within $\delta$ at the $\alpha$ level;" otherwise Not reject $H_{0}^{-}$ , then conclude "failed to find evidence of equivalence within $\delta$ at the $\alpha$ level." Bonus round: Relevance Tests Combine inference from a test for equivalence (t-test of $H_{0}^{-}$ ) with a test for difference (t-test of $H_{0}^{+}$ ) to (1) incorporate statistical power directly into the conclusion, and (2) incorporate minimum relevant effect size directly into the conclusion: Reject $H_{0}^{+}$ and fail to reject $H_{0}^{-}$ : conclude "found evidence of a relevant difference at least as big as $\delta$ ." Fail to reject $H_{0}^{+}$ and reject $H_{0}^{-}$ : conclude "found evidence of equivalence within $\delta$ ." Reject $H_{0}^{+}$ and reject $H_{0}^{-}$ : conclude "found evidence of a trivial difference (i.e. yes evidence of difference, but a priori you don't care about differences that small, and the test was 'overpowered')." Fail to reject $H_{0}^{+}$ and fail to reject $H_{0}^{-}$ : conclude "Data were indeterminate (i.e. the power of the data given $\alpha$ and $\delta$ is too low to say anything)."
