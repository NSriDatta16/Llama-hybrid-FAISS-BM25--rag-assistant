Is there a tool/ library/ algorithm that can learn from the steps I perform in cleaning text and apply them to similar data?

I have a dataset of organization names that is quite messy. I used all the popular NER tools on it without much success(I assume it's because they lack context). I resolved to using OpenRefine but I reached a dead end with it's filters not picking up a lot of similar strings. I would like to use the data that I cleaned so far with OpenRefine for a (preferably supervised) machine learning algorithm that can afterwards continue the cleaning. Are there any resources that could help with this?
