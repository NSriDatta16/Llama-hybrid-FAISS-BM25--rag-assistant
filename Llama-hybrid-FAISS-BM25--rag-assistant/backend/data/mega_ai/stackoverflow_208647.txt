jQuery: How to stop a helper from being removed if it wasn't successfully dropped

I have a draggable with a custom helper . Sometimes the helper is a clone and sometimes it is the original element. The problem is that when the helper is the original element and is not dropped on a valid droppable it gets removed. My solution looks like this so far: in my on_dropped callback I set ui.helper.dropped_on_droppable to true ; In the stop callback of the draggable, I check for that variable and then ... what do I do? $('.my_draggable').draggable({ stop : function(e, ui) { if (!ui.helper.dropped_on_droppable) { /* what do I do here? */ } }, Is this even the right approach?
