See http://www.apache.org/dist/apr/Announcement0.9.html : This version of APR is principally a bug fix release, and is provided only for users requiring APR 0.9 compatibility. Most developers are encouraged to adopt the latest APR 1.x version to ensure the most comprehensive support and access to the latest features and enhancements. For example, the Apache HTTP Server Project's httpd 2.0 release uses APR 0.9 for binary compatibility, while later httpd 2.2 releases require APR 1.2 for better support and additional features.
