PCA as Pre-Processing before Clustering through GMM

Suppose I start with a data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$ , where each row $x_i$ is $D$ -dimensional sample. I would like to cluster this data through a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). If I pre-process the data using PCA, then I can attain a new data matrix $X' \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$ , where each variable (column) are orthogonal to each other. I think this implies that the covariance matrix of this transformed data is diagonal. My questions are Would it make sense to assume that the components in my GMM have diagonal covariance matrices? Is there any relationship between this process and Probabilistic PCA (PPCA)? Does this process make sense / when would I want to use PCA before clustering in GMM?
