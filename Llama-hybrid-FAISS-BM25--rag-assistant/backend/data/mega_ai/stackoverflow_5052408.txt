accessing vaadin data on the client side

I would like to know if there is a way to access or expose the data that is managed by Vaadin on the client side. I.e. I am using some data on the server inside of a Vaadin application. In the UI, I would like to include a visualization widget that uses this data and leverages raphael.js. I suspect this is possible using the gwt graphics library, but it would imply creating a custom Vaadin widget which looks like a headf*ck. Isn't there a simpler way, something as straightforward as using plain javascript on the client side?
