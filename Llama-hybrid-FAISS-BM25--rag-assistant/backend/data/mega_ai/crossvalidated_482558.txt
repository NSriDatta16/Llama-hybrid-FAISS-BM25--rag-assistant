Unfamiliar with 'contrast' function

Stata has a 'contrast' function after using a regression on a categorical variable. What this essentially does is compare each level of the categorical variable to the mean of the dependent variable. So say I am interested in tumor size in 10 different locations in the brain. My research question is: Does any location in the brain harbor statistically significantly smaller tumors than the rest? Many would suggest running a binomial regression with locations as the dependents, or logistic regression with locations as a categorical independent. But this does not answer the research question. This answers the question "does any location in the brain harbor small tumors compared to the base in question ." Myself I would probably run 10 different regressions by dichotomizing location, but I also know many would shake their fists at this approach. So I've looked at using contrast (this is what it's called in stata, it may have a different name in whatever environment you work in or in statistics generally, and is described above). However I'm posting this question because this function is new to me. My question is essentially: Does this function answer my research question sufficiently? If 3 locations pop out with p values lower than my alpha, can I report these as locations that harbor significantly smaller (or larger) aneurysms than the mean?
