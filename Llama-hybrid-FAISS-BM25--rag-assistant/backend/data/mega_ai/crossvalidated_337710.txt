You can restructure your covariate set so that time till treatment is accounted for. For example, your covariates can be average number of tweets per month, etc., and you can also include length of time till treatment as a covariate. Once you feel you have adequately adjusted for confounding in this way, you can perform a regular PSM analysis. You can also require exact (or coarsened exact) matching on time till treatment, thereby matching treated units with control units that have the same amount of time till treatment. Also, instead of or in addition to matching, you can include these variables in a regression model of your outcome on the treatment, perhaps including interactions between time-till-treatment and treatment.
