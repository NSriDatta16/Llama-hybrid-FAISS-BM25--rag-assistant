R has a lot of excellent packages related to data mining. In particular, look at: The machine learning view on CRAN. The natural language processing view on CRAN. It also ties into Weka ( see the RWeka package ). And it can be integrated with either .Net (through COM) or Python (through RPy or RPy2). I would agree regarding Pentaho for a reporting platform, although it's a very large project depending upon what you're using it for.
