Until people answered my question, I was working on my own method of doing it. I've only started GUI programming so I don't know all the features of wx so I ended up using the time module. Anurag's method is probably better since it uses wx functions, but I'll post this here anyways as another way of doing it. NOTE: This may not always work (I'm having trouble getting it to work with diff interpreters on same OS). So use Anurag's method. import wx def vibrate(windowName, distance=15, times=5, speed=0.05, direction='horizontal'): #Speed is the number of seconds between movements #If times is odd, it increments so that window ends up in same location import time if not times % 2 == 0: times += 1 location = windowName.GetPositionTuple() if direction == 'horizontal': newLoc = (location[0] + distance, location[1]) elif direction == 'vertical': newLoc = (location[0], location[1] + distance) for x in range(times): time.sleep(speed) windowName.Move(wx.Point(newLoc[0], newLoc[1])) time.sleep(speed) windowName.Move(wx.Point(location[0], location[1])) app = wx.App() frame = wx.Frame(None, -1, 'Vibrator') frame.Show() vibrate(frame) app.MainLoop()
