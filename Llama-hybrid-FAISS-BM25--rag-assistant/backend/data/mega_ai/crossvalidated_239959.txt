How to obtain the angle of rotation produced by a PCA on a 2D dataset?

I want to find the principal direction in a set of spatial coordinates (i.e. in a 2D table). To do so I'm using PCA implemented in prcomp (because it allows missing values). prcomp returns a 'rotation' matrix which is said to be the matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns contain the eigenvectors). From this, I would like to calculate the angle of the rotation achieved by the PCA, expressed as the clockwise angle from the North direction. I know the information is there, but I cannot get the calculation right. Any help would be appreciated. EDIT: It seems that deg(asin(abs(rotation[1,1]))) works. My understanding of what I read elsewhere led me to that solution, but I don't feel like I would be able to correctly spell out an explanation for the benefit of others.
