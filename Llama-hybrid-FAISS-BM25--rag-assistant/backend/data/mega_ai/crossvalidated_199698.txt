I think what you are after is the gender gap, $\frac{\delta Wage}{\delta Female} = \beta_1 + \beta_3 Time$. Notice that in this case, the gender gap depends on time. Notice also that the gender gap does not equal $\beta_1 + \beta_3$. What your F-test tests is whether there is no gender gap when time = 1. Maybe this is something you want to test but this could also be nonsensical for instance if your time variable goes from 1990 to 2010. Your confusion comes from the fact that you think you have tested with the F-test whether there is a gender gap in your entire dataset. So you think you have the following results There is no gender gap (based on the F-test) The gender gap increases over time (based on $\beta_3$) which sounds weird. However, this is not true. What you have is There is no gender gap at time = 0 ($\beta_1$) There is no gender gap at time = 1 ($\beta_1 + \beta_3$) The gender gap increases over time ($\beta_3$) This seems to be plausible for instance if there is a significant gender gap at time = 10 ($\beta_1 + 10 \beta_3$). If you want to test whether there is a gender gap on average over time, you can just run a regression without the time variable and investigate the coefficient of Female. All this is of course predicated on what your actual question is. If you just want to say that women, get lower wages on average, this is fine. If you want to say something along the line of "Women get underpaid for the same work and because they are women", you will need a more complicated model with at least more control variables.
