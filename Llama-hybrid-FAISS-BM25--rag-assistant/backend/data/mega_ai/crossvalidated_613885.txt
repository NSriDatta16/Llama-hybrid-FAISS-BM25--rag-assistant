If a strictly stationary process is also independent, does this imply i.i.d.?

Suppose I have a time series process $\{X_t\}$ that is strictly stationary in the sense that the joint distribution of $[X_{t_1},...,X_{t_k}]$ and $[X_{t_1+a},...,X_{t_k+a}]$ are the same for any set of integers $t_1,...,t_k$ and any integer $a$ . If in addition, I know that this process have mutually independent observations. Does this imply that $\{X_t\}$ is an i.i.d. process? My guess is that it is. Because strict stationarity implies that every term in this time series have the same distribution as $X_1$ , and thus when independence also hold, it is an i.i.d. process. Does this look correct?
