Check out our product named ActiveAnalysis (previously named Data Dynamics Analysis). It allows your end users to perform interactive, drag & drop analysis on the web against a relational database or an optimized OLAP database (e.g. Analysis Services). However, since it is a programmable component a .NET developer can customize and integrate it into your applications. See http://ActiveAnalysis.grapecity.com for more information.
