Framework for reinforcement learning for games

[I hope this is the correct place to post - if not, please feel free to migrate the question to another site]. I would like to build a computer program that will play games effectively, and I want to use reinforcement learning techniques, namely, let two copies of the program play against each other, and use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal-difference_learning for learning an optimal strategy. Before I start coding - is there an existing framework for such tasks? Preferrably in Java, but not necessarily. I found some Java frameworks for reinforcement learning, but they are not geared towards games.
