MySQL: Formatting a string

My database contains a string pattern that is used to allow for easy user editing via a JS-script. The string is basicly formatted like so: aaa[bbb#ccc]ddd[eee#fff]ggg the result I am looking for is aaacccdddfffggg I'd like to do this when selecting the string from the database. I'm guessing a regex should do the trick. But my knowledge in the subject of regex's is rather limited. However, this is not a requirement, if there exist a more elegant solution to the problem.
