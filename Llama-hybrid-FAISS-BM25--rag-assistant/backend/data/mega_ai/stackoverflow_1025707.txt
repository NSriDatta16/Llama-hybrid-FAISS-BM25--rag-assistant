Getting a class/struct object from the member pointer

I have C++ structure as struct myStruct { int a; int b; int c; }; myStruct b; int *ptr = &b.c; How can I get myStruct object back from ptr? (I know I can do this using pointer arithmatic like container_Of() in C. Basically something like reinterpret_cast (reinterpret_cast (ptr) - offsetof(myStruct, c)); I am asking if there is any recommended/elegant way?)
