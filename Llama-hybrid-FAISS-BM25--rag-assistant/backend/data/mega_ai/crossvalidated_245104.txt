Random Forest with longitudinal data

I have many measurements for multiple individuals, but I'm not sure how to account for that repeat-measure structure when running a random forest model. Is there a way to account for underlying data structure of longitudinal data using a random forest model? Is this even necessary? -- it seems to me that it should be... I would especially like to be able to perform this in R .
