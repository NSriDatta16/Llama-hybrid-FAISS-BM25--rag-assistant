Depending on the way you implement (and if you implement) sessions, you could use the same storage media to get the number of active users. For example if you use the file-based session model, simply scan the directory which contains the session files and return the number of session files. If you are using database to store session data, return the number of rows in the session table. Of course this is supposing that you are happy with the timeout value your session has (ie. if your session has a timeout of 30 minutes, you will get a list of active users in the last 30 minutes).
