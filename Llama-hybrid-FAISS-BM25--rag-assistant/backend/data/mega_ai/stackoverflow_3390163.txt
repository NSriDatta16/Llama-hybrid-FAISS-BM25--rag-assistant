Confused about table design. How to store multiple data

I have a table for storing the postman coverage area. It has two fields postmanid covering_pincode What i am going to implement is, when a user enters a pincode in the textbox, the list of the postman covering that pincodes are displayed. My doubt is, how can i enter the values in the table 1. Multiple pincodes stored in single row like postmanid->1, covering_pincode-> 626123, 626124, 626432, 654564 OR 2.Storing each pincode by each seperate fields like postmanid->1, covering_pincode->626123, postmanid->1, covering_pincode->626124, postmanid->1, covering_pincode->626432, postmanid->1, covering_pincode->654564 Please help which one is best for searching the table by pincode
