Interpretation for test score , training score and validation score in machine learning?

Interpretation for test score , training score and validation score ? what they actually tell us? What's an acceptable difference between cross test score , validation score and test score? If difference between test score and training score is small mean it is a good model/fit? overfitting and under fitting on the basis of test score , training score and validation score? whether any of these score or difference among them tells us , if we need more data(observations)
