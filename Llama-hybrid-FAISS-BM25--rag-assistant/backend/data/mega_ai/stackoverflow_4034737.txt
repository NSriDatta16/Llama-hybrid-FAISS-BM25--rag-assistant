No strictfp in Scala - workarounds?

I searched the web for how to enforce srictfp in Scala but could not find any hint of it. There are some people complaining about it, but real solutions cannot be found. There is a bugtracker entry about it which is almost two years old. As it seems there is no elegant fix for it on the way I'm looking for workarounds. My current idea is to set the appropiate method flag ACC_STRICT in the generated bytecode by myself somehow but I have no idea what would be the best solution to do so. A Scala Compiler Plugin comes to mind or just hacking flags in a hex editor. Maybe someone faced the same challenge and can tell me his or her solution?
