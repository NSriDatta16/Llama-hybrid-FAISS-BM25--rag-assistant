Selecting a boundary on a binary classifier to optimal precision and recall

I have a logistic regression classifier that shows differing levels of performance for precision and recall at different probability boundaries as follows: The default threshold for the classifier to decide which class something belongs to is 0.5. However, am I right in understanding that in order to get the best performance trade-off I should set the decision boundary to be about 0.82 below? That can be done in Scikit-Learn, but I want to make sure that I am drawing the correct conclusions. Any advice would be appreciated.
