I think the most convenient way to do that in Python is by using a tabula library. I happened to do similar task with pdf files and probably the easiest way to do so is to use tabula.read_pdf function. I see also that Tabula has an online tool, but I haven't tried it. Unless it works, you can try to create a parser a little more manually with PyPDF2 library. I can also recommend just asking ChatGPT to write a parser for you based on a snippet of your document. However, with this approach remember to anonymize your personal data.
