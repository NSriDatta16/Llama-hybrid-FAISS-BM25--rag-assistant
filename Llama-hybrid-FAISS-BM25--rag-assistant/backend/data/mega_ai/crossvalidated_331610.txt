Reinforcement learning with large number of actions to choose from

In reinforcement learning, if the number of possible actions to choose from is increased, it becomes difficult to train. In many successful examples (ex: DQN), the number of possible actions to choose from is a single digit. Is there any reinforcement learning technique that allows large number of "possible actions" to choose from? When I say large number, it should be in terms of 1,000-1,000,000. If it's more it's still better. Thank you!
