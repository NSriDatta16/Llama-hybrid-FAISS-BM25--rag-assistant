HTML email message condensed

The query below sends out an email. It works okay, but the message is condensed into basically one long paragraph. I would like a break where I have the tags below. However, the tags are being ignored. Any idea how I could put breaks there? Thanks in advance, John $message1 = " Someone made the following comment on your submission $submission: $comment Please click the link below to see the comment in context. $link1 "; $headers = 'MIME-Version: 1.0' . "\r\n"; $headers .= 'Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1' . "\r\n"; $queryem = mail($mailaddress, "Someone has commented on your submission $submission.", $message1, $headers);
