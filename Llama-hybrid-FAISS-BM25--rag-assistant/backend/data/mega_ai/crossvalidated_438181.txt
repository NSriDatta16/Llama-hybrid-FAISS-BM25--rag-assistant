If you look at a crosstab of the copy of allele variable I expect you will find the problem: There aren't enough people in some of the cells and you cannot estimate the parameters for those levels of that variable. Also, it looks like you are using lm (which fits linear regression) but your DV (normal/abnormal) looks like it is categorical, which would indicate using logistic regression. Looking at your variables, it also seems likely that you have some coliearity. Have you checked that?
