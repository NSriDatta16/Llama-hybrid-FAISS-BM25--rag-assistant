Couple of nasties to watch out for from personal experience (with GDI and Direct3D9 anyway): When the two monitors have different bit depths, and the user expands the window to cover both monitors or drags it from one to the other... well it can get ugly if your app wasn't expecting it. Used to be much more of a headache back when systems might mix 8-bit palletized displays with higher bit-depth RGB ones (although be aware that such configurations are still out there for certain specialized applications). Direct3D windows created on one "D3D device" may need attention if you drag them to another display (wholly or partially). Depending how you set up the device, windows either displays nothing on the other display, or does display content but with a massive amount of CPU-processing overhead (enough to kill high frame rates). (This was true on XP anyway).
