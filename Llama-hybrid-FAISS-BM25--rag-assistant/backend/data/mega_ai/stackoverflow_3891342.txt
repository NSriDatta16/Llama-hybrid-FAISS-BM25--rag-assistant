I'm a bit unclear on what to do with the ID column since it's always the same value, but this should give you the output you want given the data you provided: WITH Results AS ( SELECT MAX(ID) as ID, Page_Order, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Page_Order DESC) as Page_Number FROM PageNumberTable GROUP BY Page_Order ) SELECT Results.* FROM PageNumberTable JOIN Results ON PageNumberTable.Page_Order = Results.Page_Order
