As a colleague of the authors, I can address this question. To directly answer the OP, @rapaio is correct: the top quotation means that the authors created 10 separate bags each with a random forest of 10 trees -- there will be 100 total trees. As @rapaio mentioned, there's no clear cut reason why this performed better than 100 bags or 100 random forest. The Weka implementation made it easy to perform all five experiments experiments (single tree, 10 bags, 100 bags, 100 random forest, 10 bags of 10 random forests) and the authors felt the result was interesting enough to mention. Whether this is something that shows up as a general trend against other datasets (such as Kaggle or UCI) could be the basis for a good research paper. @rapaio did not mention it, but there may also be some interplay between the various oob estimates and the final performance metric -- AUC (not accuracy). Perhaps this is a trend only observed when optimizing for rank-order and not necessarily discrete predictions.
