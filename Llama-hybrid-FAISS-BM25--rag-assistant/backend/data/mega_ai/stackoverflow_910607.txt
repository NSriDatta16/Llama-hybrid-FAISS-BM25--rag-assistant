UIViews don't generally need IBAction outlets to receive touch events. Typically, if a view is under the control of a viewController, you can check for UITouch Events using touchesBegan methods. To set the target and selector for control actions you can also use: - (void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)controlEvents
