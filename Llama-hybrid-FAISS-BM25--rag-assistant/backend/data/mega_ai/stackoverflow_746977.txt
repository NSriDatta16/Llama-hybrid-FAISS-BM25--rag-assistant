SEO issues with identical pages with just slight variation in auxiliary content (shown in different languages)

Are there any issues to be expected if search engines can see the same pages in maybe 2-3 variations, where the main content stays the same but some secondary information differs? Example. Let's imagine a forum thread can be reached at several Urls: http://www.mysite.com/threads/en/12345 http://www.mysite.com/threads/de/12345 http://www.mysite.com/threads/fr/12345 As you can see, the main user-generated content (which will constitute over 90% of the visible text) will be the same, but some auxiliary information like labels and links ("View profile", "Send a message", "Report abuse" etc.) will be present in different languages. The reason for that organization is that I want the users to be able to bookmark a page directly in their preferred languages. So, is this approach good or bad from the SEO point of view? I somehow guess it will be. Does it matter that these links all belong to my site, not just to other copies scattered on various resources all over the web? If this way of doing things is bad, how should I do otherwise?
