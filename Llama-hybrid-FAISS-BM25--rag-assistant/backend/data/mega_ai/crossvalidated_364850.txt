Non-monotonic decile averages

I've got a range of scores (output of a statistical model) between 0.0 and 1.0. When I split these into deciles and take within-decile averages, I get a sequence of numbers that is not monotonically increasing from the bottom decile to the top. Am I crazy or should that not be possible?
