Ok, I found the answer: bool MyModel::dropMimeData(const QMimeData *data, Qt::DropAction action, int row, int column, const QModelIndex &parent) If the QModelIndex is valid (not parent.row(), parent.column() of -1) then it is being dropped on that object as its parent and its up to me to figure out where to put it in the model. If it is not valid, then the row and column is not -1, and I have an invalid model index and the object is being inserted at that position. This was in the qt docs " Using Drag and Drop with Item Views " - I had only seen the general drag/drop documentation.
