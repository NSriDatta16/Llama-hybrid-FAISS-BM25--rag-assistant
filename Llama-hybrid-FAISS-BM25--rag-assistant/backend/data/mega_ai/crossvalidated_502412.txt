Factor graph equivalent to Markov networks

Consider the following potential on three nodes. $$\psi(x_1,x_2,x_3) = f_a(x_1,x_2)f_b(x_2,x_3)f_c(x_1,x_3)$$ represented by the following factor graph: Now the notes claim that we can represent this factor graph as both a Bayesian network and a Markov networks as follows. The representation is given here: I'm failing to see the connection with the extra three nodes $Z_1,Z_2,Z_3$ ? What would the break down into clique potentials of the probability distribution looks like? Since there are only 2-cliques, the theory as I know it suggests that $$p(x_1,x_2,x_3,Z_1,Z_2,Z_3) = \frac 1 Z \psi_1(x_1,Z_1) \psi_2(Z_1,x_2) \psi_3(x_2,Z_2) \psi_4(Z_2,x_3) \psi_5(x_3,Z_3) \psi_6(Z_3,x_1)$$ where $Z$ is the normalising constant. However I'm confused as to what $\psi(Z_1)$ would represent and how it equals $f_a(x_1,x_2)$ ? Can anyone fill in the missing pieces of the construction?
