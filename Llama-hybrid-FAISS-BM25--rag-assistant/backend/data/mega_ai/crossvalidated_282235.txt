Is my data useless for a machine learning classifier?

I want to use machine learning to predict/classify a set of samples with about 6 features each. My target is multilabel with 3 possible values. I've plotted all 2-length combinations of features, with the target color coded in either green, red or blue. Looking at the plots, there's no discernible pattern or boundaries in the data ( imgur link to plots ). Does that mean that no machine learning algorithm is going to work? at least not with the current data? thanks
