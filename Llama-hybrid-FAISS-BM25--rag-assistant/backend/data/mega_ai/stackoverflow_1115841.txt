You can just use the ACCEPT keyword to grab keyboard output. Loop through until you hit a keyword such as 'end', or you can use the hex value of EOF (1A, I believe). As in: 1000-YOUR-PARAGRAPH. ACCEPT WS-YOUR-VARIABLE. DISPLAY WS-YOUR-VARIABLE. IF WS-YOUR-VARIABLE IS NOT EQUAL TO EOF THEN GO TO 1000-YOUR-PARAGRAPH ELSE GO TO 1090-EXIT END-IF. 1090-EXIT. EXIT. That will take everything up to an EOL marker (e.g. return).
