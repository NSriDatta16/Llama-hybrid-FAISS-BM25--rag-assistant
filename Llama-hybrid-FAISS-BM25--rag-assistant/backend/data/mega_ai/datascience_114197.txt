As far as I am concerned, Mask R-CNN is the oldest model from listed above. It comes from R-CNN family, these models are two stage models. Generally speaking, first they make region proposal and then classify them, Yolo family is younger, models from this family are single stage networks, they spit image into grid and return probabilty of classification. Besides of that, compatibilty of mask r-cnn with e.g tensorfow 2.0 is problematic. As you mentioned yolo models are faster. Taking into consideration argumemsts above I would choose one from yolo family e.g yolo v7
