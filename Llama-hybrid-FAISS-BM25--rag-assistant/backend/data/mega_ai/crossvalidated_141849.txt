Understanding Bartlett's test from SAS

I am trying interpret the results of Bartlett's test run in SAS. This is the output I get: Bartlett's Test for Homogeneity of HoursWorked Variance Source DF Chi-Square Pr > ChiSq Year 1 0.00103 0.9744 My data is comparing the average hours worked between a group of countries between two years. Since the pr is larger than chisq , does that mean there are or aren't equal variances?
