Yes, the approach you propose is sound and applied widely. Instead of PCA, I suggest using U-MAP , which will probably yield better results (also better than t-SNE). The representation you may use as input to U-MAP is the output last layer before the projection to the label space dimensionality (e.g. with a 5-class classifier, you would take the vector representation before projection to the 5-dimensional space).
