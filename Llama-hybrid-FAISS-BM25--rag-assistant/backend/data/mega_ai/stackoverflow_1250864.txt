Examples of ORMs which use a single table for the entire hierarchy and those which don't?

From http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx "developers typically adopt one of the other two approaches, more complex in outlook but more efficient when dealing with relational storage: they either create a table per concrete (most-derived) class, preferring to adopt denormalization and its costs, or else they create a single table for the entire hierarchy, often in either case creating a discriminator column to indicate to which class each row in the table belongs. (Various hybrids of these schemes are also possible, but typically don't create results that are significantly different from these two.) Unfortunately, the denormalization costs are often significant for a large volume of data, and/or the table(s) will contain significant amounts of empty columns, which will need NULLability constraints on all columns, eliminating the powerful integrity constraints offered by an RDBMS." I would like to know which ORMs use one or the other way especially the ones which use a single table and in .NET ?
