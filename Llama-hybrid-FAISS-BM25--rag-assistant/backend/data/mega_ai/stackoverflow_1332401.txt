Ncover not covering the code in child process of the test.dll (which is started using Process.start) in C#

I want to get coverage of let's say CoverageTarget.dll. I have a test.dll to run the nunit tests, which starts a child process childTestApp.exe(which tests some of the code in CoverageTarget.dll) using the Process.Start method in the process of testing. in the results i am not able to see the code covered by the childTestApp.exe. this is may be expected behavior,but is there any way/tool i can get the code covered in the testApp.exe?
