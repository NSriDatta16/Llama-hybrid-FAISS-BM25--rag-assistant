Two time series with equal autocorrelations

I am considering two simple regression models. The error term of each follow AR(1) model. I am looking for the examples where the error terms of the two models have equal autocorrelation coefficients. I would appreciate if someone give me examples from time series. What is the relation between the slope of a model and the autocorrelation coefficient? Thanks.
