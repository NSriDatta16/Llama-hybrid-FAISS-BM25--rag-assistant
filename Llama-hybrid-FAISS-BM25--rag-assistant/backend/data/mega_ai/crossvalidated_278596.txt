PLS regression - My X and Y blocks are obtained at different sampling frequencies. Should I trim the X block or smooth and interpolate the Y block?

PLS (partial least squares) regression is the tool that I'm using to express each Y block variable as a linear function of the X block variables. The overall goal of this project is to create a model that can predict the infrequently measured Y block parameters (once daily), from the frequently measured X block parameters (every minute). This would allow for more agile control of the Y block parameters based on the model predictions (or more likely, this would trigger an unscheduled measurement of Y to confirm that corrective action should be taken). Consider the following properties of the Y block data: High measurement variability (only 1 measurement available from each daily sample, but according to the vendor the standard deviation of replicate measurements can be up to 30% of the average value) Low frequency signal Typically a monotonically decreasing function (and other measurements have obvious changes to determine when this assumption is invalid) X block values have a known linear dependence on the Y block values, and on other unmeasured parameters that vary independently of the Y block variables As far as I'm aware, having more (useful) data in the model training step will decrease the magnitude of the error in future predictions. I specifically want to know if it would be appropriate to generate a larger set of data to train the model with by interpolating new values for Y such that I have a value at every minute to align with the X block measurements. I know this is generally frowned upon, but I feel that bullet points 2, 3 and 4 lend credibility to this kind of manipulation, but I can't find any references that discuss preprocessing the Y block parameters; all of the literature focuses on proper treatment of the X block data. I'm also curious if it would be appropriate to use a smoothing filter on the original Y data to account for the high measurement variability before interpolation. I'd appreciate any insight one can offer into this problem. Also, I can't find anything in the literature about Y block preprocessing techniques,so I'd love a reference paper, or set of search terms, to be able to read more about it if possible.
