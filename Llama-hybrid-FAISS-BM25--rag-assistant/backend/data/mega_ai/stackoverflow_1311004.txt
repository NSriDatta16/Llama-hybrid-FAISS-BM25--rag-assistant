This is the problem that ODBC was supposed to solve :-) . But in response to your questions: Is it an idea that cannot be implemented? It can be implemented. It would be tedious and thankless work, and you would have a very limited audiance. In my opinion it's not worth doing. Are there any such applications? None that I know of. If so what are they? None that I know of. ...... Bringing in Chandrasekar's note in the comments section: Have a look in a super user's perspective... He has a nice application but he can't use it without some DBMS. But still he is not a programmer to do something. So they need such a product I agree it has applications, but it has a very limited audiance :) . What you're proposing is something like the firefox plugin 'ietab', Only you won't have ie installed... so instead of embedding ie, you would need to entirely re-implement ie using firefox's rendering window. Just my opinion : that's too much effort... It's simpler to just install a second database.
