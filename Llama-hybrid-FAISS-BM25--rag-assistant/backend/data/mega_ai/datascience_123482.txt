In general, the filters of a convolutional network are NEVER designed, they are trained. Of course, there can be research lines that study the inclusion of hand-designed filters in CNNs, but in the real-world that is not a thing. The article you mention has zero citations, implying that its methods are not something other people in the field use. In signal processing, you might want to apply a hand-designed convolution to a signal to apply a specific effect (e.g. smoothing). These can be derived by: logic, intuition and trial-error. heuristics (e.g. make the sum of the elements zero, so that no response is gained from a uniform background). Here you can find some examples. approximations of mathematical expressions, like probability functions. Here you can find examples. In neural networks, the focus is on a specific task, so you optimize the filters to improve the performance at the task.
