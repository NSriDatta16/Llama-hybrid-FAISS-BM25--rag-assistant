The most direct way is to bind the background value in your gridview's template to a method in the code behind that takes the two fields you care about as parameters and switches on these values returning the appropriate color string. This is not the most elegant method I would think there is likely some natural grouping mechanisms built into gridview I may be unawares of, but this is simple to implement and use for a single case. Look at something more natural if you're a stickler or are going to implement this in many places.
