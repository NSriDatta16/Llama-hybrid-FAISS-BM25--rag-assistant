First of all, I do not think you need a DNN if task is as simple as you are describing it. There will be lot of digital image processing solutions or maybe check opencv-python (cv2). But, if you are particularly interested in DNN, I would suggest starting with Keras. According to me it should not be too tough to perform this task as CNN can do complex jobs than this one. On the data arrangement part, you may have multiple pictures of various states of your device and annotate data manually. A working system can take pictures at some interval and detect the state. I hope this helps :)
