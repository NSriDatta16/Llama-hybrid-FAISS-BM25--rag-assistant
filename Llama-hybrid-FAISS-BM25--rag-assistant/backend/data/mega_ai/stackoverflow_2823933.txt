Think about the failure modes: With the upper bound, either your package builds or cabal bleats about an unsatisfied build dependency. Blame is clearly assigned. Without the upper bound, customer has a recent version of transformers and it's not backwards compatible. Your software fails to build; GHC bleats about how your code doesn't compile. Your software looks shoddy. Put in the upper bound.
