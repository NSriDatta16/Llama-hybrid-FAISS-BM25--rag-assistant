Count data on proportion or different kind of type?

I really do not know which kind of variable my response data is. I cannot find any answer to my question in the world wide web. I have the results from a survey of 900 consumer. Each consumer told on how many mÂ² he used one cleaning agent. So the result can be maybe 0.11 = They used a cleaning agent on 11% of their house or 1= Use on 100% of house. I guess its count data on proportion, but I am not sure, because i did not find any similar example. The distribution of the data is shown below (there are also many farmers who used on 0% of their fields a pesticide: I need to know it, because i try to do an analysis of my data with a Generalized linear model in R (with poisson,binomial or gamma errors). It is necessary to know if it is count data on proportion or something else. What would you guess is it continuous data or count data on proportion or something else?
