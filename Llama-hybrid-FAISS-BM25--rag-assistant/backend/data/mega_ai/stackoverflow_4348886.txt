Php design patterns

Ok, i'd like to firstly make you notice that i have looked for "php mvc design patterns" and so and i haven't really found what i was looking for; still now, writing my question, i cannot find any related and so specific question as i am going to ask. But i know i'm probably wrong, anyway consider this question and a question pack that could be usefull togheter. Question I was wondering how we should consider the design patterns. I mean: What are they? Are they simply binaries that help us designing consistent application? Are they so used? Why? Where could i find a list about every design patterns on the web? Or at least the 5-10 most used design patterns? Do Phpbb, Wordpress or Joomla (that i know pretty well) use a design pattern? If yes, which? I googled MCV PHP and found about 3 italian articles and read about 5 of the first pages ranked and i didn't understand pretty much nothing. They were conflicting and seemed to me confusing. I did understand that it is usefull to separate business login, script and view (?) but i didn't got anything else. I am probably stupid or something but where could i find a nice and official (means written by the Gang of Four or someone who actually know what he is talking about) mvc tutorial or documentation related to php? Are there simple examples about design patterns and how they are better then (normal) writing styles? Are there simple examples about a mvc or other design pattern? For example a simple blog written with a design pattern? Tips I'd prefer free solution first. I don't like frameworks, so please don't refer to them even if (i know) they have mvc and other valid design patterns and benefits. I still don't like them. Thanks Notice I'll choose my accepted answer after tomorrow, so, please, take your time to answer.
