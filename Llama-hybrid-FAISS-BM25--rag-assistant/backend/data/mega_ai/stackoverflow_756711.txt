Problem with Count Statement for Multiple Databases

Sorry everyone. It appears that I am a dumbass! The query works fine when I run it against the live database versus my test database...gotta pay more attention to that stuff! I am having a problem with the statement shown below. It works fine if I run it against one database (sans the DBCATALOG.dbo), so no problem there. When I try running the statement as is, I get an incorrect syntax near â€˜ SELECT CNT=COUNT(*) FROM .[dbo].[LinkedDocumentFolderTable] WHERE IsUnmanagedFolder = 1 SELECT 'TF7-User-Demo-ScheduledRestore-03' AS DBCatalog, * FROM(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [TF7-User-Demo-ScheduledRestore-03].[dbo].[LinkedDocumentFolderTable] WHERE IsUnmanagedFolder = 1)rsOne UNION ALL SELECT 'TF7-TestDatabase-ScheduledRestore' AS DBCatalog, * FROM(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [TF7-TestDatabase-ScheduledRestore].[dbo].[LinkedDocumentFolderTable] WHERE IsUnmanagedFolder = 1)rsOne
