First, please format your code. Second, what do you mean that your code is executing before the response? If it's dependent on the return of the $.ajax call, simply include that function in the success continuation. Ah, I think I see your problem - Try this: var itemcount = Alladd.returnAddressList.length; if (itemcount > 0) { for (i = 0; i Alladd.returnAddressList[i].City + "," + Alladd.returnAddressList[i].State + "," + Alladd.returnAddressList[i].Country }, function (results, status) { if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) { var marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position: results[0].geometry.location, draggable: true, icon: markerImage }); markers.push(marker); if(i == itemcount-1) { var zoom = parseInt(-1, 10); var size = parseInt(-1, 10); var style = parseInt(-1, 10); zoom = zoom == -1 ? null : zoom; size = size == -1 ? null : size; style = style == -1 ? null : style; markerClusterer = new MarkerClusterer(map, markers, { maxZoom: zoom, gridSize: size, styles: styles[style] }); } } }); } } The problem that you're running into is that you're not waiting for all of the async calls to return before running your script. This change ensures that you're on the final expected response before going ahead. Having said that, you might want to introduce some error checking - what happens if a response isn't returned or you get an error code? Those cases should all be checked.
