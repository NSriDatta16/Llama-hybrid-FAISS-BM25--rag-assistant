Meaning of Surrogate Split

I tried to figure but couldn't on what happens when missing values are present in some predictor variable and we have to solve the problem of regression using Random Forest. What is the meaning of surrogate split to handle that? It will be good if a snapshot of the working of algorithm in that part of missing data could be shown.
