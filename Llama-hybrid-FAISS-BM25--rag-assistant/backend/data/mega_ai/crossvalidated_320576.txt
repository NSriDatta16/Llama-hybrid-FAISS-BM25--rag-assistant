Most relevant categories in categorical variables for Random Forest models (or for general black box models)

Suppose I want to predict if a person is committing fraud and I only have his/her age and city , where age of course is a continuous variable and city a categorical one. I'd like to have an idea of what ages or cities of residence are predictive of a high probability of fraud. With age I could do a a partial plot (see partialPlot for an implementation) to see how the response variable or the probability of fraud changes with different age values. However, with the variable city , I'm not sure what to do. I'd like to have a list of, say, the 10 cities that cause a biggest change in probability of fraud. Bonus points if there's a library that addresses this. Thanks for your time! ----- EDIT ------ I've read some of the literature on marginal effects for non-linear models (see this summary . They distinguish between: Marginal effects at representative values (say, at the median of the other variables) Average Marginal effects (discretize the support, calculate the effect of a city and then average those effects)
