Restore Eclipse subversion project connection

I have a project in subversion, which I'm developing using Eclipse. I did the original checkout from the svn repository from inside Eclipse. All was well for some weeks then for some unknown reason, Eclipse (specifically: subclipse in Ganymede) no longer recognizes my project as being under svn control. The team context-menu only shows the basic "apply patch" / "share this project" menu options. From the shell, I can still update the project using the svn command line tools, so I know that the svn credentials still work. Other projects under subversion in the same copy of Eclipse still work. I realise that I can delete the local copy and check it out again, but I'd rather understand what has gone wrong - fix the problem, rather than mask the symptoms. Where does Eclipse store its knowledge of which projects are under version control? I looked at the .project file and the .settings directory, but couldn't see any obvious mention of svn nature or anything similar, even in the projects that are still working properly.
