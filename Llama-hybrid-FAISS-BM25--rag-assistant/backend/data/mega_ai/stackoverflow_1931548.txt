Which version of Eclipse are you trying this with? If you are using 3.4 (Ganymede) or 3.5 (Galileo), you can't just add new plugins to the plugins folder anymore. Try putting your plugin into the dropins folder instead (that is the intention of the dropins folder). When your plugin is ready for a more permanent deployment, you can export it with P2 metadata and use the update manager to start it up. If you're using an older version of Eclipse, the .log file will probably give you some details about the plugin.
