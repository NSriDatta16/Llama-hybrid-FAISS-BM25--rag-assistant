Bootstrap, Monte Carlo

I have been set the following question as part of homework: Design and implement a simulation study to examine the performance of the bootstrap for obtaining 95% confidence intervals on the mean of a univariate sample of data. Your implementation can be in R or SAS. Aspects of performance you may want to look at are confidence interval coverage (i.e., what proportion of times the confidence interval contains the true mean) and Monte Carlo variation (i.e., how much do the upper and lower confidence limits vary between simulations)' Does anyone know how to go about the Monte Carlo variation aspect of this? I can't seem to even work out an algorithm or anything. Is it to do with Monte Carlo integration? Thanks!
