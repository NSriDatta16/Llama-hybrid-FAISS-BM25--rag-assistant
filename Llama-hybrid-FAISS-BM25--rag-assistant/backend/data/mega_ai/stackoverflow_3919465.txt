It's a difference in implementation. InnoDB supports transactions and therefore it has to count the rows based on your transactionally consistent view of the table(s). Since MyISAM doesn't support ACID properties, if a row is inserted, it's inserted for everyone and therefore it can just update a count it keeps within the storage engine.
