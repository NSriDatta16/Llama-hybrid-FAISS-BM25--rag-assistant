The XML sitemap helps search engine spider to indexing of all web pages of your site. The sitemap is very usefull if you publish frequently many pages, but does not replace the correct system of linking of the site: all documents must be linke from an other related page. Your site is very large, you must attention at the number of URLs published in the Sitemap because there are the limit of 50.000 URLs for each XML file. The full documentation is available at Sitemaps.org
