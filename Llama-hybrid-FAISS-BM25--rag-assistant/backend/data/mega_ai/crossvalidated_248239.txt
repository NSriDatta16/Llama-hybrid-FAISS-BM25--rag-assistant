What is meant by "random vectors" in Random forest ?

In the beginning of https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf , it is explained that: The common element in all of these procedures is that for the kth tree, a random vector Θk is generated, independent of the past random vectors Θ1, ... ,Θk−1 but with the same distribution; One way that I understand random forests is, you have some data say of dimensions $N x P$, so now you grow some $Q$ amount of decisions trees which will be used as classifiers, and each tree will get a random subset of the data. However, in the paper there are two inputs to the trees, the data $x$ and a random vector. What is this random vector? Is it just a column array of randomly generated numbers, that adheres to the constraints of independence from the other random vectors ?
