What data mining methods can I use for a large (800x100000) matrix that don't require a super computer?

What data mining methods can I use for a large (800x100000) matrix that don't require a super computer? Because upon trying to do data mining on such data set, even basic PCA in sklearn runs into Memory Error (and I have up to 20GB I think). How can I do data mining on such large data sets on a home computer? In this case my data is binary.
