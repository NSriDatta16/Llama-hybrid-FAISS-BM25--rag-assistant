Expected Number of Dishes in Indian Buffet Process?

I'm sure this question has an answer somewhere online, but I can't find it. Suppose I have an Indian Buffet Process with $T$ customers and concentration parameter $\alpha$ . For those unfamiliar with the IBP, the IBP is a Bayesian nonparametric model defining a distribution over binary matrices $Z$ with $T$ rows (customers) and an infinite number of columns (dishes). Let $z_{t, k}$ denote the $t$ th row and $k$ th column of $Z$ , and let $\Lambda_t$ denote the number of non-empty columns of $Z$ after the $t$ th customer has sampled their dishes. The IBP gives the following sequential sampling process: The first customer samples $\lambda_1 \sim Poisson(\alpha/1)$ new "dishes". We set the first $\lambda_1$ entries in the first row of $Z$ to 1 i.e. $z_{1, k} = 1$ for $k \in [1, \lambda_t]$ Each subsequent customer does three things: Samples dishes proportional to the number of previous customers who sampled that dish: $$\forall k \leq \Lambda_t, \quad p(z_{t, k} \lvert z_{ Samples $\lambda_t \sim Poisson(\alpha/t)$ new dishes. We set $z_{t, k} = 1$ for $k \in [\Lambda_{t-1}+1, \Lambda_{t-1} + \lambda_t]$ Add the number of new dishes to the previous number of total dishes i.e. $\Lambda_t \leftarrow \Lambda_{t-1} + \lambda_t$ My question: what is the expected number of non-empty columns (or equivalently, the expected number of sampled dishes) $\Lambda_t$ ?
