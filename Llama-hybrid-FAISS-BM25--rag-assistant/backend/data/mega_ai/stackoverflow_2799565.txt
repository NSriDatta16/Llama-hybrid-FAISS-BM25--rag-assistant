Determining Best Table Structure for MySQL Performance

I'm working on a browser-based RPG for one of my websites, and right now I'm trying to determine the best way to organize my SQL tables for performance and maintenance. Here's my question: Does the number of columns in an SQL table affect the speed in which it can be queried? I am not a newbie when it comes to PHP or MySQL. I used to develop things with the common goal of getting them to work, but I've recently advanced to the stage where a functional program is not good enough unless it's fast and reliable. Anyways, right now I have a members table that has around 15 columns. It contains information such as the player's username, password, email, logins, page views, etcetera. It doesn't contain any information on the player's progress in the game, however. If I added columns for things such as army size, gold, turns, and whatnot, then it could easily rise to around 40 or 50 total columns. Oh, and my database structure IS normalized. Will a table with 50 columns that gets constantly queried be a bad idea? Should I split it into two tables; one for the user's general information and one for the user's game statistics? I know I could check the query time myself, but I haven't actually created the tables yet and I think I'd be better off with some professional advice on this important decision for my game. Thank you for your time! :)
