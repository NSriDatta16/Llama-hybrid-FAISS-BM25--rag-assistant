Interpret reuslts of PLS regression coefficients

I have performed PLS regression using sklearn library (python 2.7) over three types of soil (PLS model per soil type) and I plotted the regression coefficients, but in the most right plot in the picture, the bars seem a bit bizarre, where one band is positive and the next is negative. Does it mean something? or this is a valid result? (the black curve is an average spectrum, you can ignore it)
