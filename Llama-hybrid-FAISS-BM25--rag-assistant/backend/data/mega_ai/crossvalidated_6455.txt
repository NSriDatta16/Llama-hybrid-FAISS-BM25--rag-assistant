How many lags to use in the Ljung-Box test of a time series?

After an ARMA model is fit to a time series, it is common to check the residuals via the Ljung-Box portmanteau test (among other tests). The Ljung-Box test returns a p value. It has a parameter, h , which is the number of lags to be tested. Some texts recommend using h =20; others recommend using h =ln(n); most do not say what h to use. Rather than using a single value for h , suppose that I do the Ljung-Box test for all h h which gives the minimum p value. Is that approach reasonable? What are the advantages and disadvantages? (One obvious disadvantage is increased computation time, but that is not a problem here.) Is there literature on this? To elaborate slightly.... If the test gives p>0.05 for all h , then obviously the time series (residuals) pass the test. My question concerns how to interpret the test if p h and not for other values.
