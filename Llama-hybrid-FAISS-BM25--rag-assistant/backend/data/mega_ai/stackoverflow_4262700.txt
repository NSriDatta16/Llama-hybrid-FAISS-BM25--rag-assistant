Should I use Windows Management Service or Remote Agent Service to publish to a remote server?

I have a remote web server that I have full administrator access over, and I want to deploy a website. When I use Visual Studio's Publish tool, among other things which seem a bit less convenient (FTP etc), I have the option of using either Windows Management Service or Remote Agent Service. All the documentation says is this: To publish remotely through Remote Agent Service, use http://RemoteComputerName . This option is typically used to deploy a Web application inside a network (in an intranet scenario). You must have appropriate permissions to perform the deployment on the destination server. To publish to a hosting site using Windows Management Service, use the value that is specified by the hosting provider. You can typically use just a server name (HostedRemoteServer) or a complete URL that includes a server name, a port number, and the Web Deploy handler name ( https://HostedRemoteServer:8172/MsDeploy.axd ). The hosting provider can tell you the name of the server and the port number, if applicable. This isn't enough information for me to decide, though. Yeah, I'm not publishing over a network, but I do have full access over the machine I'm deploying to. At the same time, MsDeploy is the big fancy thing that Scott Hanselman describes in his talk and that I've been convinced as being the awesome way to deploy. So which should I do? Are there any obscure security considerations or anything?
