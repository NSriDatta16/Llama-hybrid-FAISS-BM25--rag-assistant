What is the best approach to transform independent variables that have a bimodal relationship with the dependent variable?

I am building a logistic regression model with a binary rating (High and Low) as the dependent variable and 40+ independent variables. One of the independent variable (Age) has a non-linear relationship (bimodal shape) with the dependent. What is the best approach / transformation to deal with this? Are splines the best method? I feel splines make the model too complicated and hard to interpret especially if interactions are also included.
