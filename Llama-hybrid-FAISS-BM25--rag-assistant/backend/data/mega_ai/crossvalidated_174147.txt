Note: This answer has been edited following a helpful comment from usÎµr11852 For a 2x2 confusion matrix, the accuracy is typically defined as: $$ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+FN+TN} $$ While the g-mean is defined as (see, e.g., Espindola & Ebecken 2005) $$ g_{PR} = \sqrt{\text{Precision}\times\text{Recall}} $$ or $$ g_{SS} = \sqrt{\text{Sensitivity}\times\text{Specificity}} $$ Where $\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ , $\text{Recall} = \text{Sensitivity} = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$ , and $\text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN+FP}$ . These two definitions give different results so it is important to be clear which is being used. Note that $g_{PR}$ and $g_{SS}$ are my notations for this answer and not commonly used notation. $$ \begin{align} g_{PR} &= \frac{TP}{\sqrt{(TP+FP)(TP+FN)}} \\ g_{SS} &= \frac{\sqrt{TP\times TN}}{\sqrt{(TP+FN)(TN+FP)}} \end{align} $$ Notice that TN features in the formulae for accuracy and $g_{SS}$ but not for $g_{PR}$ . Accuracy is a bad measure, because a test/model can be quite bad but appear to have good accuracy if there are lots of TNs, and why it's meaningless in some situations, e.g., information retrieval (where TNs are of no interest and are even difficult to define). Here are some examples where accuracy is less than $g_{PR}$ and/or $g_{SS}$ : +----+----+----+-----+-------+-------+-------+ | TP | FP | FN | TN | Acc. | g_PR | g_SS | +----+----+----+-----+-------+-------+-------+ | 31 | 0 | 6 | 19 | 0.893 | 0.915 | 0.915 | | 56 | 16 | 3 | 5 | 0.762 | 0.859 | 0.475 | | 10 | 1 | 6 | 12 | 0.759 | 0.754 | 0.760 | | 58 | 1 | 0 | 103 | 0.994 | 0.991 | 0.995 | +----+----+----+-----+-------+-------+-------+ So, in answer to your question, it is entirely plausible for accuracy to be lower than g-mean, but it is worth making sure which g-mean is being used.
