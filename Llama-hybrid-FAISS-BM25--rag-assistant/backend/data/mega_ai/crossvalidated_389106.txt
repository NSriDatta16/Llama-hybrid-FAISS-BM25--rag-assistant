What is the maximum number of features in Logistic Regression Problem

I was doing Text classification(binary) hosted on kaggle with approx 1.3 millions observations. My approach is to use Logistic Regression after computing the TF-IDF matrix with n-grams = 1:3. With this approach the number of feature is going to sky rocket. Is there any limit to the number of features that can be used in the logistic regression?
