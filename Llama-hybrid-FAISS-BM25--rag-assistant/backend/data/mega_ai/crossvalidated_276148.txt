1) They can! The problem is that if the functional form of the relationship between the covariates and the outcome is not exactly as you specify in the regression/ANCOVA, then you arrive at a biased and inconsistent estimate of the treatment effect. This matter is discussed in many articles, but the key articles for this are Schafer & Kang (2008) and Ho, Imai, King, & Stuart (2007). Another issue (mentioned in Schafer & Kang) is that if there is effect modification (the effect of treatment differs across levels of a covariate), but you only care about a marginal treatment effect (i.e., over an entire population receiving a policy change), then the effect cannot be estimated with regression (i.e., because if you include an interaction term with treatment, then the base treatment coefficient will not equal the causal effect). 2) Other approaches include inverse probability weighting, stratification, and other non-propensity-score-based matching techniques. Inverse probability weighting uses propensity scores to compute weights which are applied to your data set to create a pseudosample in which the covariates are balanced; the weights are then used in WLS regression to get a treatment effect. Stratification by the propensity score involves estimating a propensity score and creating strata based on quantiles of the propensity score. Under ideal conditions, there will be covariate balance within each stratum, and you can compute and then average stratum-specific causal effects to arrive at an average effect estimate. There are also other matching methods that don't involve propensity scores: Mahalanobis distance matching, genetic matching, and coarsened exact matching come to mind. 3) There is a technique called marginal structure models (MSM) with time-varying treatments that might be of use. Essentially, you have three timepoints: at t1, people are "assigned" to being a drinker or not; at t2, people are "assigned" to being in treatment or not, and this assignment depends on treatment assignment at t1. Finally there is the outcome. Using MSM, you can estimate counterfactual means for the outcome for a given treatment "history". You are probably interested in all four combinations resulting from a complete cross of drinking and treatment. Then you can compare those means however you like to arrive at the effect of interest. For example, for the effect of treatment in those who are drinkers, you could calculate the difference in the means between the those who received treatment history (drinker, treatment) and those who received treatment history (drink, control).
