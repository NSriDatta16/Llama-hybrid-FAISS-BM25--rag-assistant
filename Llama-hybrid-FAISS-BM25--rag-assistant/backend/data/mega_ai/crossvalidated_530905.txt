I'm not sure if there is strict definition of the branches of machine learning, (e.g. is deep learning a branch) but if we consider [semi-]supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning as major approaches, I think the most important distinction is the problem formulation, i.e. what is to be learnt. Patterns learnt might be the same, similar or different based on this definition.
