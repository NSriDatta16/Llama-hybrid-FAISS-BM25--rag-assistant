Personally I think all the answers here are overcomplicating things. Here's my take: Use whichever technology excites you, and is best for what you want to build right now. If the app you want to build right now feels perfect for Flex, use Flex. If something about HTML5 has caught your fancy and won't let go, dive into it. You can always change technologies in a year or three, and You'll be taking everything you've learned about design and architecture and usability with you - learning a new scripting language and some new tools won't be that bad. The only way you can make the "wrong" choice here is if you, for whatever reason, pick a technology that you wind up not enjoying enough to get anything built . The reason I feel this is the best way is, nobody here can tell you anything useful about what technologies will or won't be around in a few years' time. Adobe could go bankrupt; Steve Jobs could die; Google could get broken up in an antitrust suit. Hell, Flash could be on the iPhone next year for all we know - or HTML6 could adopt a new, strongly-typed JITable programming language. Or a hundred other things could happen to render your (and our) predictions moot. I mean, personally I expect that both Flash and HTML5/6/7 will be vibrant and flourishing in five or ten years - because they both have successful organizations behind them investing in their futures, and because I've never heard a whit of a meaningful argument why the success of one should require the failure of the other. But that's just a guess, and my guess is no better than yours. Focus on getting good stuff made now, and the technology road map of the future will come when it comes.
