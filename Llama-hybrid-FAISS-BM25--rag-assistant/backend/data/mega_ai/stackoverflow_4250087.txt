I'll be honest, I didn't thoroughly read the responses. But I'm guessing it's a lot of "no python in your templates" and "your view shouldn't have much logic" type stuff. If you put idealism aside and opt for pragmatism then I think Mako is a fine choice. I'm using it in a production capacity (mainly for speed, power and dynamic inheritance) for 3+ years now. It hasn't failed or been otherwise annoying in any way. The idealists are correct, but sometimes you have to go for what's doable vs what's right. If you are not limited by the Django templating engine use it. If you need more power, Mako and Jinja are fine choices. Django makes it very easy to swap out templating engines and keep most things working as before: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/api/#using-an-alternative-template-language
