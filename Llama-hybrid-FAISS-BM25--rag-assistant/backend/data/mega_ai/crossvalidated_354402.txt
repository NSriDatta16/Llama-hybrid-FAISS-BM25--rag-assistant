A visual interpretation using repeated kfolds To give a visual / intuitive interpretation to @Matthew Drury's answer consider the following toy example. Data is generated from noisy sine curve: "True $f(x) \ +$ noise" The data is split between training and testing samples (75% - 25%) A linear (polynomial) model is fitted to the training data: $\hat f(x)$ The process is repeated many times using the same data (i.e. splitting training - testing randomly using Sklearm repeated kfold) This generates many different models, from which we compute the mean and the variance at each point $x=x_i$ as well as over all points. See below for the resulting graphs for a polynomial model of degree 2 and degree 6. At first sight, it seems that the higher polynomial (in red) has greater variance. Arguing that the red graph has greater variance - experimentally Let $\hat f_g$ and $\hat f_r$ correspond to the green and red graphs respectively and $\hat f^{(i)}$ be one instance of the graphs, in light green and light red. Let $n$ be the number of points along the $x$ axis and $m$ be the number of graphs (i.e. the number of simulations). Here we have $n = 400$ and $m = 200$ I see three main scenarios The variance of the predicted values at one specific point $x = x_0$ is greater i.e. $ Var \ \left[ \{\hat f^{(1)}_r(x_0), ..., \hat f^{(m)}_r(x_0)\} \right] > Var \ \left[ \{\hat f^{(1)}_g(x_0),...,\hat f^{(i)}_g(x_0)\} \right]$ The variance in $(1)$ is greater for all points $\{ x_1,...,x_{400} \}$ in the range $(0,1)$ The variance is greater on average (i.e. may be smaller for some points) In the case of this toy example, all three scenarios hold true over the range $(0,1)$ which justifies the argument that the higher order polynomial fit (in red) has higher variance than the lower order polynomial (in green). An open ended conclusion What should be argued when the above three scenarios do not all hold. For example, what if the variance of the red predictions is greater on average, but not for all points. Details of the labels Consider point $x_0 = 0.5$ The error bar is the range between min and max of $\hat f(x_0)$ The variance is computed at $x_0$ True $f(x)$ is the dotted blue line
