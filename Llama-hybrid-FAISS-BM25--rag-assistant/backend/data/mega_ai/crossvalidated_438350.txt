The goal of a 95% confidence interval for a parameter, is that if you repeated your data collection infinite times, 95% of the time your confidence interval would contain the true parameter. As you've found out, there are several theoretical ways you could formulate a confidence interval. Ultimately, someone got a PhD somewhere for running millions of computer simulations generating data with a known parameter and working out the proportion of times that formula got it "right" (the true parameter was contained in the interval). This is called the coverage probability. I think your mean + sem actually needs a mean +/- z sem because I think this is the so-called Normal approximation method. $\hat{p} \pm z \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}$ where for a 95% confidence interval you would use a z value of $1.96$ . There are many alternatives to this, such as the Wilson Score interval, the Agresti Coull interval. You can even use an arcsin transformation which fixes the problem of the Normal approximation occasionally giving you intervals which are smaller than $0$ or bigger than $1$ . You could find a comparison of methods in places like this . My recollection is that the Wilson Score interval is regarded as the "best" and by best I mean it is most likely to give you a 95% CI that has a coverage close to 95% in most scenarios.
