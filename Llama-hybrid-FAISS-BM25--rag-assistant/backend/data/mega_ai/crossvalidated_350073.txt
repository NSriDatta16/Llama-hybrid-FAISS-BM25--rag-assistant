A concrete example is easier to follow. Let us say the dependent variable is average score in math. When an interaction term exists between two binary variables, its coefficient means the the mean added (math score) for a student who is both male and has an active class, above and beyond just being male and just having an active class. So, if I understand your description, in which all coefficients except the interaction are zero, it means that being male has no significant difference (in math score) than being female, and that having an active class has no significant difference (on math score) than having a passive class, but that being male AND having an active class does have a difference (I guess significant, but it wasn't clear to me) on the dependent variable (math score). Afterthought - if you can post the regression output, this can be much more specific an answer.
