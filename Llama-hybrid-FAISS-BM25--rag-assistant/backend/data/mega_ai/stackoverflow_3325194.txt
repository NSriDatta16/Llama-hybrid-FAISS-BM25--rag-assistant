What's the best way to add jQuery enhancements to a website?

For a while now, I'm been using jQuery to offer enhancements via JavaScript on my websites. However, I'm now beginning to ponder—from a performance point of view—what is the best way to organise my file of functions? Up until now, I've done something similar to the following: $(document).ready(function() { foo(); bar(); }); function foo() { // do something here }; function bar() { // do something else here, and so on... }; However, I've since seen JavaScript file layouts like this: $(document).ready(function() { $(selector).foo(); $(selector).bar(); }); $.fn.foo = function() { $(this).each(function() { // do something here and return }); }; $.fn.bar = function() { $(this).each(function() { // do something here and return }); }; Is it better practice to extend jQuery and assign methods to a selector as in the second example? Or is it still OK to define individual functions as the first example?
