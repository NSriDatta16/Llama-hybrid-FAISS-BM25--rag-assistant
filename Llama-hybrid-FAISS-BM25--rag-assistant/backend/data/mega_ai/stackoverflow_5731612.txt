need help implementing InnoDB storage engine to existing database

I am trying to add primary keys to my tables, via Sequel Pro and it said "This table currently does not support relations. Only tables that use the InnoDB storage engine support them." I went into phpMyAdmin and looked at the storage engines and saw InnoDB listed, highlighted in blue, then I selected it and it displayed this info: http://cl.ly/68Ph It is enabled, but I am unsure how to implement it to my existing database, any help is appreciated.
