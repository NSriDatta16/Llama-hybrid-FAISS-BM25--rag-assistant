Bayesian use of previous experiments

Assume I have two studies, say $\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\mathcal{S}_2$ , with respective datasets $\mathcal{D}_1, \mathcal{D}_2$ , parameters $\theta^{(1)}, \theta^{(2)}$ and response variables $y, z$ . I have the following questions: If I am interested in using the response $y$ from the first study as a covariate in the second study, which is a recommended way in which I could proceed? Would it make sense to have a Normal approximation to the posterior predictive and calculate the mean and variance and use this as a prior for the parameter related to the covariate $y$ , say $\theta_y^{(2)}$ , in the second study? The main issue that I have with this is that the posterior distribution that I have does not seem Normal. Moreover, assume that $\mathcal{D}_2$ has a set of covariates that appear in $\mathcal{D}_1$ . Which is the recommended way to proceed if I would like to include the posterior information about the subset of $\theta^{(1)}$ in the second study $\mathcal{S}_2$ ?
