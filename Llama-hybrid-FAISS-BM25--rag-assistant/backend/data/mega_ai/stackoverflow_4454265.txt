Unfortunately, when I run it in terminal and assign the directory path by typing or dragging a folder in from the dock nothing happens. I have tried this by, as you said, dragging the folder to my terminal (I am on Linux) and it displays the path surrounded with quotes. Remove the quotes after your raw_input should fix your problem import os directory = raw_input("See contents of: ") directory = directory.strip() if directory[0] == "'" and directory[-1] == "'": directory = directory[1:-1] print directory for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory): print root, dirs, files
