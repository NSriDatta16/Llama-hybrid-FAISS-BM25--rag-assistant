Why is the BEST algorithm so slow for modeling the difference in means of two vectors?

I'm using the BEST package in R as a proxy for the frequentist t-test to measure the difference in means between two groups. However this process is VERY slow, and will simply not converge for the tests that I am trying to run. Is there another method that can work for this? I'm mainly looking for a Bayesian equivalent to a standard t-test.
