Why Epochs take longer as learning proceeds?

I am training a deep learning model in Tensorflow on GPU (Amazon AWS) and what I observe is that in the beginning each epoch takes only less than a second but let's say after 80 epochs one epoch takes more than 8 minutes . What could be a possible reason?
