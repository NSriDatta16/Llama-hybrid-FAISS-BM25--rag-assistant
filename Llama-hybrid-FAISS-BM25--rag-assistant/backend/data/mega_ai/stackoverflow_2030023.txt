How to databind Enum value to a Boolean value?

So I have a main form with 3 controls whose Enable property I want to control using an enum. All these controls have a reference to the Data that contains the Enum value Level. enum Level { Red, Yellow, Green } So if it's Red , I want the RedControl to become enabled, if it's yellow , then YellowControl becomes enabled, etc. How do I best do this with minimal code and elegance? I tried having 3 properties like IsRed , IsYellow , etc on the Data to hook them up. But then I didn't know a way to detect the change of Level from those properties.
