Bayesian Belief Network - directions of arcs between nodes

I generated a BBN below based on environmental variables and a response of some organism. My aim here is to see how environmental variables (A-H in a graph above) interact with each other and influence organisms (phenotypic response). The sensitivity of "organism" is as follows: Sensitivity of 'organism' to a finding at another node: Node Variance Percent Variance of ---- Reduction Beliefs Target 0.00393 100 0.2004898 A 0.003929 100 0.2004673 B 0.001801 45.8 0.0919060 C 0.001537 39.1 0.0783964 D 0.001203 30.6 0.0613732 E 0.001027 26.1 0.0523963 F 0.0009696 24.7 0.0494689 G 0.0009023 23 0.0460363 H 0.0007741 19.7 0.0394967 All good except a direction of arc between A and B. The direction is actually counter-intuitive. But when I reverse the direction, the sensitivity drops. Is it feasible to say B potentially influence "organism" through interaction with A? Based on this model, is it ok to say B influences A? But how can I explain the direction of arc between A and B? My guess is that a probability of A can be best predicted by a combination of E, F and G, but not with B, and information on A helps predict a probability of B. So the direction between A and B is not necessarily mean that A affects B (i.e. B would affect A and also indirectly affect organism).
