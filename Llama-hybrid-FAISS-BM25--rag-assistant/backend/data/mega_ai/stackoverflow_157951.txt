I think it's better to deal with the "real" objects as much as possible. Introducing "mock" (in this case it is not the exact term, though) objects can help only if handling the test data set is unfeasible. I don't think that putting a test file in your version control system is a big deal, so better go with it rather than writing lots of code which may lead to other bugs and testing. Use a PDF very close to the expected average file, too.
