How have you got your cpp files organised? If they are organised into projects then building a project will only compile those cpp files that have changed since the last build. Visual Studio works this out by checking the time stamp on the cpp file and comparing against that on the output intermediate file (not the exe). So once you've built everything once VS should only build what's been modified. Make sure you're using "build" not "rebuild" and with C++ if you modify a header file then all the cpp files using that header will have to be built too.
