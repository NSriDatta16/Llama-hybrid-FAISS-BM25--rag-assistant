Confirm replacement in JavaScript

Yes, I've searched high and low on Stack Overflow and seen some great solutions to this problem that's been solved time and time again with things like SimpleModal, jQuery.confirm and the like. Problem is, I am developing for this low level device that doesn't allow for a JS framework to be utilized AND I am having to shoehorn this modal confirm into existing JS. There is an existing script that I am at liberty to edit (but not rewrite) that does a few things like validate, concatenate a few inputs into a single variable, and more. The script was written to: Take some session variables and assign new variable names to them and format accordingly Present a confirm to the user to see whether they want to use those variables to pre-populate the form on the page Get some functions ready to validate inputs. other stuff, like offer an abandonment scenario, among other things Now, all was good when the "confirm" was in place as the script would pause until an OK or Cancel was provided. I am now presenting a modal on the page that I want to mock this behavior and the only way I can think of doing it is to remove that reliance on the line that goes through the confirm thing and NOT run the script until the user interacts with the modal. Does anyone have an idea how to take what's in place and "wrap" it in a "listening" if/else scenario for each of the YES or NO possibilities? Sorry if this is jumbled... my brain is all blended up at the moment, too.
