Weird AJAX/JS bug in ASP.NET and Infragistics NetAdvantage

I have a quite simple data capture web app. In the main capture window, when you save a row in a UltraWebGrid, depending on certain flags two more windows open (with a ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript). One of the windows, works perfectly fine. The other one, when it gets closed (by means of its own ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript) causes the next error in Firefox IN THE MAIN WINDOW: Sys is not defined Sys$CultureInfo$_getAbbrMonthIndex("")ScriptRe...=7c12e347 (line 6391) ? in ScriptResource.axd?d=Bx90cRohr9iY-lmxXmy5QYd7JgQApS0Xh-xBfl6hEe8d-0h4pCZYQQKgxdo97mKzaD5488jiBZ8TOSa4-cOPaw2&t=4e25e479@1()ScriptRe...=4e25e479 (line 499) [Break on this error] this._upperAbbrMonths = this...s.dateTimeFormat.AbbreviatedMonthNames); And after this, Firefox goes crazy, tab navigation stops working, every text input in the window (including the address bar, and the search box) draw their contents as if they are selected (all at the same time) and things stop behaving quite strange. I have to close the window and reopen it, sometimes I even have to kill the process. I've tried many things, and nothing seems to work. I compare the two aspx files in the aforementioned windows and nothing is really that different. This is GETTING ME FREAKING CRAZY. Anyone have had this error before? Any ideas? Hacks? Pointers? Thank you very much.
