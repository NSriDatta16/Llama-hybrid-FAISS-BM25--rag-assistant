Matching a partial string with a regular expression

I'm trying to parse a fragment of a stacktrace, which looks pretty much like this: at Test.Test1() in C:\Projects\Project\Test.cs:line 37 Using a regex like this works as intended: at (.*?) in (.*?):line (\d*) This matches Test.Test1() C:\Projects\Project\Test.cs 37 This regex is hardcoded to an english stacktrace, so there are obviously no matches if the stacktrace is in another language, such as swedish: vid Test.Test1() i C:\Projects\Project\Test.cs:rad 37 To make the matching more language neutral I tried this regex out: (.*?) .*? (.*?) (\d*) This matches Test.Test1() C:\Projects\Project\Test.cs:line 37 The question is how would I match the file path without the trailing :line?
