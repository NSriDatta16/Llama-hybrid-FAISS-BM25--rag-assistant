Using the Google Analytics Export API to get a websites trend

i am working on an application that uses the Google Analytics Export API and i am trying to get the "Trend" result that Google shows against each of your site accounts as a percentage ie UP 35.04% or DOWN 16.02% How/where do they get this figure and is it available in the API somewhere. i have tried comparing averages of last month to this month/first week of the period vs last week of the period etc, but i cannot seem to get the same numbers that Google provides. any ideas? thanks in advance Doug
