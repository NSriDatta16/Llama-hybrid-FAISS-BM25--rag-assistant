How important is the context that is implied by a namespace?

Ok, the title might sound a bit vague but I really can't think of something clearer here. I recently was in the position where I needed a Point class, simply with two properties, X and Y and a ctor Point(int x, int y) . Nothing fancy. Now this thing already exists in .NET, but this was in a library that handled certain objects on a map and dragging System.Drawing into this just felt ... wrong somehow. Even though System.Drawing.Point fit what I needed perfectly, I now created that struct myself again in that project. Now I wonder whether that was a right or sensible thing to do. System.Drawing.Point would have come with a reference to that assembly as well, if I remember correctly. And putting something in System.Drawing into a totally non-drawing related context was somehow weird. Thoughts? What if it wouldn't have implied a reference to another assembly?
