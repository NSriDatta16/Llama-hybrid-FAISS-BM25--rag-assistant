Split string in C every white space

I want to write a program in C that displays each word of a whole sentence (taken as input) at a seperate line. This is what I have done so far: void manipulate(char *buffer); int get_words(char *buffer); int main(){ char buff[100]; printf("sizeof %d\nstrlen %d\n", sizeof(buff), strlen(buff)); // Debugging reasons bzero(buff, sizeof(buff)); printf("Give me the text:\n"); fgets(buff, sizeof(buff), stdin); manipulate(buff); return 0; } int get_words(char *buffer){ // Function that gets the word count, by counting the spaces. int count; int wordcount = 0; char ch; for (count = 0; count Although the output is what I want, I have really many black spaces after the final word displayed, and the malloc() returns NULL so the MALLOC ERROR! is displayed in the end. I can understand that there is a mistake at my malloc() implementation, but I do not know what it is. Is there another more elegant or generally better way to do it?
