Pearson's r over time

I have a Pearson's r for the same variables for 4 different periods of time. (4 different years). How can I find the Pearson's r for all of them put together? Here are the years and the related coefficients: 1969: -.169, 1975: .427, 1982: .308, 2006: .632 . Can I average these to the overall Pearson's r coefficient?
