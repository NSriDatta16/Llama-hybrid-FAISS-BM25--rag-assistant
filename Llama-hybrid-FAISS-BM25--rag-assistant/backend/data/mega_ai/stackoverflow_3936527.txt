subdirectories as an organizational tool so that you don't just have one directory with tons of java files. The reason you often see a domain name is that conventionally people derive java package names from their domain names in order to prevent collisions with other developers. So although we both might have a util.Stringutil class, if I name mine com.mydomain.util.Stringutil and yours is com.yourdomain.util.Stringutil, we can have a project containing both classes without a collision.
