(Feature Selection) Meaning of "importance type" in get_score() function of XGBoost

I'm trying to use a build in function in XGBoost to print the importance of features. My code is like import xgboost as xgb ... clf_xgboost = xgb.XGBClassifier(...) clf_xgboost.fit(X, y) for type in ['weight', 'gain', 'cover']: print(clf_xgboost.get_booster().get_score(importance_type=type)) The program prints 3 sets of importance values. Each set looks like, {'feature1':0.11, 'feature2':0.12, ...} And I googled the importance_type and found this page . The page gives a brief explanation of the meaning of the importance types. Besides the page also say clf_xgboost has a .get_fscore() that can print the "importance value of features". Can someone explain the difference between .get_fscore() and .get_score(importance_type)? And the difference between the 3 importance_types?
