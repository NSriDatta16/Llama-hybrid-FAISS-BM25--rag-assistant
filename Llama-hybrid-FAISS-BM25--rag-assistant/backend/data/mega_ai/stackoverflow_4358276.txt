PNG works this way (approximately): For each pixel, replace its value by the value that it had minus the value of the pixel left to it. Do this from right to left. Then you can calculate the entropy (bits per character) by making a table of how often which value appears now, making relative values out of these absolute ones and adding the results of log2(n)*n for each element. Oh, and you have to do this for each color channel (r, g, b) seperately. For the result, take the average of the bits per character for the channels and divide it by 2^8 (assuming that you have 8 bit per color).
