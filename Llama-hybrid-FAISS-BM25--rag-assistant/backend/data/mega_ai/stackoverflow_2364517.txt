iPhone SDK: Core Data

Probably a silly question but I cannot find a way to do it. I am developing an iPhone application that uses Core Data for it's storage. At one point I want to loop around all the objects in the store and perform and action on them. Is there an easy way to do this? I've tried all manner of for and while loops but can't seem to get anything working.
