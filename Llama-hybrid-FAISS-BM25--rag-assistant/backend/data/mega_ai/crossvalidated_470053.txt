Its difficult to answer your question as you have not provided enough information on the model parameters, but just by looking at that 2D PCA graph, it will be impossible for any reasonably robust classifier to be able to achieve 100% accuracy without over fitting by only using the first 2 PCs. I suspect you are using many more features than just 2, your accuracy scores are not holdout scores, and your models are large, hence overfitting. Depending on the kernel you're using, SVMs can have linear decision boundaries (/w linear kernel) or non-linear decision boundaries (/w non-linear kernel). A complex enough SVM with enough capacity to over-fit every data point can certainly achieve 100% accuracy. This is the same with nearly all ML methods. I recommend you look into cross validation strategies.
