Isolated storage can be treated as a small per application filesystem where an application can save files. The isolated storage is available to applications running in partial trust and to Silverlight applications. Those applications does not have permissions to write elsewhere in the filesystem, but with isolated storage they can store settings and user preferences in a persistent location. Each application gets it own isolated storage and applications running in partial trust can not look at another application's isolated storage. The isolated storage can be browsed in the regular file explorer. I think that outside partial trust applications isolated storage is rarely used, but for partial trust applications and Silverlight applications isolated storage is the best choice.
