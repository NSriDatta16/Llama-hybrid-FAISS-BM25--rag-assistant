How to test for main effects in 2x2 factorial design with categorical outcome

The problem I have is as follows: I have a clinical trial based on 2x2 factorial design (four treatment combinations, balanced design)comparing treatment A with treatment B, where the primary outcome is dichotomous response variable, denoting patients' response to treatment (yes/no). A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the trial and the estimated response rates are below: My question is, how do I perfom a test of the main effect of treatment A, for example and then test for interaction effect? I know that F or t-test is not appropriate, since my dependent variable is not continuous. My thoughts for how to do this are the following: Since outcome is dichotomous, we have the logistic regression model: $$logit(P) = α + \beta_Ax_1 + \beta_Bx_2 + \beta_{AB}x_1x_2$$ For main effect of A, null hypothesis: $\beta_A = 0$ vs alternative: $\beta_A ≠ 0$ and use chi-square test. Would that be appropriate given my relative small cell counts or would Fisher's Exact test be better? And if chi-square is ok, then would this be the correct formula to use to test for main effect of A or how should I do it? $\chi^2 = [10 - (18*23/36)^2]/(18*23/36) + [8-(18*13/36)^2]/(13*18/36) + [13-(18*23/36)^2]/(18*23/36) + [5-(13*18/36)^2]/(13*18/36)$ Similarly, for interaction effect, null hypothesis: $\beta_{AB} = 0$ vs. alternative: $\beta_{AB} ≠ 0$ and again use chi-square/Fisher's test? Any suggestions/help would be appreciated, thank you! ================================================================================ UPDATE: Ok, so I fitted a logistic model in R with glm and this was what I got: It appears that the AB interaction effect is not significant according to p-value=0.2. Question : Now in order to test for the main effect of treatment A and main effect of treatment B, do I have to fit two separate models, one just with treatment A (for main effect of A) like so: glm(cbind(no, yes)~treatmentA and then one just with B for the main effect of B or can I just take the p-values from the original model with the interaction term (p for A is 0.396; p for B is 0.556)? What would be the statistically valid way to do this?
