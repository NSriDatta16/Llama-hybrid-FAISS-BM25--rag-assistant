games-howell test with multiple independent variables

my data doesn't meet the homogeneity of variances criterium. After a welch one way test I wanted to perform a post hoc games-howell test since it doesn't require the homogeneity of variances criterium. my question: I have two independent variables, but I can only insert one in the test. Is there a reason you can only insert one? To provide some context, I am researching the effect of precipitation (independent 1) (rain and snowfall) on the rating that reviewers give (dependent). I want to find out if the effect differs for people from certain countries (independent 2). It seems like this is not possible with this test in the following way: oneway(x= data$precipitation * data$segment, y = data$rating, posthoc = 'games-howell') (the ratings range from 1 to 5, precipitation is a dummy variable and there are 3 segments (countries with low, medium and high average precipitation). If this doesn't seem like the appropriate analysis, which analysis would be better? (When searching I came across ordinal regression, does this the same or is this something completely else since it also incorporates the ordinal dependent variable?). Any tips are welcome!
