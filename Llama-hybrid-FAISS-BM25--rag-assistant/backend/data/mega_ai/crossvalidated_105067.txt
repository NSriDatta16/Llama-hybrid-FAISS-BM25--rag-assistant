Normalizing a Customer Satisfaction Index

I'm looking to use the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index) for a customer satisfaction survey. I'm confused by the explanation for how to calculate this. The survey is three questions: What is your overall satisfaction with [our product or service]? To what extent has [our product or service] met your expectations? How well did [our product or service] compare with the ideal [type of offering]?* And the explanation for the calculation is: Some organizations simply normalize and average the three ratings, like this: $$((Satisfaction-1) + (Expectancy-1) + (Performance â€“ 1)) / 27 \cdot 100$$ I don't understand how this works -- why is 1 subtracted from each, and why divide by 27?
