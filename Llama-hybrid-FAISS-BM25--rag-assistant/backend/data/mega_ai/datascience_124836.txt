In Pandas, any problem can nearly always be solved with some elegant one-liner. But a possible not-so-elegant approach would be as follows: Reset index so that it becomes a column. Create a dataframe (df_A) containing the index (name it index_A) and column of interest A. Create a dataframe (df_B) containing the index (name it index_B) and column of interest B. Perform a merge of df_A on A and of df_B on B (left merge, for instance). The result should contain the shared values and the corresponding indexes.
