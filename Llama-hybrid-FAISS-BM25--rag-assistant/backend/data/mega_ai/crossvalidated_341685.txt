Since this is a time-series data set the temporal issue is of utmost importance, meaning you really cannot use future data in order to predict past events. Thus, the split by Subject doesn't make much sense here since you'd be training your model with future observations but testing it on past ones ( e.g. train on period {1 3 4 5 6} and test on period {2}). The flow should follow the pattern below, with new data that comes in being ingested into the training set (blue dots) and used to predict the target variable in the future (red dots). In light of this, I would use only the split by t , as in the right-side table. There is a similar thread here and you can read more about time series cross validation here .
