It seems that Hibernate doesn't support rlike or regexp feature (see http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3404 ) But Grails does !! For that you need to used createCriteria (and not executeQuery) Based on this discussion http://n4.nabble.com/Using-rlike-in-a-gorm-query-td1391934.html and on http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILS-3481 , your solution will be: def c = List.createCriteria(); results = c { rlike("name", "^[0123456789].*") } Attention: it might work only on MySQL and Oracle
