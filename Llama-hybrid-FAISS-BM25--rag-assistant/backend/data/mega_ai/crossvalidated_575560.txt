Constrained ordination (CAP) pairwise ANOVA

Is there any way to perform pairwise ANOVA test from Constrained ordination for multiple factors in a variable? e.g. I am trying to figure out whether microbial communities among five plant genotypes are different in their composition. I am performing constrained ordination using capscale using 'vegan' package in R. My model is like this: (in R code) CAP=capscale(vegdist(asv_tab,method ="cao")~ Condition(Experiment)+Genotype+Condition(plate), data = metadata) Here I am removing the effect of experiment and plates using Condition and I am interested in plotting the effect of Genotypes on microbial communities. When I run anova(CAP,permutations=999) , I'm getting only the effect of genotype as a factor, but not individual genotypes. If I want to retrieve the results of individual comparison of each levels of the genotype, is there any command in this constrained ordination? Appreciate your help!
