Normal-Gamma: Metropolis-Hastings on log-scale, but no Jacobian?

I am reading the paper by Griffin and Brown (2010) where at one step in their MCMC procedure they need to sample from the following conditional posterior: $$ p(\lambda|\gamma, \Psi)\propto \pi(\lambda)\frac{1}{(2\gamma^2)^{p\lambda}(\Gamma(\lambda))^p}\left(\prod_{i=1}^p\Psi_i\right)^\lambda $$ They say that $\lambda$ can be updated using a Metropolis-Hastings random walk update on $\log\lambda$ . We propose $Î»' = \exp\{\sigma^2_\lambda z\}\lambda$ , where $z$ is standard normal then $\lambda'$ is accepted with probability $$ \min\left\{1, \frac{\pi(\lambda')}{\pi(\lambda)}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\lambda)}{\Gamma(\lambda')}\right)^p\left((2\gamma^2)^{-p}\prod_{i=1}^p\Psi_i\right)^{\lambda'-\lambda}\right\} $$ My question: why is there no term in the acceptance probability that accounts for the fact that we are proposing new draws on the logarithmic scale? See for example here: Sampling on a logarithmic scale The paper, however, has more than 300 citations and I know several successful papers that have used the same type of Metropolis-Hastings procedure; therefore, I'm inclined to think I am missing something. But what? Griffin and Brown (2010) Inference with normal-gamma prior distributions in regression problems, Bayesian Analysis, https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1340369797
