What are the most suitable machine learning algorithms according to type of data?

I am beginner to data science. I found that some machine learning algorithms perform better, when given particular kind of data(ie - numerical, categorical, text, graphical). I searched about this topic on the web, but no luck. I would like to know what kind of data performs best according to given machine learning algorithm? It is better to explain briefly why certain kinds of data suitable for certain machine learning algorithms? Hope answer to this question will help beginners in data science. Update : It is better if you can explain what are the types of data most suitable for following algorithms. Naive Bayes, SVM, Regression, K-Means, Deep Neural networks.
