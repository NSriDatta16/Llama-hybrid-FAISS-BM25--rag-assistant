Entity Framework 4 CTP 4 / CTP 5 Generic Repository Pattern and Unit Testable

I'm playing with the latest Entity Framework CTP 5 release and building a simple asp.net MVC blog where I just have two tables: Post and Comments. This is done entirely in POCO, I just need help on the DbContext part, where I need it to be unit testable (using IDbSet?) and I need a simple/generic repository pattern for add, update, delete, retrieval. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
