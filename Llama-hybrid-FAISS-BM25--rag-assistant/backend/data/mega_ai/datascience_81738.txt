This is a simplified explanation : Ground truth is a term used in statistics and machine learning that means checking the results of machine learning for accuracy against the real world. The term is borrowed from meteorology, where "ground truth" refers to information obtained on site. How you get that ground truth : Many options but usually humans will evaluate each scenario and give the right labels to it. For example you can upload a group of images to trainingset.ai , label them (where is a car, where is a pedestrian and so on) and that will be your ground truth to evaluate or train your ai algorithm.
