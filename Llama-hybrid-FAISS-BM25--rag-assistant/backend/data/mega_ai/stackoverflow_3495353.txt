If the cursor moves when they touch, then I assume the OS is just registering this as a MOUSE_MOVE and not a MOUSE_DOWN. Since it's a touchscreen, you could just consider MOUSE_MOVE a click since the user probably isn't actually dragging their finger around creating a real MOUSE_MOVE event. Well, if they are actually dragging their finger around for stuff then you could assume a MOUSE_MOVE that suddenly places the cursor on a button (with no prior MOUSE_MOVE i.e. dragging), it's a MOUSE_DOWN.
