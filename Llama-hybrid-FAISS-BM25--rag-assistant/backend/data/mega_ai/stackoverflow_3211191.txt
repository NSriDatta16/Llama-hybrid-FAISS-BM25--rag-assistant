Windows Mobile 6.5 - .NET CF connection management

I'm developing a Win32 mobile application (.NET CF 2.0/3.5) that has to communicate with a WebService. The mobile computer will be used in places called "Dispatch" where good WLAN coverage is provided and company offers its own AP with defined SSID name. This means that the mobile computer must use those APs (knowing their SSID name) for Internet connection. The other use of mobile computer is by driver. In that case to commuicate with WebService, GPRS/EDGE connection must be used because of lack of WIFI access. I want to provide a way of "intelligent connection management" in my application so that the mobile computer detects if there is a known SSID (WIFI) and then connects to it and WebService communication is established through this connection. If no WIFI is in range, the mobile computer connects through GPRS/EDGE via the GSM ISP. How to approach this by using .NET CF and/or Win32 API? Regards
