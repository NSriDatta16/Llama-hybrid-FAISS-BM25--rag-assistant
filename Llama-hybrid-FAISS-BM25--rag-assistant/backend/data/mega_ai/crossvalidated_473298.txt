The code if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) > 0.2: if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) 0.5: position = (position - 1) % N relies on three independent Uniform draws and generates a Markov chain that remains at the same position with probability $$0.2+0.8\times(0.5^2+0.5^2)=0.6$$ that moves by one (right) with probability $$0.8\times 0.5^2=0.2$$ and moves by minus one (left) with probability $$0.8\times 0.5^2=0.2$$ Note also that the log counter does not follow the chain moves properly. The alternate code if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) > 0.2: if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) uses only two independent Uniform variates generates a Markov chain that stays static with probability 0.2, moves left or right with identical probability 0.4.
