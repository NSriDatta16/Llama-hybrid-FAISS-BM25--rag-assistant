Can you be a bit more specific? Are there more cells that scroll into place? I'm guessing your tableview has more cells than the screen real-estate provides, so do you want your view to come into place as the last cell is scrolled upward? Edit: Personally, the idea of figuring out content height on a table view is too messy, especially since you have to add the subview yourself, rather than have the UITableView manage it for you. There is a more elegant solution that works in my opinion: Create an extra section (that doesn't have to have any rows associated with it). Then implement the function tableView:viewForHeaderInSection: Return the view you were meaning to add as a subview under your main table. That should do the trick.
