Prediction interval

I calculated an 80% prediction interval of the outcome of interest (proportion of patients, average temperature etc.) based on my previous study. Is it true that in the future study I will receive the outcome within the calculated prediction interval with 80% probability? Which means that if I do a billion studies the outcome will be within the prediction interval in about 80% of them?
