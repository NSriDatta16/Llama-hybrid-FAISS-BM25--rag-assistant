Cache-Control Header & Browser Caching IIS7

I am using Google Page Speed on my website in IIS7 and I was wondering how to set Leverage browser caching - The following resources are missing a cache expiration Leverage proxy caching - Consider adding a "Cache-Control: public" header to the following resources. I am using doDynamicCompression in my web.config and little confused how to set these ? Hoping for some help Note: Reference being used http://www.iis.net/ConfigReference/system.webServer/httpCompression
