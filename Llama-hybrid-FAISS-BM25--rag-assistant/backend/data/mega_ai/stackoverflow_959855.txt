Depending on what you're trying to do it may be easier to get existing software to handle the TCP handshaking for you. One open source IP stack is lwIP ( http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/ ) which provides a full tcp/ip stack. It is very possible to get it running in user mode using either SOCK_RAW or pcap.
