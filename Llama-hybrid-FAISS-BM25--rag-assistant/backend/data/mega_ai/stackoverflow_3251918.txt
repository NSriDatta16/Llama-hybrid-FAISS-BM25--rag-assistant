Excellent question. After much digging, I found the following page on touch and gesture events for Android and iPhone. Hopefully this list will be of some use to you: http://backtothecode.blogspot.com/2009/10/javascript-touch-and-gesture-events.html To elaborate, you're probably going to want to handle the touchstart and touchend events, perhaps keeping track of the position of the "cursor" at each to determine if it was a drag or simply a press. Good luck, and I don't blame you if you don't consider this a definitive answer. :P
