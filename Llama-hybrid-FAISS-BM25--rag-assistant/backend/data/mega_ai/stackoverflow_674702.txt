There's a temporary fix by adding any network ip masks to the trusted intranet zones That's the real fix. The error message occurs when you are trying to copy files out of the Internet Zone. And it is indeed risky if you really are dragging files out of a public-internet network share, so the message isn't really wrong (just vague and misleading). To avoid the error popping up in your intranet — and because it's the right thing to do anyway — you need to make sure Windows sees the intranet as being in the Local intranet Zone. Go to Control Panel -> Internet Options-> Security -> Local intranet -> Sites. If “Automatically detect intanet network” is ticked, untick it as obviously the automatic detection isn't working. Turn on the top two; if you're sure that you will never be accessing network shares outside the intranet (eg. because a firewall prevents it), you can tick “Include all network paths”. If this doesn't work add the folder path as a trusted Local Intranet site.
