If you want to code it in Objective-C, you need a UIScrollView and set it's property pagingEnabled to YES and the property contentSize to widthOfOnePage*numberOfPages . To get the "bullets" you need a UIPageControl . Keep in mind that the UIPageControl does not get updated automatically but you can use the UIScrollView delegate method - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView to update the active bullet in the UIPageControl . For getting the image the user tapped on, use the - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event method.
