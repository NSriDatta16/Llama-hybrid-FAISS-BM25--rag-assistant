Advice on correcting for seasonality in data

I am a little new to time series in general, however, I have 5 years of weekly sales data and another variable of interest. I am trying to see if there is a trend in the sales data and the second variable. The sales data has some seasonality trends I would like to correct for. What I have done thus far is normalise the data for both variables using (value-min)/(max-min) and simply just plotted these two just as the plot below. ggplot(df, aes(x = WEEKref)) + geom_line(aes(y = Adjmm, colour = "red")) + geom_line(aes(y = dollarmm, colour = "blue")) I have looked into the forecast package in R but at this stage I am not trying to forecast anything, I just want to see if there is an underlying relationship between the two variables. I have been following this tutorial: https://anomaly.io/seasonally-adjustement-in-r/ Do you have any advice on where I should be looking? Data (R dput): df
