First review your understanding of ANOVA & its relation to (ordinary least-squares) regression. "In addition, adding several variables in the logistic model changes the significance of the previous variables! Some stop being significant depending on whether others are there too:("â€”this isn't peculiar to logistic regression. See e.g. How can adding a 2nd IV make the 1st IV significant? . Second, with logistic regression (& other generalized linear models) you can calculate the equivalent of an ANOVA table with tests carried out using the asymptotic distribution of likelihood ratios according to Wilks' Theorem. See What are the differences between ANOVAs and GLMs? . It's sometimes called analysis of deviance . Third, point & interval estimates of model parameters are much more informative than declarations of significance/insignificance. Can't your questions be answered quantitatively rather than dichotomously? See e.g. Why is "statistically significant" not enough? . If odds ratios are new to you see Help me understand adjusted odds ratio in logistic regression for a start.
