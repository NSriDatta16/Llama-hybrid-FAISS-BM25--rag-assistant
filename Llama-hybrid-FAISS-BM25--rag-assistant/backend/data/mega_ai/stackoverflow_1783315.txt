How to enable ruby methods visualizing in vim

a have googled the question, but found nothing - maybe I do not know how to define the search keywords properly in this case. I like to use folding in vim when I'm developing Ruby on Rails applications. And my foldcolumn is set to 4. But its visualizing of the start and the end of the ruby method is not so simple and obvious ("-" - "def", "|" - "end"): -def foo bar = 1 |end The question is - is there any plugin for vim, that will show markers (arrows or stmh) near every "def" and "end" like it is done in TextMate ( 1 )? v def foo bar = 1 ^ end Also, as I do not have much experience in vim/ruby, maybe there is another, more elegant way to check that all def-end pairs are closed in a particular file? (matchit.vim is not very comfortable for this need) I hope there is more convenient way to catch lost "ends" than to read "Syntax error" in the console :)
