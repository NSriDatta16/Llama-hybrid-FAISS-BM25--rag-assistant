So here's the solution for this problem after I got the source: I didn't really pay attention to the posted screenshot, but the target is of type " Command-line Tool "... and since those don't have a bundle [NSBundle mainBundle] of course returns nil. It's pretty misleading that Xcode doesn't complain that it can't execute the " Copy Bundle Resources " step, it just silently skips it. Solution is simply to add a new target, of type " Application " so a bundle-based application is generated. Then check the Target Membership checkboxes for all sources and resources for this new target. The plist paths are correctly resolved then.
