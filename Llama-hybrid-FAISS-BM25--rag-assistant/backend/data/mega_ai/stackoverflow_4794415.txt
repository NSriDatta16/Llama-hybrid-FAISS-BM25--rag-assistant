How to match a keyword on a web page that is NOT within an and its href, using JavaScript?

I'm searching a page to find a specific keyword. That itself is easy enough. The added complication is that I don't want to match this keyword if it is part of an tag. E.g. Here is some example content that has a keyword in it. I want to match this keyword here but, i don't want to match the keyword here. If you look at the above example content, the word 'keyword' appears 4 times. I want to match the first two times it appears with the paragraph, but i do not want to match it when it appears as part of the href and as part of the content. So far I've managed to use this below: var tester = new RegExp("((?! )("+keyword+")(?! ))", 'ig'); The problem with that above is that it still matches the keyword if it is part of the href . Any ideas? Thanks
