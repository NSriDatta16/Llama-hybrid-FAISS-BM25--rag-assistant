You can use NSArray method writeToFile: atomically: to dump your data into a file, you can then use initWithContentOfFile to retrieve the information from t hat file just as you dumped it previosly. I believe if you have dictionaries in your array you should be able to get them back this way. You can always use core data as well for storage if you find your structures to store are getting complex and dumping the in a file and getting them back to recreate some o bjects is becoming messy.
