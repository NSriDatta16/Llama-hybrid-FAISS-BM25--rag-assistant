does Interface Builder automatically instantiate the custom controllers you drag on?

So I have: created a couple of custom controllers (add file UIViewController subclass) in Interface Builder dragged two ViewController items from the Library to the MainWindow.xib (ie when applicationDelegate is, and the main window) pane, then set their class names to be those of the custom controllers respectively Now that I have done this: should this then automatically take care of instantiating these controllers for use in the Application Delegate's "didFinishLaunchingWithOptions" method for example? Or do I still need to create these controller for the Application Delegate *.h and *.m files? Or in other words again, trying to understand what IB actually does for you when you create customViewControllers and link them up...
