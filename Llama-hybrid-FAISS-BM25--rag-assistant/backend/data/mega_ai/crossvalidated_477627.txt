Intuitive Explanation of "AutoEncoders"

To my knowledge, Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique in which we leverage neural networks for the task of representation learning. I know there is a lot of topics around autoencoders, I can find the code and run but I'm unable to understand the math and concept of Autoencoders. I'm looking for intuition in words but also some simple insight into mathematical calculations (I don't know if the latter is possible). Can anybody shed some light on the "AutoEncoders"?
