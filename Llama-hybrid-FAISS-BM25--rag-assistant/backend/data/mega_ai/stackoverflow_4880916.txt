Can IKImageBrowserView display multi-line titles?

I'd like my IKImageBrowserView to display long titles by wrapping them and displaying them in multiple lines, but I've been unable to achieve this. I've tried changing the size of the titleFrame returned in the ImageBrowserCell subclass and also setting the paragraph style on the title so that it should wrap ( NSLineBreakByWordWrapping ) but I only ever get a single line of text. Has anyone tried this? Any other suggestion I might try?
