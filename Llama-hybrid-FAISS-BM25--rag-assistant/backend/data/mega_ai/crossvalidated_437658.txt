Statistical analysis in R language

I have a few questions about statistical tests in R. I have a dependent variable Admitted, whose values could be either Yes or No and have 100 observations. When we train our model, we get results like No, No, Yes, No, No, Yes, Yes ...... for one algorithm such as Random Forest and similar type of results using SVM. My question is which statistical test we can perform on this data so that we get one algorithm (RF) is statistically better than the other (SVM). Thanks
