hierarchical clustering doesn't work as expected

I have a precomputed distance matrix. I'm trying to do an hierarchical clustering using scipy: from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import fcluster, linkage, cut_tree,fcluster z = linkage(ds, "average") clust = fcluster(z, 4, criterion='maxclust') print(clust) The problem is that, most of the labels ends up in one group - Why? By the way, I tried to use AgglomerativeClustering as well but I got similar results. ds is the precomputed distance matrix. I'm using DTW, a distance metric for time series analysis. I uploaded ds.csv to here . Also, here's an heatmap which forms interesting lines (I don't really know how to interpret this currently)
