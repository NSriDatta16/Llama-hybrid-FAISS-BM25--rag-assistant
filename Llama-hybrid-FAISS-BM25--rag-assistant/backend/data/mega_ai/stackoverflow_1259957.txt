Subversion Proxy for working offline?

What is the best approach for working at a customers site (with several people) where there maybe not internet access the whole time and using a subversion repository? (Migrating to Git or Mercurial is out of the question at the moment) But wouldn't it be possible to leverage something like, for instance the Git SVN Integration, to create a proxy which acts like a subversion repository for the clients and may be used at the end to synchronize the changes back to subversion? Is there already something like that available?
