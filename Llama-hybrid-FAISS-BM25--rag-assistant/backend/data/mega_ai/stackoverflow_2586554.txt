It looks like this function is apart of a family of classes that do this: This method should be used to retrieve the environment variables that will be needed to 'validate' a session. This is so stupid it hurts. When your session is hijacked using XSS it will probably be sent as a GET request. In the incoming HTTP request will contain the USER_AGENT, as well as many other "environment variables" that the attacker can control. Calling this approach a waste of time is an understatement. This is not a security feature, and sessions are can never be protected in this way. If you want to protection your sessions scan for xss , patch CSRF, use https for the entire session . Read the OWASP top 10 for 2010, especially A3: "Broken authentication and session management."
