Reinforcement learning (RL) is a useful way to frame problems when actions that are taken change the environment. The best way to assign credit for outcomes is through experimentation. By carefully designing an experiment, you can figure out if the intervention has a causal impact on the result. Often it takes a series of experiments to understand the cause-effect relationship.
