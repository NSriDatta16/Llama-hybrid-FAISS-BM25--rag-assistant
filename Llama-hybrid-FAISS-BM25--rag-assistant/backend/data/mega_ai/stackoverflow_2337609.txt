internal RSS feed not working with webClient object

As part of our application, we need to download a RSS feed. Our client's have an internal RSS feed which works fine with IE/Firefox but doesn't work with our application. The application try to download from a url. I am not sure what exactly wrong here: RssChannelDom DownloadChannelDom(string url) { RssChannelDom dom = null; System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy policy = new System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy( System.Net.Cache.RequestCacheLevel.BypassCache); WebClient client = new WebClient(); client.CachePolicy = policy; client.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0"); byte[] feed = client.DownloadData(url); // parse it as XML XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument(); doc.Load(new MemoryStream(feed)); return dom; } The client URL looks like: http://sampleclient/diapatents/index.php/Special:Ask/ -5B-5BCategory:Patent_Alert -5D-5D-20-5B-5BResearch-20Unit::Allergy_and_Respiratory -5D-5D-20-5B-5BOrganisation:: -5D-5D-20-5B-5BTarget:: -5D-5D-20-5B-5BIndication:: -5D-5D-20-5B-5BDate:: -20-3E-20-0A-5D-5D-20-5B-5BRevised-20Since:: -20-3E-20-0A2009-2D8-5D-5D/sort-3DDate/order-3DDESC/ format-3Drss/rsstitle%3DPfizerpediaPatents/rssdescription-3DRSS-20Feed: -20Allergy-20and-20Respiratory-20recently-20uploaded-20or-20revised/ limit%3D400
