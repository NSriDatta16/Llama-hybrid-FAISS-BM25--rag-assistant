What you are asking here is basically food for numerous posts, opinions and a lot of research on the field of imbalanced classes. To answer your main question, there is not a straight answer of what a “rare” event is. I personally would say that your case is basically in the boundary. I will list some approaches here but seriously this will be the tip of the iceberg you will have to go back to google and look for more info: Do nothing. Sometimes it’s fine to just model the data as it is. Especially for an algorithm like logistic regression which not a classifier and predicts probabilities, these class imbalances will be taken into account. In the case you want to use the model as a classifier you might consider to: Undersample the majority class. Sample observations so that you make the two classes balanced Oversample the minority class. Similarly sample some observations from the minority class, obviously with replacement That being said, I believe that these 3 techniques can get you started. Given that you want prediction accuracy, I would suggest to look into other techniques as well. If you really want to use logistic regression then what I would do is: Split the data into train and test sets Define a loss function Check which approach minimises the loss function in the test set
