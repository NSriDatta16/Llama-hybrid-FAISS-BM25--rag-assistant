Assessing sphericity assumption Like with most assumption tests, significance tests should not be taken too seriously. With small sample sizes the assumption test will be underpowered. Furthermore, if you are pragmatic, you are really more interested in the degree of violation of your assumption, rather than a binary decision rule. If you are interested in the effect of time, then sphericity is almost always violated (correlations tend be larger between time points that are closer together in time). If you are interested in the effect of experimental manipulations, then sphericity may be a more plausible assumption. I guess it depends on the experimental manipulation. My intuition is that the greater differences between group means would be associated with smaller covariances, because of individual differences in change as well as measurement on each occasion. However, I don't have any specific studies on hand to justify this. In addition to examining Mauchly's test, it can be interesting to actually look at the correlation or covariance structure of your repeated measures conditions in order to get a sense of the extent of any violation. Furthermore, if you want get more sophisticated, you can adopt a modelling framework that specifically tries to model the error structure. However, it sounds like you are mainly interested in simply assessing group mean differences. Univariate corrected or multivariate tests If after reflecting on your assumptions, you conclude that sphericity is a reasonable assumption, then I'd use the sphericity assumed. If you conclude that sphericity is not a reasonable assumption, then choose one of the univariate corrected or multivariate test approaches. I have never read a compelling case of why a researcher should prefer one over the other. Just don't choose your technique based on which has the better p-value. If you want to read more, check out Algina, J. and Keselman, H. (1997). Detecting repeated measures effects with univariate and multivariate statistics. Psychological Methods, 2(2):208. This article discusses relative statistical power of univariate corrected and multivariate approaches.
