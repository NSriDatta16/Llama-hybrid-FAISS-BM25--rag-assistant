Splitting '12213123_mul_32432532' in Python Regex

I hav Got HTTP Request Like GET /1213123_mul_32424324.html HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: ..... etc...etc... I need to send the multiplication of Integers 1213123 and 32424324... So I have created a Python ccript for this. I used the req.find() method to fetch integer. but there should be a better way, like using regex. Whats the best way to fetch integers from this request?
