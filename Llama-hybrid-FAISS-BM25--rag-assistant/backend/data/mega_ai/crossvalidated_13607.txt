Can non-random samples be analyzed using standard statistical tests?

Many clinical studies are based on non-random samples. However, most standard tests (e.g. t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression, logistic regression) are based on the assumption that samples contain "random numbers". Are results valid if these non-random samples were analyzed by standard tests? Thank you.
