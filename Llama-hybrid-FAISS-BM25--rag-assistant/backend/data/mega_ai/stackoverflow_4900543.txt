Yes, there's a ton of duplication here. I don't think LINQ is going to help, but you definitely can make it much simpler. Start by taking the basic unit of repeated code and making it into a helper function. Making TOTAL/INCLUDED/BILLED a parameter should be easy. Making Month1/Month2/Month3/Average a parameter will need some tricks like using a lambda to select which property. EDIT: But really, I think the best solution is to pick a single unit for internal variables (e.g. kB) and stop all this converting back and forth. Do just one conversion to create a string for display. Converting back and forth will lose precision.
