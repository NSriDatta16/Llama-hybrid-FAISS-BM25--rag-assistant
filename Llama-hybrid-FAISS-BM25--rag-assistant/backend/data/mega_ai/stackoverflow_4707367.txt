Android Sqlite IN, NOT IN syntax

I'm trying to run NOT IN select where NOT IN list is dynamic. Something like SELECT id, type FROM CONTACTS where type NOT IN ('connect','answer') In the code my futile attempts were: db.query(TABLE, new String[] { "id", ""}, " type NOT IN (?)", "connect,answer", null, null, null); // didn't work db.query(TABLE, new String[] { "id", ""}, " type NOT IN (?)", "'connect','answer'", null, null, null); // didn't work My take on this is that ? substitution treats my comma list as single argument. I did find a solution but it is rather ugly so I won't post it here until someone comes forward with something more elegant
