Mixed effect linear modeling with multiple nested effect variables

I am trying to develop a linear mixed-effect model for a dataset with a somewhat complex nested structure. The scenario is roughly the following: I am measuring the attention level of students at different points in a school year. The highest level of my hierarchy is District, which is marked as either Liberal (L) or Conservative (C). Each district has several schools, and each school has multiple teachers and students. Say a student $i$ takes classes by several teachers in the school year; I measure the attention level of a student $i$ with teacher $j$ somewhere between 5-10 times in the school year (the number of times differs for each student). Every student and teacher additionally self-reports their gender (assume we have just two levels, M and F). I am now interested in looking at whether attention (numeric) is dependent on the genders of the student and teacher, as well as how this relation may be moderated by the district type (L or C). I also want to control for the variation within students, teachers, schools and districts. I have my fixed effects structure set up as $districtType * studentGender * teacherGender$ . For my random effects, I initially started off with having each of the four variables as separate effects: $(1|districtId) + (1|schoolId) + (1|studentId) + (1|teacherId)$ . However, the data does follow a clear hierarchical structure, so I figure I should have my random effects nested: $(1|districtId/schoolId/studentId)$ , and also $(1|districtId/schoolId/teacherId)$ . I am confused with this last step -- both teachers and students are nested under a particular school, but each student can interact with multiple teachers and vice versa (crossed??). What would be the best way to include this random effect? An additional thought is how much the random effect specification even matters -- is it possible that the different ways of specifying them will affect the fixed effect associations of my model? I'd appreciate any advice!
