Okay, not sure if this tidbit will help you, but when I did it with XML I would get the object of the drop target with: var r:int = dropTarget.calculateDropIndex(evt); var node:XML = treeCurTemplate.indexToItemRenderer(r).data as XML; Then I would compare the localName of the target to the localName of the item I was dragging. The localName was what I used to control the tree branching, so this made sense. Maybe you can use this to find some sort of way to do it with your objects.
