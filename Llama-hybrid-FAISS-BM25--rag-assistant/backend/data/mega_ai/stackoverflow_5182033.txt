silverlight UnitTesting doesn't call TestInitialize

I use (or try) the Silverlight unittesting. everything seems alright but the methods taged with attribute [TestInitialize] are not called before the [TestMethod] . Anyone knows a workaround ? here is a sample where Method BeforeAnyTest is never called: [TestClass] public class TViewModel { protected MockRepository MockRepository { get; set; } /// /// This is strangely not called automatically before any test /// [TestInitialize] protected void BeforeAnyTest() { MockRepository = new MockRepository(); } [TestMethod] public void TServerStartupViewModelCtor() { //BeforeAnyTest(); var smsa = MockRepository.StrictMock (); ServerStartupViewModel ssvm = new ServerStartupViewModel(smsa); Assert.IsNotNull(ssvm); } }
