Simplistic: "[^"]*" will match anything between double quotes, though it won't work with escaped double quotes such as "Abc\"Def" For the single-quote to EOL, you can use '.*$ Update: Sylverdrag's made a valid point; to match between the quotes you'd need "([^"]*)" and then get the first subgroup of the match. I see the question's been updated to mention that &quot; should be used - my answer can be adapted to this easily enough.
