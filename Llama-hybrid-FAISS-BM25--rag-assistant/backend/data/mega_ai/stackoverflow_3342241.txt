Defining a variable is when you allocate memory for the storage and maybe assign it a value. Declaring is when you state that a variable with a specific name and type exist, but memory has been allocated for it already. The use of the extern keyword means that you are declaring the variable but not defining it. In terms of your specific question, your first example is declaring and your second answer is defining.
