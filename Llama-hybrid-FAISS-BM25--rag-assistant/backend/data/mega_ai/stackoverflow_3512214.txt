I achieved this effect by having everything defined in a single xml file with multiple TableLayout views stacked on top of each other within a Merge view. In order to "load" a view, I change its Android:visibility tag from "gone" to "visible" . Since you want your second view to not obscure the header, you can put a buffer (margin or padding) that offsets it from the top of the screen. The background color of this top TableLayout would have to be android:background="#00000000" so that the alpha channel is zero and it is transparent. If anyone else has a more elegant approach, I would be interested to know as well, but this suites me just fine. The only downside I see is an extra large XML file.
