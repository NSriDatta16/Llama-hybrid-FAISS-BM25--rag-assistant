According to this class : /** * Some components treat tabulator (TAB key) in their own way. * Sometimes the tabulator is supposed to simply transfer the focus * to the next focusable component. * * Here s how to use this class to override the "component's default" * behavior: * * JTextArea area = new JTextArea(..); * TransferFocus.patch( area ); * * This should do the trick. * This time the KeyStrokes are used. * More elegant solution than TabTransfersFocus(). * * @author kaimu * @since 2006-05-14 * @version 1.0 */ public class TransferFocus { /** * Patch the behaviour of a component. * TAB transfers focus to the next focusable component, * SHIFT+TAB transfers focus to the previous focusable component. * * @param c The component to be patched. */ public static void patch(Component c) { Set strokes = new HashSet (Arrays.asList(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke("pressed TAB"))); c.setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, strokes); strokes = new HashSet (Arrays.asList(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke("shift pressed TAB"))); c.setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.BACKWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, strokes); } } Note that patch() can be even shorter, according to Joshua Goldberg in the comments , since the goal is to get back default behaviors overridden by JTextArea : component.setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERS‌​AL_KEYS, null); component.setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.BACKWARD_TRAVERS‌​AL_KEYS, null); This is used in question " How can I modify the behavior of the tab key in a JTextArea ? " The previous implementation involved indeed a Listener , and the a transferFocus() : /** * Override the behaviour so that TAB key transfers the focus * to the next focusable component. */ @Override public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { if(e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_TAB) { System.out.println(e.getModifiers()); if(e.getModifiers() > 0) a.transferFocusBackward(); else a.transferFocus(); e.consume(); } } e.consume(); might have been what you missed to make it work in your case.
