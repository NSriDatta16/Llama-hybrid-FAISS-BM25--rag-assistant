Kernel SVM: I want an intuitive understanding of mapping to a higher-dimensional feature space, and how this makes linear separation possible

I am trying to understand the intuition behind kernel SVM's. Now, I understand how linear SVM's work, whereby a decision line is made which splits the data as best it can. I also understand the principle behind porting data to a higher-dimensional space, and how this can make it easier to find a linear decision line in this new space. What I do not understand is how a kernel is used to project data points to this new space. What I know about a kernel is that it effectively represents the "similarity" between two data points. But how does this relate to the projection?
