You are correct that simply averaging the ranks for each of the $k$ objects will provide you the overall rank that maximises the Spearman $\rho$ correlation with each of the individual ranks. This is equivalent to the Borda count method. The reference for this is Kendall & Gibbons (1990, pg. 125). Finding the ranking that maximises Kendall's $\tau$ is a little more complicated. The Kemeny-Young method can determine the overall rank that minimises the Kendall's $\tau_D$ rank distance between itself and each of the individual ranks. Because Kendall's $\tau$ is a normalisation of the $\tau_D$ distance between two ranks, $$\tau=1-2 \binom k2 ^{-1} \tau_D$$ The Kemeny-Young method yields the overall rank with the highest Kendall's $\tau$ correlation. Note this is problem is NP-hard though, so if you're working with large $k$ , computation may be challenging. For ways to calculate the average $\rho$ and $\tau$ between a criterion (e.g. overall) ranking and a group of ranks, see Lyerly (1952) and Hays (1960) respectively. References Hays, W. L. (1960).
