Foraward SNMP requests from Agentx Master to Agentx Subagent

I am running an agentx master and an agentx subagent on linux. When I run snmpget on a default MIB i.e. sysdescr.0 it returns fine, but when I request for a MIB that was registered through the agentx subagent it timesout. It appears that the master receives the GET request but does not forward on to the agentx subagent. The MIB is registered successfully but when master agentx receives the GET request it saying "Sending 60 bytes to UDP: unknown" . It can't find the location to forward to. Am I missing a configuration of some sort on the subagent side? How does the master know who is suppose to receive the requests?
