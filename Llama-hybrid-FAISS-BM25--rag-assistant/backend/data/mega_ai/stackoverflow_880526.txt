On top of the SOLID principles, have a look at Code Smells. They were mentioned first (IIRC) in Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" book, which is an excellent read. Code smells generally apply to OO and also procedural development to some degree, including things like "Shotgun Surgery" where edits are required all over the codebase to change one small thing, or "Switch Case Smell" where giant switch cases control the flow of your app. The best thing about Refactoring (book) is that it recommends ways to fix code smells and takes a pragmatic view about them - they are just like real smells - you can live with some of them, but not with others.
