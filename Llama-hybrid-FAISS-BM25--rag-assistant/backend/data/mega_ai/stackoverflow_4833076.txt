Creating files from record in database in .Net

I have a database table with the following structure: Columns: DealID (int), CustomerID (int), DocumentArchiveID (int), DealXML (string of XML) The issue is: a value for the CustomerID field can appear multiple times in the table but for each time it appears the DealXML associated with it is unique. I need to connect to the table and create a file of the XML contained in the DealXML column - but only one file per CustomerID. So basically if a CustomerID appears 5 times I need to create one file with all the related DealXML data in that file... if a CustomerID appears only once then I create a single file with just that CustomerID's DealXML in it. So at the end of it all I need one file per each unique instance of CustomerID but each file should contain all the DealXML data associated with that particular CustomerID. I am at a complete loss as to how to accomplish this and I'm facing a deadline. Summary: need to create a file for each unique instance of CustomerID (a CustomerID can appear many times in the table, each time with a distinct DealXML that needs to go into the file) - each file contains all the DealXML for that particular CustomerID. I thought of creating a FileStream with FileMode.Append, creating a unique file for each unique CustomerID in the database but unfortunately I do not have control over what I name my files (they must adhere to a convention established outside my organization) and cannot use this method to create unique files (based on the CustomerID) which was my first idea. I'm doing this in .Net platform using C# and a SQL Server 2008 database. Any help? Anyone? Feedback deeply appreciated.
