Firstly, while you're specifically asking about future prediction, RNNs can be used in a variety of applications, including translation from one language to another, detecting a music instrument player in an audio file, speech recognition, and others. RNNs are especially well setup to deal with time-dependent series, since you are feeding it your input sequence step-by-step, one value at at time, and each value gets incorporated into the RNN in the form of "memory" (which can be short- or long-term). So, by design, not all points in your input series are treated equally, RNN "knows" about the order. At each step RNN can decide what information from the past to drop or pass on to the next step. Another advantage of RNNs is that you set it up such that you can feed sequences or variable length to it and it will still perform well. It can also output variable length sequences. This is especially useful in applications like speech recognition, translation, sentiment analysis, and others where the input and/or output cannot be made to be constant length. For many applications, including the one you described in your question, you can indeed use other ML algorithms and they may work perfectly well for you. But it's the versatility of RNNs combined with the power of deep learning that makes them so useful for processing ordered sequences and it's the reason why it's used in most of the state-of-the-art NLP applications.
