As Peter Flom suggests, logistic regression would be a good place to start. If your goal is automated prediction more than an easily interpretable model, you might want to read through the solutions thread for Kaggle's Event Recommendation Engine contest. That was focused on a binary interested/not outcome, but otherwise has some similarities to your problem.
