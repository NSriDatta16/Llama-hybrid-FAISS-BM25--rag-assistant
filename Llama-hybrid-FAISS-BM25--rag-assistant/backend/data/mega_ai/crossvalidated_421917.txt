Related answer here from just yesterday. If the distribution you observe is the distribution you wish to test, then binning forfeits information and will thus on average reduce your ability to (in this case) reject the hypothesis that the distributions are different between the two groups. There are 3 important caveats, though. 1) the tests you use matter. For example, if you bin and do a chi-square, you might still expect more power to reject the null of independence than if you don't bin and test for stochastic dominance, because it's very difficult to reject the null hypothesis of no stochastic ordering. However, it should be easy to see that if you bin and do a t test, you'll get worse power than if you do a t test on the original data. I suspect that this is what's occurring in your example, since it seems easier to reject independence than to reject the bizarre Wilcoxon null (though I don't have a proof of this, maybe someone else can jump in). 2) finite samples might yield anomalous results sometimes. 3) if you believe there is significant measurement error and the binned data are "closer" to the actual thing you'd like to have measured, then binning might be a good idea. If the percents you have are imprecise/ad-hoc, then doctors might feel that the bins are a more faithful representation of the disease's progression. However, they might just feel more comfortable with the chi-square, which by itself is not a good reason. Try a t test on the original percents. Your sample size is small enough that it shouldn't be completely trusted unless the percentages look very normally distributed, but I'll bet it gets a lower p-value than the chi-square.
