Context is information outside of the scope of the thing you're currently doing but which has implications that may be essential. Imagine if someone asks you the meaning of the English word "fly". There are multiple definitions: the buzzing little inspects or the sustained act of gliding through air. In order to give the right answer you need the context which tells you which definition they're looking for - are they reading a book about Diptera or the Wright brothers? Regarding computing, say you're implementing an HTTP handler. It might be able to generate a response without knowing anything else (Hello, World!) but it's more likely that it needs the context of the HTTP request information - what were the request parameters, acceptable encoding types, etc. so it can produce a meaningful response to the user agent.
