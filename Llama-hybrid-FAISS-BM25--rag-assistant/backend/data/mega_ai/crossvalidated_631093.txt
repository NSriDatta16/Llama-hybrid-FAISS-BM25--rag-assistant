If you just want to estimate the prevalence of the phenomenon in the population, rather than identify the the particular instances of the phenomenon, then I would use e.g. logistic regression to make a probabilistic classifier that estimates the probability of class membership and then apply the algorithm of Saerens et al. which can be used to adjust the output of a probabilistic classifier to compensate for unknown operational class frequencies that are not the same as those in the training data (it is an EM-type algorithm). As a by product it gives you an estimate of the operational class frequencies.
