these are bit fields. in structs you can define how many bits are assigned to the variable (overriding the standard for the variable type) in the example above x only uses 1 byte and can thus only take the value 0 or 1. see the following example from the C book . follow the link for more information. struct { /* field 4 bits wide */ unsigned field1 :4; /* * unnamed 3 bit field * unnamed fields allow for padding */ unsigned :3; /* * one-bit field * can only be 0 or -1 in two's complement! */ signed field2 :1; /* align next field on a storage unit */ unsigned :0; unsigned field3 :6; }full_of_fields;
