Waveform API from Apple commercial?

In the new iPhone 3GS commercial, Apple shows voice control with a cool blue waveform animation. Is this visual effect for rendering the waveforms (or maybe just volumes) available as an API call or source code somewhere? (Not the voice control part, just the audio visualization) I think you could get the sound info from AVAudioPlayer's averagePowerForChannel: method, but how would you show the waves moving up and down? Thanks!
