Launching Vim via Lua

I'm writing a simple little Lua commandline app that will build a static website. I'm storing my fragments in a sqlite database. Retrieving the data from the db is straightforward as is saving it; my question comes from editing the data. Is there an elegant way to pipe the data from Lua to vim? Can vim edit a memory buffer and return it? I was planning on launching the editor via os.execute('vim') but only after grabbing a temporary file handle and dumping the database output into that. I would like to have to avoid touching the filesystem that way but that is my contingency plan.
