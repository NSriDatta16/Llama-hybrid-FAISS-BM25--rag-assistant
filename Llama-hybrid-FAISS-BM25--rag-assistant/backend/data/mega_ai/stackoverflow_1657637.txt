IFNULL equivalent in Hibernate Query Language?

I'm trying to write an HQL query which will calculate an average rating for an item. I want the query to return 0 instead of null when there are no rating for a given item - so that I can use my query as a subquery. So is it possible? Is there an HQL equivalent of IFNULL or NVL?
