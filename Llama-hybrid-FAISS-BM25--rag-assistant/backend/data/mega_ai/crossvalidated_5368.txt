Why would it not make sense to apply factor analysis after PCA?

I think that after apply PCA the covariance between components is reduced since the aim of PCA is to maximize variance. Covariance is needed by Factor analysis and thus it does not make sense to operate on the data in PCA space. Does this make any sense? Does someone have any other explanation?
