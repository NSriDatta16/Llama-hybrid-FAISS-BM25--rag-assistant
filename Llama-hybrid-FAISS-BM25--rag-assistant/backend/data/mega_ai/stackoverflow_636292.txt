Yes, it's called method_missing ; it gets called whenever an undefined method is used. You can use it to add or emulate any method you want, including accessors. For example, if you throw this on a Hash you can treat the contents of the hash as properties: h = {} def h.method_missing(*args) if args.length == 1 self[args[0]] elsif args.length == 2 and args[0].to_s =~ /^(.*)=$/ self[$1.intern] = args[1] else super end end let's you write: h.bob = "Robert" and if h.bill == "William" ... and so on in addition to the more normal h[:bob] = ... style.
