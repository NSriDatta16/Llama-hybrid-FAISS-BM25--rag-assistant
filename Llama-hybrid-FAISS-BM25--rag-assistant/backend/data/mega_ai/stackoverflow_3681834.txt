Is there an official reference stating that battery life is one of the reasons why a Garbage Collector was not included inside iOS?

In the following SO question , it is mentionned that the Garage Collector was not included in iOS in order to conserve battery power. Is there an offical reference from Apple stating that battery life is one of the reasons why a Garbage Collector was not included inside iOS? I have been looking for it on google but was not able to find anything relevant.
