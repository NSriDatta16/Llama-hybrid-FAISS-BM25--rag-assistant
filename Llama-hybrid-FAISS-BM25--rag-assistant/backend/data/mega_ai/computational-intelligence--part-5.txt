ing together cognitive, emotional and environmental effects and experiences to acquire, enhance or change knowledge, skills, values and world views. Learning theories then helps understanding how these effects and experiences are processed, and then helps making predictions based on previous experience. Probabilistic methods Being one of the main elements of fuzzy logic, probabilistic methods firstly introduced by Paul Erdos and Joel Spencer in 1974, aim to evaluate the outcomes of a Computation Intelligent system, mostly defined by randomness. Therefore, probabilistic methods bring out the possible solutions to a problem, based on prior knowledge. Impact on university education According to bibliometrics studies, computational intelligence plays a key role in research. All the major academic publishers are accepting manuscripts in which a combination of Fuzzy logic, neural networks and evolutionary computation is discussed. On the other hand, Computational intelligence isn't available in the university curriculum. The amount of technical universities in which students can attend a course is limited. Only British Columbia, Technical University of Dortmund (involved in the European fuzzy boom), Georgia Southern University and Multimedia University from Malaysia are offering courses from this domain. The reason why major university are ignoring the topic is because they don't have the resources. The existing computer science courses are so complex, that at the end of the semester there is no room for fuzzy logic. Sometimes it is taught as a subproject in existing introduction courses, but in most cases the universities are preferring courses about classical AI concepts based on Boolean logic, turing machines and toy problems like blocks world. Since a while with the upraising of STEM education, the situation has changed a bit. There are some efforts available in which multidisciplinary approaches are preferred which allows the student to understand complex adaptive systems. These objectives are discussed only on a theoretical basis. The curriculum of real universities wasn't adapted yet.
