Interesting paper. One of the things I get out of it is that it's not easy to make sense out of user event logs unless you have a very specific hypothesis you are trying to test. They can be very useful, for example, if you know it's taking users too long to complete Task X or they're failing to complete it altogether. It's clearly a whole different ballgame to try to analyze sequences without any other supporting information and make sense out of them (though it can be done if you use the sophisticated techniques mentioned in the paper). One simpler method would be to simply measure the total time to complete a given task that you know is common and important. If it's a shopping application, for example, the time to complete the check-out on a purchase would probably be something useful to collect. It's not quite that simple, though, because you'd have to at least take into account interruptions (e.g., the user's boss came into the room and he abandoned his shopping for actual work--not that I've ever done this :-P). You could have a simple rule that says, if there were no events logged for X seconds, assume the user is not paying attention to the screen. Another simple thing you could do would be to check for obvious signs of errors, such as a user employing the "undo" facility or inputting information into an input box in a web app that causes a validation check to trigger (e.g., failing to enter required information and putting information in the wrong format). If certain input boxes result in a high number of errors, it might be a sign you should be more flexible in allowing different formats (e.g., allow users to enter a date as "6/28/09", "6-28-09", "june 28, 2009" instead of requiring a single format). One other idea: if your application has contextual help, certainly count how many times people use it for each page/section/module of your application. I doubt anything I'm saying is earth shattering, but maybe it will give you some ideas. -Dan
