Too many logistic regression predictors: create multiple models for subsets of predictors?

I'm using logistic regression to look for association between independent variables and outcome (i.e. not to create a classifier). I have many variables, and a sample size of 391 (with 58 y=1 and the rest all y=0). By the rule of 10s, I am limited to 5 independent variables. Is it possible to test associations by creating two models, one on a subset independent variables (IV1, IV2, IV3, IV4, and IV5) and the other on the remaining ones (IV6, IV7, IV8)? I would then test each model separately for over-fitting, etc. My result could, theoretically, be IV3 has p-value 0.002 and IV8 has p-value 0.01 and I would conclude (assuming goodness-of-fit tests are good) that there is an association between outcome and IV3 as well as IV8. Does that make sense?
