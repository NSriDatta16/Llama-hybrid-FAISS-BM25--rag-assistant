I don't know much about iPhone development but I think it would be better to support both if possible. For the "local" scenario P2P is the way to go. The players can easily discover each other and start a game without the hassle of setting a server and connecting to it. On the other hand if you want the game to be playable over the internet, I think a client-server model is more suited. You can also host statistics on the server (high scores?) organize tournaments and more.
