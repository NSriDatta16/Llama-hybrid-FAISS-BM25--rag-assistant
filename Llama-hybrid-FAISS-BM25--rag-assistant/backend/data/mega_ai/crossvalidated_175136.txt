Analyzing data which could be interval or ordinal, in a pretest posttest deisgn

The BDI-II is given to 30 participants prior to treatment. The data is kept in both raw form (interval) and organized in ranks from "minimal, mild, moderate, and severe" (1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). a 16 week treatment plan is conducted and the BDI-II is repeated. No dropouts. No control group. What method of analysis would be best for this pre-test/post-test design?
