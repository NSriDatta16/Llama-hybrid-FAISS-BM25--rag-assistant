I don't know the bootstrap facilities of SPSS, but if you can save the bootstrap estimates and inspect those then that may give a hint of what is going on. Below is how I would start in Stata. In this case there is no problem. In your case I would suspect to see a bimodal distribution: a set of samples will be unproblematic and another set will suffer from some problem (e.g. near perfect separation) and will have odds ratios that are off the chart. . sysuse nlsw88, clear (NLSW, 1988 extract) . tempfile bootstr . logit union grade i.race i.south, /// > vce(bootstrap, reps(1000) saving(`bootstr') nodots) Logistic regression Number of obs = 1876 Replications = 1000 Wald chi2(4) = 87.46 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -999.6188 Pseudo R2 = 0.0434 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Observed Bootstrap Normal-based union | Coef.
