Choose nlp api (java)

I am (very) new to the field of NLP, I tried to look for an API (in Java) that can tell me if two pieces of text have the same meaning (or if one is derived by the other) for example: "billy said tom was a nice kid" is the same as "tom is a nice kid according to billy" I checked GATE and openNlp and it seems like GATE only offers API for annotations and openNlp doesnt support it as well.
