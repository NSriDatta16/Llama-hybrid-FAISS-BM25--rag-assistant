Yet another gotcha: The framework code that calls the Drag-events swallow all exceptions. You might think your event code is running smoothly, while it is gushing exceptions all over the place. You can't see them because the framework steals them. That's why I always put a try/catch in these event handlers, just so I know if they throw any exceptions. I usually put a Debugger.Break(); in the catch part. Before release, after testing, if everything seems to behave, I remove or replace these with real exception handling.
