Extracting the text from a pdf file is anything but trivial. To quote from th iTextSharp tutorial. "The pdf format is just a canvas where text and graphics are placed without any structure information. As such there aren't any 'iText-objects' in a PDF file. In each page there will probably be a number of 'Strings', but you can't reconstruct a phrase or a paragraph using these strings. There are probably a number of lines drawn, but you can't retrieve a Table-object based on these lines. In short: parsing the content of a PDF-file is NOT POSSIBLE with iText." There are several commercial applications which claim to be able to do it. Caveat Emptor. There is also a free software library called Poppler http://poppler.freedesktop.org/ which is used by the pdf viewers of GNOME and KDE. It has a function called pdftotext() but I have no experience with it. It may be your best free option.
