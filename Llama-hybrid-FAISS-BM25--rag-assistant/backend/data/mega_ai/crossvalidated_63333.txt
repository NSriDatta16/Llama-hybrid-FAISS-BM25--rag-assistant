Sparsity regularization for eigenvectors

One way to think about finding the eigenvectors of a matrix $A$ is that they are the critical points of the functional $\vec x^\top A \vec x$ subject to $\|\vec x\|_2=1$. To regularize this problem, it is easy enough to ask that we minimize $\vec x^\top A \vec x+\varepsilon\|\vec x\|_2^2$, since this corresponds to finding eigenvectors of $A+\varepsilon I$. Is there a way to replace $\|\vec x\|_2^2$ with an $L^1$ norm to encourage sparsity in $\vec x$? What sort of computation would result? Is it tractable?
