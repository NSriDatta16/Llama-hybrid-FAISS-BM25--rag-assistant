How to calculate output of neural network layers

I want to know how I can calculate the output layer from (number of neurons and shape of that) of deep neural network layers. Suppose we have 32 * 32 image input of 2D convolution layer with parameters: num_filters = 96, kernel_size = 5, stride = 1, pad = 2. How do I calculate output form or for pooling layer or other layers existing in deep neural networks?
