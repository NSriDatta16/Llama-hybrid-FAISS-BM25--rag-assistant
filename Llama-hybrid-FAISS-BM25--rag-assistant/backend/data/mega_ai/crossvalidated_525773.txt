ML model to predict values from text (a lot of training training data)

I have around 1M entries of the type: id | big5_openness | big5_conscientiousness | big5_extraversion | big5_agreeableness | big5_neuroticism | input_text Where id is just the identifier of some user (it is not important), the big5 values are numbers between 0 and 100 (showing how much of each of them a person is), and the input_text is the text that is used to predict this values. These are actual predictions, but I want to develop an algorithm that uses these predictions as training data to predict these values for an arbitrary text . Here is some information on how the original predictions were made by the software that created the data: ( https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/personality-insights?topic=personality-insights-science ) Does anyone know what kind of ML algorithm I could use to train on this type of data (where the input is text, and the predictions are 5 discrete classes? For me, this immediately looks like a problem that can be solved by neural network (encode the texts somehow). Thank you in advance, have a great day!
