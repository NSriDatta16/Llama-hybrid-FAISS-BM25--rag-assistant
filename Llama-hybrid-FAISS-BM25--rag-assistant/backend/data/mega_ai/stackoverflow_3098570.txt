First of all, SendTo is only used for UDP sockets. In the code snippet above, you are opening a TCP socket. SendTo won't work with a TCP socket. Try it with a UDP socket and see if it works. Bear in mind that the maximum practical size of a UDP packet is 65,507 bytes. Generally, you want to keep UDP packets small to avoid fragmentation by the various network elements involved with their transmission. EDIT: Use TcpClient to make your life easier. Int32 port = 13293; String host = "somehost.com"; TcpClient tcpClient = new TcpClient(host, port); Byte[] data = System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("your message to send"); NetworkStream stream = tcpClient.GetStream(); stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
