How can I search into database with WPF and Linq-to-entities model

I prepare a WPF project, where I want to implement a more complex search. I use LINQ to entities through the ADO.NET Entity model and plan to do the display in WPFToolkit DataGrid. My search window should allow search by a few different criteria. My idea is to be able to write in (for example) name, surname and occupation textboxes in the application and receive a list of all people in the selected table that correspond to all 3 search parameters. I want to be able to search when all are entered or even if only one is entered. I suppose that the other option is to bind the form to the database...still, I do not know how to search like this (I know how to display info, edit it and insert...but not search). I though of applying a string to query mechanism, but in vain. Seems that it's not working. Please, share some ideas of how can I do this. Any source or code fragment will be appreciated. Thank you!
