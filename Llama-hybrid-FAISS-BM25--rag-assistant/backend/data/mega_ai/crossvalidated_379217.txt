Multicolinearity (and VIF) in logistic regression is already discussed on this site, e.eg VIF calculation in regression or Binary Logistic Regression Multicollinearity Tests . Can you use VIF with binary (0/1) variables ? Why not? VIF only depends on the design matrix, and no distributional assumptions are needed! Then the last question about variable selection. This is much discussed on this site, so search. The short answer is NO , the best approach is to select your variables before looking at the data. If that for some reason is impossible (to many variables, ...), then think about regularization. Otherwise, look through this list and especially Variable selection for predictive modeling really needed in 2016?
