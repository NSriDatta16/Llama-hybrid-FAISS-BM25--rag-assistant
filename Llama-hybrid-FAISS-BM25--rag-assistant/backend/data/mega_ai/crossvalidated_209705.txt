A couple of minor points to start with: First, if alpha is based on correlations, then it's referred to as standardized alpha. Alpha is calculated based on variances. Second, alpha is not used (or should not be used) to determine the presence of unidimensionality. Onto the main point. Alpha is a measure of reliability, and reliability is the correlation between the true score and the measured score. As you increase the length of a scale, you get better reliability and the correlation increases (via the Spearman Brown prediction formula - which has a Wikipedia entry). Just like when you increase the size of a sample, your estimates become more reliable. A short scale with a low average interitem correlation will have low reliability, a long scale with the same average interitem correlation will be more reliable. (I'm not sure I understand the part of the question about multicollinearity).
