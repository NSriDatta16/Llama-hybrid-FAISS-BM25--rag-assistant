It seems like the truncated citation censored the relevant part: These differences involve not only what is counted as being a relevant solution, but even the basic statement of the context being considered. Different approaches have been employed to solve this problem, and they seem to had been discussed in one your questions. A simple an important difference appears by comparing the classical and the Bayesian formulation of the problem since, from a Bayesian perspective, point hypothesis are not of interest given that the probability of any point is zero for continuous random variables (this also applies to $P(\mu_1=\mu_2\vert \text{data})=0$). This implies a different formulation of the problem for each framework. The references in the wikipedia article are too selective (there is an immense amount of literature on this topic) and they are not up to date. However, I think it represents a good starting point (which might be closer to the spirit of wikipedia, since it does not aim to be an exhaustive reference).
