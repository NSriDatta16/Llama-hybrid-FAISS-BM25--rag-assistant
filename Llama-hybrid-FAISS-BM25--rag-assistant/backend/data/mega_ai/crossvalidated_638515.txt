How to write the AR polynomial for a model containing a constant?

I'm working on an exercise, Consider the autoregressive time series model $$y_t=c+\frac{1}{3}y_{t-1}-\frac{1}{2}y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t,\tag{$\ast$}$$ where $\epsilon_t$ is white noise with variance $1$ . Write $(\ast)$ in compact form using the backward shift operator $B$ . Show $(\ast)$ is causal. I see I can write $(\ast)$ as $$ \epsilon_t = \phi(B)y_t-c, \text{ where } \phi(x)=1-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}x^2,$$ but I don't know how to include $c$ in $\phi$ or how to do a causality test without having the whole expression in the form $\epsilon_t=\phi(B)y_t$ . Could someone give me a pointer?
