I think you could look into dependency parsing . Your fact tuples could be extracted from edges in depencency graph. PS1 If you want to do something on NLP you should check cs224n and not cs231n. I also recall cs224 contains a section on DL for dependency parsing. PS2 The dependency tree is taken from Stanford Neural Network Dependency Parser
