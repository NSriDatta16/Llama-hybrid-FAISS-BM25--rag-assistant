IF you have a the proper license for the typeface you can embed it with @font-face which can work cross browser provided you have the rights to take the font an convert it. There are also tools like Cufon and sIFR that use flash or JS to emebed and use fonts. CUFON i think you still need a license to convert to its format for embedding... sIFR really gets around the licensing since it being embedded in a flash movie.
