You can use Java Web Start, as you can use a self-signed certificate to sign your files. This will give your users a warning which they can accept once and for all. I would therefore recommend you going that way, as this is the only standard Java way to do what you want, and it works reasonably well. With the latest Java 6 update you get a lot of new, useful functionality. A piece of advice: When you release a new version, put the jars in a new location so the URL's pointing to the jar-files inside the JNLP-file change! This is because Java Web Start caches the jar-files and this is the best way we have found to ensure that the cache is accurate. EDIT: I believe you can also use JSmooth to wrap the Java files in an EXE-file, which transparently extracts the various files on the local computer and executes them there. This should not lock the original EXE file. I would, however, recommend you use the Web Start approach.
