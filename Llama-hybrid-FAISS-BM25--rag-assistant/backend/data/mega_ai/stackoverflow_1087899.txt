These answers pointed me towards what I was looking for. The underlying process needed special attention to kill it. I needed to jump out of the loop. Thanks again, Stack Overflow. while (!feof($pipes[1]) && !connection_aborted()) { echo fgets($pipes[1]); } if (connection_aborted()) { exec('kill -4 '.$mypid); }
