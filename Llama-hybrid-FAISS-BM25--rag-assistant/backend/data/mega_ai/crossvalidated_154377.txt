I'll add another perspective. In E. T. Jaynes incredible book Probability Theory: The Logic Of Science , he gives a rigorous treatment of an extension of Aristotelian logic to degrees of belief (Jaynes was a baysean to the core). That is, he explores a probability theory so that $P = 1$ and $P = 0$ correspond to True and False in classical first order logic. He outlines a few desirable properties that such an extension must have: I. Degrees of Plausibility are represented by real numbers. II. Qualitative Correspondence with common sense. IIIa. If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way must lead to the same result. IIIb. Always take into account all of the evidence relevant to a question. Do not arbitrarily ignore some of the information, basing its conclusions only on what remains. In other words, the theory is completely non-ideological. IIIc. Always represent equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent plausibility assignments. That is, if in two problems the state of knowledge is the same (except perhaps for the labeling of the propositions), then it must assign the same plausibilities in both. all of these statements are given rigorous interpretations in the book. Then Jaynes gives a deeply fascinating and rigorous mathematical demonstration that Bayesian reasoning is the unique extension of logic to degrees of belief that satisfies these requirements. So in the sense of Jaynes, the answer is actually no , if you want your theory to be compatible with Aristotle, Bayes is the only way.
