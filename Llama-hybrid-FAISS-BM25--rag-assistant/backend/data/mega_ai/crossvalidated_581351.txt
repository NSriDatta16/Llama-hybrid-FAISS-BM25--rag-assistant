The various information criteria (Bayesian, Aikake) and e.g. Cp try to estimate this. So for example, the Bayesian information criterion ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion ) measures fit by likelihood, except the final score is also penalised if you have more parameters because then you're more likely to be overfitting. Mallow's Cp and the Aikake Information Criterion works on similar principles but are tweaked slightly differently. However, if you have access to a computer, cross validate. Cross validation is the solution to the problem.
