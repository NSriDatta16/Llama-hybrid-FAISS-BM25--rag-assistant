Anyone using Scheme/LISP for embedded projects?

This question is maybe somehow inspired with Anyone using Python for embedded projects? ; so anyone using some Scheme version or Common Lisp (like ECL) for free/oss/commercial projects? Personally, I used (and still using) TinyScheme for personal projects where some embedded language is needed, mostly due extremely easy embedding (sorry Python lovers, been there and that is quite painful, especially after I learned from TinyScheme how things can be simple).
