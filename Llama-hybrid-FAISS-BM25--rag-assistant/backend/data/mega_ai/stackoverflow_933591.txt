I would take a look at Hashcash . With an effective hash algorithm, like md5, the time to calculate a collision to exponential with the number of bits. What Hashcash does is calculates partial collisions. That is, a match of say the lower 16 bits of the hash. To get the lower 16 bits to match, one would have to try hashing 2^15 different combinations on average. If you know how long it takes to come up with a 16, 24, or 32 bit collision, then you can easily calculate out the time for higher numbers of bits.
