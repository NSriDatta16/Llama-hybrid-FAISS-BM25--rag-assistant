this may help a little bit: 1) go to http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/ and insert you website and download an xml map, then upload it in you website folder. You can also make it by your own (google it) 2) go to http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ and add your website (if it is not present yet) 3) click on you site and in the bottom right you can see the sitemaps tab, you can enter the url of your updated xml map 4) in your robots.txt file add this: User-agent: * Sitemap: http://www.yoursite.com/sitemap.xml 5) go to facebook, twitter, delicious, digg, and other social bookmarking and save your new pages
