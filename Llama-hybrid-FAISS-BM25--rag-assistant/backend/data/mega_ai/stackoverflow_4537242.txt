The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a standardized protocol for building REST APIs. It is a web protocol for querying and updating data, which can be freely incorporated in various kinds of data access applications OData v4 specifies many best practices for REST APIs including a terse, hypermedia-oriented JSON format. OData v4 is an OASIS Standard , with more than 20 companies participating on the technical committee. Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce, and many other companies are strong advocates of the protocol as a solution to an otherwise fragmented REST API landscape. This same standardization allows generic hypermedia clients to consume the service. excel , tableau and openui5 are well known data clients that have support for consuming OData.
