Most likely, not trained enough, keep training. have at least 500~600 well-labelled images for one Class. use tensorboard to observe loss trend, keep training till loss doesn't change much. 10K steps normally would do. try another model, SDD may not be able to extract enough features for certain Class. try Fast RCNN, or inception or hybird model.
