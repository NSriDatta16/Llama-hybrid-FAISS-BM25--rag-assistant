There is very little structure in your data. Your ACF/PACF plots do not indicate any kind of autoregressive behavior. In such a case, an extremely simple forecast, like the overall historical average, may be the best you can do . This may well be what your automatic ARIMA or ETS method yields. Alternatively, you could try to search for drivers of historical dynamics, like promotions or similar activities. If you can forecast those, you can use them to improve your forecast of your focal time series. You may want to take a look at How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? Incidentally, if by "I transformed back after forecasting" you mean that you exponentiated the point forecast that was calculated on logged data, I hope you know that this will not give an expectation forecast, but a median forecast. The difference is often minor, but in particular for high volatility series, it can be crucial. See the "Bias adjustments" section here . (I recommend the entire online textbook.) It's usually better to rely on a proven piece of software to determine whether Box-Cox transformations are indicated, and do the transformations and back-transformations. The gold standard are still the forecast and fable packages for R (both written by the author of the textbook I linked).
