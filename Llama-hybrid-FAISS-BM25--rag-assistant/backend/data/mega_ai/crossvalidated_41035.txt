Nick is right, a Beta distribution seems like the natural choice here. In principle, you can have any proposal distribution you like. As long as the proposal distribution covers the range of the parameter distribution that you wish to sample from, then MCMC is guaranteed to converge on the right distribution. This means, however, that the Dirichlet distribution is NOT appropriate, because it does not cover all possible sets of parameters; namely it does not cover those that do not sum to one. In practice, the proposal distribution can have a big influence on how fast you reach convergence, so you should try to pick one that proposes 'good' parameter values (near the mode of the posterior distribution) more frequently. You could adapt the Beta distribution to reflect any knowledge you may have about where the mode of the true parameter distribution may lie. If you have no prior knowledge, then you might just as well propose from a uniform distribution over the interval [0,1].
