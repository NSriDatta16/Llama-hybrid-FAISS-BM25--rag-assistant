Sample size that will give statistically significant results

I have a computer program which I am trying to optimize. Suppose that I can collect random test cases which I will use to run both the original and the modified version to see if there are any speedups. How can I calculate the sample size (number of test cases) which makes sure that the average speed-up/down I am getting is a significant one ? Any ideas is appreciated.
