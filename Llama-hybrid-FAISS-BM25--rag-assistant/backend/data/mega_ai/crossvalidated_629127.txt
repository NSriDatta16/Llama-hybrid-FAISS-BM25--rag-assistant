One solution would be to fit one binomial GLM (logistic regression) per answer. In R, it would look something like this : glm(question n~group, family=binomial) this way you would know if the outcome of one particular question is explained by the group the participant belongs to, i.e. if the answer to the question which is the response variable of your model is different whether the order of the questions is randomized. However, this approach is not multivariate.
