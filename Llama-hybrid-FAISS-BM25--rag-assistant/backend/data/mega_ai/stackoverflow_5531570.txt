Browsers lie about their "user agent" to give web sites a break. You're running 9, you cannot have 8 and 9 installed at the same time unless you used the beta version. See this blog post for details about the user agent string. If you want to make sure then look at the DLL version that gets loaded. Project + Properties, Debug, tick "Unmanaged code debugging". Start your program, Debug + Break All. Debug + Windows + Modules and locate ieframe.dll in the list. The version number column should tell you. I'm getting "8.00.7600.16385 (win7_rtm.090713-1255)", the Win7 release version. I don't have IE9 installed yet.
