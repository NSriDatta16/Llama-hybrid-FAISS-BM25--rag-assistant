There is no quick solution to the problem, since the deterministic trend is just a function of $t$. We may denote this trend by $f(t)$ and it is not evident that the trend is linear. So some quick tips what to do in this case: Plot the original data, though the noise ratio could be huge therefore... Make technical decomposition of your time series into Trend + Cycle + Seasonal + Residual components and try to plot them (implementation of this step depends on the software you do use), usual approach is to apply Hodrick-Prescott filter for example. After you decide on the form of trend you may conclude that some polynomial $\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i t^i$ is suitable, to check this you may apply $n$ times difference operator, the reminder term should be close to white noise then... If it is not search in addition for the best fit from the $(S)ARMA(p, q)$ class (since there is no unit root in your case, in general you will work with SARIMA, or some advanced users would go for SARFIMA-GARCH may be :)). Decide on the efficient estimate of the final model on the basis of any information criteria you think is relevant ($BIC$ for example). Anyway, the time series models are needed for short term forecasting needs (without clear structure and theoretical restrictions long-term forecasts are useless), short and long term betas therefore are just a matter of curiosity. Since you do not have a structural model here you do not need to care about consistency . For forecasting needs any parsimonious (the simpler the better) model with lowest information criteria ( the best ) will do nicely in the short run, even if the true data generating process is more complicated.
