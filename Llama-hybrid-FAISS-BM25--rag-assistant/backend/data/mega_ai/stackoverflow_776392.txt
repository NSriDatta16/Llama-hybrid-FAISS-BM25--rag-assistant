I think the best practice for developing CRM extensions meant to be accessed by regular CRM users (ie = each with his/her own CAL) is to store the pages in a folder under the [Installation folder]\CRMWeb\ISV folder. The corresponding dlls though should be placed in the [Installation folder]\CRMWeb\bin folder. For me this turns out to be C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\CRMWeb\ISV\MyApp That is, not in the Server folder, but in the CRMWeb folder. As far as the multi-tenancy is concerned, you will have to use a CrmAuthenticationToken parameter when calling the CRM Web Services. This token in turn has a property called OrganizationName. UI-Integrated extensions like IFrames, Buttons etc already provide your pages with this information as a GET parameter. Check this MSDN link to view an example.
