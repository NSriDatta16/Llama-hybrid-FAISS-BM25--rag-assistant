The way to understand Max features is "Number of features allowed to make the best split while building the tree" . The reason to use this hyperparameter is, if you allow all the features for each split you are going to end up exactly the same trees in the entire random forest which might not be useful. To overcome this we let the model select a fixed number of features randomly, in this case, the no of features allowed = Square root of total no of features in your dataset. Hope this clears up !!
