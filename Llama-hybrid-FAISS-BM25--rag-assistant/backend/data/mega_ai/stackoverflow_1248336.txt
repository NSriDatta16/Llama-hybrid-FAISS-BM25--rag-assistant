Guidance needed in Writing Specifications

I was asked (at a place i just began working) to create simple specs for some new functionality that is going to be added to an existing Registration system. I need a little help since i've never done this before. Here are two diagrams that show the current workflow and the new workflow. Current Workflow: http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/102/currentworkflow.png New Workflow http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/6748/newworkflow.png I know they might be a bit vague but here's what's basically happening. We are adding a new import form to an existing windows application. We are modifying an existing form by adding a search button which will search search and populate data read by an ocr. I'm a new developer and i'm pretty bad at writing documents in general, but i would like to improve on this. Maybe some examples on how to go about writing something like this would be helpful. I've googled for some examples, but most of the ones i've found are on creating a brand new system. I need something that shows how to write one for modifying an exisiting system. Here's my attempt at a specification. Maybe someone can critique it. At least then i will know what i need to improve. http://cid-ddb3f6a92ec2b97e.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Specs.docx Thanks
