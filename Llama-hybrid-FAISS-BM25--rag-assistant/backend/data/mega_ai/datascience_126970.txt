Most tree-based models are not a good fit for time series forecasting. I'm not aware of any truly tree-based models that extrapolate outside of the training data as is required for forecasting. As for the other models you mention, better input features for the particular application will result in better model performance. What makes a "better" features is extremely application dependent. I have used rolling moments with good success in a forecasting application. Typically ARIMA and exponential smoothing models are univariate. In fact, every state space model (which exponential smoothing models fall under) has an ARIMA equivalent. The same can be said of their multivariate extensions (see Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing: the State Space Approach by Rob Hyndman). I bring up the fact they are univariate because your question seems like you want to feed multiple features to your model. Features built from a time series do not need to be "fully correlated" with the time series as you say. As an example a transformation from time to something cyclic in time like day of the week or month will not be "fully correlated" with the original input.
