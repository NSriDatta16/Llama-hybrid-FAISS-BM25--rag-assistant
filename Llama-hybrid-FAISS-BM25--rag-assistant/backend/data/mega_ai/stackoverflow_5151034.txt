PsExec gets stuck on licence prompt when running non-interactively

I have a Hudson build script which calls the SysInternals PsExec utility. Normally, when PsExec is run for the first time by a given user it pops up a dialog box asking the user to accept the licence. The build agent runs as a service and I can see that the build gets stuck at PsExec. Process Explorer shows that PsExec is running, so I strongly suspect it's displaying that same prompt, but because it's running non-interactively there is no way to accept the prompt. Is there any way to get around this silly limitation? Running on Windows Server 2008 R2 x64.
