I posted this question on the sqlite-users list and got a response that suggested reducing the cache size for sqlite. This is done by executing the following statement (adjusting the size value as desired): pragma cache_size = 100 EDIT: here's another nifty trick for releasing SQLite memory. Be sure to #define SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT. Documented here: http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/release_memory.html int bytesReleased = sqlite3_release_memory( 0x7fffffff ); NSLog( @"sqlite freed %d bytes", bytesReleased );
