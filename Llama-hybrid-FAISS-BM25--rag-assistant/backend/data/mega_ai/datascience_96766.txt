Use of multiple models vs training a single model for multiple outputs

So let's say I have data with numerical variables A , B and C . I believe that the value of A has an effect on B . I also believe that A and B both have an effect on C . I don't think C has an effect on either A or B . I want to use machine learning to predict A , B , and C . I obviously have A and B as training data, and I have other variables as training data too. Do I simply create multiple models to predict all three, or is there a way to make one model predict them all if I just throw the entire dataset at it?
