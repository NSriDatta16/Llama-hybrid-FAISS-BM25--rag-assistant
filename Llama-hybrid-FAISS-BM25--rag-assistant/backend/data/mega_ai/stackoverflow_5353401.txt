Autotools: Generating Sources and Headers in Makefile.am

This link mentions wildcards as a way to automatically list the SOURCES and HEADERS in the Makefile.am file. It also mentions that some people write external scripts to generate those files. Do you know of the standard way of automatically including all the *.h *.cpp here, or should I just write my own Perl script to generate them. Do you have such a script already that you use? PS: I organize the source files in my project according to the following purely-logical separation of directories: src/dog/woof.h src/dog/woof.cpp src/cow/moo.h src/cow/moo.cpp
