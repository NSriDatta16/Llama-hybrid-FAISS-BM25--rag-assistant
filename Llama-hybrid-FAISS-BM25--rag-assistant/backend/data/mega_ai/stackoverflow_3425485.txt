making TeX documents ragged left justified?

How can I make my entire LaTeX document (using TeXShop in Mac OS X) left justified, in a "ragged left" mode? I don't want to use blocks of \begin{flushleft} everywhere, I just want to declare somewhere in the document header that the whole document should be this way. Right now everything is fully justified (like newspapers) by default.
