In general no. A design pattern is more about how you organise your code to make it comprehensible, maintainable extensible etc. By virtue of this, you might end up with more efficient code but not necessarily. If your algorithm requires that you visit every element in a 3 dimensional data structure of size 2000, then no design pattern can help, you just have a n^3 algorithm and there's nothing you can do about this. The only scope for improvement will be if your algorithm turns out to be naive and maybe visits more elements than is strictly required. harrisunderwork above alludes to this by asking if you are searching; if so, maybe there search algorithm can be made more efficient but again, this is not a question regarding design patterns.
