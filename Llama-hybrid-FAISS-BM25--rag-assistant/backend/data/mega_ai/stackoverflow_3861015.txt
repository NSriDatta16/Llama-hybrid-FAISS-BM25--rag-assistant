$(".articles a").click(function() { articlenumber = "1" $(articlenumber).css("display", "none"); articlenumber = $(this).attr("id"); articlename = $(this).attr("name"); articlenumber = '".' + articlenumber + '"'; $(articlenumber).attr("style", "display:inline;") $(".articletitle").text(articlename) }); Okay, in order of your script: Declare your variables before you try to assign values, terminate the line and remember that 1 is numeric not a string: articlenumber = "1" should be var articlenumber = 1; jQuery typically expects the identifier to be an id , a class or an element-type ( a , li etc). Neither an id nor a class can start with a number, they have to start with either and underscore _ or a letter (plus a couple other characters I can't remember), and there are no elements . This could be a problem since with: $(articlenumber) is equivalent to either: $(1) or $('1') both of which are, or should be, invalid (I think). Then you're reassigning articlenumber again without first declaring it a var (the same is true in the following line when you initialise articlename . I'm not sure if these are your main problems (I removed your commented-out code), but fix the obvious, then we can talk more. I would suggest, strongly, that you get hold of Firebug and watch its console as you load/interact with the page in Firefox. It'll tell you the main problems you're having. Also, as an addenda, I'd strongly suggest that you develop your sites/scripts with either Google Chrome (with the Web Inspector), Safari Webkit (as with Chrome), Mozilla Firefox (with Firebug, as above) and/or Opera (with Dragonfly). These browsers and web-development tools will more or less force you to develop your scripts properly. Once they're working, and valid, then try it in IE. More often than not it'll work there if it works everywhere else, developing in IE first seems to allow you to develop bad habits, and error-prone JavaScript/jQuery, and then become confused, flustered or frustrated when the other browsers refuse to play ball.
