First crappy Google search for "object oriented javascript" turned this up...but it explains the point I wanted to get across: JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming Just take a look at the first paragraph and you find: Javascript isn't a fully Object Oriented programming language. The use of classes in JS is based on the prototype functionality. The Prototype library masks the use of the prototype functionality to create your class. jQuery expects you to use the prototype functionality the same way you would using regular JS to extend jQuery itself and create your own custom objects.
