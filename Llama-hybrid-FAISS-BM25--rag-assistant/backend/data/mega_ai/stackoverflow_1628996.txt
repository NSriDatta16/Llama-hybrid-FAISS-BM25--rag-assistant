Is it possible exclude test directories from coverage.py reports?

I'm kind of a rookie with python unit testing, and particularly coverage.py. Is it desirable to have coverage reports include the coverage of your actual test files? Here's a screenshot of my HTML report as an example. You can see that the report includes tests/test_credit_card . At first I was trying to omit the tests/ directory from the reports, like so: coverage html --omit=tests/ -d tests/coverage I tried several variations of that command but I could not for the life of me get the tests/ excluded. After accepting defeat, I began to wonder if maybe the test files are supposed to be included in the report. Can anyone shed some light on this?
