Statistical significance test for multiple binary classification problems

Let $C_1$, $C_2$ be two binary classifiers, which are used to classify some data (images, videos, etc) to $30$ different classes, using an one-against-all approach. Then, we have two $30$-dimensional vectors containing the performances of the above classifiers in terms of average precision (AP). That is, $$ \mathbf{v}_1 = \big(p_{1,1},\ldots,p_{1,30} \big)^\top, $$ and $$ \mathbf{v}_2 = \big(p_{2,1},\ldots,p_{2,30} \big)^\top, $$ where $p_{i,j}\in[0,1]$, for all possible $i$, $j$. Let $\bar{v}_1$, $\bar{v}_2$ be the mean values of $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$, respectively. Let's assume that $\bar{v}_2>\bar{v}_1$. I would like to test if this is statistically significant. What I have tried so far is the sign test, but I have been advised to also check the McNemar's test. However, I cannot see how I could possibly use this test. What would you suggest me to do? Is there any particular reason why I should prefer McNemar's test over the sign test? How could I use the McMenar's test? Thanks in advance!
