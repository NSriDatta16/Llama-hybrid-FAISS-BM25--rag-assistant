w8004 compiler warning BDS6 c/c++

It is a best practise to initialise a variable at the time of declaration. int TMyClass::GetValue() { int vStatus = OK; // A function returns a value vStatus = DoSomeThingAndReturnErrorCode(); if(!vStatus) //Do something else return(vStatus); } In the debug mode, a statement like this int vStatus = OK; is causing no issues during DEBUG MODE build. The same when build in RELEASE MODE, throws a warning saying: w8004: 'vStatus' is assigned a value that is never used. Also, i am using the same variable further down my code with in the same function,like this if(!vStatus) and also I return the value of return(vStatus); When I looked at the web for pointers on this debug Vs Release , compilers expect you to initialise your variable at the time of declaring it. I am using Borland developer studio 6 with windows 2003 server. Any pointers will help me to understand this issue. Thanks Raj
