In CNN the output feature maps are sensitive to the location of features in the input. If the input image is translated the output feature map will also be affected by the translation, so that small movements in the position of the feature in the input image will result in a different feature map. One way to adress this sensitivity problem is using pooling layers, because of their down sampling ability. Pooling layers create a lower resolution version of the input that still contains the large or important structural elements, without the fine details which may be not usefull for the task. So the max pooling layer makes the image unclear for the human eye by sampling it down to a lower resolution, but for the machine learning model it mostly removes not relevant elements and makes it more robust to changes in the input (like rotation, shifting, translation etc.)
