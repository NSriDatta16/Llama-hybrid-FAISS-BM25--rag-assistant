'Object Expected' Javascript error in IE8

When I run my page on IE8 I got the following error. While it is running fine on Firefox and Chrome. I used the following line to include js. Could you tell me where I'm making a mistake? So that that error is coming on IE8 only. Webpage error details: User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0) Timestamp: Wed, 24 Nov 2010 08:28:06 UTC Message: Object expected Line: 72 Char: 188 Code: 0 URI: http://localhost/auditng.html
