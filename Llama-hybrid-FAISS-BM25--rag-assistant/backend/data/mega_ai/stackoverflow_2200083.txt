Building a tree structure (read as Array) in mysql can be tricky but it is done all of the time. Almost any forum with nested threads has some mechanism to store a tree structure. As another poster said they do not have to be expensive. The real question is how you want to use the data. If you need to be able to add/remove data fields from individual nodes in the tree then you can use one of two models 1) Adjacency List Model 2) Modified Preorder Tree Traversal Algorithm (They sound scary, but it's not that bad I promise.) The first one listed is probably the more common you will encounter and the second is the one I have begun to use more frequently and has some nice benefits once you wrap your head around it. Take a look at this page--it has an EXCELLENT writeup about both. http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database As another poster said though, if you don't need to change the data with queries or search inside the text then use a PHP function to store it in a single field. $array = array('something'=>'fun', 'nothing'=>'to do') $storage_array = serialize($array); //INSERT INTO DB //DRAW OUT OF DB $array = unserialize($row['stored_array']); Presto-changeo, that one is easy.
