How do I plot simple slopes for a significant interaction term in an ordinal logistic regression model?

There are a variety of excel files allowing users to plot simple slopes with various types of estimates (regression coefficients, odds ratios, etc.). I'm wondering if such an excel file for a logit exists. If not, any recommendations on how to create one? Thanks!
