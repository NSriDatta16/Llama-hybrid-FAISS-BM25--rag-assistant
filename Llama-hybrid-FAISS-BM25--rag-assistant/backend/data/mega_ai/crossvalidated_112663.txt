Perhaps should provide us with info on what type of regression your dealing with. The statement that confidence limits including "1.0" are non significant applies to situations when the coefficient is estimating a relative figure, often a "relative risk". This could for example be Cox regression, logistic regression (when exponentiating the coefficients). In these cases, coefficients including 1 are non significant. But if your dealing with linear regression and model, for example, blood pressure as dependent variable and obtain a coefficient on 0.9 for blacks vs whites and a confidence limit landing on 0.8 to 1.0 then this might be extremely significant in terms on p-values; one group has higher blood pressure. In that case, passing 0.0 would imply non significance.
