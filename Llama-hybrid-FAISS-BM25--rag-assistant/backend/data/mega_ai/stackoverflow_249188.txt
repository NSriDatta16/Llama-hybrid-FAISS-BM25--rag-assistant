Implementing an editable DropDownList in ASP.NET

What's the most elegant way of implementing a DropDownList in ASP.NET that is editable without using 3rd party components. As a last resort I will probably try using a TextBox with an AutoCompleteExtender with an image to 'drop down' the list; or a TextBox overlapping a HTML Select with some JavaScript to fill values from the Select to the TextBox . But I'm really hoping there is a more terse and maintainable solution. Thanks in advance.
