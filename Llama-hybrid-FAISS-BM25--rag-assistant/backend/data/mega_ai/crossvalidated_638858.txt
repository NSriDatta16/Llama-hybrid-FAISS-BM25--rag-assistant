Statistical significance different observation windows

I'm sure that this is trivial and I just can't figure out the right keywords. I have a dataset A containing values of how many cars were observed in an hour long window. I have a dataset B containing values of how many cars were observed in 30 minute long window somewhere else. The two datasets are independent and there are enough measurements in both. The task is to find if there is a significant difference in the mean number of cars in the two places. My approach: If the same number of cars passes on average, then I would expect $\mu_A/2 = \mu_B$ to hold. Of course the means aren't exactly the same. How to test for statistical significance here?
