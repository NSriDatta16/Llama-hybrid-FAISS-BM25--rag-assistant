Redirect from Web query open agent on Lotus Domino?

Does anyone know a way of redirecting to another webpage from lotus domino web query an open agent? The print statement does not seem to work. A possible workaround would be very appreciated! Something on that subject can be found here but it seems kind of flaky like this link . Can it be done without JavaScript and major redesign of document form? Thanks in advance.
