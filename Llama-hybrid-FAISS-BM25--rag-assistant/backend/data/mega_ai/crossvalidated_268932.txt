The strategy of having a score for each word, adding them up, and then checking against a threshold to decide if a topic is present or not is a common technique. When you don't care about the order of the words in the sentence it is called the bag-of-words method. There are lots of more sophisticated ways of learning scores for each word--instead of always doing +1 for each word like you did. You could look up the naive Bayes algorithm as a good place to get started. I would recommend sticking with the bag-of-word approach (where single isolated words are treated individually) until you get more farther along. If the accuracy is not as good as you want you can add bi-grams, pairs of adjacent words, as features. For example, you would have scores for (I, live), (live, in), (in, Brown), (Brown, Street). Convolutional neural networks can be used for the problem you are working on. It is just a different way of learning and combining scores for the words in each sentence. My advice is not to do that until you have a solid understanding of the simpler techniques.
