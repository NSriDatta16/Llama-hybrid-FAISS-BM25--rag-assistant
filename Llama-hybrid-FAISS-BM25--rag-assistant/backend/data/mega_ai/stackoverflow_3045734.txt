find() or children() to search top-level children only for a style?

I'd like to find if a child element exists which has either of two class styles applied. My code looks like this: var listOfMatchedResults = $("#parentList").find(".myStyle1, .myStyle2"); My styles are defined like this: .parent li, .myStyle0 { } .parent li.myStyle1 { } .parent li.myStyle2 { } I don't need to traverse more than one level deeper than the children level, like: foo grok Here I am! foo grok I'm not clear as to what find() is doing, is it going into each of the paragraph elements too? I just need it to traverse the top-level children - is there a way to specify that? Thank you
