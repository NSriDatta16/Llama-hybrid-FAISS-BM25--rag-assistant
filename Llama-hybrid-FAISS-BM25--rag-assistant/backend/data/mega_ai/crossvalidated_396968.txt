How does mice::mice work?

The idea of multiple imputation seems to be based on the decomposition $$ p(\theta \mid y_{\text{obs}}) = \int p(\theta \mid y_{\text{obs}}, y_{\text{mis}})p( y_{\text{mis}} \mid y_{\text{obs}}) \text{d}y_{\text{mis}}. $$ One can simulate draws $y_{\text{mis}}^i \sim p( y_{\text{mis}} \mid y_{\text{obs}})$ , estimate the posterior $p(\theta \mid y_{\text{obs}}, y_{\text{mis}}^i)$ for each draw, and then average these results, appealing to the law of total expectation. This is interesting because it's probably more common to sample from the posterior first, and then use those parameter samples to sample unobserved data. Does the R function mice::mice estimate $p( y_{\text{mis}} \mid y_{\text{obs}}) $ without reference to the parameters of interest $\theta$ ? If it does not, and it is actually using the decomposition $$ p( y_{\text{mis}} \mid y_{\text{obs}}) = \int p( y_{\text{mis}} \mid \theta)p(\theta \mid y_{\text{obs}}) \text{d}\theta, $$ then it doesn't seem like I can use any method I wish to do step (2). I'm sure this has been asked before, but I've been having a hard time finding the answer because many search results are devoid of any notation.
