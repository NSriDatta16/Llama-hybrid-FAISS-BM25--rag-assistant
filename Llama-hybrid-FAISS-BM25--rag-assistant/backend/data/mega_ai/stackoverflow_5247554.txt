Slide textview horizontal without using paging

I`m using a simple Textview in an tabbased application to display some text :) I figerd out how to change the text animated using the following code: - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentTouchPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; // To be a swipe, direction of touch must be horizontal and long enough. if (fabsf(startTouchPosition.x - currentTouchPosition.x) >= HORIZ_SWIPE_DRAG_MIN && fabsf(startTouchPosition.y - currentTouchPosition.y) However there is now "slide transition" defined in UIViewAnimationTransition. I know about paging, but I don`t want to use this. Is there an other possibility to have an horizontal slide animation when detecting a horizontal swipe?
