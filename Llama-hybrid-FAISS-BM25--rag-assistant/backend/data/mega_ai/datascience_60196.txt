The drawbacks of one-hot encoding is that it generates very sparse matrices . Neural Networks hate sparse data: gradient descent optimizers give their best on continuous variables, while weight updates do not work very good when there is so little variability. I would never recommend one-hot encoding for ANNs. I use it only when it's absolutely necessary, and avoid it anytime I can. My personal experience as a data scientist tells me sparse data matrices lead to generally bad results. However, what I think you're going to need is a statistical technique called survival analysis . It actually comes with many names: survival regressions, event-history models, duration models, etc. It's a technique invented by biostatisticians several decades ago, that is meant to estimate the probability of the death of a patient, given how much time passed and external variables. It was later applied to many fields of science that have nothing to do with medicine. It can be generalized as a technique that is meant to estimate the likelihood of a termination event happening. Mathematically speaking, it is estimating a 'survival probability' of a process through time. There is plenty of information you can find just googling. A good start is here , here and here . One of the best books ever written on the topic is this one (it's written for social scientist but it's super useful for anybody.) Somebody developed Neural Survival models , using ANNs to estimate the survival probability of a process. However I never happened to try these models in practice. You can read some interesting stuff here and here . This class of models (ANN or not) will let you treat age as a continuous variable.
