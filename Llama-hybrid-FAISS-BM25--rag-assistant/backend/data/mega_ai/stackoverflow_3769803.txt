creating new fragments with class and id behaves strangely in IE8

I have this piece of code which works in Firefox link = $(' link '); var name = $(" ").append(link); $('#container').append(name); However this doesn't work in IE8. It seems that name doesn't get created at all. I tried adding console.log('class of name'+name.attr('class')); and inside the Developer Toolbar, the result is undefined. Hence I look around for another option, and this works: var name = $(' '); name.addClass('name'); name.addClass('section'); name = name.append(link); It does exactly the same thing. I was wondering if IE8 has a thing against using HTML to define DOM fragments, so I tried this: var name = $(" ").append(link); And this works in IE8. What esoteric law of jQuery/IE8 did I break? Is it preferable to use addClass or setting the attribute of new DOM fragments over literal HTML?
