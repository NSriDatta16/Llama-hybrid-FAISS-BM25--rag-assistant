Here, continuous evolution is from lower to higher lifeforms, culminating in bodiless entities. Later in the series, further lifeforms, representing stages between the known shells, were introduced. The main shells are: Lifeless matter Bacteria Higher animals Intelligent species Intelligent species that have contacted other species Superintelligences (SI) Matter sources/ Matter sinks Cosmocrats / Chaotarchs (High Powers) Powers close to the "Horizon of the LAW", the essence of the Multiverse The Superintelligences are the next step above normal minds. They can be born, for example, when a species collectively gives up its bodies and unites their spirits. Such Superintelligences may claim as their domain areas consisting of up to several galaxies (the entity known as "ES ('IT')" has the Local Group as its personal domain). The Superintelligence provides mental support to the species in its domain, sometimes symbiotically (positive SI), sometimes parasitically (negative SI). The Matter Sources/Sinks are born when a Superintelligence fuses with all life and matter in its domain while shrinking. Little more is known except that the process is gradual and that the resulting object lacks the gravitational pull possessed if the contraction produced a black hole. The "high powers" were long thought to be the highest known lifeforms. They live in an unimaginably distant dimension and have great powers in ruling over lower beings. However they are not omniscient and they are unable to directly interact with lower beings. To enter a regular universe they have to assume a mortal shape, thus reducing their powers and sometimes their knowledge and memory. This is known as the transform syndrome. As a consequence, they rarely interact with lower beings and instead enlist individuals, organizations or entire species. Conflict between the high powers Among the high powers are two factions known as the Cosmocrats and the Chaotarchs. The Cosmocrats wish to transform all universes into a state of absolute order (a state of utmost entropy, usual symbol S). The Chaotarchs wish to do the opposite and remake all universes into absolute chaos (or negative entropy). They are engulfed in a cataclysmic neverending war involving nearly all known universes. They manipulate and doom whole species for their actions. Open warfare is just one tool among many. In the 2300â€“2499 cycle the Milky Way galaxy was subjected to open military assault by the forces of chaos trying to establish a bastion of chaos, a Negasphere, in the nearby galaxy Hangay. Recent stories have revealed to the protagonists that life itself has become a rival to the high powers. Spreading uncontrollably among the universe, it can be found in nearly every niche. The Cosmocrats and Chaotarchs both use life for their own directed goals of order and disorder, but life's unplanned and unregulated cosmological actions are a disturbance for and to both. The Pangalactic Statisticians (a neutral organization of observers) have while some cosmological manipulation is caused by the cosmocrat servants and a lesser amount by the chaos servants, the majority is caused by the uncontrollable power of life itself. To reduce the influence of life, the Cosmocrats have stopped their programs that encourage the development of life and intelligence. They have increased the hyperimpedance in order to reduce the effectivity and durability of most forms of hypertechnology. At least one power, called Thez, higher than either Cosmocrats and Chaotarchs has been recently identified. Thez is said to live close to the "Horizon of the LAW" so that both Cosmocrats and Chaotarchs have problems understanding it. Critical reaction In the introduction to the first English-language edition of Perry Rhodan in 1969, editor Forrest J Ackerman said "[i]n
