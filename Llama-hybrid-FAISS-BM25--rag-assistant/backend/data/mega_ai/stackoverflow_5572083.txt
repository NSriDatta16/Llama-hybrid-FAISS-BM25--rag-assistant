Amazon S3 or Personal Server for data storage?

I currently have a budget of a few thousand pounds (GBP) to get a small-scale file hosting project up and running. I had planned to use Amazon S3 for hosting the files that users upload, however this results in having to pay for every byte of space I'm taking up (which is both good and bad, of course). Given that both security and speed are major factors here, would it be wise to stick with S3 or to do things via my own server?
