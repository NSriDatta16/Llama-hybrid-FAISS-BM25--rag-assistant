Picking the right SQL Server collation for storage

How does the collation impact SQL Server in terms of storage and how does this affect the Unicode and non-unicode data types? Does the collation impact Unicode storage? or just govern sort rules within the database? When I use the non-unicode data types what restictions are tied to the collation? If restrictions apply, what happens when I try to store a character not in database collation of a non-unicode data type? My understanding is that the Unicode data type can always store the full set of Unicode data while the non-unicode data types storage capabilties depend on the code page (which is defined by the collation) and can only represent a number of common characters in that collation. Obviously each character in an Unicode data type would at least occupy 2 bytes while the non-unicode data types occupy 1 byte per character (or does this vary with collation as well?) Set me straight here, how does this work exactly?
