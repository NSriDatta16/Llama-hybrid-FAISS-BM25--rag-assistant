phpMyAdmin uses SHOW TABLE STATUS to get information for your tables. From the documentation : Rows The number of rows. Some storage engines, such as MyISAM, store the exact count. For other storage engines, such as InnoDB, this value is an approximation, and may vary from the actual value by as much as 40 to 50%. In such cases, use SELECT COUNT(*) to obtain an accurate count. This is due to InnoDB being an ACID compliant storage engine. InnoDB implements MVCC using row-level locking . In short, there can be multiple copies of a given row at a given time. I suggest reading this article: Understanding InnoDB MVCC .
