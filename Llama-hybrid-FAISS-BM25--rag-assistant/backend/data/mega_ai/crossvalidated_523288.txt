Meta/ Few-shot Learning for time series regression

I am working on the calibration of low-cost air sensor data (a time series regression problem). My primary focus is to use some meta/ few-shot learning approach to solve this problem with a lesser amount of data. I have tried using MAML on top of LSTM/vanilla NN but the results are not convincing. Is there a different approach/paper for meta-regression? Anything that I should be doing differently? Things to avoid etc? Thank you in advance.
