Problem removing and re-adding an image file into my iOS4 app bundle

My problem is something that should be so simple it is mind boggling. When I change the look (in PhotoShop) of an image file that is being stored in my app bundle. My method for replacing the old image in the bundle with the new one is this: 1) remove the old image from the app bundle (choosing to also move to trash) 2) drag the new image into my file hierarchy in xcode (choosing to copy to app directory) when I do this, the app cannot find the image no matter what I do. The new images have the same name as the old images but none of the image loading methods (imageNamed, imageWithContentsOfFile, nibs) work. (Although I believe nibs also load with imageNamed, i'm not sure). Is there something that I am missing here? I feel like it should be a relatively simple process but I am having all kinds of trouble. I also make sure to delete the app off of the target device and clean all targets before rebuilding and running after changing the image files just in case. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
