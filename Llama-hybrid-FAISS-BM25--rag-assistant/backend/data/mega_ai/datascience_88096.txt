I think you can speak of imbalanced targets if (in case of a binary classification problem) the classes are not represented in a 50:50 manner. This is almost always the case. With about 25/75 in your case, I would see this as „imbalanced“. There are some strategies to deal with this problem, such as (re)sampling so that you achieve a 50:50 balanced sample (essentially you will lose observations in the majority class here). Alternatively you can use synthetic oversampling (SMOTE) and related rechniques. However, some packages come with built-in options to deal with unbalanced targets, e.g. sklearn‘s random forest (option class_weight ). Check the docs.
