in dom, what is functional difference between an html element and a fragment?

have found fragments to be very useful in constructing dynamic html - like using a bag of html elements and the bag itself dissolving when put into place - very nice. I had assumed the methods for html elements and fragments were the same, but I think this is incorrect. it seems that fragments have node methods - appendChild() etc - but do not have more sophisticated html element methods, for example, getElementsByTagName() . is this assessment correct? or am I shooting myself in the foot in a new way?
