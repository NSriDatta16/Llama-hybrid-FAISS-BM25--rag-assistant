Openx Ad Delivery Issues

My System Apache 2.2.9 PHP 5.2.9 MySQL client version: 5.1.28-rc Openx v2.8.5 I am using the Javascript single page call to serve my ads. I am running an in house CMS where everything is processed through a template.php file. My Issue The success of an ad being served seems to be very hit and miss. The placement or type of the ad does not seem to matter. For some reason, the loading of the ads is very spotty. Each page serves an average of 3 ads. Sometimes none show up, sometimes 2, sometimes 1. There does not seem to be any consistency in the problem occurring. The problem seems to have worsened since I updated to the most recent version and started using Single Page Call. I have checked the source. All Javascript script is in place, but the ad content is not generated under the script where it should be. The space where the ad should be is just empty. No Javascript errors are generated. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
