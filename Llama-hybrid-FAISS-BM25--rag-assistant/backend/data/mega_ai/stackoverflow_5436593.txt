Upload to Appengine Blobstore in Android

I'm working on a simple multimedia messaging app for Android, and I was trying to use Google AppEngine's BlobStore as my cloud storage for the various image, video, and audio files that will be transferred. However, all of the examples and such that I've seen for uploading to blobstore assume that I'm doing it via an HTTP form, and so I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do. I've seen several people asking the same question, but none of them seem to ever get a satisfactory answer. Can I or should I use AppEngine's blobstore in this way, and if so how do I go about doing it? Thanks, SO.
