Detecting process crash in .NET

Is there a way to determine that a process that my program started has crashed? Currently, the solution I found is to look at Process.ExitCode and examine the value: this.STProcess = Process.Start(this.CreateProcessStartInfo()); this.STProcess.WaitForExit(); if (STProcess.ExitCode != 0) { //raise error event... } I wanted to know if there is a more elegant (and accurate) way of doing this? I would prefer answers in C# and using P/Invoke is fine as well. P.S - I need to work on windows XP/Vista/7
