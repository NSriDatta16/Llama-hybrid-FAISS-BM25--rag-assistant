Allegro library cannot read .png files by default. You must use some other libraries/addons (libpng, zlib, loadpng). loadpng is bundled with Allegro from version 4.3.10, but you need libpng and zlib installed in your compiler. You must use register_png_file_type() before load_bitmap(). The loadpng addon of Allegro 4.4 is included in its source code: https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.4/addons/loadpng/ If the PNG is 8bpp image, remember to load its color palette: PALETTE palette; BITMAP* red = load_bitmap("frago.png", palette); select_palette(palette); blit(red, screen, 0, 0, 0, 0, red->w, red->h); unselect_palette(); Anyway I think Allegro should convert your image to 32bpp automatically, try using set_color_conversion before load_bitmap() just in case: set_color_conversion(COLORCONV_TOTAL); Finally you could try to use load_png() function directly (replace load_bitmap with load_png).
