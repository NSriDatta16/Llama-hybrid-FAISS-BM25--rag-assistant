If I understand you correctly, you should assess how well the model fits before paying attention to the coefficients. If the model is a poor fit and the parameter coefficients are significant, then the coefficients are doing a good job at explaining a bad model. Once you are satisfied the model fits well, you can interpret the coefficients. If you are looking to figure out the relative importance of the predictors in your model, that's a different can of worms. The coefficient of each predictor is how much a one-unit change in it affects the outcome. But, critically, that effect is based a model that includes the other predictors you included. This article explains some of the thorniness: http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-relative-importance-of-predictors-let-the-games-begin/
