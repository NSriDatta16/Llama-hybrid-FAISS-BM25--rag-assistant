One problem with your question is that the long-standing database term "column oriented" has been appropriated (some might say "hijacked"!) by the NOSQL community to describe something completely different from what it originally meant. Both meanings of "column oriented" are still current but they refer to very different DBMS products. So it is often helplful to clarify which you are talking about. In this case, it's the NOSQL meaning of the term. In the original meaning of a column oriented database the answer to your question is that there is no difference in the way you retrieve information. Column store isn't a different data model, it is simply a different type of representation in internal storage. In the NOSQL community however, the term column store refers to a different kind of data model.
