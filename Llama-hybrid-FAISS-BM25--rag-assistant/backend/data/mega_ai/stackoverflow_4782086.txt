Your it is pointing to an invalid location. You need to initailize it with the map's iterator. Something like it = myMap.find("aaa"); //Replace it with actual key After doing the find you need to make sure you are having a valid iterator by checking it agains myMap.end() . EDIT You are using uninitialized iterator here: cout second.size() Also, you can not dereference a iterator pointing csvMap.end() , it will result in crash again. As per EDIT 3 You are still using the unitialized iterator / iterator pointing to end in if(csvMap.size() == 0) and if(it == csvMap.end()) case. You need to initialize the it with the return value of insert function like this: it = csvMap.insert(....).first; in these cases.
