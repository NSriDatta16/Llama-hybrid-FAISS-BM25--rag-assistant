To proceed with this series for building forecasting , I read many places if your data is not white noise and does not have random walk then you can model forecasting , Otherwise if your time series data is either white noise or has random walk then don't use time series forecasting You can use ARIMA when you have a random-walk. If you have white noise data you can fit a OLS regression rather than ARIMA.
