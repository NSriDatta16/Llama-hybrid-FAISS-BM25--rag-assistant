Needing help in order to infer the statistical hypothesis tests performed in an old paper

I am in great need of help in order to infer the statistical hypothesis tests performed in an old paper. However I need to make some reasonable guesses only from the abstract of the paper since the original text is in chinese which i can not understand (after extensive search i was also unable to find the original text even in chinese) The title of the paper is: â€œDetection of sister chromatic exchange in workers exposed to coal tar pitch and to coke oven volatiles" The abstract of a paper (which was published in 1998 is the following): In order to know the changes of genetic toxicological effects on workers occupationally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), sister chromatic exchange(SCE) was detected by the methods of peripheral lymphocyte culture in 23 workers exposed to coal tar pitch (CTP) and in 19 workers exposed to coke oven volatiles (COV) and 12 normal controls. The results suggested that the SCE in occupational workers was significantly higher than that in controls (11.31 vs 6.37, P 0.05). It is indicated that CTP and COV caused strong genetic toxicity and injury to chromosome. In your opinion how do you think that the above reasarch was organized For example: a) What types of statistical hypothesis testing was performed by the reasearchers b) What kind of data was collected and used for each statistical hypothesis test c) What methods were employed for the each hypothesis test ?
