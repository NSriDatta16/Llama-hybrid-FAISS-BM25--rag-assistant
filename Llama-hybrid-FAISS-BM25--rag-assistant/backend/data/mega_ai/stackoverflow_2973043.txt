Problem with Linq Left Join

I have seen a number of examples on this but re-producting them in this example does not seem to work. Does anyone have any ideas what is wrong with the following code.... var products = new[] { new {ProductName ="Soda", Category = "Beverages"}, new {ProductName ="Tuna", Category = "SeaFood"}, new {ProductName ="Jam", Category = "Condiment"} }; var categories = new[] { new {Category = "Beverages", Description="Slurp"}, new {Category = "SeaFood" , Description="Nosh"}, new {Category = "Exotic" , Description="Spicy!"}, }; var q = from c in categories join p in products on c.Category equals p.Category into tmp from prd in tmp.DefaultIfEmpty() select new { Category = c.Category, Description = c.Description, ProductName = prd.ProductName }; Many Thanks in advance Keith
