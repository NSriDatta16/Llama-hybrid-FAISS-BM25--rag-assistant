Creating custom classes for list storage

When is it acceptable to do this. For example, I find myself sometimes needing to create, say, a form of tuple or something that has a key so like a String -> (myObj1, myObj2, myObj3) I end up making a class to hold the myObj1 -> 3 but as you can see this class has limited fields so it seems like its a waste of a class as such. Should I not worry about that or is it bad design to create classes for list storage purposes?
