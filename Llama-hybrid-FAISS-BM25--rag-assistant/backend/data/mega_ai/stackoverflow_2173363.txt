OpenGL ES (iPhone) multi-texturing (2D) code

I have a texture from this PNG: And another from this PNG: They both have the same blend function: glBlendFunc(GL_ONE, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); I want to see them on one single polygon first. I just couldn't find a simple example of this. Draw them to different polygons works perfect, but I just cannot "merge" them into one texture. Any working sample codelines would be appreciated well. Second problem is to make the specular map's alpha variable. I can see that I have to texture combine somehow it's alpha with the primary color (created from my variable), but again, have no working example of codes. I began to study glTexEnvi function, but yet I have no any result. Please, I beg you for just about 16 lines of code! I googled the whole net, but still stuck. The engine I want to implement (working flash sketch on the bottom of the post) is here .
