I concur with bechbd - use a good sample of your database traffic (by running a server trace on a production system during real office hours, to get the best snapshot), and let the Database Tuning Advisor analyze that sampling. I agree with you - don't blindly rely on everything the Database Tuning Advisor tells you to do - it's just a recommendation, but the DTA can't take everything into account. Sure - by adding indices you can speed up querying - but you'll slow down inserts and updates at the same time. Also - to really find out if something helps, you need to implement it, measure again, and compare - that's really the only reliable way. There are just too many variables and unknowns involved. And of course, you can use the DTA to fine-tune a single query to perform outrageously well - but that might neglect the fact that this query is only ever called one per week, or that by tuning this one query and adding an index, you hurt other queries. Index tuning is always a balance, a tradeoff, and a trial-and-error kind of game - it's not an exact science with a formula and a recipe book to strictly determine what you need.
