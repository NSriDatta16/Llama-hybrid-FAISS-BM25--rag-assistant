First of all, you cannot easily do that in MLP . Among the most important hyper-parameters, there is number of layers, and even if you set it there is number of neurons parameter in each of these layers. In SVM , you might want to try different kernels and their associated parameters. For example, gamma , C , and degree are among important ones. In my opinion, in KNN , you should first play with K and a suitable metric choice (cosine, euclidean etc.).
