Looks like recursion in the traverse() and update() methods with depth controlled by the physical geometry of your object collection. If this is your actual class I would recommend a few things: Check the upper bound of numChildren before using it lest someone passes in a remarkably huge number by mistake. If this will be used in a threaded environment you might want to synchronize access to the child objects. Consider using containers instead of allocating an array. I don't see a destructor either so you'd leak the memory for the array storage and the children if this object gets deleted.
