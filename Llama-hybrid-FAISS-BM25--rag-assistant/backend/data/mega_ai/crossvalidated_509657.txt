Here is one way to estimate the median in the question, using order statistics: \begin{align} \text{median}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n|X|_i\right) &=\text{median}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n|X|_{(i)}\right) && (1)\\ &\sim\sum_{i=1}^n\text{median}\left(|X|_{(i)}\right) && (2)\\ &\sim\sum_{i=1}^n F_{|X|}^{-1}\left(\frac{i}{n+1}\right) && (3)\\ &=\sum_{i=1}^n F_{X}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i}{2n+2}\right) &&\\ &=\sum_{i=1}^n \tan\left(\frac{\pi i}{2n+2}\right) && \\ &\sim \sum_{i=1}^n \int_{x=i-1/2}^{i+1/2} \tan\left(\frac{\pi x}{2n+2}\right)dx && (4)\\ &=\int_{x=1/2}^{n+1/2} \tan\left(\frac{\pi x}{2n+2}\right)dx && \\ &=\frac{2n+2}{\pi}\log\left(\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{4n+4}\right)\right) && (5)\\ \end{align} In (1), we wrote the sum as the sum of order statistics. In (2), we replaced the median of the sum by the sum of the medians, which is the most questionable part of this estimate. In (3), we used the standard estimate for the central value of an order statistic. In (4), we estimated a tangent as the average of nearby tangents. In (5), the cotangent of small $x$ is like $1/x$ , so we could also write the final result as $O(n \log n)$ , as predicted in the comments above.
