Android: onCreate() getting called multiple times (and not by me)

There is something I don't quite understand right now. My main activity class creates a Service, which creates a new thread that waits for a TCP connection. Once one comes in, it will start a new activity: Intent dialogIntent = new Intent(getBaseContext(), VoIPCall.class); dialogIntent.putExtra("inetAddress", clientSocket.getInetAddress()); dialogIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK); getApplication().startActivity(dialogIntent); After that, the onCreate() method of that class gets run. It will create 2 threads: one records and send data, the other one receive and plays data. Those threads have a forever while loop. For some reason, I notice that the onCreate() of that last class gets called again, which makes my program crash. I do not understand why it is called again as only the 2 threads are running, there is no user interaction. The documentation says: "Called when the activity is first created.". The activity is already running and I am not trying to create it. Could someone please explain me this behavior?
