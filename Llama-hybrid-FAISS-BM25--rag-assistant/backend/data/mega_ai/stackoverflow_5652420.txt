After a bit of searching, I don't think that WebKit offers such a property (I might be wrong). Here's a simple Vanilla JS workaround. var userAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); if (userAgent.search('iphone') > -1 || userAgent.search('ipod') > -1) { document.getElementById('your_textbox').onblur = function() { this.focus(); }; } This solution does perform a focus() even after the textbox launches its onblur trigger, but it only does this for MobileSafari on iPhone and iPod Touch (iPad might be similar).
