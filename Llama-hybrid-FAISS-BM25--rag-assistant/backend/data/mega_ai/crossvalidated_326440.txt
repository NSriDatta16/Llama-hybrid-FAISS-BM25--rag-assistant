To calculate the mean cover at each location I've divided the Cover(%) by the number of quadrats in the sample (e.g. 10/4), and then summed the Mean_Cover(%) I dont know If I understand your words correctly but I feel that something like "Total_Cover(%)" would be better words to express that number. The mean_cover as in "average cover % per quadrat" should only be one number for your data set and should be estimated by $$ \sum_i^n (C_i)*1/n$$ where $C_i$ is the Cover_of_quadrat_i and $n$ is the number of samples. So $(10 + 15 +5+ 12)/4 = 10.5$ The standard deviation represents the idea of "average deviation from the mean" for your data. And it is estimated as: $$ \sqrt(\sum_i (C_i - \bar C )^2 * 1/n)$$ Where $\bar C$ is the mean of the sample.
