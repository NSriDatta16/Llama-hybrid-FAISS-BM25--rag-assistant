With such a big dataset, I would start using a random sample of the data as a smaller training set, until you have identified an algorithm that is suitable. With so many descriptors, I would start with a Random Forest classifier. Although not necessarily the best final model, it is a good way to explore feature importance. Happily, these choices fit together well: you can train each iteration of the forest building with a different subsample from the dataset.
