how to encrypt an database using sql cipher

I want to encrypt an database using sqlcipher. I have done with the integration os openssl and sqlcipher integration and the build works perfect. But my issue is I am not able to encrypt my database. I don't know how to perform that activity or method to encrypt a database using sql cipher. I read on the SQL Cipher but I am not able to understand the same process. I tried the code that is provided by them but not working . EDIT: Can any one tell my how to set PRAGMA key for the same and then how to start with the encryption ? As only this part is remain for my encryption to get completed. Please help me out from this situation. Thanks in advance
