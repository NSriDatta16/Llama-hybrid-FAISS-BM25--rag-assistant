Code coverage (c++ code execution path)

Let's say I have this code: int function(bool b) { // execution path 1 int ret = 0; if(b) { // execution path 2 ret = 55; } else { // execution path 3 ret = 120; } return ret; } I need some sort of a mechanism to make sure that the code has gone in any possible path, i.e execution paths 1, 2 & 3 in the code above. I thought about having a global function, vector and a macro. This macro would simply call that function, passing as parameters the source file name and the line of code, and that function would mark that as "checked", by inserting to the vector the info that the macro passed. The problem is that I will not see anything about paths that did not "check". Any idea how do I do this? How to "register" a line of code at compile-time, so in run-time I can see that it didn't "check" yet? I hope I'm clear.
