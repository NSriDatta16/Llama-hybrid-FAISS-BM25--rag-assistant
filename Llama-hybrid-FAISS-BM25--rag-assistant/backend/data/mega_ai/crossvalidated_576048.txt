Comparing intervention/control group

I am planning to conduct a study which is based on an RCT design. I am intending to conduct an intervention. During this intervention, participants and control group enter some medical data on daily base for a predefined time frame (like 6 months). I wonder whether there is a better approach to investigate the effect of intervention besides averaging medical data per participants and doing an repeated ANOVA. I wonder about this because averaging does not really take into account whether the intervention stables good health behaviour over the time compared to control group. Thanks a lot!
