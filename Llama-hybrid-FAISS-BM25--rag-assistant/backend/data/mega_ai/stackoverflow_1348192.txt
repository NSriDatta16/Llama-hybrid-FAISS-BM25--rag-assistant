Binding a form variable in jQuery

I'd like to compute a value and carry that computation in the form post, so what I do is: $('#myID').attr('value', myCalculation); What I would like to do is display it as well, so I've added: $('#myIDdisplay').text(myCalculation); Is there a better, more elegant way than duplicating the assignment of myCalculation to both the hidden form field and the displayed area? I don't want the user to get confused in thinking that it's an input field, so I'd rather not display the input tag. And I just can't trust CSS enough to think that CSS will remove the input border on every version of every browser.
