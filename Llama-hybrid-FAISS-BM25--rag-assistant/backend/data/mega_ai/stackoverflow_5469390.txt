Is there a way to make Magento indexing more intelligent?

I would like like to know if it is possible to make a new method to only update indexes on products which have changed since I run a store with 206000 records in the core_url_rewrite table and need to update product status everyday. It takes 8 hours using a CLI call to index.php --reindex catalog_url.
