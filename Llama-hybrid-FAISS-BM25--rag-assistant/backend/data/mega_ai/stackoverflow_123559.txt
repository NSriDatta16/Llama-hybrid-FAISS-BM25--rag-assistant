How to validate phone numbers using regex

I'm trying to put together a comprehensive regex to validate phone numbers. Ideally it would handle international formats, but it must handle US formats, including the following: 1-234-567-8901 1-234-567-8901 x1234 1-234-567-8901 ext1234 1 (234) 567-8901 1.234.567.8901 1/234/567/8901 12345678901 I'll answer with my current attempt, but I'm hoping somebody has something better and/or more elegant.
