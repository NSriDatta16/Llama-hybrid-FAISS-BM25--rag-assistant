I don't believe there's any documented way. You could send WM_DROPFILES , but this (1) requires you to put the filename into an undocumented HDROP structure in the target process memory ahead of time, and (2) is the older method for accepting files, it won't work if the application uses the newer IDropTarget APIs. IDropTarget is actually designed to be more general than just dragging files from explorer: there's a Win32 API, DoDragDrop , which allows an application to act as a drag source so the user can drop its data into other applications. Unfortunately DoDragDrop watches mouse movement directly, so you'd need to simulate mouse movement and button release in order to control where the item dropped. Even this won't work unless the other window is on top of the z-order, since DoDragDrop finds the window under the cursor, and will interfere with any mouse activity the user is doing. So it should be used as a last resort.
