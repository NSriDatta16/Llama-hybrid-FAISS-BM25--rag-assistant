Does the model architecture of a CNN depend on the dimension of your input images?

By model architecture, I'm interested in knowing the following: Number of nodes in input layer Number of nodes in subsequent layers Number of layers in the architecture Number of filters and kernels in each layer For more context, I'm creating a ConvWTA that previously took in 32x32 images but now I'm modifying the model to take in 16x16 images and I'm not exactly sure about how I should go about modifying the architecture/whether this needs to be done in the first place other than the input layer. I also want to include a bottleneck in the model so I'm planning out the architecture but would appreciate some guidance or resources.
