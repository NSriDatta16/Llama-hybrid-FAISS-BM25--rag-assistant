I'm assuming you're on a Linux VPS, so ... how are you looking at 'free' memory? There's a few different measures of that in your average Linux system. For instance, from my Linux box, I get: marc@panic:~$ free total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 2058188 1596532 461656 0 778404 604752 -/+ buffers/cache: 213376 1844812 Swap: 1052248 0 1052248 By the first line, it would appear that 1.5gig are in use and just under 500meg are free (on a 2gig box). However, those totals include memory used for disk cache, which is the second line. Once you remove cache buffers from the counts, then only 213meg of memory are used by running processes, and 1.8gig are free.
