In Microsoft.WindowsMobile.Status there is a class which keeps track of all kinds of properties of your device. Besides the one you need, DisplayRotation, it also contains properties about phone coverage, Nr of missed calls, next appointment and many more. See msdn for more info. You can also add an event-handler to be notified of changes of these properties.
