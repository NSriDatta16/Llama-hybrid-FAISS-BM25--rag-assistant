@JahKnows' answer which has nicely explained the importance of correlated features. I would like to elaborate on the techniques that can be explored for the problem. There are powerful time series and machine learning techniques that can be used for the problem at hand. The problem has a time component to it. And the data that you would be having would be auto correlated . Ex- The revenue for present year will be correlated with the revenue for past year. Does anyone have any recommendations on how I would go about forecasting Microsofts revenue using python + time series or ML (recommended techniques e.g Random-forest). As far as recommendations are concerned, they will purely depend on the kind of data you have. But as you have described the problem I would like to recommend from the two different schools of techniques: Time-series and Machine Learning Time-Series: Assuming you have some features in your data set. You can go with developing a multivariate time series model. Vector Autoregression (VAR) models have been successfully applied in the domain econometrics. That can be surely borrowed. Machine learning: Recurrent neural networks have been widely used for problems of predicting time series variables, in recent times. A variant of RNN, Long short term memory (LSTM) have been proven to be more successful than simple RNNs for the same.
