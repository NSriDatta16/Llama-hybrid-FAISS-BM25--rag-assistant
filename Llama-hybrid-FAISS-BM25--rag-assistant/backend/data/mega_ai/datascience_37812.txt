I suspect the number of ethnic groups is large and you are given a large enough sample of random people from different ethnic background to work with. So I propose the following: Rather than using clustering (unsupervised segmentation) you could use an existing less granular ethnic grouping. Let's say your unique ethnic groups in your raw dataset is like that in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contemporary_ethnic_groups then you could use a high level grouping with smaller groups such as that in https://www.google.com/search?q=ethnic+grouping+in+the+world&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS810US810&oq=ethnic+grouping+in+the+world&aqs=chrome..69i57.10445j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 for the purpose of understanding the high level group profiles: for example by analysing the descending rank of frequency count of gene features that are more prevalent in each group. Technically you can do the same using the original more granular ethnic groups. Normally you cannot apply traditional principal component analysis on the gene features since they are categorical with values 0 or 1, but you could apply a more appropriate method that does not require continuous variables inputs, such us the method used in this R package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html Clustering and recommendation in one shot: You could also try explicit collaborative filtering which requires data to be in the format of user by item, in the following way: since the gene features are all binary you could use your ethnic group numeric id as the rating but you have to convert it to numeric from 1 to N distinct ethnic groups define person as the user dimension and the id of each gene feature as the item dimension re-organize the data as [Person, genes,group], where genes=[1,2,...,N_genes] and group=[1,2,...,N_ethnic] keeping rows where gene feature=1 only in this format, the zero value assumed where the combination does not exist, separate the data in training and validation datasets Apply Alternative Least Square ( https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/ml-collaborative-filtering.html ) on the training data then use the validation data to validate how well ALS predicts the ethnic group, may use the number of elements in the smaller ethnic grouping above as the an initial number of components in the ALS process if the number of correct predictions of each ethnic group given gene features for all persons is reasonably higher than incorrect predictions then use the model to predict ethnic group membership, you can also look at the mix of gene features that are characteristic to each ethnic group from this result.
