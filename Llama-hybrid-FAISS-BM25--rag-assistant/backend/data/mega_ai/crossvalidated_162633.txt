The neural networks used in typical deep learning models have a very large number of nodes with many layers, and therefore many parameters that must be estimated. This requires a lot of data. A small neural network (with fewer layers and fewer free parameters) can be successfully trained with a small data set - but this would not usually be described as "deep learning".
