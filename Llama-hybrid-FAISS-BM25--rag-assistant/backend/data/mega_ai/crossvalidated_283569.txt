Can the variance of a continuous random variable with known distribution be impossible to find?

I am solving a problem where the life expectancy of a microorganism can be modeled as having the PDF: $ f(x)= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} kx^{-3} & x\geq 1 \\ 0 & x \lt 1 \\ \end{array} \right. $ Where $k=2$. I've calculated the average to be 2 hours, but when I try to calculate the variance as: $$\sigma^2=\int_1^\infty x^2f(x)dx - \mu^2$$ The integral doesn't converge. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks in advance!
