What's the best way to store multiple values for jQuery's $.data()?

If storing multiple (10+) values on a large number of divs, is it more optimal to store them all in a single object, or as separate values? Single Object: $("#div_id").data("data", {foo:1, bar:2}); Separate Values: $("#div_id") .data("foo", 1) .data("bar", 2); What are the trade-offs of each method? Some of these attributes will be accessed frequently (during event callbacks like dragging, for instance).
