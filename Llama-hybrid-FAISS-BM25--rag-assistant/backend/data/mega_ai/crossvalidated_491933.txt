It is the number of base estimators (not necessarily tree-based). So, if you give XGBoost as the base estimator, which I think is a bit complex to be a base estimator, it'll use 100 XGBoost models. XGBoost itself has n_estimators hyper-parameter but BaggingRegressor does not change it. It treats your estimator object as black-box.
