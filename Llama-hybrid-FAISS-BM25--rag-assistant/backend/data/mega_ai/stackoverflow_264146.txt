I don't have any strong feelings either way. I can't see any great benefit to doing it one way over another. I know philosophically the bit fields are better for storage. My reality is that I have very few databases that contain a lot of logical fields in a single record. If I had a lot then I would definitely want bit fields. If you only have a few I don't think it matters. I currently work with Oracle and SQL server DB's and I started with Cullinet's IDMS database (1980) where we packed all kinds of data into records and worried about bits and bytes. While I do still worry about the size of data, I long ago stopped worrying about a few bits.
