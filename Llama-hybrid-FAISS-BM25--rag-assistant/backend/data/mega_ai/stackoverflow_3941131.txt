The best I found is to leverage the fact that CLLocation.verticalAccuracy is only set for GPS equipped devices. Of course this means that GPS availability can only be determined after the first location update. From Apple's documentation: Determining the vertical accuracy requires a device with GPS capabilities. Thus, on some earlier iOS-based devices, this property always contains a negative value. Update: Sometimes, Core Location sends CLLocation objects with verticalAccuracy = -1 on an iPhone 4 as well. Probably it's doing that when no GPS fix is available and Core Location resorts to cell or Wi-Fi positioning. So the fact you're getting -1 doesn't necessarily mean you don't have GPS. Only if you're getting a positive value you know for sure, you do have GPS.
