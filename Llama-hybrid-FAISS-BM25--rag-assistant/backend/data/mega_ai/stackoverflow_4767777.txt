please help! i can sort items to hidden overflow!

This is my site . On the left I have a playlist, inside a container with hidden overflow (the playlist is a sortable). The playlist grows as you drag more songs to it from the search list. The problem is that when you drag many songs to the playlist, and the playlist is larger than the container, it makes a situation where I can sort the playlist by dragging items to the hidden area. In other words, I can drag a song from the playlist to an area under the container (where the invisible part of the playlist is) and the song will still be inserted to the list. Here's a screenshot:
