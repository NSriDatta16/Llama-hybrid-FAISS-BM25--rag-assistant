Pearson correlation is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables . A positive value indicates a positive linear relationship (as one variable increases, so does the other), while a negative value indicates a negative linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other decreases). However, correlation does not imply causation which means just because two variables are correlated, it doesn't mean that changes in one variable cause changes in the other. Shapley values, on the other hand, provide a way to fairly distribute the contribution of each feature to the prediction for a particular instance. In the context of machine learning, the importance of a feature generally refers to how much the model's prediction changes when the feature's value is changed. So yes, you could say that a more important feature is one that the model is more sensitive to.
