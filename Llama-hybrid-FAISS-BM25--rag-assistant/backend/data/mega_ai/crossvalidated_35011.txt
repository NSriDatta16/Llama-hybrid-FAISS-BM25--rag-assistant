I don't think there is any simple interpretation of AIC or BIC like that. They are both quantities that take the log likelihood and apply a penalty to it for the number of parameters being estimated. The specific penalties are explained for AIC by Akaike in his papers starting in 1974. BIC was selected by Gideon Schwarz in his 1978 paper and is motivated by a Bayesian argument.
