There are no "Rules" to OOP. There are 4 language properties that make a language object-oriented or not (these are the things you listed in your question). The rest of the material out there are guidelines. The best/most helpful guidelines I've read are GRASP Many of the suggestions are not readily understandable by laymen (non-CS majors). I thought GRASP was pragmatic and approachable. I think GRASP is nice because it suggests the most critical part of OO in its name - Assignment of Responsibility (to objects not programmers). The two most critical GRASP concepts from which everything else derives are coupling and cohesion. These two concepts/principals drive all other patterns and approaches. BTW - did I just interview you? You transcribed the question incorrectly...
