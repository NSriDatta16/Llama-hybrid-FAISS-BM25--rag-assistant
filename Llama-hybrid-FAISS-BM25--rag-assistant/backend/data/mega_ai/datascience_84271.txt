I want to run PCA on a data set that will be aggregated by country. Should I aggregate the data before or after I standardize the data, and why?

Basically the title asks my question. I have the results of a survey that was filled out by people from different countries. I have been asked to analyze the data using PCA and see what findings I can get on each country from my analysis. Now of course this means I have to aggregate my data, but should I aggregate the data before or after I standardize the data? From the results that I am getting it seems that aggregating first is the right way to go about it, but I am failing to understand why that would be the case.
