Time series: So, I believe you mention a different approach. The data that people use in the examples you mention in coursera is based on the following assumption: The data was collected in the same date and you have many different features associated with the data. So the question here is to asssociate the price of a house with the features of the house. However, your question may be different. You may want to study the prices of the same house (or an average house or many different houses like a panel) will be smaller or larger in the future. So the problem here is not to associate the features to the house, but to know how some economic variables may affect the house. For instance, in times of low economic activity (low gdp) people do not have money and, therefore, less houses are sold. Since less houses are sold, the prices of an average house also falls. Usually economists are interested in this kind of problems. So depending on your data you may use a time series model or dynamic panel data. Usually, you have a structure that the price of the house today depends on the price of the same (or a similar) house in the past, since the characteristics are the same.
