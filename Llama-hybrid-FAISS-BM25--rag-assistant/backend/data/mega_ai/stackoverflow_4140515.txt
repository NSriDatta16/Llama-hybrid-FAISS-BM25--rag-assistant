It's likely that SC1DRL is a write-only register (check the official register docs to be sure -- google isn't turning up the right PDF for me). That means you can't read it back (even with an in-target debugger) to verify your code. How is HWRegPtr defined? Does it have volatile in the right places to ensure the compiler treats every write through that pointer as something which must happen immediately?
