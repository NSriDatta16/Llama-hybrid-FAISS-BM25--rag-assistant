Does covariance nonstationarity violate GARCH modelling assumptions?

I am trying to model two series of financial returns using a bivariate BEKK GARCH estimation. From the output of the statistical software, I see that covariance stationarity is not ensured in my case ($\alpha_1^2+\beta_1^2 > 1$). That is, either mean, variance or covariance are not constant through time. Is one of the GARCH modeling assumptions violated then? Could I also infer that the two processes comove and have a joint trend? How can I reconcile this result with the fact that correlation between the two time series is almost flat during the time period?
