There are at least two advantages to Cox models for survival data: They deal with censoring, logistic regression doesn't. They allow survival time, rather than just survive/did not. This usually provides more power and is often a more relevant question. You don't say what your variables are, but let's suppose they are "surgery vs. not" and "death". It's usually important to distinguish "died in one day" from "died in 10 years".
