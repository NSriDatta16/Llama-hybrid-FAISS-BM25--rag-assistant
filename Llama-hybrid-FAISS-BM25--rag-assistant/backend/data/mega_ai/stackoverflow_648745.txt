Sounds to me like you have 2 different context, the BusinessLogic context and the data access domain. You probably need a transformer/context mapper to convert from one onto another and vice versa. public class ContextMapper { public BusinessLogic.Customer Convert(DataAccess.Customer customer) { } public DataAccess.Customer Convert(BusinessLogic.Customer customer) { } You could also write these as extension methods if you like }
