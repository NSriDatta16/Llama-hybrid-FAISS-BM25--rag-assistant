Chat history isn't really that heavyweight. If I calculate around 100 bytes per message, 6 messages per minute, and 5 hours per day, (that is a very talkative chatter, though), permanently , as a worst case, that would give about 61MB per user per year (!). That means with 1 million talkative chatters ( very unprobable) you would need around 58TB or data storage. Saying that this is a worst-case calculation, I would start off with a maximum of 1TB storage, set up the database, and see how things are going. It is highly unprobably for a very young service to evolve that fast. Also, I would personally not recommend using a Windows system for something like this, unless you know very well what you're doing. MySQL on a Debian distribution will store billions of records, and probably do this faster due to less OS-level limitations (see the MySQL documentation for details, there should be section about the limitations on Windows).
