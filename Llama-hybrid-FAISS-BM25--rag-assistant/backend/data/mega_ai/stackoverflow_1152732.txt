How does the MapReduce sort algorithm work?

One of the main examples that is used in demonstrating the power of MapReduce is the Terasort benchmark . I'm having trouble understanding the basics of the sorting algorithm used in the MapReduce environment. To me sorting simply involves determining the relative position of an element in relationship to all other elements. So sorting involves comparing "everything" with "everything". Your average sorting algorithm (quick, bubble, ...) simply does this in a smart way. In my mind splitting the dataset into many pieces means you can sort a single piece and then you still have to integrate these pieces into the 'complete' fully sorted dataset. Given the terabyte dataset distributed over thousands of systems I expect this to be a huge task. So how is this really done? How does this MapReduce sorting algorithm work? Thanks for helping me understand.
