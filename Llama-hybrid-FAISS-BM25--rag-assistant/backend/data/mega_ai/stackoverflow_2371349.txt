You just need to compare the pointers with what is passed into the methods - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate { if(scrollView == self.firstScrollView){ // do something } else if(scrollView == self.secondScrollView){ // do something else } } This is assuming that your scrollviews are properties on the class. I'm pretty sure that a pointer comparison is fine here. If it gives you trouble use something like if(scrollView.tag == self.firstScrollView.tag) You will need to assign them a tag when you create them
