Search engines don't care in the least about Java, only the output HTML. Your concern is misplaced with Java, instead become a student of quality content marked up with Semantic HTML ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Semantic_HTML ) If you are asking about JavaScript (instead of Java), most search engines do not pay any attention to JavaScript. So do not expect dynamically added HTML to be indexed. This also means, do not use JavaScript onclick actions to replace the basic functionality of the href attribute of anchor tags. Similar to Java, the recommendation falls back to clean semantic HTML markup of quality content.
