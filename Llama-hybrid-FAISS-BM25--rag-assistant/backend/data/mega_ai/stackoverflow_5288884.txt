that digits and special characters should not be allowed to input in textbox... Don't do this through keypress filtering. It's user-hostile, confusing, messes up other control keypresses and is easy to defeat by using other methods of input, such as copy/paste, drag/drop, form fillers, spellcheckers, IMEs... Instead, have a warning that visibly directs the user when they've put something unexpected in, eg.: Please do not use numbers or ‘!’, ‘_’ or ‘#’ characters in this field. var tx1= document.getElementById('TX1'); var tx1help= document.getElementById('TX1_help'); function checkTX1() { var isok= /^[^0-9_#!]*$/.test(tx1.value); tx1help.style.display= isok? 'none' : 'block'; } checkTX1(); // Re-check the field every time a key is pressed or other change event. // To ensure it is still checked in a timely fashion in the case of // non-keyboard events, add a timer as well. // tx1.onchange=tx1.onkeyup= checkTX1; setInterval(checkTX1, 500); You can use addEventListener for the event attachment if you want to, but be aware this won't work in IE attachEvent model. ( event.returnValue is specific to the IE attachEvent model and will not work with addEventListener , which uses event.preventDefault() instead.)
