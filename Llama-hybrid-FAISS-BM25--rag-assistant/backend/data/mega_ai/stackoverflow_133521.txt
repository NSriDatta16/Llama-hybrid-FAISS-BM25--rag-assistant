In GCC, compile with -Wno-unknown-pragmas In MS Visual Studio 2005 (this question isn't tagged with gcc, so I'm adding this for reference), you can disable globally in Project Settings->C/C++->Advanced. Enter 4068 in "Disable Specific Warnings" or you can add this to any file to disable warnings locally #pragma warning (disable : 4068 ) /* disable unknown pragma warnings */
