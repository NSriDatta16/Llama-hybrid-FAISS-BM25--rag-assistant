Total download size of *initial* page of major websites

I'm quite surprised how large some major websites homepages are. This is the total amount downloaded just when opening the homepage. cnn.com - 845kb microsoft.com - 470kb yahoo.com - 235kb gillette.com (flash) - 3.8Mb abc.com - 3.4Mb nbc.com - 1.4Mb youtube.com - 530kb Anyone care to add to the list? I'm just trying to justify the size of a site by comparing it to major sites out there. Obviously some of these sites are quite media intensive and wouldn't be much fun at 200kb. Im quite surprised how huge some sites actually are. To do this I used fiddler . Clear your cache first , go to the site, select all the items in fiddler and under the 'statistics' tab it will show the total.
