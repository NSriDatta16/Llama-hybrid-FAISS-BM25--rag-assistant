Password strength and usability are often at odds these days. If you're part of a forward thinking organization, the best technique that I've found is to encourage users to make use of applications that both solve your problem and theirs, such as Password Managers . KeePass and Password Safe are two such applications, but there are many others. Here is the new policy: Encourage users to create 1 strong password that they own and maintain which is the password to their local/private encrypted database. Ask them to use the built in functionality for generating random, strong passwords. Encourage them to simply use the copy/paste functionality from the password manager to your application There are several pros / cons to this approach; but believe me, users are happier when they don't have to deal with all of the unfriendly nonsense required by passwords these days AND they might actually stop short cutting your policies.
