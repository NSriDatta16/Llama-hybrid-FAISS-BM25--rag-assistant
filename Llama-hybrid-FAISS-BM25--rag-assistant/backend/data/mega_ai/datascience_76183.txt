Try writing a custom loss function for a regression model! Keras' neural networks support this, for example. See https://stackoverflow.com/q/43818584/745868 (But many other libraries give support for this as well) The only special thing about your custom loss function is that it doesn't add up the error of a datapoint if min(pred_y, actual_y) >= THRESHOLD
