The method is correct IN THIS CASE but not in general . You need a sufficient model to detect an anomaly ( read underlying signal and latent deterministic structure ). You approach assumes the kind of model i.e. a model with time and versions of time as exogenous predictors premising no pulses/level shifts/seasonal pulses and attempts to find what had been assumed to be not present. Why is my high degree polynomial regression model suddenly unfit for the data? should ne reviewd and especially @whuber comment Does the p-value in the incremental F-test determine how many trials I expect to get correct? reflecting on "fitting polynomials to data can be a deceptively very poor approach " The problem or opportunity is to simultaneously identify both i.e. a possible hybrid model using both memory and the waiting to be identified latent deterministic structure. I used my favorite time series package ( specifically authored to do both with my help) and obtained in this trivial case and . It concluded as you did regarding the pulse and the level shift. In summary the noise model can be other than white noise i.e. not (0,0,0) in arima notation. The baseline can have break points in trend not simply curvature which is implied by time squares et al. A solid reference to detecting amomalies is here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html covering the impact of error variance changes while incorporating memory as it searches for anomalies. Standard Regression Diagnostics assume uncorrelated errors while attempting to provide clarity to anomalies. If you have an error process that is white noise then simpler procedures often work BUT when you have time series data this is often not the case thus more powerful/correct/robust approaches are needed.
