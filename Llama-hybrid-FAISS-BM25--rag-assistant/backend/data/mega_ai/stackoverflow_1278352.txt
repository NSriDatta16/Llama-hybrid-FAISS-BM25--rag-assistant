You don't tell Winpcap where to send packets. You tell it to put a packet on the wire. The network switch will send the packet to the right destination. The TCP stack on the receiving end will send the packet to the right application/service. Obviously this means the routing information has to be in the packet itself. To take your example, you'd need to put the IP address and TCP port of the appropriate MSN server in the packet. If you don't, your networking hardware will discard or misroute that packet.
