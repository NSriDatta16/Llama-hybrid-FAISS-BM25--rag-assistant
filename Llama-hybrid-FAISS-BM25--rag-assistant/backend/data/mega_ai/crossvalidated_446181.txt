Which Machine Learning Algorithm should I use to classify(Binary) an analog signal?

Currently I am trying to classify an analog signal of 128 points. It will be a binary classification of 'Yes' or 'No'. My data set is roughly 10,000 data points and is supervised. The algorithm/model I think I should use is the Linear Support Vector Machine but I am not sure. Is their a specific algorithm I should be use in this situation? Implementation: I am using Microsoft.ML to implement this.
