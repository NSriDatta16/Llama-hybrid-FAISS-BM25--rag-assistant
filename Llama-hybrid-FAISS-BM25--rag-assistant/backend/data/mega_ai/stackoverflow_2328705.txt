One good way to protect your material is to make your web site the easiest way to get/view/access your stuff. Note that Apple makes millions of dollars selling MP3's on ITunes that are wholly unprotected, because it is easier for most people to grab them on Itunes than to find them on torrent sites. Ultimately, you will not be able to prevent a determined user from copying and redistributing your material. The most you can do is try to slow them down. Whatever encryption method you end up using will require a key, and that key will need to end up on your user's computer. Therefore, a determined user will have everything they need to grab the content from you. What you can do is annoy average users enough that they decide it is not worth the trouble. However, there is a fine line to walk between annoying users enough that they pay, and annoying them so much that they leave your site entirely.
