introductory machine learning concept questions

I just started learning about machine learning and the concepts behind the different methods and I wanted to get some clarification on the couple concepts. I'm filling out a true or false handout and I was wondering if my answers were correct: Covariance matrix can have negative values I think it's true since co-variance can be negative The `1 regularization cannot shrink parameters to zero, hence it can be used for the purpose of feature selection I'm not sure about this one, but I think it's true? Also I'm trying to identify the hyper-parameters of the following machine learning methods: Deep Neural Networks: is it learning rate and number of layers? Are my answers correct?
