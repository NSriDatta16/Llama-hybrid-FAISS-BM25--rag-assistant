How are ANN's, RNN's related to logistic regression and CRF's?

This question is about placing the classes of neural networks in perspective to other models. In "An Introduction to Conditional Random Fields" by Sutton and McCallum, the following figure is presented: It shows that Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression form a generative/discriminative pair and that linear-chain CRFs are a natural extension of logistic regression to sequences. My question: is it possible to extend this figure to also contain (certain kinds) of neural networks? For example, a plain feedforward neural network can be seen as multiple stacked layers of logistic regressions with activation functions. Can we then say that linear-chain CRF's in this class are a specific kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)?
