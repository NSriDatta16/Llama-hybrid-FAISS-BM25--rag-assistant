I read somewhere, some years ago, that every imported class would be loaded at runtime with the importing class. So removing unused, especially whole packages, would reduce memory overhead. Although I suppose that modern versions of java deal with that, so probably it is not a reason anymore. And by the way, with eclipse you can use Ctrl + Shift + O to organize imports, but you can also configure a "cleaner" that deal with such things (and many others) each time you save a java file.
