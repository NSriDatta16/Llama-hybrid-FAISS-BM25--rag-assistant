The box command LaTeX offers for doing vertical adjustments is \raisebox : \raisebox{distance}[extend-above][extend-below]{insert your text here...} With the distance parameter, you can specify a offset to raise or lower the text, and extend-above and extend-below parameters can be used to add additional space. This command is for example great for positioning a small amount of text with a small font size in a line with a bigger font size. Simple additional vertical spaces can also be created with the \vspace*{distance} command, which inserts an additional vertical space. (The starred version also adds the space on the beginning and end, the normal version only adds space between text blocks). You might put that on the end of your paragraph or at the end of your own command to add some spacer afterwards (or before). But for longer text extracts, I would recommend to use the \minipage environment: \begin{minipage}[position][height][inner-pos]{width} insert your long text here \end{minipage}
