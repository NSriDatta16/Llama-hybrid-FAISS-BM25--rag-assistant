updating column based off of parent information

I am a beginner at SQL Server and I have a question about how best to do this. I have a table that looks like this: ID Parent Level 1 NULL 0 2 1 1 3 1 1 4 2 2 5 2 2 6 3 2 7 2 2 8 5 4 9 4 3 10 6 3 11 6 3 As you can see, all the entries have a Parent and a Level and the database is organized in a tree structure. There are some entries where the Level is set incorrectly such as entry ID #8. The Parent of 8 is 5 and ID 5 has a level of 2 so the level of 8 should be 3 and not 4. There are many incorrect Level values in my table and I'm not sure how to fix this. So far I have this: UPDATE myTable SET level=level-1 FROM myTable WHERE ???; I am not sure how to fill in the WHERE part or whether this is the best way to do this. Any suggestions are gladly appreciated.
