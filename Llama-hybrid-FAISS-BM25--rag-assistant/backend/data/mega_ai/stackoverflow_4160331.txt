Put it as far down in the page as possible to minimize interference with rendering other elements. I've worked on high volume sites where we would intermittently experience issues loading Google and other 3rd party js; we determined that the issue was with the 3rd party servers, not us; the only thing you can do (other than turning off adsense) is to organize the page so that it renders even if you can't load the 3rd party components.
