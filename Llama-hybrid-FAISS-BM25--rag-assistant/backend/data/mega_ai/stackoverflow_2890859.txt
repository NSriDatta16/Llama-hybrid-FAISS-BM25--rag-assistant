How to test reliability of my own (small) embedded operating system?

I've written a small operating system for embedded project running on small to medium target. I added some automated unit test with a high test code coverage (>95%), but the scope is only the static part. I got some code metrics as complexity and readability. I'm testing my code with a rule checker with MiSRA support, and of course fixed all warnings. I'm testing the code with a static analyzer and again fixed all warnings. What can I do now to test - and improve - the reliability of my OS ? How about the dynamic part ?
