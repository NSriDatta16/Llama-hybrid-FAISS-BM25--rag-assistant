Stata teffects ATET

How does stata estimates ATET (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated) using teffects psmatch. I understand the average treatment effect (ATE) is computed by taking the average of the difference between the observed and potential outcomes for each subject done by teffects psmatch. What about ATET?
