Drupal permission, a user case

The objective of the site is to maintain a product listing. Each product composes of a title , description and quantity (CCK field). Each product belongs to a shop . Each shop has a manager . All products are visible to all. A manager can only add/edit products of his own shop . A site admin can create new shops and new managers . How can I set the permission for the above scenario? I am thinking of using Taxonomy for shop names, Taxonomy Access Control for permission control. Not sure whether I am on the right track though... Besides, is Organic Groups also an option? Thanks!
