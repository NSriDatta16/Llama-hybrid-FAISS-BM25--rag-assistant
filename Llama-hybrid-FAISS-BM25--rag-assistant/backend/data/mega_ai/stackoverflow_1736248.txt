When you implement a wrapper method, you are effectively coding up a variant of an existing method, usually because the existing method doesn't satisfy your current requirements. The original method may be too complicated (too many parameters), or it may not quite do the required thing, which means you have to write a wrapper (or overload) that does the extra work the original method doesn't. Usually when writing a wrapper you will still leverage the original function for whatever it does, and fill in the gaps with your wrapper.
