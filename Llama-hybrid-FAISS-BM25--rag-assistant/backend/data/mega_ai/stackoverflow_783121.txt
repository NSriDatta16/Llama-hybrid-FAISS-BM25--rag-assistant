Calling System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.InvalidateRequerySuggested() forces the CommandManager to raise the RequerySuggested event. Remarks: The CommandManager only pays attention to certain conditions in determining when the command target has changed, such as change in keyboard focus. In situations where the CommandManager does not sufficiently determine a change in conditions that cause a command to not be able to execute, InvalidateRequerySuggested can be called to force the CommandManager to raise the RequerySuggested event.
