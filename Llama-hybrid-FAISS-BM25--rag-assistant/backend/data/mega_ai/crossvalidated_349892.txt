Generating complex controlled image data

In order to demonstrate properties of statistical models it is often useful to generate data, which is messy, but messy in a controlled way which is well-understood by the generator. For example, to demonstrate the advantage of a more general Gaussian Mixture Modelling compared to $k$-means clustering, you might generate several slightly overlapping clusters with distinct spreads; see for example this Wikimedia image . I would like to test certain statistical properties of neural networks, especially convolutional. Data in low dimensions, with simple features, does not seem appropriate to me: this will fail to capture the actual power of the model, and be (heuristically) less likely to tell you things about the model that apply to real world applications. Therefore I am interested in, either, existing artificial data sets, or generating complex image data myself in a controlled way. My questions are: Are there already complex generated image data sets freely available? Are there standard succesful methods for generating complex image data in a controlled manner?
