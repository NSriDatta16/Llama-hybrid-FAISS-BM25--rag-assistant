If you consistently want to go from "shades of gray" to "shades of Color X", you might be able to use transparency with some funky blending mode. If you want to go through all the content streams and edit the existing color commands, that's a pretty tall order. You have to take into account a Wide Variety of colo(u)r spaces. DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, ICC profiles, calibrated RGB and CMYK, spot colors, and So Forth. What exactly are you trying to accomplish? "Color" didn't work? Funky. Can we see the PDF? Idea: Turn this upside down. Use the existing page as an alpha channel on a page filled entirely with the desired color rather than the other way around. One more try. Rather than blending, use a transfer function. You'd need to build a Function dictionary. You're sticking with CMYK, so cramming any and all inputs into a specific output should be fairly simple. something like this: C: [0 1] -> [0 0.6] M: [0 1] -> [0 0.1] Y: [0 1] -> [0 0] K: [0 1] -> [0 0] (I swiped the 0.6 0.1 0 0 from your PDF) Urgh... only your existing page is all deviceGray, right? Nope... CMYK as well, only just K's. You'd need a transfer function that took the K values, and mapped them to CMYK based on the color output you wanted. And then I looked at how you define a function in PDF. So much for simple. Domains and ranges and samples oh my! Not exactly trivial. Still, this just might work. (though I still think you should find a blended PDF that works in Acrobat and see what the differences are) Last ditch effort: PM Leonard Rosenthol. He has an account here on SO. He's the Acrobat developer relations guy for Adobe. Tell him that Mark Storer is stumped. That should get his attention. ;)
