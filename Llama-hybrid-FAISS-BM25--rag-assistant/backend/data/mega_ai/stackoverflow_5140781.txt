It means "reading" the XML file/string and getting its content according to the structure, usually to use them in a program. For example if you have this XML fragment: value1 value2 you may want to use these values in a data structure: ClassRoot: node1: string node2: string so that, in the end: Object goofy = ClassRoot.new parse(xml, goofy) puts(goofy) yelds something like: goofy[node1='value1'; node2='value2'] There are many ways of doing so, like DOM or SAX . You might want to investigate XSLT and xpath as well, according to your needs.
