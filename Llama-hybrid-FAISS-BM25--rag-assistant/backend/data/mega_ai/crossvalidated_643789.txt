You seem to be mixing a few things here. Unknown confounders are addressed thought randomization, because doing so properly guarantees (in the limit) that any characteristic that may be prognostic for your outcome is balanced across interventions. Often randomization is stratified for one or a few of such traits that are known to correlate with the outcome, to make sure at least those occur with roughly equal probability in each group. The magic of letting chance decide who gets what is that any confounder -- even unknown! -- will eventually balance out (assuming your sample size is sufficiently large), and its effect will cancel itself in a comparison if it is not otherwise affected by only a specific intervention. Rare confounders will be more difficult to balance randomly, but their effects will be smaller on the average outcome anyway. Blinding is there to address human bias, and has little to do with confounders. If you think a decision such as keeping a subject on treatment would be the same if a physician knew an investigative drug were active or not, you haven't worked with many investigators. That's not a criticism, they want what's best for their patients, but blinding prevents anyone from systematically steering towards a specific outcome (I really want this drug to work!). Essentially you need to act as if everyone receives the same unknown intervention. This applies to more than the participant and the investigator in larger clinical studies by the way, and goes up to sponsor staff that's only involved in high-level strategic planning (by then that's usually quadruple-blind?). Pre-planned analysis approaches will be set in place before the blind is lifted. All of this is because you cannot disprove bias, you can only systematically exclude it through proper procedures. A conservative but not unrealistic assumption is that people planning and conducting the study will make decisions in such a way to give it the best chance of succeeding: no one likes failure. Maintaining the blind still means you have to address undesired/unexpected outcomes (adverse reactions, dropouts, deaths..), but you cannot systematically plan for them in such a way that favours any one intervention (we're going to count this death but not that one). Neither blinding nor randomization guarantee comparability. That has to do with a lot of other factors as well, such as what population you're studying & under which conditions. Balancing out confounders through randomization and preventing bias via blinding will improve generalizability however, again because no one is able to act conditional on treatment allocation.
