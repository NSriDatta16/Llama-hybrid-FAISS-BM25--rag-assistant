As requested by Demetri's in the comments to his (incorrect) answer, here is R code correctly estimating the coverage of both prediction and confidence intervals by simulation. For simplicity only a single covariate is considered. coverage Varying for example the sample size $n$ (see simulations below) the coverage never deviate significantly from the nominal level of 0.95. This is of course as expected as it is well known that these intervals are exact (see any mathematical statistics textbook on linear regression). > set.seed(1) > coverage(n = 5) $pi.coverage [1] 0.952 $ci.coverage [1] 0.9501 > coverage(n = 10) $pi.coverage [1] 0.9478 $ci.coverage [1] 0.9507 > coverage(n = 20) $pi.coverage [1] 0.9532 $ci.coverage [1] 0.9509
