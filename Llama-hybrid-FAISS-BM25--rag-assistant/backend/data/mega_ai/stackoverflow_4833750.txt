As @FerRory suggests, you could take advantage of the drag event. You could take advantage of the data() method to determine whether an element is draggable or not: $("div").draggable({ drag: function() { return !$(this).data("disabledrag"); }, revert: true }); Then in your async action, you could set that data if the element being dragged is the one that's been deleted (I'm assuming you have some system for associating DOM elements with data from the server): var $dragging = $(".ui-draggable-dragging"); if ($dragging.length) { // If this is the item that was deleted, stop dragging: if ($dragging.attr("id") === "item-one") { $dragging.data("disabledrag", true); $dragging.addClass("deleted").html("This item has been deleted!"); } } I've updated my example here . The first div will be "deleted" after 5 seconds.
