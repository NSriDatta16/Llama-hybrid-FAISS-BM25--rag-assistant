How can I use data science / machine learning / statistics / data analytics techniques to find better customers in the future?

I work for a business to business company with a data set containing approximately 2700 businesses as customers. For each business customer I have approx number of staff, location, industry, the sales rep managing their account and for the last 7 years how much profit I have made with each of them for each month. What data science/machine-learning/statistics techniques or analysis can I perform to use this data to select which businesses I should try to acquire as customers in the future? And what if any methods might be worth considering to enrich this data set?
