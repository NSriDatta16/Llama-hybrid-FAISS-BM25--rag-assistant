As @Erwan stated in his answer , medical data is not easily accessible. However, during the pandemic a lot of data related to Covid19/SarsCov2 has been made available. Therefore, if you would like to focus on medical datasets I suggest to consider Covid19/SarsCov2 datasets, e.g. see here . As a general note: When working with medical data it is important to understand the features and pathological mechanisms. Otherwise you might easily assume features to be predictive of an outcome which do not represent any causal relationship. Also, if you do not know how the data has been obtained you may easily make an error when interpreting a feature (e.g. for an ICD10-encoded diagnosis you need to understand how this diagnosis has been derived). See, for example, Common pitfalls and recommendations for using machine learning to detect and prognosticate for COVID-19 using chest radiographs and CT scans . Similar issues can arise with tabular data.
