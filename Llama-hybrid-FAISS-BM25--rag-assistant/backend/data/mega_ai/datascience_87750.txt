Confusion Matrix after XGBoost is showing positive as negative class

Please can you help me with confusion matrix. I've implemented the XGBoostClassifier. After fitting the model when I looked to the confusion matrix to view the performance on Test data. The confusion matrix was showing Positive class as Negative class. My positive class is Submitted and Negative class is Not Submitted. My dataset is extremely imbalanced. Positive class is very small in size. Not Submitted:1423948 count Submitted:5775 count I've attached the photo of confusion matrix The reason why I'm asking is because the model which I've created is not performing well. I want to do a hyperparameter tuning. I've used ROC_AUC curve which gave around 99% score. But confusion matrix is showing something else.
