Identities in a VAR model

I am working on a VAR model where one of the equations is an identity. For example: $$ \begin{cases} A_t = \alpha_{11} + \alpha_{12} A_{t-1} + \alpha_{13} B_{t-1} + \alpha_{14} C_t + \varepsilon^{(1)}_t\\ B_t = \alpha_{21} + \alpha_{22} A_{t-1} + \alpha_{23} B_{t-1} + \alpha_{24} C_t + \varepsilon^{(2)}_t\\ C_t = A_t + B_t \end{cases}$$ Where $A_t$, $B_t$, and $C_t$ are time series variables, $\alpha$'s are the coefficients to be estimated, and $\varepsilon$'s are the error terms. So far, my idea is to estimate the first two equations, then generate fitted values $\hat{A}_t$ and $\hat{B}_t$, and finally to use $\hat{A}_t + \hat{B}_t$ as an estimate of $C_t$. However, this procedure does not take into account the identity (the last equation) when estimating the first two equations. Are there any methods (or ways to transform the model) that would actually incorporate the information from the identity into the estimation procedure?
