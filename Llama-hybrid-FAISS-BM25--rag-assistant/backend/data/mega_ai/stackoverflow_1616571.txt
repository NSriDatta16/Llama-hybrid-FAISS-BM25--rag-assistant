c++ send data to multiple UDP sockets

I got a c++ non-blocking server socket, with all the clients stored in a std::map structure. I can call the send() method for each clientObject to send something to the connected client and that works pretty good already. But for sending a message to all (broadcast?) i wanna know: there is something better than do a for/loop with all the clients and call to ClientObject->send("foo") each iteration? Or should i just try having a peek on multicast sockets? Thanks in advance. Rag.
