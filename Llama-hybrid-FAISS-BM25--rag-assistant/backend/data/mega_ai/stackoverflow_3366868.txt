I can't speak for Sproutcore but Cappuccino has great, easy to implement drag and drop. See the Cappuccino Scrapbook Tutorial for example. If you follow along the steps you can decide if Cappuccino is overkill for your application. The Floor Plan demo app also demonstrates Cappuccino drag and drop in action together with some extra niceties like rotation controls on widgets. The source code is available . Personally I think writing an app like Mockingbird without a full power framework like Cappuccino would be frustrating.
