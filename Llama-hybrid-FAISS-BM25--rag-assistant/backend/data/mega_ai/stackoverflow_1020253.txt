No, all objects will be lost when you change pages. However, there is an interesting hack you can do with window.name . The value of window.name will remain for as long as the current window is open, so you can store data in it temporarily (and access it from page-to-page). However this data is accessible (and overwritable) from any page using that window, so it's not secure or reliable storage. See http://www.thomasfrank.se/sessionvars.html for more info.
