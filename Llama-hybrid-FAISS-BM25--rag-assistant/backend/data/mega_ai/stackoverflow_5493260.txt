Email spam protection script

I have a small real estate virtual tour website where visitors can email the agent asking for information. I realize I need to protect the email form to prevent spamming my agents. I would like to avoid those awful image captcha's like reCAPTCHA. Are there any other options? Like a very simple math question, without having to render an image with GD? Something like: "2 + 3 = ?" I was thinking math's because I have a multi language website and like I don't have to translate strings etc. What about a time protection? I think I saw this before. You need to wait x seconds before sending a second email. Maybe because off some "hammering" scripts? Any links or lights appreciated! EDIT Forgot to say, I am sending the data with AJAX (jQuery), so there is no real form to submit..
