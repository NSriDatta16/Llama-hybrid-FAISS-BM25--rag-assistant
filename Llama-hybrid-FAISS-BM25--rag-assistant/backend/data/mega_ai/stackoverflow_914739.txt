Try to get hold of Robert Love's book on Linux Kernel Programming. Its very concise and easy to follow. After that or along with that, you may want to take a look at "Understanding the Linux kernel".But I wouldn't recommend it during the early stages. Also, look at the Linux kernel programming guide . Since a lot can be learnt from programing kernel modules, that guide will help you. And yes, for a lot of information, consult the 'documentation' sub-directory of the Kernel sources tarball.
