The as keyword is very useful if you think the conversion will fail during an upcast. For instance, if I want to perform the same operation on similar types in a Control list... let's say unchecking all Checkboxes: foreach (Control ctrl in Controls) { Checkbox box = ctrl as Checkbox; if (box != null) box.Checked = false; } This way, if my list has something else, like a text box or a label, no exception is thrown (as simply sets the variable = null if it fails), and it's very efficient. There is no exception overhead.
