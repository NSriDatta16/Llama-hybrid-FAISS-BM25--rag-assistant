A much better way to do this is to use the TempData collection. TempData["myException"] = exception; It acts as a store of data for the next request only (for the current client of course). However, I believe it is only accessible from within a Controller, so you might have to reorganise your code such that your error handling occurs within a controller (I have some sample code that I don't have access to right now, but will put up shortly that will explain this better).
