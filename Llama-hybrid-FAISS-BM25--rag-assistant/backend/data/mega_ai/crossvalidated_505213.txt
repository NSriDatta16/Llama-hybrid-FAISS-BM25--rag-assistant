You are correct that $\mathsf{Gamma}(\mathrm{shape}=1,\mathrm{scale}=\theta)$ is exponential, specifically $\mathsf{Expm}(\mathrm{mean}=\theta)\equiv\mathsf{Exp}(\mathrm{rate}=1/\theta).$ Using the CDF method, you can show that if $X_1, X_2$ are IID $\mathsf{Exp}(1/\theta),$ then $Y_1=\min(X_1,X_1) \sim \mathsf{Exp}(2/\theta),$ so that $E(Y_1) =\mu_1 =\theta/2.$ Similarly but with a little more difficulty, you can find $E(Y_2) = E(\max(X_1,X_2)) = \mu_2$ (in terms of $\theta).$ Finally, $E(\alpha Y_1 + \beta Y_2) = \alpha\mu_1 + \beta\mu_2.$ Here is a brief simulation with $\theta = 6, \alpha=5, \beta=10$ with sufficiently accurate results (2 or 3 significant digits) that you can check each part as you go along. set.seed(121) th = 6; alp = 5; bet = 10 x1 = rexp(10^7, 1/6) x2 = rexp(10^7, 1/6) mean(x1); mean(x2) [1] 5.999339 # aprx E(X1) = 6 [1] 6.000077 # aprx E(X2) = 6 y1 = pmin(x1, x2) y2 = pmax(x1, x2) mean(y1); mean(y2) [1] 2.999401 # aprx E(Y1) = 3 [1] 9.000015 # aprx E(Y2) = 3 + 6 = 9 z = alp*y1 + bet*y2 mean(z) [1] 104.9972 # aprx E(Z) = 15 + 90 = 105 Note: An intuitive answer to $E(Y_2)$ is that that the min averages 3, then by the no-memory property of exponential random variables, the max must be 6 greater on average, so $E(Y_2) = 3+6=9.$
