How can I log in to YouTube using Perl?

I am trying to write a Perl script to connect to me YouTube account but it doesnt seem to work. Basically I just want to connect to my account but apparently it is not working. I don't even have an idea on how I could debug this! Maybe it is something related to https protocol? Please enlighten me! Thanks in advance. use HTTP::Request::Common; use LWP::UserAgent; use strict; my $login="test"; my $pass = "test"; my $res = ""; my $ua = ""; # Create user agent, make it look like FireFox and store cookies $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->agent("Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051213 Firefox/1.0.7"); $ua->cookie_jar ( {} ); # Request login page $res = $ua->request(GET "https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=youtube&hl=en_US&passive=true&ltmpl=sso&uilel=3&continue=http%3A//www.youtube.com/signup%3Fhl%3Den_US%26warned%3D%26nomobiletemp%3D1%26next%3D/index"); die("ERROR1: GET http://www.youtube.com/login\n") unless ($res->is_success); # Now we login with our user/pass $res = $ua->request( POST "https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLoginAuth?service=youtube", Referer => "http://www.youtube.com/login", Content_Type => "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", Content => [ currentform => "login", next => "/index", username => $login, password => $pass, action_login => "Log+In" ] ); # YouTube redirects (302) to a new page when login is success # and returns OK (200) if the login failed. #die("ERROR: Login Failed\n") unless ($res->is_redirect()); print $res->content; what i am doing is learning the web features of perl, so i dont want to use any library except wwwlib or mechanize to get the job done. how can i just connect to my account using a perl script? this is my objective for now hope someone can post a script or correct mine. thank you guys for you help. i am testing Webscarab now..
