If you know Python and has bought into the "pythonic" way of doing things, then Jython allows you to bring that philosophy to the JVM stack. If you do this, it is much more than just adding scripting capability. In our latest projects, all the custom and business logic is built in Jython, at the same time we can still leverage some of the great tried and tested Java libraries like Solr, Jasperreports, Quartz, Jetty, Velocity to name a few. It does get compiled to bytecode, however, an extra layer is being added, but is no different to using an ORM instead of straight JDBC for example. What you gain in productivity far out weighs the minuscule lost in performance. On the server side, Jython is rarely the bottleneck. For mini desktop apps, there may be issues, but very much dependent on what you are trying to do. The latest JDK, together with containers like Jetty or Tomcat are very mature and stable, adding Python on top, in many cases, gives the best of both worlds.
