I have created a few wizard for www usage. If you need to create 2 or more wizards then it is better to create a simple wizard framework responsible for navigation and data storage in session. In my case every wizard step implements IWizardStep interface responsible for temporary data storage, as well as some common information like step number, display strings, next & previous steps etc. Then I just put them together and the framework takes care of displaying them in order, navigation and processing.
