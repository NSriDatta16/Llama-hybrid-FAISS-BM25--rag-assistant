Here is an R code in the univariate case for the above Metropolis-within-Gibbs approach drafted by @alberto. No indication of the chain getting stuck: the acceptance rate for the $x$ component is close to 50%. First, I picked some pseudo-values to run the algorithm: #observation from N(x,1) y=3.081927 #latent x from t(nu,theta,1) nu=3 Second, I simulated the location $\theta$ from the full condition distribution, namely a Student's $t$-distribution with location parameter $x$ and the latent parameter $x$ by a Metropolis-within-Gibbs step, making a proposal from a Student's $t$-distribution with location parameter $\theta$ and accepting this proposal based on the second part of the full conditional, namely the normal pdf centred in $y$. #Metropolis-within-Gibbs T=10^4 mcmc=matrix(NA,T,2) #initialisation mcmc[1,1]=rnorm(1,mean=y) mcmc[1,2]=rt(1,df=nu)+mcmc[1,1] #Gibbs iterations for (t in 2:T){ mcmc[t,1]=rt(1,df=nu)+mcmc[t-1,2] #theta mcmc[t,2]=proposal=rt(1,df=nu)+mcmc[t,1] #x #acceptance probability: accept=dnorm(proposal,mean=y)/dnorm(mcmc[t-1,2],mean=y) if (runif(1)>accept) mcmc[t,2]=mcmc[t-1,2] } As seen from the contour plot below, the resulting chain $(\theta_t,x_t)$ is correctly located on the highest contours of the target density.
