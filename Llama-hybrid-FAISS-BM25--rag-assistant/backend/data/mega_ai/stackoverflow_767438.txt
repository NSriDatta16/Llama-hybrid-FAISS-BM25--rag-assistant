A common culprit with these small embedded deviecs is memory fragmentation. You might have free memory in your application between 2 objects. A common solution to this is the use of a dedicated allocator (operator new in C++) for the most common classes. Memory pools used purely for objects of size N don't fragment - the space between two objects will always be a multiple of N.
