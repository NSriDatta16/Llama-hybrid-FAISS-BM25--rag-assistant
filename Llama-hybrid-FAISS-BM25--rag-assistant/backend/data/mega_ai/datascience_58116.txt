Extracting tokens from a document: applying Deep Learning or Classification?

I have a legal document from Law. That document is 4-pages of evidence from the plaintiff. I want to identify the Dates, Addresses and Financial transactions in that document. Can I apply deep learning, the data with me is very small, on just one 4-page document, or should I apply Text Classification to solve my problem?
