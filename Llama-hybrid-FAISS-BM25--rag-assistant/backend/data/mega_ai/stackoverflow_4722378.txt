There is a way to import them but they lose quality as advanced transparency seems to be unsupported: 1) Drag and drop the SVG file into an empty drawing area. 2) Export it as .shape : File -> Export... Then select "By extension" and save the file as .shape . Then a dialog will appear. Choose the default size in there. 3) Import it: F9 -> NEW -> SVG Shape (select the file) That's it. If you want to import more advanced drawings, I suggest you to try different formats, for example, PNG are imported really nicely (but of course are not vectors). Hope it helps (and I hope DIA team implements more advanced SVG support).
