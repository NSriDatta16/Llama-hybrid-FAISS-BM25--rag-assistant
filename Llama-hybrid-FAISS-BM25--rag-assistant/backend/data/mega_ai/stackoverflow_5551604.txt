Ok so i got it working by rounding all of the "averages" that i was calculating before i got to the "bodyfatcalculations" - (float)getabHipAvg { float ab1 = [abdomen1Input.text floatValue]; float ab2 = [abdomen2Input.text floatValue]; float ab3 = [abdomen3Input.text floatValue]; float hip1 = [hips1Input.text floatValue]; float hip2 = [hips2Input.text floatValue]; float hip3 = [hips3Input.text floatValue]; (abHipAvg = (((ab1+ab2+ab3)/3)+((hip1+hip2+hip3)/3))); abHipAvg = roundf(abHipAvg * 2.0f) / 2.0f; return abHipAvg; } - (float)getneckAvg { float neck1 = [neck1Input.text floatValue]; float neck2 = [neck2Input.text floatValue]; float neck3 = [neck3Input.text floatValue]; (neckAvg = ((neck1+neck2+neck3)/3)); neckAvg = roundf(neckAvg * 2.0f) / 2.0f; return neckAvg; } - (float)getCircumferenceValue { float abHipTempAvg = [self getabHipAvg]; float neckTempAvg = [self getneckAvg]; (circumferenceValue = (abHipTempAvg - neckTempAvg)); circumferenceValue = roundf(circumferenceValue *2.0f) / 2.0f; return circumferenceValue; } So yea thats my solution, there was nothing wrong with all the if/else if statements, it was the fact that dividing by 3 to get the average was giving me a much longer decimal than i needed, so by rounding them to the nearest half solved my problem. Now i get the answer that is supose to come out. Thanks for everyones help!!
