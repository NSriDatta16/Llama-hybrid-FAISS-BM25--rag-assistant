How to propagate uncertainties for parameters whose upper and lower uncertainties are different?

If $A = A_0 \pm \sigma_A$ , $B = B_0 \pm \sigma_B$ , and $f = \frac{A}{B}$ , the normal error propagation goes like ( following Wikipedia ) \begin{equation} \sigma_f = \sqrt{\sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 - 2\sigma_{AB}} \end{equation} How to propagate the uncertainties for parameters whose upper and lower uncertainties are different? For example, when we use some sampling method, such as MCMC, we might get variables that look like $A = 32.0_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$ and $B = 17.0_{-0.2}^{+1.3}$ . How to generalize error propagation to such cases? Do we simply adopt the larger uncertainties ( $\sigma_A = 0.5$ and $\sigma_B = 1.3$ )? Or does $\sigma_A = (A_{\rm 84th} - A_{\rm 16th})/2$ , which is half of the width of the $68$ % confidence interval? Edit: As @whuber asked in the comment, the upper uncertainty corresponds to the 84th percentile of the sampling and the lower uncertainty corresponds to the 16th percentile.
