What is the reason for this zig zag loss curve

I train a resnet18 (also resnet50 and resnet152) to classify 1500 different vehicles and the loss curve has this weird shape. At the beginning of every epoch there is a huge jump. What could be the reason? I use cross entropy loss. And it is the average loss per batch.
