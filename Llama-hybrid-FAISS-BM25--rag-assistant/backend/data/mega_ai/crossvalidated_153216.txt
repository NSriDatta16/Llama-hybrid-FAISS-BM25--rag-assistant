You can include indicators for both the pooled group CD as well as D alone in the regression; then the coefficient for D is the average difference between CD and D , and you'll get standard output (SE, t-stat, p value, etc) for the hypothesis test. Those test statistics should match up with the one-df ANOVA you proposed (F=t^2) but are a bit more directly interpretable.
