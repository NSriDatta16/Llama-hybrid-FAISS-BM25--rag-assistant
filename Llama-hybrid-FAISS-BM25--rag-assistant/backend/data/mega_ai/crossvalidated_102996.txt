Can a multidimensional Jeffreys prior be used to formulate a prior distribution for the posterior distribution, p(θ⃗ |x1,…,xn)? Yes, but it's usually not recommended to use Jeffreys prior for anything other than a single parameter model. The go-to approach for multidimensional cases is the Reference prior . Reference priors maximize the K-L divergence between the prior and the posterior averaged over the sufficient statistic distribution, so that we learn as much as possible from the data. A strong introduction and justification for Reference priors can be found here . A more approachable introduction is available in this lecture accompanied by this lecture . If it's comforting at all, for single parameter models the Reference prior works out to be the Jeffreys prior in each case.
