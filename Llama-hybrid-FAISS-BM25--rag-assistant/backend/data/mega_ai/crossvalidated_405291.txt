It might be a good idea to first see if the data is skewed or not. The Pearson Index is a good place to start to check for data skewing. The equation is: $$ \begin{equation} PI=\frac{3(\bar{X}-median)}{s} \end{equation}$$ In this equation, PI is the Pearson Index. $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, median is the median, and s is the sample standard deviation. So for your data the equation would look something like the following: $$ \begin{equation} PI=\frac{3(1.032-0.442)}{1.214} \end{equation}$$ If the result of this is greater than or equal to +1 OR less than or equal to -1, the data is significantly skewed. The skew calculated here, which it seems was also calculated for you, is around 1.46. It depends on if you want exact values or more generalized assumptions. If you want exact values, you could try to normalize your data. A common way of doing this is taking the natural log of the data or applying a power until the data fits a more normal curve. This could look something like: $log(x)$ or $new data=data^{0.5}$ . There are articles saying that you should instead try glm/glmz and then correct that data based on it. I will link the article here: Don't Log Transform If you have any other questions, let me know. I don't know a lot about statistics, but I know enough to be dangerous, and hopefully giving this some attention should bring some more advanced people in too :D
