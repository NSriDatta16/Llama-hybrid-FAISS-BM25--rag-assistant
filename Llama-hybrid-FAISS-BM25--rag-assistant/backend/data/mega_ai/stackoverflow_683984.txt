When using svn:externals, it is generally a bad idea to use an external without a revision number. It means that it becomes hard to correlate the version of the external with the version of the containing project; I know this the hard way, from trying to track down some history in a project that contained externals, and I would have to guess which revision corresponded to the revision in the containing project (sometimes it was earlier because someone had updated the external project and then updated the containing project, sometimes it was later because someone had edited files directly in the external checkout and then committed it). Instead, as suggested by the tip box a couple paragraphs into the externals section in the subversion book , you should always commit externals with a revision number. That way, whenever you check out a particular revision of the containing project, the appropriate revision of the external will also be checked out. It does mean a little more work, as you have to update the revision number in the svn:externals property every time (we wrote a script to do it automatically), but in the long run it is a much better solution. edit : Here is the skeleton of the script we used (a rake task) for conveniently updating the external and keeping everything in sync. desc 'Update external for this project (rake update_external r=17789)' task :update_external do |t| rev = ENV['r'] rev =~ /^\d+$/ or raise "Invalid SVN revision number: r= " # Update the project. sh "svn update" URL = 'svn+ssh://example.com/external/trunk' sh "svn propset svn:externals 'external -r#{rev} #{URL}' containing/directory" # Update again -- to put the externals back to the right revision. sh "svn update" end
