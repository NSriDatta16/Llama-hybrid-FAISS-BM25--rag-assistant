how to shorten the url in a mathematical approach

I am looking into the possibility of shortening / encrypting a url which will be from 150 to 250 characters in length to maximum 12 characters using an algorithm. Initially I am doubting it's possible but I wanted to leverage the great minds of StackOverflow :) the algorithm should be one that can be written in classic asp, sql, c#, vb, or foxpro or other language. Is that even possible without a database centric approach? I was reading here that AES in CFB mode, will do a stream cipher and the output length will be the same as the input length. Is there any way to shorten it even more?
