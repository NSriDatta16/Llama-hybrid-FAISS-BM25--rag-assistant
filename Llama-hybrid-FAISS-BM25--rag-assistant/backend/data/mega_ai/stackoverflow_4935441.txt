Another key area to point out are SQL Jobs. Since SQL Agent is not running, SQL Jobs are not supported. One way to migrate these jobs are to refactor so that a worker role can kick off these tasks. The content of the job might be moved into a stored procedure to reduce re-architecture. The worker role could then be designed to wake up and run at the appropriate time and kick off the stored procedure.
