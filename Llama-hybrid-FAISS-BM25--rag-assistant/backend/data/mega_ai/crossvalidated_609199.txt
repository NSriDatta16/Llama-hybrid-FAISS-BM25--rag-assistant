Does temperature have a unit root? Probably not. Why would you difference a variable that does not have a unit root? Doing that introduces a unit-root moving-average component. Instead, model the seasonality in temperature deterministically using Fourier terms or dummy variables. You can include them in auto.arima via the argument xreg . For a more detailed explanation and for R code, see "Forecasting with long seasonal periods" by Rob J. Hyndman.
