Finding the dimension of the reward matrix in an inverse reinforcement learning problem

In one of the easy cases of inverse reinforcement learning, we try to derive the unknown reward function assuming that an optimal policy is known and MDP is completely known. Let $P_{a_1}$ be the probability transition matrix from one state to another, following the optimal policy $\pi(s) = a_1$. Assuming $n$ states, then this matrix is $n \times n$. On the other hand, $P_a$ is the transition matrix of all other policies that are not $a_1$. Still $n \times n$. If $I$ is the identity matrix and $\gamma$ is the reward discount factor (scalar), what is the dimension of $R$ in the follow rule? (from Algorithms for inverse reinforcement learning, by Ng and Russell, 2000) $$(P_{a_1} - P_a)(I - \gamma P_{a_1})^{-1}R \geq 0 $$ Is $R$ a vector? or $n \times n$ matrix? And what would this mean?
