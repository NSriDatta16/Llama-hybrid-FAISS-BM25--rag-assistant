The appropriate course of action may depend on what the three variables are. (1) they are effectively measuring the same thing in three slightly different ways. You mention that you are working in health and there are often variables which might be measured in different ways. In that case you might want to combine them into a single variable either by using PCA or simply by summing them if they are measured on commensurate scales. (2) they are measuring three things which are not correlated by design but just as a matter of fact and you do really want to look at each separately. In that case your multiple regression is telling you the effect of each over and above the effect of the others. So if they are, say, systolic arterial tension, diastolic, and pulse rate, you get the effect of each over and above the others. With modern software and the moderate correlations you mention there should be no problem actually fitting the model.
