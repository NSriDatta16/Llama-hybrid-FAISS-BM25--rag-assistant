Simple CakePHP text markup solution for editing news posts

When first searching the web for a simple CakePHP way to convert small news posts (written by a non-technician) I found the flay method in TextHelper . However it turned out that it has been deprecated , referencing to TextileHelper w/ SmartyPants . Textile indeed seems to be a very competent markup language. Nevertheless, I'm afraid it is to complicated for the non-technical writer. All he want is to be able to write paragraphs separated by double new-line and hyperlinks inserted just as they are. Is there a simple and non-bloated way to achieve that with CakePHP?
