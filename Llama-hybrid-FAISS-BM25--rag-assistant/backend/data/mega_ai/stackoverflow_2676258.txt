I would suggest integrating one of the two best-known Open Source media players, VLC or mplayer . Both projects are widely used, in active development, highly flexible and open to integration. Out of the box they are both able to play dozens of video & audio formats on Windows, OS X, and Linux. For VLC, there are Java bindings jvlc (older, no longer maintained) or vlcj (newer, simpler). Mplayer can be embedded into a Java component in "slave mode" . As an alternative, the Java Media Framework (JMF) may be a Java-friendly way of embedding video, but it is not so up-to-date and few people recommend it. Docs can be found here .
