1) Sessions typically contain a whole bunch of data other than the user's login name. Therefore, if you just set the expiration date to a few weeks or months like a remember me token, you'd probably run into performance problems on the server due to thousands or millions of heavyweight session objects. 2) Remember tokens are client-side, not server-side. This puts all of the storage requirements on the user's browser, which is a better solution for simple data like login names. If you relied on session ID's linked to in-memory objects on the server, then every time you restart your server or the server process (to deploy an updated application, for instance), then all of those session objects would be lost.
