how to generate a key (e.g., 350401be75bbb0fafd3d912a1a1d5e54) for a session cookie? Just call session_start() for this. A key would be generated automatically when do we need such a key? when session starts, to distinguish one user from another Why not just set $_SESSION['color']='red' in the first page and retrieve in the second page with $_SESSION['color']? This is the way sessions works. You are encouraged to do it this way. Who says you can't do it?
