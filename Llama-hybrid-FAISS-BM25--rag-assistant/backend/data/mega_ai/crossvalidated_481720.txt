It now sounds like you're after a sample size based on the width of a confidence interval of coverage $1-\alpha$ . For a two sided interval of half-width $h$ (that is, the interval will be of the form ( $\hat\epsilon-h,\hat\epsilon+h)$ ), the required sample size is: $n \geq Z_{α/2}^2 ­\pi(1-\pi) /h^2$ where $\pi$ is the population proportion (for small $\epsilon$ relative to $\pi$ it won't matter whether you use $\pi$ or $\pi+\epsilon$ ). If $\alpha$ is 0.05 (coverage 95%) the Z value is 1.96; this is often approximated by 2. So if $\pi$ is $\frac12$ this is about $1/h^2$ . If $\pi$ is even roughly in the ballpark of $\frac12$ this doesn't change much, but if it's getting close to 0 or 1, you will get smaller $n$ . If you want a one-sided interval (you care only about a lower bound on $\epsilon$ , say) then the sample size reduces a little. Hopefully this addresses your needs; strictly I should have continued asking questions to make sure I was answering the right question but this may be useful either way. If you instead need a test with a given power to pick up a difference of $\epsilon$ that's a different calculation (though related).
