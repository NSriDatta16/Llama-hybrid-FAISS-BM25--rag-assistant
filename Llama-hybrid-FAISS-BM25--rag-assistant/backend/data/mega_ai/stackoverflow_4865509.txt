CSS in HTML Helper - only override width on certain HTML Helpers

m.ResetDayComponent.WeightedAverageMethodID, DropDownData.AveragingMethodList(), "", new { @class = "multipleReset", propertyName = "ResetDayComponent.WeightedAverageMethodID", onchange = "UpdateField(this);" })%> So I have this HTML Helper. Basically, I want to be able to change the width of the dropdown, but other ones that use the same CSS class multipleReset , I don't want to do it. I basically want to be able to have sort of a CSS "parameter". But I don't know if that's possible.
