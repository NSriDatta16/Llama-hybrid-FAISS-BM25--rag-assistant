Interpreting Random Effects for Poisson GLMM

There seem to be a few answers for normally distributed models, but after some searching I could only come across this page for Poisson mixed models. I want to be certain I am interpreting the random effects properly . I'll paste my output and provide the reproducible code at the bottom. Let's pretend we are counting species of moths in two different habitat groups on 5 different individual trees. summary(fit) # Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood # (Laplace Approximation) [glmerMod] # Family: poisson ( log ) # Formula: Count ~ Group + (1 | ID) # Data: df # # AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid # 132.2 135.2 -63.1 126.2 17 # # Scaled residuals: # Min 1Q Median 3Q Max # -1.8708 -1.0472 -0.2687 0.6795 2.3808 # # Random effects: # Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. # ID (Intercept) 0.123 0.3507 # Number of obs: 20, groups: ID, 5 # # Fixed effects: # Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) # (Intercept) 1.0236 0.5339 1.917 0.05520 . # Group 0.9226 0.3502 2.634 0.00843 ** # --- # Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 # # Correlation of Fixed Effects: # (Intr) # Group -0.945 Ok. So I think that exp(0.9226) = 2.51 means that in the second group, Counts are up by 2.5 x what they are in the first group. That's fine, it makes sense if we look at the plots I made (in code below). But what about the random effects? First, I assume I should exponentiate them as well...? exp(0.3507) = 1.42 How can I interpret this number? Is it the average standard deviation within IDs? As in, within any group, the count differs by a standard deviation of 1.42? This might mean that we would find that most counts within a group would be within exp(1.96*0.3507) = 1.98 above or below the mean for that ID? Or, that in general the spread of count data within one tree would fall within exp(2*1.96*0.357) = 4 species? Thierry's explanation on the hyperlinked page was that the highest 97th percentile tree would have 4 X the number of species as the lowest, so I wonder if I'm getting this wrong - as in, the actual interpretation would be that over ALL IDs, the counts differ by 4X from the lowest counts to the highest. What is the correct interpretation? Here the example: library(lme4) library(ggplot2) df
