Magento: adding duties/taxes to a quote during review

I need to make a call to a 3rd party API to get up to date Duties/Taxes for international shipping during the review stage of the checkout process. I have the API call ready to go, however I am missing a way to add the returned duties and taxes to the quote. Is there a built in way to do this? im hoping there is something like $quote->addCostComponent("Duties", 5.0);
