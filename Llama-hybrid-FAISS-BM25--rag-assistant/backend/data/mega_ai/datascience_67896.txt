I would remove the sites with more than a threshold (say60%) na data (for eg site 32). For the other sites with na data, i would fill the na data columns with average values. This way i would be able to use the entire dataset for training. While testing, use cross-validation to ensure a good accuracy. Sine you did not mention what methods have you already tried and dont have a query or confusion, i would suggest going through this website: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html It has lots of information about how to deal with na values.
