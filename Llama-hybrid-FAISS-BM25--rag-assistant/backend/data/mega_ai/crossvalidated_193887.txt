Classification with a neural network when one class has disproportionately many entries

I try to train a neural network using a dataset with several classes $c_1, c_2, \dotsc, c_{10}$. The class $c_1$ has a lot more entries in the training set than the other classes, and this makes my neural network to classify most of the the test set entries as being $c_1$. What preprocessing should I make?
