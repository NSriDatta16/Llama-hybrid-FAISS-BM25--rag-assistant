What optimization method (given a loss function) would a literal marble in a smooth hilly terrain be?

I was considering various loss functions and optimization methods , for my neural network, and while watching a youtube video about them this illustration was shown: (You can find the animated version here .) I already know that a marble in a smooth hilly terrain is an often used analogy for gradient decent type of optimization. It made me wonder what optimization method a literal marble in smooth hilly terrain would be. My thought is that it would have to include at least: Gravity Friction Momentum Using typical and simple physics laws, what common optimization method would comes closest?
