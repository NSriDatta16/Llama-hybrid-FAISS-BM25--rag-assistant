How to calculate overlap between empirical probability densities?

I'm looking for a method to calculate the area of overlap between two kernel density estimates in R, as a measure of similarity between two samples. To clarify, in the following example, I would need to quantify the area of the purplish overlapping region: library(ggplot2) set.seed(1234) d A similar question was discussed here , the difference being that I need to do this for arbitrary empirical data rather than predefined normal distributions. The overlap package addresses this question, but apparently only for timestamp data, which doesn't work for me. The Bray-Curtis index (as implemented in vegan package's vegdist(method="bray") function) also seems relevant but again for somewhat different data. I'm interested in both the theoretical approach and the R functions I might employ to implement it.
