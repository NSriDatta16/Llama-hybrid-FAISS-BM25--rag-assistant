One logical approach would be to use a random effects Poisson model with a random user effect (reflecting that potentially results for the same user on different days might be correlated) and a fixed group effect (e.g. 0=group A and 1=group B or the other way around). The random effect could follow a normal distribution on the log-rate scale or a gamma distribution on the rate scale, whichever you can find a package for. A keyword you could google here is GLMM. You would be able to do this, as long as you have the data for each user and not just the overall numbers. If you only have the overall numbers, you might have to assume zero variability across people and use a Poisson model. If you have a small number of days, you might want to consider a Bayesian approach, while with enough days a frequentist approach should work just fine (and presumably some standard package offers a likelihood ratio test). For the Bayesian approach, there are packages such as PyStan in Python (and similarly rstan in R).
