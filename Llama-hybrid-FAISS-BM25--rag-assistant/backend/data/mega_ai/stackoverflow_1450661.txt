If your base value (e.g. 13) is in the first row of your data set, you should be able to do what you want using the CVS version of gnuplot. Have a look at the running averages demo . Along those lines, you could write a custom function that stores the base value in a custom variable when called for the first time, and returns that variable on subsequent calls. (Since that demo is listed for the CVS version only, I assume the required functionality is not available in the current release version.)
