Probability distribution in data mining

In many data mining/machine learning books and articles, nobody is mentioning probability distribution of input data and relation between data mining models and distributions. Does it mean, that it is not important, when applying, for example, a random forest classifier? When building data mining models, should one consider probability distribution? If yes, how? EDIT By data mining models i mean more like Machine Learning algorithms, as certain data mining models can make assumption about distributioun as Underminer mentioned
