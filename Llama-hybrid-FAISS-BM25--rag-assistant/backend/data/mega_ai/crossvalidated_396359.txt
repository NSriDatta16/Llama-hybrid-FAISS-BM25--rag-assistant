Gower Distance and PAM algorithm with Random Forest for Variable Selection

I am currently working with cluster analysis and am trying to create clusters based on the important variables. My data consists of both categorical and continuous variables thus I have used the Gower distance measure to dissimilarities/similarities between observations, then I applied the PAM algorithm for clustering. I would like to know which variables are the best for my clusters I was going to use Random Forest but I have never used this technique before and would like to understand a bit better how it works and if it is the right technique to use. Below is the coding I have used in R: #clearing all variables rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) set.seed(9850) library(cluster) # for gower similarity and pam library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(readr) library(Rtsne) # for visualization in lower dimension library(factoextra) #clustering algorithms and visualization library(tidyverse) # for sampling #Getting the data df % sample_frac(0.10) #selecting continuous and categorical vars sample20vars $serv,sample20$ equip,sample20 $address,sample20$ city,sample20 $zones,sample20$ compe, sample20 $OfferPrice,sample20$ Finalprice,sample20 $P_number,sample20$ TV,sample20 $T1, sample20$ T2,sample20 $Down,sample20$ Up) gower_dist $silinfo$ avg.width } plot(1:8, sil_width, xlab = "Number of clusters", ylab = "Silhouette Width") lines(1:8, sil_width) #summary of each cluster k % mutate(cluster = pam_fit $clustering) %>% group_by(cluster) %>% do(the_summary = summary(.)) pam_results$ the_summary tsne_obj $Y %>% data.frame() %>% setNames(c("X", "Y")) %>% mutate(cluster = factor(pam_fit$ clustering)) ggplot(aes(x = X, y = Y), data = tsne_data) + geom_point(aes(color = cluster)) I hope someone can help with this as I am not sure if 2 clusters is the right amount of clusters and I wanted to check which are the best variables before doing clustering.
