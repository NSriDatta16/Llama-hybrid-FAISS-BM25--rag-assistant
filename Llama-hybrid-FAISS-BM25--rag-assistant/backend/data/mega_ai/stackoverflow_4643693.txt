Change Resolution Of Form Based On Screen Resolution ( without changing monitor resolution and using Maximized screen option )

I searched on the forums, and I tried a few things... but they didn't really seem to work. Let me lay out my problem. I have a very high screen resolution on my laptop: 1400x1050. I'm designing my app on this. My colleague tried it out on his laptop (which had lesser resolution), and the application did not fit on his laptop. The buttons were dragging out of the screen space. So, I want my application to automatically resize/adjust based upon the screen resolution. I found some similar forums, and I tried a few things suggested by developers, but that did not really work out for me. I tried : Solution 1 : But is changing user's screen resution in place of adjusting form . I don't want to use Maximized screen option and don't want to change user's pc settings. Unfortunatly I am not using Table Layout panel. Please suggest me a simple solution.
