MCMC with 10000 parameters?

I have a model for longitudinal data with 10,000 random effects and 25 additional parameters. The sample size is 30,000. I have tried to use Stan, MCMCPack and others to sample from the posterior distribution but they are all veeeeeeeery slow. The model is complex so it does not allow for conjugate priors. What alternative samplers or methods can I consider?
