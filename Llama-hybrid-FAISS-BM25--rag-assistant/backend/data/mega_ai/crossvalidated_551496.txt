Is it possible to use training, validation and test split for regression models?

For classification problems, we can split the data into training, validation and test sets. And we can use the validation set for obtaining an unbiased estimation of the loss of our model. We can monitor the validation loss (or accuracy) in early stoping for stoping the training when the model is not improving on the validation. Is it possible to do something similar to this when working with time series forecasting with LSTM? How can we do that? Is it possible to use early stoping with some custom function for evaluating the performance of our model? For example, let ut suppose that we would like to use RMSE on validation set during the training of our LSTM. Is it possible to do that? Best regards.
