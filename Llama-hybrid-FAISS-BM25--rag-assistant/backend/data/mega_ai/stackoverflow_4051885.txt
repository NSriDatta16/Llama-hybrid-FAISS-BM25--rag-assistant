The browser is a progressive rendering device. It will display the page as it downloads. Only when the element corresponding to your #fragment arrives and is added to the page can the page scroll to show it. Until then, better that the browser at least shows something than to leave the user twiddling their thumbs waiting for some page content. Browsers may download files and update the page at slightly different rates depending on a number of factors, so your particular page may behave differently on different browsers. But in general having a page with a #fragment jump into place after the initial display is a normal and expected part of the web.
