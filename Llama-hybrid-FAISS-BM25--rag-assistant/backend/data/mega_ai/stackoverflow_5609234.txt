Best way to handle primary communication records in a normalized design

I did search before posting this question and didn't find anything directly related, so if this is a duplicate I do apologize. I am designing a business system and like any business system I have a Customers table with a CustomerID PK Identity column. I am working on the phone numbers/e-mail addresses tables which I would like to be normalized in such a way that any given CustomerID can have multiple phone numbers and/or e-mail addresses when the thought hit me. Most businesses will associate one phone number for any one person's account and call that the primary phone number. This phone number would likely be the one displayed on any statements, reports, etc. The same with e-mail address. I began thinking about how the SELECT query would work if I wanted to get a list of Customers with their primary phone and e-mail address. Obviously I could use an Inner Join to retrieve the information but I only want each CustomerID to show up once, if a CustomerID had two phone numbers then they would show up twice in the list. So my initial thought was creating a table called CustomerCommunications and storing both phone numbers and e-mail addresses and adding a FlagPrimary column there but that doesn't quite make sense because how would you tell if one record was a phone number or an e-mail address. (Obviously the content would give it away, but from the aspect of a query this would be challenging). So then I thought of adding a CommunicationTypes table with seperate rows for Primary Phone and Primary E-mail. Then in the CustomerCommunications table I would add a Foreign Key called CommunicationTypeID and that would allow me to easily identify which was a primary phone and which was a primary e-mail. But then I started thinking about what CommunicationTypeID the other phone and e-mail address records would be. Just Phone and E-Mail? Secondary Phone and E-Mail? Obviously this question is subjective and subject to one's own design ideas, but basically what I'm looking for is ideas other people have used when using a 1 to Many table but would like to be able to easily single out a row for display or reporting purposes.
