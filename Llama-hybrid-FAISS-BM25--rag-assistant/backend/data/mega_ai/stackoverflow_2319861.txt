The only relevant powers of two are 512 and 4096 , which is the default disk block size and memory page size respectively. If your total row-length crosses these boundaries, you might notice un-proportional jumps and dumps in performance if you look very closely . For example, if your row is 513 bytes long, you need to read twice as many blocks for a single row than for a row that is 512 bytes long. The problem is calculating the proper row size, as the internal storage format is not very well documented. Also, I do not know whether the SQL Server actually keeps the rows block aligned, so you might be out of luck there anyways.
