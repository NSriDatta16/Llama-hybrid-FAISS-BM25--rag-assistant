FullCalendar: Change agendaDay background-color

While I have seen this question asked, I haven't seen the answer. I just want to be able to color the background-color of the TD from a certain range.. Say I have my calendar that has slot minutes every 15 minutes and from 9am to 9pm, I would like to only color differently 10am to 3pm. This information would be coming from a feed but that is not an issue. I haven't found the TD s relating to a set time inside the calendar. Perhaps I missed something? :) I am rather new to jQuery and fullCalendar . Also, another quick question that is unrelated to the main one: Is it possible from an event handler to get the id of the calendar that launched it? I have multiple calendars on my page to simulate something like a Gantt view. This will let me be able to fetch the right feed and populate the right events.
