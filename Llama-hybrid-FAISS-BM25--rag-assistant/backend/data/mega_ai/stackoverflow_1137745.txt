I think there are a few criteria you should consider before choosing a solution. Some of these are: Do you have authenticated users or public (anonymous) users? How sensitive is the information you're storing between pages? Are they allowed to go off-line and return later to continue where they left off? How large is the data you're storing (in total) and how many concurrent users do you anticipate? These questions will lead you to decisions on where and how to store the data. Once you know that, you can start looking for a good implementation of that storage method.
