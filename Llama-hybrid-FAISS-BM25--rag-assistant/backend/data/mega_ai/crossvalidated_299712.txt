What are the shortcomings of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)?

The Mean Absolute Percentage Error ( mape ) is a common accuracy or error measure for time series or other predictions, $$ \text{MAPE} = \frac{100}{n}\sum_{t=1}^n\frac{|A_t-F_t|}{A_t}\%,$$ where $A_t$ are actuals and $F_t$ corresponding forecasts or predictions. The MAPE is a percentage, so we can easily compare it between series, and people can easily understand and interpret percentages. However, I hear that the MAPE has drawbacks. I'd like to understand these drawbacks better so I can make an informed decision about whether to use the MAPE or some alternative like the MSE ( mse ), the MAE ( mae ) or the MASE ( mase ).
