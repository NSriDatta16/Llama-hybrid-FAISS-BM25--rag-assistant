Hope I have understood your question right... It can be proved that Hexagonal Close Packing (HCP) of spheres covers the maximum volume, using spheres. Therefore, I assume that doing HCP with circles will also cover the maximum area using circles. Tessellate your area with triangles and place a circle with the centre at each vertex of the triangle, with the radius half the length of the side of the triangle. See this for an image of the algorithm I am talking about. Note: This is similar to the close packing of atoms in a unit cell . EDIT: My previous method covers as much of the area as possible, without overlapping. If overlapping is allowed, then (I believe that) the following method would cover the whole area with minimum overlapping. As you probably know, there are only 3 tessellations of 2D space with regular polygons - using squares, triangles or hexagons. The strategy is to tessellate using one of these polygons and then circumscribe a circle to every polygon. A hexagon would waste the minimum area using this method. Therefore, from the radius of the given circle, calculate the size of the needed hexagons, tessellate the area using the hexagons and then circumscribe a circle onto each hexagon. NB: Eric Bainville suggested a similar method. -- Flaviu Cipcigan
