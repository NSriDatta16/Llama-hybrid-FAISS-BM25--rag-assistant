Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are an extension for RNN. This method can be used on object detection in case detect object in video or moving images, etc. You can try this https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/lstm_object_detection . It implementation from Tensorflow mobile video object detection implementation proposed in the following paper: Mobile Video Object Detection with Temporally-Aware Feature Maps (CVPR 2018).
