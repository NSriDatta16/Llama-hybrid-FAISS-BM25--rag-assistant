Scrum: What's the average number of stories in your backlog

I'm currently working on a productivity tool for Scrum teams and would like to know what is the average number of stories you see in a product backlogs at any particular time. Just to clarify the number should not include completed stories or stories which 'might' be broken into multiple stories in the future. Also I'm interested in what people 'are' doing rather than what they 'should' be doing. Unfortunately I don't get out and about enough to other peoples labs so only really have experience with what's normal for us. I'm guessing there are quite a few consultants on this site who maybe get to see far more team rooms than I do. Now I know this is a "how long is a piece of string" type question and there will be some people with two and some with two thousand, but I'm just looking for a yard stick. For the teams in our company is is usually less than twenty. Regards, Chris
