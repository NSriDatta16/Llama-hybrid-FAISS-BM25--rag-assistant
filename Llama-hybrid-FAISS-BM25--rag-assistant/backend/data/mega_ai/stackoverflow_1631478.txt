Two DropTarget in the same class does not work (Java) ?

I have two Jlist in the same class each with DnD drop enable. The problem is whatever file I DnD from my desktop to the JLists either number of or number 2 will populate ( and appear ) in JList1. Jlist2 accepts the drag and drop but it is like the content is going to Jlist1 automatically. Any idea on how to solve that ?
