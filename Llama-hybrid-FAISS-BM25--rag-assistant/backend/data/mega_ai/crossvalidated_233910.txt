The short answer is that logistic regression is for estimating probabilities , nothing more or less. You can estimate probabilities no matter how imbalanced $Y$ is. ROC curves and some of the other measures given in the discussion don't help. If you need to make a decision or take an action you apply the loss/utility/cost function to the predicted risk and choose the action that optimizes the expected utility. It seems that a lot of machine learning users are not really understanding risks and optimum decisions.
