Insert your results into a storage table, ordered how you'd like to display them, but with a new IDENTITY column. Now SELECT from that table just the range of IDs you're interested in. (Be sure to clean out the table when you're done) Or do it on the client, as anything to do with presentation should not normally be done on the SQL Server (in my opinion)
