Because attachments are defined at the class level, Paperclip interpolates the symbols in your strings using it's own interpolation library. You can create your own interpolations using this library. I would add a field to the model called attachment_version or something similar, and then increment this version number each time the file is changed. Then, create an interpolation for it in an initializer file: Paperclip.interpolates :version do |attachment, style| attachment.instance.attachment_version end Now you can use :version in your strings: class Model " :rails_root/public/somethings/etc/:version.:extension" end See the wiki documentation for more information. [Update] After some digging around (see the comments to this answer), I've come to the conclusion that Paperclip will still delete the old attachment due to code that's called in Paperclip::Atachment#attach . Probably the best way to deal with this is to create a new storage engine based on Paperclip::Storage::Filesystem and overwrite #flush_deletes . Note that there is no way in that method to tell if a file is being queued for deletion because of the model it belongs to being deleted or a new file is being uploaded in its place.
