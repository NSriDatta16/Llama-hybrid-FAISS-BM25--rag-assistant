I haven't used Haar features for face detection, but from what I remember it might be more effective at detecting a face than eigenfaces/pca. I have run into the issue about the rotation issues with the face. My thought is maybe you could try shape matching and attempt to correct the object. Try and oriented it for the normal head aspect ratio. I never got that far in my project with Eigenface, but let me know how that works out. That should be easy in matlab. :P
