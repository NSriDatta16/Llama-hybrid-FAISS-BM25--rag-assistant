T4 isn't compiling in the same context as your project code, so you'll need to use an assembly directive to load the output of your project. So long as your'e using VS2010 SP1, you won't find any assembly locking issues with this. However, this kind of recursive template that contributes to an assembly that it then helps to build can be fragile, as you need a version of the binary to bootstrap a clean build. If at all possible, I'd move your helper code into an Helper assembly that's not part of your finished project, rather just a part of your toolset.
