Measuring R-Squared by category

It makes sense to look at metrics like recall/precision by category when performing classification. sklearn has classification_report for this purpose. But what if I want to look at error by category in the context of a regression problem? Are there best practices for this? For example if I want to predict a target variable employee_salary using three predictor variables. Two integer variables years_of_school and years_on_the_job and one categorical variable industry which is one-hot encoded. employee_salary ~ years_of_school + years_on_the_job + industry_gov + industry_edu + industry_fin ... My goal is to figure out the R2 by industry to see if there are specific industries that are more/less predictable and may warrant more attention. How and when in the modeling process do I do this?
