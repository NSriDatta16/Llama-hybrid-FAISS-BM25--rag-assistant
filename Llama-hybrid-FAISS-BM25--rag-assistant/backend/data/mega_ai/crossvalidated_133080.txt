Density estimation for streams of Data

What statistical methods out there that will estimate the probability density of data as it arrives temporally? This is the situation I have: I need to estimate the pdf of a multivariate dataset; however, new data arrives over time and as the data arrives the density estimation must update. What I have been using so far is kernel estimations by storing all the data and computing a new kernel density estimation with every update of new data; however, I cannot keep up with the amount of data needed to be stored. Therefore, I need a method that will keep track of the overall pdf/density estimation then be able to update itself when new data arrives. This sort of sounds like it may need some sort of Bayesian method but I am not sure Any suggestions would be really helpful.
