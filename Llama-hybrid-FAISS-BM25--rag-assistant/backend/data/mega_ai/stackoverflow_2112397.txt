This hasn’t got much to do with \texttt . The word is simply too long, and LaTeX doesn’t know how to hyphenate it. You can tell it how to do this manually, by declaring hyphenation rules: \hyphenation{base-Admin-Configuration} The \hyphenation command may take arbitrarily many words, separated by whitespace. Alternatively, if this doesn’t the trick, you can introduce manual hypenation hints in the text: This is a long text that uses the word \texttt{base\-Admin\-Configuration) … Only the actual hyphenation will be displayed – unused so-called discretionary hyphens ( \- ) will not be displayed so you can freely sprinkle your text with them, if necessary.

The downside: this can lead to very ugly spacing. Alternatively, \tolerance and other internal parameters can be manipulated directly – the TeX FAQ shows how .
