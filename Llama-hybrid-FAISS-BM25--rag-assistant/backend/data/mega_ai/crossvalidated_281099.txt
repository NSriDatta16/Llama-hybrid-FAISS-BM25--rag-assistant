The appropriate model

I'm trying to explain the evolution of productivity(total factor productivity) by its determinants in my country with 46 observations for each variable I explain: I have the rate of growth of productivty a time series and I'm trying to explain it with the following independent variables: openness to trade political stability inflation rate human capital index credits to private sector foreign investements These variables are ratios to gdp except the dependant variable which is productivity,and other variables(human capital, inflation rate, political stability). I found no correlation between the independent variables and the productivity (dependent) variable. What could be the appropriate model for such a case ? And that's the correlation matrix and the p-value matrix of correlation. The dependent variable is ptfg the second column of the data set.
