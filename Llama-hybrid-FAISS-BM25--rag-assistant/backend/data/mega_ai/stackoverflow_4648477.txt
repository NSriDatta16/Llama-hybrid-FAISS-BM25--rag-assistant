SQLite as Android storage?

I am developing android apps, yet I used shared-pref and JSON(rest web service) for storing data. I generally tend to prefer less sophisticated technologies, as I believe more complexity results in more issues. But for my new app, it may be better to have db-like storage. What do you think about using SQLite in Android , is it really light? Have you experienced performance or compatibility issues developing SQLite for Android? Namely would you recommend SQLite over simpler alternatives as android storage solution? Thanks
