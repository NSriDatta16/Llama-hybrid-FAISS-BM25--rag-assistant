Where is my variable ? objective-c

I initialize a view(Image) through: Image *myImageView = [[Image alloc]init]; myImageView.myId = randomImageNumber; [myImageView initWithImage:myImage]; At the Image class I do a Log(LOG1) and get the previously set randomImageNumber. Later on, in the very same Class, I do a second Log(LOG2). Why does my second log have no value anymore ? Here my implementation-file of the Class Image: @synthesize myId; -(id) initWithImage: (UIImage *) anImage { NSLog(@"LOG1%d",myId); if ((self = [super initWithImage:anImage])) { self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; } return self; } } -(void)touchesBegan... .... - (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"LOG2%d",myId); } The "return self" empties myId which i declared in the header-file and which was set at the initialisation. How do I prevent that ? my Headerfile looks like this: @interface Image : UIImageView { int myId; } @property (assign) int myId; @end
