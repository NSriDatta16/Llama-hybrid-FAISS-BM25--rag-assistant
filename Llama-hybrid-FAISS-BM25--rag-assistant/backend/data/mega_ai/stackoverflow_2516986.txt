Basically you want to create a Master/Detail screen... is this homework? On any case, you want to add an event (selected index changed) to the first grid. Then add code there that will either set the data source or "filter" the data in the second grid, you might also choose to make the second grid visible at this point if is not already. The data source of the second grid needs a "WHERE" clause which will compare the processID in your datasource with the one selected in the first grid. You can set the first grid's data key to be this field (processID) for easy retrieval. Good luck!
