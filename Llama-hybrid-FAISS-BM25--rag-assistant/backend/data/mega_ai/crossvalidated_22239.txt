Data mining papers/examples

I am looking for some medium to long length papers/websites/etc about data mining, specifically where one dataset is explored in depth from data preparation through final model. I am particularly interested in discussions about application of machine learning algos and also basic data modeling. An example would be Luis Torgo's book 'Data Mining with R'. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
