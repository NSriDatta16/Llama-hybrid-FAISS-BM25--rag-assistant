You can use valgrind's Massif tool to get a heap profile. This code is still labelled "experimental", and it does not ship with all versions of valgrind. You may have to download and build from source. Also note that the heap profile is organized by allocation site, which is a finer granularity than classes. If you need information organized by class, you will have to read the developer documentation and get the machine-readable format, then figure out which allocation sites go with which classes - perhaps with support from your compiler. Even without support for classes, however, the Massif profile may be useful.
