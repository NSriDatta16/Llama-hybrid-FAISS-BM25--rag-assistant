To me, performing a drag and drop of list elements in place (i.e. within the list itself) is the best approach. Not only you can give to your users the immediate idea of what their list will look like (the list is reorganizing before their eyes), but it's also very easy for them to understand the moving mechanism. And this is the briefest way to have your users ordering the list in the shortest number of moves. By the way, foreseeing that a list could be longer than few elements, alongside the DnD method you could provide an asynchronous way to order the list: give the user the ability to attribute an ordering number to each entry, and then click on the "Order" button. Handling in a smart and correct way user's input, this could result in a speed up for longer lists editing.
