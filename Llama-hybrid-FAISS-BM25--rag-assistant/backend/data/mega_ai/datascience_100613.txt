There are not common implementations of the proposed method because there is not much to be gained by adding a step function to a neural network. A step function increases the complexity without significantly increasing the learning capacity of neural networks beyond a nonlinear activation function. The goal of neural networks is not to model biological neurons. The goal of spiking neuron models is to model biological neurons. Spiking neuron models often use the functions you describe.
