Sounds like a good candidate for pre-calculating and loading separately on-demand, perhaps even in a separate store. If the actual data is small, that's not too taxing and most iPhones can spare a meg or two of 'disk' storage for this sort of thing. If the values are mutable, you could run a background thread after modifications to make sure the pre-calc tables are kept up-to-date. A 'dirty' flag will let you know if the user interrupts the operation before it's done so you can do it again the next time the app is run.
