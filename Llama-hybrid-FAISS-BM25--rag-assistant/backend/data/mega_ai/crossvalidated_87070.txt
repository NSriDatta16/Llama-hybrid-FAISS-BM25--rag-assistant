I think you should use Bayesian Inference. So you have Distributions $A, B, C$ and sample $x$. What you are asking is what is the probability that $x$ is $A$ distributed given $x$, which by Bayes theorem is $Pr(x\sim A|x)=\frac{Pr(x|x\sim A)\cdot Pr(x\sim A)}{Pr(x)}$. You would determine $Pr(x|x\sim A)$ with your pdf for $A$. The $Pr(x\sim A)$ would come from how much of your overall population are $A$ distributed or for your example in the edit how likely anyone in the overall population is "severe" or "non-depressed". Then the only thing to calculate is $Pr(x)$ which we would get from the law of total probability $Pr(x)=Pr(x|x\sim A)\cdot Pr(x\sim A)+Pr(x|x\sim B)\cdot Pr(x\sim B)+Pr(x|x\sim C)\cdot Pr(x\sim C)$. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference
