Fixed effect vs random effect when all possibilities are included in a mixed effects model

In a mixed effects model the recommendation is to use a fixed effect to estimate a parameter if all possible levels are included (e.g., both males and females). It is further recommended to use a random effect to account for a variable if the levels included are just a random sample from a population (enrolled patients from the universe of possible patients) and you want to estimate the population mean and variance instead of the means of the individual factor levels. I am wondering if you are logically obliged to always use a fixed effect in this manner. Consider a study on how foot / shoe size changes through development and is related to, say, height, weight and age. ${\rm Side}$ clearly must be included in the model somehow to account for the fact that the measurements over the years are nested within a given foot and are not independent. Moreover, right and left are all the possibilities that can exist. In addition, it can be very true that for a given participant their right foot is larger (or smaller) than their left. However, although foot size does differ somewhat between the feet for all people, there is no reason to believe that right feet will on average be larger than left feet. If they are in your sample, this is presumably due to something about the genetics of the people in your sample, rather than something intrinsic to right-foot-ness. Finally, ${\rm side}$ seems like a nuisance parameter, not something you really care about. Let me note that I made this example up. It may not be any good; it is just to get the idea across. For all I know, having a large right foot and a small left foot was necessary for survival in the paleolithic. In a case like this, would it make (more / less / any) sense to incorporate ${\rm side}$ in the model as a random effect? What would be the pros and cons of using a fixed vs. random effect here?
