How to exclude a parent element based on a child's attribute using XSL?

I am building a Wix installer that is based on a set of auto-generated XML files (I use HEAT to harvest folder content). I need to exclude certain files from a resulting XML, for example, from this fragment I want to exclude a file "Web.config": I apply the following transformation: Unfortunately it only removes the "File" element (the one it matches), I would like to remove the parent element ("Component") for the matched "File" sub-element. This must be relatively easy in XSLT, but I haven't figured it out. Thanks in advance
