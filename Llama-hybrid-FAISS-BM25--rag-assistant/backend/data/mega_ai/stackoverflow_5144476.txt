C# need to add data to a field when a record is touched

I've built a form that has a listbox on the left side, and a bunch of text fields on the right for each field in the data source. When the user clicks on an entry on the left it moves to that record so they can modify the fields on the right. All works fine up to this point. The problem is that each user has a unique ID number and once they start typing in the record fields I want to populate a hidden field with their ID number so when they save, I know who touched that record. I cannot find a suitable event to handle this method. I am not using a datagrid, I simply dragged members from the data sources window onto the form accordingly. CurrentChanged and CurrentItemChanged fire off when switching between items on the listbox so these don't reflect the behavior I need. Any thoughts?
