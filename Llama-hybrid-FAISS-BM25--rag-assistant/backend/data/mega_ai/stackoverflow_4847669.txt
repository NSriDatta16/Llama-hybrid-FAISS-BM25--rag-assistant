Recalling an instance variable in a virtual attribute with Ruby

So I am just starting to make my way through The Pragmatic Bookself's, " Programming Ruby 1.9 (3rd Edition) " and I've come across some code that I need a little clarification on. If you own the book, it's in Chapter 3's, "Classes, Objects, and Variables," specifically in the section about virtual attributes. Basically, a class is defined with an initializer that sets a couple of instance variables, one of which is @price . That variable has an accessor / mutator created with attr_accessor like so: attr_accessor :price That class also has a virtual attribute called, price_in_cents which simply returns the value from this line: Integer(price*100 + 0.5) Now my question is why is price in the virtual attribute not prefixed with an @ ? It is clearly dealing with an instance variable. Executing the code without the @ works just the same as with; why is that? P.S. Sorry for not just posting the code wholesaleâ€”given that this is a question about code in a book, I wasn't sure what legal right I'd have to post.
