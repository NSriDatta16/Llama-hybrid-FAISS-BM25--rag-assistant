Here is my top 10 list of what is funky , cool , happening and grooooovy : In at 1, Concurrency, scalability and distributed data implementations In at 2, Programming Languages and Meta-Object structures In at 3, Image analysis and automated environment interpretation In at 4, AI and NLP combinations in Search technologies In at 5, Self-replicating automata and swarm intelligence In at 6, Human/Machine hardware interfaces (wetware) In at 7, Nano-robotics in medicine In at 8, Medical/Life Simulation (think simulating a virus that attacks cancer) In at 9, Real-time Raytraced graphics In at 10, Automated Social Interaction/experimentation using online communities I feel it might be balanced to add a few Empty hype items that have potential, but so far are pretty lame/boring from a technical perspective ... but with some thought could get interesting: Location Based Services Google Wave ... isn't this just very rich, relational email? I take this back, I watched the developer video thingy. Now i'm hyped :P Wikis ... Blank canvas, not much going on. How dry is wikipedia ;P Payment/virtual currency. Too much freeconomy going on online. Secondlife/MM-style games - Interesting tech, no juice Flash, Silverlight, JavaFX - A single open solution might be nice. Google Chrome OS - Doing away with X11! Sounds like Microsoft's embrace-extend-extinguish game plan to me Note: Facebook, Google and Twitter do not appear in the list. They are API
