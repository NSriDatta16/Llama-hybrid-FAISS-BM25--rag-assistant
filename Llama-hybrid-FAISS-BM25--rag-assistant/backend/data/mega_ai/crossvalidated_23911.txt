When it comes to PCA, relatively few approaches are objectively wrong. But I see two potential problems with your approach. First, suppose a variable has no high loading on any obtained component. That means it is basically independent from the other variables in the analysis. Does this mean it will not contribute to your regression? Not necessarily. Suppose it fills "its own niche" very well in accounting for some of the variance in your outcome. After all, that outcome was not included in the PCA, right? The use of the PCA axes in the regression analysis was impossible to interpret (since there wasn't a clear correlation with environmental variables), so we chose to select a limited number of variables, namely those that had the higher explanation in PCA. The last part of this seems contradictory to me. If you want to use individual variables as predictors rather than the poorly-performing components that summarize dimensions in the data, the most consistent thing to do is to disregard the PCA results when selecting predictors. You care about how a predictor relates to the outcome, not about ensuring that different predictors are correlated with each other. Another note: it sounds as if you have conducted or will conduct multiple iterations of regression as you attempt to find good predictors. You'll want to read, on this site or elsewhere, discussions of ways to avoid the pitfalls that come with that. I'd recommend looking at posts on this site with the tag "variable selection."
