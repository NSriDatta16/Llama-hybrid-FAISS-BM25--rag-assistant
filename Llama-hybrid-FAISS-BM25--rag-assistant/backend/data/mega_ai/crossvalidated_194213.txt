See High p-values for logistic regression variable that perfectly separates? & How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? for some background. If stepwise selection were appropriate (take @gung's advice to read Algorithms for automatic model selection ), a straightforward approach would be just to make the decisions based on likelihood-ratio tests (equivalently AIC), as the Wald tests will be badly wrong. Perhaps you could take a similar approach with Firth regression: Heinze & Schemper (2002), "A solution to the problem of separation in logistic regression", Statist. Med. , 21 , pp 2409â€“19, form a penalized log likelihood ratio test statistic for the null hypothesis that a given coefficient is zero analogously to the unpenalized version, & imply that its asymptotic distribution is also chi-square with one degree of freedom. (By the way, "problem" is rather a loaded term.)
