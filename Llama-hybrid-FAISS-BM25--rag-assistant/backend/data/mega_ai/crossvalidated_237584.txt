Aggregation system for percentage Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

I need some suggestions for an issue regarding our business intelligence (BI) system, percentage Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and average values. I am using a BI system for our organization, which allows for quantitative four-monthly KPIs, monitoring individual variation between target and actual values, and producing a four-monthly and yearly percentage. The only fields our offices have to fill in are, at the beginning of the year, the four-monthly target values, and during the year, the fourth-monthly actual value every four months. The BI system automatically does all the calculations for the differences and the four-monthly and total percentage of success. For instance: KPI "Clients" | Target | Actual | Difference | % --------------------------------------------------- April 4 4 0 100% August 4 3 -1 75% December 4 1 -3 25% --------------------------------------------------- YEARLY TOTAL 12 8 -4 66% We have to develop a way to extend this to the use of percentage KPI values , keeping the same system (only target and actual values are to be entered by our offices). I am having quite a hard time figuring it out, in particular for the yearly totals and success percentage aggregation method. Here is an example: KPI "% of reports delivered on time" | Target | Actual | Difference | % --------------------------------------------------- April 25% 20% -5 80% August 50% 55% +5 100% December 75% 70% -5 93,33% --------------------------------------------------- YEARLY TOTAL ??% ??% ?? ??% The software engineer proposed to use arithmetic averages, but I know it is wrong to simply average percentages in this way. Also, a percentage yearly final value, in the previous example, would be the december value (75%), not an average value, since it's the final target I am trying to achieve... Some solutions I've been thinking about: using the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic mean, which fits best comparing different items such as percentages, but I am worried about our offices not understanding the resulting yearly total values; using a "fixed" yearly target value for all the four-monthly periods (instead of variable four-monthly target values), that would make it easy to measure the differences against the same value, and to average the results.
