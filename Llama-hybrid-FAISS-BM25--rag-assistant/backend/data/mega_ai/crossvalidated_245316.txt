We usually call multivariate HMM an HMM that model multidimensional observations. If you have time series in the form: X = [1 2 3 4 5 1 2] (each value corresponding to a time step), you will model them using a univariate HMM (as only one variable varies) If the time series you are modeling have the form: X = [1 2 3 4 5 1 2; 5 4 3 2 1 5 4] (i.e., a matrix with 2 rows, with each column corresponding to a time step), you will model them using a multivariate HMM (as you are observing multiple variables - 2 in this case). The dimensions of your observations defines the dimension of the emission probability distributions used in the HMM.
