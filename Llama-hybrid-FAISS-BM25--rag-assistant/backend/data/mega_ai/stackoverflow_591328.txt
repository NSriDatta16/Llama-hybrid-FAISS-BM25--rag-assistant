What are your tips for best practice for web application structure?

I do a lot of custom applications at work. I'm trying to define some standards for new applications. Something a little like Elements. CSS : How do you organize the style sheets? Should I have one base style sheet for the whole site and one for each individual page for customizations? Should I have another for print styles? I've heard that linking more files takes more time for the browser to retrieve them. (More objects per page...also a problem with lots of javascript files or images) ... How many is is too many? Do you heavily comment your CSS? Provide any nested structure? Alphabetize within elements? Do I need a reset? What about imports? And typography? Javascript : Basically the same question. Javascript files...Should I include one or two nice libraries (JQuery and Prototype, for example) and then have another included for each page? Now I'm suddenly including 5 or 6 CSS and JS files... Directory Structure : How do you organize a site? Currently, I use something like /CSS ... For CSS files /JS ... For javascript files /INC ... For private code includes /ASSETS/IMG ... For images /ASSETS/AU ... For audio /ASSETS/SWF ... For Flash Also, any other tips would be welcome. Thanks!!
