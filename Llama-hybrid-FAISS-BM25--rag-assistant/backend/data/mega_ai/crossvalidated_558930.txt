There are a few options. A key assumption of most risk models is that the outcomes are independent conditioned on the covariates. So, it may suffice to build something like a logistic regression and update your risk estimate as customer data is updated. This main benefit of this approach is its simplicity: in a batch manner, update your design matrix and re-score individuals. Using interpretable models like logistic regression has the added benefit that you can interpret how changes in one variable will lead to changes to the outcome. Another approach would be to use a class of models known as mixed models . It may be the case that the risk changes differently for customer A and B as their cost of living changes, for example. We can estimate a effect for each customer, pooling information from all customers to help inform the model on customers we might see in the future.
