Very likely the OOM killer . If you really , really really want to stay out of its reach, as root , have your process write -17 to /proc/self/oom_adj . Caution: The kernel usually knows better. Evading the OOM killer can actually cripple the same RDBMS that you are trying to query. What a vicious cycle that would be :) You probably (instead) want to stagger queries based on what you read from /proc/loadavg and /proc/meminfo . If you increase loads or swap exponentially, you need to back off, especially as a background process :) Additionally, monitor IOWAIT while you run. This can be averaged from /proc/stat when compared with the time the system booted. Note it when you start and as you progress. Unfortunately, the serial killer known as the OOM killer does not maintain a body count that is accessible beyond parsing kernel messages. Or, your cron job keeps hitting its ulimit ed amount of allocated heap. Either way, your job needs to back off when appropriate, or prevent its own demise (as noted above) prior to doing any work. As a side note, you probably should not be doing what you are doing on shared hosting. If its that big, its time to get a VPS (at least) where you have some control over what process gets to do what.
