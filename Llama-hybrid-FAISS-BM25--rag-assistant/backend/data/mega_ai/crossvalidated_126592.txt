How many observations do I need to implement ARIMA?

I need to model an ARIMA with a time-series data. But my data is the statistics of land area, and it's annual data, so I have 64 points between 1950~2014. Because it increased by a stable rate, So I think maybe it can used to build ARIMA. Since I know the time series analysis may need as many observation as possible, so I'm little concerned about my data. But in other hand, the land area wouldn't change dramatically like interest rate, price. So I think may be I have enough observations for ARIMA modelling. So can anyone give some advice?
