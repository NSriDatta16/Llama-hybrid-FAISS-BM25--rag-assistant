Ignoring the "change point" your description suggests to me a (non-linear) mixed effects model of the following form: g(E(Yi)) = Xi*beta + Zi*U Where The betas are fixed effects, the U's are random effects, g(E(yi)) is the (logit) link to a binomial mean. This will deal with logitudinal correlation of data and the non-Guassian distribution issues. This must be coupled with some form of change point model, probably a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_markov_model It may be necessary to set-up the model as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in MCMC format, or even specify it fully in a Bayesian framework using software such as WinBUGS.
