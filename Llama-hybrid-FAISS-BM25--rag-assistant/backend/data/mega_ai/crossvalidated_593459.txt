I think beyond the base assumptions of a random forest (or any other model method really) should be a logical and practical awareness for what using just three animals that have bee repeatedly sampled means for the utility of the model, even if the model built is with the utmost attention to detail using best practices. The entire idea of predictive models such as this (as opposed to parametric models used for statistical inference for example) is to generalize something from your data to other instances of some system of individuals or events. On a purely pragmatic level, how confident would you be in assuming whatever you are estimating with just three sample animals can be fully summarized by just three test subjects? And how does using different times in their life (read that as samples under different environmental conditions) help or hurt your study. While I understand and sympathize with having limited data (it is something we all struggle with at some point) ultimately it comes down to what is the consequence for the utility of the model down the road?
