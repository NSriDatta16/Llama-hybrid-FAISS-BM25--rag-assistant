Using MatchIt in R after performing PCA

I want to use the package 'MatchIt' in R to perform propensity score analysis. However, my dataset has 100 variables and to reduce the dimensionality I'm using Principal Components Analysis(PCA) and selecting around 60 of them. My question is, can matching be done on the PCs so obtained? Or can only the original dataset be used for this?
