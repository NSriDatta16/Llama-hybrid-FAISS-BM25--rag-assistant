You can use a self join just like you join to other tables using PK & FK . I think you should design this with some things to consider. Examples: Different Managers: Tom is a Jr. Pgmr today, and Jerry is his Manager today. Tomorrow Tom may report to Sebastian. Promotions: Tom is a Jr. Pgmr today, and Jerry is his Manager today. Tomorrow Tom may become a manager himself and have people reporting to him. Promotions 2: Tom may go from Jr Pgmr to Sr Pgmr to Team Lead to Project Lead to Manager. Do you want to save this? Reporting: You may want to show hierarchy at a point in time (some user will come ask for this for a report sooner or later) You may want to consider splitting up the data into separate entities - normalizing the data as follows (or even more as your needs may be) Employees Table: Basic employee info Position Lookup Table: List of all positions in the organization Employee Position Table: Track with start date and end date when a position change occurred for the employee. Employee Position Hierarchy Table: What Employee Position reports to another Employee Position (using a double join instead of a self join); with start and end timestamps
