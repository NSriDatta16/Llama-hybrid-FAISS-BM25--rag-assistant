The question of robustness of the posterior with respect to perturbations of prior/likelihood/model/data is crucial for Bayesian inference, but also very delicate, since things really depend on which metric(s) you consider, and there are positive and negative results. I am not aware of any positive results if the likelihood perturbation is measured by total variation, on the contrary, there is a negative result in this paper by Owhadi, Scovel and Sullivan "On the Brittleness of Bayesian Inference". Hope this helps.
