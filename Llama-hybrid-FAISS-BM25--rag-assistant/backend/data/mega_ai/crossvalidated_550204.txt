After predicting a Random Forest how do I spatially project predictions onto a raster?

After making a random forest model of nitrate prediction from a set of 11 (categorical and continuous) explanatory variables I want to visualize these projections spatially on a map. Most of the explanatory variables I am using are factor variables from raster layers but not all of them - some are point data. I could export the raster layers from GIS into R but then what? Would the opposite be easier, joining predictions to a layer and making the map in GIS? I cannot find any resources on how to do this online for a beginner.
