Thanks to @Demetri Pananos for getting me started on how to calculate this. The equation in the ISLR2 book is So, following this, if we call the combined returns of managers 1 and 3 group 1, and the combined returns of managers 2, 4, and 5 group 2. xbar The part of the equation I was having trouble adapting from the simple two-group t-test to the groups-within-each-group t-test was the numerator of the fraction in the equation for $s$ prior to applying the square root, specifically the $(n_t - 1)s_t^2 + (n_c - 1)s_c^2$ part: because we have multiple $i$ groups in both $(n_t - 1)s_t^2$ and $(n_c - 1)s_c^2$ rather than a single group. This is where @Demetri Pananos' answer helped so much: for each of these two group variances we simply sum the variances of the fund managers within each group # group 1 has two managers (50-1)*s[ix]^2 # two individual variances, one for each manager, before summing # output [1] 2683.24 2756.25 sum((50-1)*s[ix]^2) # pooled variance for first group after summing # output # [1] 5439.49 # group 2 has three managers (50-1)*s[-ix]^2 # three individual variances before summing # output [1] 2332.89 2199.61 2265.76 sum((50-1)*s[-ix]^2) # pooled variance for second group after summing # output # [1] 6798.26 So, now we know how to get the two pooled variances for each of the groups in the t-test, we can calculate the numerator of $s$ equation before we apply the square root numerator_seq For the denominator of the $s$ equation before square root we take total number in group 1 plus total number in group 2 minus 5 (this is the part I guessed: number of managers in group 1 plus number of managers in group 2: 2 + 3 = 5) denom_seq Now we can calculate $s$ s And now that we have $s$ we can calculcate the denominator of the t equation denom_t Numerator of the t equation is the average of mean returns for all of the fund managers in each group num_t Finally we can calculate t t And we can get the p-value from plugging our t statistic values into a t distribution with n_group1 + n_group2 - 5 (5 from number of managers in group1 = 2 plus number of managers in group2 = 3) = 145 degrees of freedom p This yields the same p-value as is supplied in ISLR.
