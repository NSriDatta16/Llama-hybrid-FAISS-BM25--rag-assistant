The error message you are getting back could be misleading. For example the server might be looking at user-agent and seeing that say it's not one of the supported browsers, or looking at HTTP_REFERER expecting it to be coming from hulu domain. My point is there are two many variables coming in the request to keep guessing them one by one I recommend using an http analyzer tool, e.g. Charles or the one in Firebug to figure out what (header fields, cookies, parameters) the client sends to server when you doing hulu login via a browser. This will give you the exact request that you need to construct in your python code.
