Interesting definitions from SPR (Software Productivity Research) Baseline and benchmark are similar but distinct activities. Figuratively, a baseline is a "line in the sand" for an organization whereby it measures important performance characteristics for future reference. This is not necessarily a "good" state", just a reference. A benchmark is best understood by way of the original derivation of the word itself: Tradesmen engaged in repetitive tasks, such as sawing lumber to consistent lengths, often placed notches on their workbenches to indicate placement of boards prior to cutting. Literally, a benchmark became a standard for comparison and an indicator of past success . Basically: baseline is about identification of a significant state , meaning your set of numbers met an approval status, publicly recognized. a benchmark is about assessing the relative performance of an application.
