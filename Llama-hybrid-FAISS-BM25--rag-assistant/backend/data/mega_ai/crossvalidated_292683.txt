The autocorrelation function of a continuous-time white Gaussian noise process is generally taken to be a some constant $K$ times $\delta(t)$ and $K$ is NOT the standard deviation of the Gaussian random variable $w(t_0)$, nor the variance, for that matter. In particular, $w(t)$ cannot be treated as a Gaussian random variable with finite variance and the concept of $(w(t_0))^2$ as a chi-square random variable is mostly meaningless. See my answer to this question on dsp.SE for some details. For a discrete-time random process, the random variables $w(nT), n \in \mathbb Z$ are a time series of independent zero-mean Gaussian random variables with fixed variance $\sigma^2$ and so the $(w(nT))^2$ are indeed a time series of independent scalar multiples of a chi-square random variable with one degree of freedom.
