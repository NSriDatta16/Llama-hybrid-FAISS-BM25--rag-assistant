I found the Udacity course here https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730 to be really good for several reasons. It uses Python, allowing you to focus more on the concepts then the coding. The lectures break it down really well into small digestible concepts. Every once and a while there are fun assignments to test your knowledge. Using tensorflow to create neural networks is very easy, and also allows you to focus more on the concepts without having to worry about implementation of the actual neural network.
