I had some similar experiences with the Simulator recently - I'm dealing with an application driving several table views from Core Data, and it also presents a bunch of UIAlertViews and UIActionSheets at various points through the application. I've noticed that the Simulator doesn't respond well to touch events right after a UI action (table cell insert, action sheet display, etc.) occurs. It usually helps for me to either switch to another window then back to the Simulator or click and drag the mouse through some touch-inactive area of the Simulator, then try the action I want again Your mileage may vary. It may be a pain during testing, but as long as everything works properly on the device, you should be fine.
