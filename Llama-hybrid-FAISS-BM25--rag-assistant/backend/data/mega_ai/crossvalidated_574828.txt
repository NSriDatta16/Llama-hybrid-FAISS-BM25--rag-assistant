How to interpret fitted coefficients in a multiple regression model: binary, continuous, and interaction terms

Suppose I have a multiple regression model: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_1x_2 + \epsilon$ where $y$ is continuous $x_1$ is dichotomous (0 or 1) $x_2$ is continuous If $x_1 = 0$ , then this model becomes: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_2x_2 + \epsilon$ which has the format y = intercept + slope*x_2 + epsilon and if $x_1 = 1$ , then this model becomes: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1(1) + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3(1)x_2 + \epsilon$ $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_2 + \epsilon$ $y = (\beta_0 + \beta_1) + (\beta_2 + \beta_3)x_2 + \epsilon$ which has the format y = intercept + slope*x_2 + epsilon, just like when $x_1 = 0$ . So the format of the final fitted regression equation will be the same regardless of the value of the dichotomous variable, and the result is that you will never see that an interaction term was included in the model. Putting numbers to this, suppose when $x_1 = 0$ , the fitted regression equation is: $y = 10 + 20x_2 + \epsilon$ and when $x_1 = 1$ , the fitted regression equation is: $y = 11 + 25x_2 + \epsilon$ My question is: How would we interpret the coefficients of the fitted model in both cases? Would there be some hidden explanation of the interaction term involved? Here's my best guess: First equation: Interpreting the fitted intercept: When $x_2 = 0$ , the estimated value of the response variable is 11 on average. Interpreting the fitted slope: When $x_1 = 0$ (i.e., for the first level of the dichotomous variable), a unit increase in the continuous variable $x_2$ results in a 20 unit increase in the response variable on average. Second equation: Interpreting the fitted intercept: When $x_2 = 0$ , the estimated value of the response variable is 15 on average. Interpreting the fitted slope: When $x_1 = 1$ , a unit increase in the continuous variable $x_2$ results in a 25 unit increase in the response variable on average. Regarding the interaction: There is a 5-unit increase in the fitted slope for $x_2$ when $x_1 = 0$ vs. when $x_1 = 1$ . There is a 1-unit increase in the fitted intercept...not sure how to finish this.
