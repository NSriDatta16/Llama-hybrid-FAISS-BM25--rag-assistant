Averaging R2 between different sized test sets

I'm testing a model using different tests sets. In fact, I'm mimicking cross validation but since my data is correlated I used data from individual years as test sets instead of assigning my data randomly to different test sets. For each test set, I computed $R^2$ as: $$R^2=1-\frac{\sum_i{(y_i-\hat{y_i})^2}}{\sum_i{(y_i-\bar{y_i})^2}}=1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}$$ Now I'm averaging those $R^2$ to get an average test $R^2$ . As far as I know, the usual way of averaging $R^2$ is just to take the arithmetic mean across all train sets. However, my train sets are different sized because I have more cases from some years than other ones and years with more data should be given more weight. My approach has been to sum squared residuals and total residuals across all test sets and sum total squares across all test sets and use them to compute $R^2$ : $$\bar{R^2} =1- \frac{\sum_{years}RSS_{year}}{\sum_{years}TSS_{year}}$$ I think my approach is reasonable but I'm concerned that I might be reinventing the wheel. Therefore my question is: Is there a standard way to average test $R^2$ across test sets of different size?
