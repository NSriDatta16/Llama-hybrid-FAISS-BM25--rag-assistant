What is the best approach: Labeled training data and unlabeled test data

I'm new into the data science world and I am working on improving my knowledge so here is my problem: I want to build a binary classifier with the following constraints: I have 2 files training.csv and test.csv The first file contains a dataset with 59 numerical features and a label that should be predicted. The second file contains a dataset with the same features but without a label. My question is: How to predict the unknown labels with a suitable evaluation method? EDIT -I want to achieve binary classification on unlabeled test data while training it on labeled data. Data: -train data: 795 rows with 59 numerical features and a label (blanaced 0:495, 1:300). -test data: 91 rows with 59 numerical features but without a label my question is: How to approach this kind of problems with suitable evaluation metrics.
