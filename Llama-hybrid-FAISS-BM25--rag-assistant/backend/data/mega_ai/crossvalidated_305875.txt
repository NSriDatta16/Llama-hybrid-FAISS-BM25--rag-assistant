Average absolute value of a coordinate of a random unit vector?

Let $\vec x$ be a random unit vector (that is, a random vector on the unit sphere). Let $x_i$ be the $i$'th coordinate (if it is easier, you can assume we are in 3-dimensional space). What is the distribution of $|x_i|$? More specifically, what is the expected value $\langle|x_i|\rangle$?
