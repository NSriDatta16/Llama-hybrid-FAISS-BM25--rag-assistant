Another problem which linear regression shrinkage methods can address is obtaining a low variance (possibly unbiased) estimate of an average treatment effect (ATE) in high-dimensional case-control studies on observational data. Specifically, in cases where 1) there are a large number of variables (making it difficult to select variables for exact matching), 2) propensity score matching fails to eliminate imbalance in the treatment and control samples, and 3) multicollinearity is present, there are several techniques, such as the adaptive lasso (Zou, 2006) that obtain asymptotically unbiased estimates. There have been several papers that discuss using lasso regression for causal inference and generating confidence intervals on coefficient estimates (see the following post: Inference after using Lasso for variable selection ).
