Designing a database schema for a Job Listing website?

For a school project I'm making a simple Job Listing website in ASP.NET MVC (we got to choose the framework). I've thought about it awhile and this is my initial schema: JobPostings +---JobPostingID +---UserID +---Company +---JobTitle +---JobTypeID +---JobLocationID +---Description +---HowToApply +---CompanyURL +---LogoURL JobLocations +---JobLocationID +---City +---State +---Zip JobTypes +---JobTypeID +---JobTypeName Note: the UserID will be linked to a Member table generated by a MembershipProvider. Now, I am extremely new to relational databases and SQL so go lightly on me. What about naming? Should it be just "Description" under the JobPostings table, or should it be "JobDescription" (same with other columns in that main table). Should it be "JobPostingID" or just "ID"? General tips are appreciated as well. Edit: The JobTypes are fixed for our project, there will be 15 job categories. I've made this a community wiki to encourage people to post.
