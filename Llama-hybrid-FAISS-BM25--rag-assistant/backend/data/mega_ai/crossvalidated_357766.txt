How to simulate from a gaussian conditional density?

Here's the problem: Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are random vectors which are jointly normally distributed with density $p(x,y)$. I wish to draw samples from the density $p(x|y)$. Denote a draw from $p(x,y)$ as $x^{+}$ and $y^{+}$ and let $\hat{x}=E(x|y)$ and $\hat{x}^+=E(x^{+}|y^{+})$. I want to prove that the vector $\tilde{x}$, defined as $$ \tilde{x} = x^{+} - \hat{x}^+ + \hat{x},$$ is a draw from $p(x|y)$, by proving that $E(\tilde{x}|y)= E(x|y)$ and $V(\tilde{x}|y) = V(x|y).$ This algorithm appears in Durbin and Koopman(2002), Biometrika, under the title 'A simple and efficient simulation smoother for state space time series analysis'. Thanks, Aqua.
