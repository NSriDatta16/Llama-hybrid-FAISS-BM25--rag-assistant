SMTP and HTTP aren't mutually compatible protocols; in fact, they are completely different from each other. What you could try is to use a loophole in the HTTP CONNECT method: instead of GET or POST, send CONNECT yourserver:yourport HTTP/1.0 - you should get a TCP connection to the requested host and port ( see this for a more complete reference). Note that some proxies will limit the allowed destination port to 443 (HTTPS) or otherwise inspect the CONNECT traffic, to prevent people from tunneling to any service (e.g. SMTP). Note that in most organizations, such actions might be interpreted as "circumventing access controls and/or security policy", so proceed with caution.
