Jquery ui-sortable - unable to drop tr in empty tbody

I have two connected tbody elements allowing me to drag rows between two tables. Everything works fine until all rows are removed from either table. When all rows have been dragged to the other table the tbody height decreases making it (near)impossible to drop rows back inside. Is there a known workaround for this problem? (min-height doesn't work on a tbody element) Many thanks in advance.
