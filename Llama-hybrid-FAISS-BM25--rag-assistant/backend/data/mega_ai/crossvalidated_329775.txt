K means is very sensitive to feature scaling. So it's hard to get mathematically meaningful results when your axes have different units! Furthermore, the PCA plot is likely misleading . It is probably showing some artifact of your data. There probably is some attribute with very high variance and just three levels (e.g. income 1000, 10000, 100000) that dominates this visualization in an undue way. The other attributes then just add a "gaussian blur" to this. So all you are doing is reverse engineer that attribute that already is in your data. My guess is that you can simply identify it by looking at the highest variance attribute.
