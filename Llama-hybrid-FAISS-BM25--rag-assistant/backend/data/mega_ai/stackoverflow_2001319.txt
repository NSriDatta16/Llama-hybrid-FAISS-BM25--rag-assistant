G'day, Similar to karoberts answer, I prefer the more direct: :map :!python % If my script is creating some output I also like to capture it in a temp file and then autoread that files content into another buffer, e.g. :map :!python % 2>&1 \| tee /tmp/results I then set autoread by entering :set autoread and opening the results file in another buffer :split /tmp/results Then I can easily see the results of the run in the buffer that auto refreshes when the results file is updated by running the script under development. HTH cheers,
