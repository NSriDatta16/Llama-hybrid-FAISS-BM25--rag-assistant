OK I have solved my issue. I added the following into WebpartManager.WebpartAdded() ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Dim wp1 As WebPart = zoneDiaryTopLeft.WebParts("Ucl_Diary_Summary1") Dim wp2 As WebPart = zoneDiaryTopRight.WebParts("Ucl_DiaryAwaitingReview1") Dim providerConnectionPoint As ProviderConnectionPoint = _ WebPartManager1.GetProviderConnectionPoints(wp1)("IMessageProvider") Dim consumerConnectionPoint As ConsumerConnectionPoint = _ WebPartManager1.GetConsumerConnectionPoints(wp2)("IMessageConsumer") Dim returnValue As WebPartConnection returnValue = WebPartManager1.ConnectWebParts(wp1, providerConnectionPoint, wp2, consumerConnectionPoint) ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' All said, how does it know/store the connection that was removed and remember to NOT allow that to be active!? It would be much easier if I could stop the connection being removed or re-enable it. I know dynamic connections are an option but I dont want users having this ability as they having a hard enough job understanding the fact you can drag a webpart around the screen. Connections are rocketscience to them.
