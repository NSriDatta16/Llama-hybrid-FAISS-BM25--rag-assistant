How can I dynamically add and remove using prototype and scriptaculous?

I'm writing a basic recipe organization application and I would like to be able to dynamically add additional items to the list of ingredients using Ajax. This is what one ingredient looks like: Ingredient Amount Unit Notes new Ajax.Autocompleter('ingredient_0','ingredient_list_0','ingredients.php', {'method':'get', 'paramName': 't'}); new Ajax.Autocompleter('unit_0','unit_list_0','units.php', {'method':'get', 'paramName': 't'}); What is the best way (using prototype and scriptaculous) to add additional copies of this with the accompanying JavaScript to the page making sure each one has a unique ID?
