With complex forms, I usually split the code into separate files. You can do this using "partial class". Each source code file is named based on the form. For example, MainForm.cs, MainForm.State.cs, MainForm.Update.cs, MainForm.Menu.cs and so on. If I have many complex forms, I will create a subfolder for each. The one tip here, is to create a MainForm.Wip.cs form. This partial class form is the code you are currently working on. Once you are done with this code, you can either rename it or move the code to other source code files. In addition, I will also create user-controls. This has the benefit of code reuse and it moves a lot of the functionality out of the form.
