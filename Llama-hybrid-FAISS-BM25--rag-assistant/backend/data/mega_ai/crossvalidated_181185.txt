Classification vs Regression: Which to choose?

Suppose I have some training data pairs $(x, y)$, where both $x$ and $y$ are real values between 0 and 1. I want to train a multi-layer neural network to predict the value of $y$ given a new $x$. Now, there are two ways to do this. One is to train the network for regression, mapping $x$ to a real-value for $y$ at the output node. The other is to discretise the data in $y$, and train the network for classification, mapping $x$ to several real-values for $y$ at output nodes. My question is: Aside from the fact that classification will introduce discretisation errors, would there likely be difference in performance between the two methods? How can I determine which method would be the best for my particular data? Thanks you!
