When using constants they are implemented as constant functions behaving something like: use subs 'BASE_PATH'; sub BASE_PATH () {"/data/monitor/"} Any uses of BASE_PATH in the program are inlined and so can't be modified. To achieve similar you could manually use the subs pragma (to make BASE_PATH behave as a built in function) and declare BASE_PATH as a standard function: use subs 'BASE_PATH'; sub BASE_PATH {"/data/monitor/"} print "BASE_PATH is ".BASE_PATH."\n"; *BASE_PATH = sub {"/new/path"}; print "BASE_PATH is ".BASE_PATH."\n"; Although why you would want to do this I'm not too sure.
