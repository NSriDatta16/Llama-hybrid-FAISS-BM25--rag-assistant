How does versioning work with Flex remote objects and AMF?

Suppose I use the [RemoteClass] tag to endow a custom Flex class with serialization intelligence. What happens when I need to change my object (add a new field, remove a field, rename a field, etc)? Is there a design pattern for handling this in an elegant way?
