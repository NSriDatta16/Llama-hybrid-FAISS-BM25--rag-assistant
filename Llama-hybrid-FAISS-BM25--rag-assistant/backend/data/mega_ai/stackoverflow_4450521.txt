Magento "Miscellaneous scripts"

@ /index.php/admin/system_config/edit/section/design/ Does adding to Magento's "Miscellaneous scripts" field affect every page in the site frontend? For instance, if I want lightbox, can I add the script here and then call it anywhere i configure say a Widget or Static Block? This question came up because JW Player told me they have no specific plans to make a Magento plug-in (like they have for wordpress) but they said that the player "should run" if the script is in the header.
