ARIMA(0,0,3) fitted values and residuals in R

I am trying to understand the residuals returned from a fitted ARIMA(0,0,3) model. I simulated a time series and recovered the parameters: set.seed(seed = 1) x So far, so good. The recovered parameters are close to the "true" parameters. I can also back into the white noise terms and recalculate the time series. And how do I interpret the residuals(x.ma) relative to those predicted values? Specifically, how do I relate those values to the simulated data and my fitted values?
