Bear in mind that Style Cop is a tool for enforcing a particular (in this case Microsoft's internal) coding style . Its recommendations should not be accorded the same weight as those of FxCop, or any other recommendations from the (excellent) Framework Design Guidelines book. The person or organisation that controls any given source code should be the source of the style guidelines for that code - there is no global 'official' coding style any more than there is an 'official' email signature or 'official' coding font.
