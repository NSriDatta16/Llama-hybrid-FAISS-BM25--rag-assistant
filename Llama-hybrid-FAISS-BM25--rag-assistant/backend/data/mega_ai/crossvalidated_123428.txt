If 'observations within' are independent experimental units to which treatment level was randomly assigned, and applied, then use all data. If those observations come from the same experimental unit (e.g. scores from several students in a class with the same teacher, with teacher being the trt, or height of several plants in a pot with the same fertilizer trt) use averages, or model them as subsamples. But you'd still need several observations per treatment combination.
