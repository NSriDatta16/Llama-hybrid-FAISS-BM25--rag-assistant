The reason you are not breaking PCA is because your data is still "simple" and have strong "linear properties". In your first example, the line example, we can summarize data as follows: the regression target will be larger, with respect x and y, i.e., in original feature space, the upper right corner. In your second example, the S shaped example, we can summarize data as: the regression target will be larger, when x is small and y is small, i.e., in original feature space, the lower left corner. The following example will break linear PCA. Because the is no linear relationship/features we can found to classify different classes. (Similar to the pearson correlation coefficient will be close to 0 for such data.)
