Time Series Forecast with Only 2 Observations

I have a number that I need to forecast its distribution over a period of time (5-7 years). There are currently 2 past observations, but I'd need to forecast the distribution of the rest. What options do I have given the limited data points? The distribution of the forecast should have a normal curve. Moreover, I'm looking for insight concerning the programming aspects of this question.
