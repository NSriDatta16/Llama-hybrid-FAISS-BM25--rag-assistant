You modify your form so that it saves some information on the state of the form. Then you add a new case to the beginning of the submit function that returns immediately if you're not done uploading all the files, and it will redraw the form. function modulename_uploader_form(&$form_stuff=null) { //the function that sets your form array $stuff = (isset($form_stuff['values'])) ? $form_stuff['storage']['done_uploading'] : false; //if values isnt set, this is the first visit. $form_stuff['storage']['done_uploading'] = done_uploading(); .... the rest of your form creation function. function modulename_uploader_submit($form, &$form_stuff) { if($form_stuff['storage']['done_uploading']) { return; } ... rest of the function make sure to unset the storage variable when you're done processing the form. You can also google multi page forms in drupal.
