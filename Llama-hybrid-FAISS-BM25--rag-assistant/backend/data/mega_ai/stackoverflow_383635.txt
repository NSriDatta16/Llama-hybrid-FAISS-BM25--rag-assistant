You could load it in flash only, and do with your image whatever you want, then if you need to show it in the page you could encode the image as base64 string of the PNG (you will need AS libraries for PNG and base64 encoding). The next step would be to pass the string to javascript, and in Javascript you could take advantage of the ability to embed base64 images (supported in Firefox, opera, not IE). The syntax is: where "ABCDE..." is the base64 string generated in flash. This way you would only get the image once, but still will be able to show it as a normal html image. I used this technique in a pet project i created ( www.creationempire.com/tstyles ) to generate the images in a online image generator, and got the original idea from http://danielmclaren.net/2008/03/embedding-base64-image-data-into-a-webpage Hugo
