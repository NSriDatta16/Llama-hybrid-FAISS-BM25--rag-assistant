Statistical significance in time series (python)

I have a list of tweets which are ordered by twitting date, the date range spans over a month. The tweets are categorised in two groups, the first group sentiment is 'sad', the second group is 'other'. I created a time series which shows the number of 'sad' and 'other' tweets per hour. Usually, when the number of tweets increases, the portion of 'sad' tweets increases too. However the increase in 'sad' tweets may not be significant, it can be just the result of the increase in total volume. I want to see for each hour if the change in the number of 'sad' tweets is statistically significant compared to the overall 'sad' tweets. I think the null hypothesis will be, for a given hour the number of 'sad' tweets is not significantly different than all 'sad' tweets. I use python (mostly pandas, scipy library) for coding/analysis. I know just very little about statistical significance, so please bear with me if the question is very simple! I will appreciate if you can give me some pointers (if the method exists in a standard python library that would be great).
