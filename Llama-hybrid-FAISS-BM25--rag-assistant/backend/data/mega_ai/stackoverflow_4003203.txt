Bounded, auto-discarding, non-blocking, concurrent collection

I'm looking for a collection that: is a Deque / List - i.e. supports inserting elements at "the top" (newest items go to the top) - deque.addFirst(..) / list.add(0, ..) . It could be a Queue , but the iteration order should be reverse - i.e. the most recently added items should come first. is bounded - i.e. has a limit of 20 items auto-discards the oldest items (those "at the bottom", added first) when the capacity is reached non-blocking - if the deque is empty, retrievals should not block. It should also not block / return false / null / throw exception is the deque is full. concurrent - multiple threads should be able to operate on it I can take LinkedBlockingDeque and wrap it into my custom collection that, on add operations checks the size and discards the last item(s). Is there a better option?
