Aside from not using the raw values for legitimate reasons stated above (non-independence), the fundamental theory here depends on your question of interest: do you want to conclude drug A had superior overall long-term effects (monthly averages, blocked by subject, two-way by type and drug)? more promising trend for 'improvement' (rate of change in daily average repeated-measures analysis, ditto)? For skewed or unbalanced data, it is very likely to make a difference how you test it, thus it is very important to formulate your hypothesis prior to testing. Also, tt seems a waste to not account for maximum variability or CV, for which you could do a separate group testing.
