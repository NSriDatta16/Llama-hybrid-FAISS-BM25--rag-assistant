Something is very messed up here. The usual approach would be to consider the four servers to be four "points". But at data this tiny DBSCAN does not make sense! I'd suggest to use a time series distance function, and hierarchical clustering. It appear that your approach is to treat the data as 2000 data sets, each with 4 points with 1 attribute each. But what magic do you expect DBSCAN to do there? And how did you manage ro end up with a non-integer k? What is the 2.12345 nearest neighbor supposed to be?!?
