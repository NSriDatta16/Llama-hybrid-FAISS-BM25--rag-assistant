Interpretation of R-squared when using FGLS

Context: I am analyzing time series and cross-sectional data using Stata's xtpcse command which corrects for autocorrelation in panel data using a Praisâ€“Winsten transformation (and additionally correcting the standard errors for heteroskedasticity) Question: I need goodness-of-fit measure and the xtpcse command reports R-squared, but I am unsure about the correct interpretation. For example, in Wooldrigde's well-known introductory econometrics textbook it says: Finally, an R-squared is reported for the Prais-Winsten estimation that is well below the R-squared for the OLS estimation in this case. However, these R-squareds should not be compared. For OLS, the R-squared, as usual, is based on the regression with the untransformed dependent and independent variables. For Prais-Winsten, the R-squared comes from the final regression of the transformed dependent variable on the transformed independent variables. It is not clear what this R2 is actually measuring; nevertheless, it is traditionally reported. (Wooldridge, 2012: Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach , p. 426) So what exactly is R-squared "measuring" in this context, after the dependent and independent variable have been transformed, compared to the usual OLS interpretation (% of variation explained by the model)? Is it still a useful measure of goodness-of-fit when comparing different models with different independent variables included? If not what are the alternatives (because of all the transformations AIC, BIC etc., are not available as postestimation commands when using xtpcse )?
