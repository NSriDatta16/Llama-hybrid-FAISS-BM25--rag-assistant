Building a simulation model for IoT device

I have an IoT device that takes inputs in bytes and returns the output in bytes; My goal is to build a software simulator for the IoT device. Some example inputs & outputs: Input: [50, 10, 40, 20, 7, 30, 0] # here 7 is length of packet, 30 is command, 0 is status Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 7, 31, 1] # here 7 is length of packet, 31 is command, 1 is status Input: [50, 10, 40, 20, 8, 35, 0, 5] # 5 register read Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 12, 36, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Input: [50, 10, 40, 20, 8, 35, 0, 2] # 2 register read Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 12, 36, 1, 1, 2] Input: [50, 10, 40, 20, 8, 40, 0] # this is example of streaming sensor data Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 8, 41, 100] Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 8, 41, 101] Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 8, 41, 102] Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 8, 41, 103] Output: [40, 20, 50, 10, 8, 41, 104] Is there any existing solution I can use, or can you point me in the direction of solving such problems or any similar solution (any similar machine learning solution)? I have read about process discovery, but I am not sure if that will be of much help. Thank you.
