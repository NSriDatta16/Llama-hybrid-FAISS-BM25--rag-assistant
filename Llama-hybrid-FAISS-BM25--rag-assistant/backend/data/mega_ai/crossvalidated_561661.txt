Random Forest: OOB error vs test error

I have a dataset composed by 124 observation and 13 variables. I need to predict the output of the response variable. The observations have a time line. I mean that these observations are in order of time and I need to predict the values of the test set which is composed by 27 variables. I'm using random forest but I'm not understanding why the OOB error computed with RMSE is very low (4.15) and the test error computed with RMSE is higher 20.1. Is my model overfitting the data? Because since I'm using a random forest I used all the variables to fit the model. Here I'm providing the graph of my model, on the left of the intercept you can find the train data and on the right the test data. Also here I'm providing the RMSE error for the train set and test set compared with different numbers of tree.
