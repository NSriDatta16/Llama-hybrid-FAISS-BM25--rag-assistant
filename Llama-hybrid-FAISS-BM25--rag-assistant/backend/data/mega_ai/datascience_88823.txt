Transformers understanding

i have i a big trouble. I don't understand transformers. I understand embedding, rnn's, GAN's, even Attention. But i don't understand transformers. Approximately 2 months ago i decided to avoid usage of transformers, because i found them hard. But i can't anymore avoid transformers. Please, help me. I want to use and understand work of transformers. How can i start to work with them?Past the fact that i want to understand their idea in general, i also want to can write/implement them using keras/tensorflow Of course i tied to read some tutorials. But i don't understand them anyway.
