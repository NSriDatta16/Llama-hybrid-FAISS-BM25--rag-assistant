I'd agree with the masses here. Poor UI mean that the product development team dropped the ball.. That said. I consider myself a good coder. Great at math, but dyslexic and attention deficit disorder.. Give me a set of earphones and some code and I'm on my way. Don't however expect me to mock up a great GUI. Line things up.. That I do. Now ADD to that the fact that as the "programmer" even when I see things in the GUI that bug the crap out of me (as a person who uses it), I don't get to fix them.. Hell when I do fix them I get QA asking me for the design document and the approval from on high. After a while I stoped caring about the GUI.. I write solid code, that works. It's fast, clean and small.. it's where I get to have an impact. The GUI is beyond my pay grade. :(
