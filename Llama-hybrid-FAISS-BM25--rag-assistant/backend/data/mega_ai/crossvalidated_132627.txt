Interpreting estimates of cloglog regression

Could someone advise me on how to interpret the estimates from a logistic regression using a cloglog link? I have fitted the following model in lme4 : glm(cbind(dead, live) ~ time + factor(temp) * biomass, data=mussel, family=binomial(link=cloglog)) For example, the estimate of time is 0.015. Is it correct to say the odds of mortality per unit time is multiplied by exp(0.015) = 1.015113 (~1.5% increase per unit time). In other words, are the estimates obtained in a cloglog expressed in log odds as is the case for a logit logistic regression?
