One problem you might run into with a NN (and other classification methods) is that since you've only shown it certain defects, it might not know how to react to completely new / yet unseen defects that might pop up in the future. You want the NN to learn "anything that doesn't look like a non-defective PCB is a defective PCB". But what if it has learned "anything that doesn't look like a defective PCB is a non-defective PCB"? You could try to modify some images of non-defective PCBs by adding a small white spot (or another small perturbation) to them at random locations and have the neural network classify these modified images. It should definitely classify them as defective, right? But it'll probably miss some (or quite many) because it has never seen such defects before. To detect completely new defects, anomaly detection methods / one class classifiers might be more.. trustworty, because they should pick up anything that's never been seen before. As D.W. said, you're just going to have to try both methods and find out which one works better. Just make sure to have a really good test set that also contains completely new defects!
