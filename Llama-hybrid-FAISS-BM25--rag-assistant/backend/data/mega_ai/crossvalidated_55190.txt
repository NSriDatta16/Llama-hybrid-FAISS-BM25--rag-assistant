It looks something like a $\chi^2$ test, though the denominator is slightly different. If you run through the (trivial) algebra, the numerator reduces to ($x_\epsilon - x_o)^2$, which is just like the $\chi^2$ test's numerator of $(N_{\textrm{expected}} - N_{\textrm{observed}})^2$. The denominator for a $\chi^2$ test is normally just the expected value ($x_\epsilon$ in your notation). Here, they appear to be adjusting the expected value for each candidate according to its prevalence in their entire corpus. I can see why you'd want to do this pragmatically, but it does mean that you can no longer treat the result as an actual $\chi^2$ value (e.g., for looking it up on a table). If you didn't want to call it a "distictive number", I suspect you might get away with calling it a "modified $\chi^2$ value" or something like that--I'm not sure it has another name.
