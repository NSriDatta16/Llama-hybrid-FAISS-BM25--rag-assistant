ok, I've found what I was looking for! in this link was the piece of code that I needed the code is this: //inside drag: function(event, ui) var offset = $(this).parent().offset(); var GRID_SPACING = 10; var SELECTION_OFFSET_X = 10; var SELECTION_OFFSET_Y = 3; if (parseInt(event.clientX / GRID_SPACING) % 2 == 0) { var row = Math.floor((event.clientY - offset.top) / GRID_SPACING) + Math.floor(event.clientX / (2 * GRID_SPACING)); var col = -Math.floor((event.clientY - offset.top) / GRID_SPACING) + Math.floor((event.clientX + GRID_SPACING) / (2 * GRID_SPACING)); } else { var row = Math.floor((event.clientY + GRID_SPACING / 2 - offset.top) / GRID_SPACING) + Math.floor(event.clientX / (2 * GRID_SPACING)); var col = -Math.floor((event.clientY + GRID_SPACING / 2 - offset.top) / GRID_SPACING) + Math.floor((event.clientX + GRID_SPACING) / (2 * GRID_SPACING)); } var new_x = row * GRID_SPACING + col * GRID_SPACING - SELECTION_OFFSET_X; var new_y = (row * (GRID_SPACING / 2)) - (col * (GRID_SPACING / 2)); if(event.clientX == new_x + GRID_SPACING * 2) { ui.position.left = new_x; new_x = event.clientX; } if(event.clientY == new_y + GRID_SPACING) { ui.position.top = new_y; new_y = event.clientY; } ui.position.left = new_x; ui.position.top = new_y; I changed some of the constants to adjust to my grid...
