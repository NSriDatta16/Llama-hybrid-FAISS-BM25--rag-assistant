Its not doable in javascript, because javascript is executed after the page is sent, so the damage is already done. Your webserver would have to recognize the google useragent when the page request is made, and serve a different page accordingly. Then you can avoid the whole redirect nonsense entirely. I know you can configure most webservers to do that, however I do not know the required steps, and it depends on what webserver you are using. I'm not going to comment on the merits/demerits of flash based websites.
