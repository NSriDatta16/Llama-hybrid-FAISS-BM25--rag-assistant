How to escape quotes in inline styles?

If I have an inline stylesheet, can and I want - for some strange reason - use the same quotes that u used to encapsulate the attribute value in my html code inside the css. Is one of these correct? I think the first one is correct and the second one is nonsense. Am I right or not, and why? edit: A co worker wrote it the second way, and the problem was that some browsers (included but not necessarily limited to internet explorer 6+7+8) requested the url INCLUDING the " signs which resultet in an 404 request. edit 2: okay now its really getting weird. this is the original code copy and pasted from our file. and this is straight from our error log: 13:09:45 (0.2424) [header] requ_uri /schauspieler/Kelly+Trump/"http:/www.flimmit.com/media/search/filmcovers/105x152/ka/false/kf/false/F6TYO8.jpg" Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0001) [header] server_addr 10.48.195.172 Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0001) [header] http_user_agent Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; GTB6.6; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; eSobiSubscriber 2.0.4.16; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; AskTbFF/5.9.1.14019) Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0001) [error] 404-Seite wurde aufgerufen Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0386) [header] remote_ip 212.95.7.69 - AT Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0001) [header] visitor_id 4095543, - Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0001) [header] requ_url http://www.flimmit.com/schauspieler/Kelly+Trump/"http:/www.flimmit.com/media/search/filmcovers/105x152/ka/false/kf/false/F6TYO8.jpg" Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0001) [header] http_referer http://www.flimmit.com/schauspieler/Kelly+Trump/ Mar 18 13:09:45 (0.0000) [header] finished at 0.2816 this was an IE8 client. on IE6 the request uri even has &quot; instead of " in it. So either we are all wrong or internet explorer is not respecting any standards?
