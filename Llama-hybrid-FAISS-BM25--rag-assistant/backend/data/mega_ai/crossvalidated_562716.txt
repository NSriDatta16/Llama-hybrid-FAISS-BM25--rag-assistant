Multivariate anomaly detection with explainability

I have several time serieses, based on aggregation of measurements of different sensors. Each sensor create boolean measurements every hour, and I aggregate them to corresponding time series. For example: Let's say one sensor measures the existence of three signals in different time points: time A B C 10:00:00 1 0 1 11:00:00 0 1 1 12:00:00 0 1 0 We can now take the measurements of signals from various sensors and aggregate them together to time series, per each measurements: time A B C 10:00:00 50 21 12 11:00:00 56 0 13 12:00:00 47 15 14 My task is to identify an anomaly on all signals together, which led me to different multivariate anomaly detection techniques. I want to identify not only an anomaly at a specific hour, but which sensors led to the anomaly, or in other words, contributed the most to the anomaly. Is there any known approach to add such explainability to the model?
