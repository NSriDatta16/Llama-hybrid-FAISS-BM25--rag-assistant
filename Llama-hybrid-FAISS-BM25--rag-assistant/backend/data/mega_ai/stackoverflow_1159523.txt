minifying has no real impact on performance on the server side. Writing less code will not improve speed, and if you plan to redistribute your code, well it will attract very few attention since the code will not be understandable. Compiling your code will also significantly increase it's speed, but I don't think people will enjoy reading and writing bytecode in binary mode to edit you app! The only way of reducing size and increasing speed while keeping readable code is to use less memory: instead of assigning a value to a variable and then pass it to a function, pass it directly to a function. Also keep in mind that PHP built-in functions are faster than user-defined functions.
