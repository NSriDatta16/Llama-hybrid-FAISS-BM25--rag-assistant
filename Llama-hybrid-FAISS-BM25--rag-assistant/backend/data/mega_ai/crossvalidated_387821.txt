bayesian decision making - comparing expected loss

The problem is like this: Suppose that I am considering which country should I invest on, country A and country B, based on their GDP growth rate $\alpha$ . There are two possible choices for each country: $d_{1A}$ : Invest in country A and $d_{2A}$ : Do not invest in country A; $d_{1B}$ : Invest in country B and $d_{2B}$ : Do not invest in country B. The loss functions for both countries are the same: $$ L(d_1,\alpha)=\left\{\begin{matrix} 0 & \alpha > 0.002\\ 4 & \alpha \leqslant 0.002 \end{matrix}\right. $$ and $$ L(d_2,\alpha)=\left\{\begin{matrix} 1 & \alpha > 0.002\\ 0 & \alpha \leqslant 0.002 \end{matrix}\right. $$ Assume that I can only invest on the country, the one will increase its GDP growth more rapidly. The $\alpha$ of country A is from posterior $\pi_A(\alpha|x)$ ;The $\alpha$ of country B is from posterior $\pi_B(\alpha|x)$ . $\pi_A(\alpha|x)$ and $\pi_B(\alpha|x)$ are known. And I also calculate the values of the four following expected loss: $E\left [L(d_{1A},\alpha) \right ] = \int_{-\infty }^{0.002}{4\cdot \pi_{A}(\alpha|x)}$ and all other $E\left [L(d_{2A},\alpha) \right ]$ , $E\left [L(d_{1B},\alpha) \right ]$ , $E\left [L(d_{2B},\alpha) \right ]$ . The issue is that how could I use these four "loss" to make a decision that which country is worth investing on? Because $\alpha_A$ and $\alpha_B$ come from different posteriors, so I cannot compare their loss directly.
