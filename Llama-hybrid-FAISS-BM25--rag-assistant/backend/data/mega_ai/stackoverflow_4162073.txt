I wouldn't compile it myself. I remember how long that takes (it's one the longest parts of building any Linux system)... So I presume you don't have a fully functional GCC right now? I got this to install from apt-get in Ubuntu 10.10 x64... Okay, so you have broken dependencies, eh? I know this is not elegant, but try downloading the deb files manually ( http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/gcc-4.1 for 10.10 or http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/gcc-4.1 for 10.04 ), save them to a folder, cd into the folder from Terminal, and run this for each package: dpkg -i package.deb There is a more elegant way to do this, but I just don't know it...
