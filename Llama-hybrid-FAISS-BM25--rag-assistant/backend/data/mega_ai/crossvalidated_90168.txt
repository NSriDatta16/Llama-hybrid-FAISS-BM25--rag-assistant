Normally you wouldn't work this way. There's really no additional information from splitting your larger sample up in such a way... so I think an important question is 'what do you think you're getting by doing this?' What information are you trying to get by averaging t-values? There is actually at least one situation where you might summarize information from many p-values, even average them -- and in that case you might also use t-values - whether averaged or in some other way. In general I think you're better to average things like effect sizes ... but if you're going to do any of these things you have to take account of the dependence between samples that's in your scheme ... and if you do that properly, what do you gain over just using all the data to being with?
