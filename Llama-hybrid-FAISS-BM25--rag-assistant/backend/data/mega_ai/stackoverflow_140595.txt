You're not really going to need that powerful of a machine. If you are running tests or other metrics, processing ability is probably your primary concern but really you could run that on an old pentium 1 and it would probably work. Your constraints are going to be your operating environment. If you are running LAMP you want to use a machine that can handle LAMP setup well which is pretty much any *nix machine that is fairly modern. I set up a continuous integration setup for .NET on an old Pentium4 workstation we had laying around and it handled just fine. One thing to keep in mind is storage space if you are archiving your code in the build.
