Supporting multiple content types in a Spring-MVC controller

A Rails controller makes it very easy to support multiple content types. respond_to do |format| format.js { render :json => @obj } format.xml format.html end Beautiful. In one controller action I can easily respond to multiple content types with plenty of flexibility as to what I wish to render, be it a template, a serialized form of my object, etc. Can I do something similar to this in Spring-MVC? What is the standard for supporting multiple content types in Spring? I've seen solutions involving view resolvers, but this looks difficult to manage, especially if I want to support JSON in addition to xhtml and xml. Any suggestions are appreciated, but the simpler and more elegant solutions will be appreciated more ;) EDIT If I'm incorrect in asserting that a view resolver is difficult to manage, please feel free to correct me and provide an example. Preferably one that can return xml, xhtml, and JSON.
