What causes error 4063 - Database ...databasename... has not been opened yet

I have an scheduled agent that is trying to access a database on another server. When it runs I get an error 4063 - Database ...databasename... has not been opened yet. The servers is listed in the ACL as manager. What are some other possible causes for this errors?
