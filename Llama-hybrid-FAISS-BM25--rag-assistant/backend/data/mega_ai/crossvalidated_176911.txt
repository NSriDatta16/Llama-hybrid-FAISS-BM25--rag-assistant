Proof for a marginal distribution

I am reading this paper by Wang and Barber title 'Gaussian Processes for Bayesian Estimation in Ordinary Differential Equations'. Can someone help me with the proof of marginal distribution Kindly refer the paper for joint distribution at: http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/barber14.pdf Any hint would be helpful. Thanks
