Robert, it seems to me that your PI is asking you to do a Pearson's Goodness of Fit test where the parameters are assumed to be known. You assume that each of the groups would have an equal number of expected counts. You then compare this expectation to the observed counts, and calculate a Pearson's d statistic as: where the Xi's are the observed counts and the Yi's are expected counts. The D statistic is approximately chi-square distributed with t-1 degrees of freedom. Calculate the value of the observed statistic and compare it with its critical value, using a significance level and t-1 degrees of freedom, and see if you reject the null hypothesis or not. For the approximation by the chi-square distribution to be good, you'll want to make sure that no group has fewer than 5 counts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test
