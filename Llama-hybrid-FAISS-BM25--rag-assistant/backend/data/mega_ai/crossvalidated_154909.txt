Simulating Data from Multilevel Logistic Regression

I want to simulate data from multilevel logistic regression . I focus on the following multilevel logistic model with one explanatory variable at level 1 (individual level) and one explanatory variable at level 2 (group level) : $$\text{logit}(p_{ij})=\pi_{0j}+\pi_{1j}x_{ij}\ldots (1)$$ $$\pi_{0j}=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01}z_j+u_{0j}\ldots (2)$$ $$\pi_{1j}=\gamma_{10}+\gamma_{11}z_j+u_{1j}\ldots (3)$$ where , $u_{0j}\sim N(0,\sigma_0^2)$ , $u_{1j}\sim N(0,\sigma_1^2)$ , $\text{cov}(u_{0j},u_{1j})=\sigma_{01}$ I prefer R and started to write codes for the simulation as : set.seed(36) x If I have initial value for $\gamma_{00}=-1 , \gamma_{01}=0.3,\gamma_{10}=0.3,\gamma_{11}=0.3$ , how can I generate $\pi_{0j},\pi_{1j}$ since there is $u_{0j},u_{1j}$ in equation (2) and (3) ?
