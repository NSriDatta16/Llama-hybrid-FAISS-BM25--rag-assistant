In my experience, mostly making site scrapers, the network download is always the limiting factor. You can usually shuttle the parsing of the page (or storage for parsing later) to a different thread in less than the time it will take to download the next page. So figure out, on average, how long it takes to download a web page. Multiply that by how many threads you have downloading until it fills your connection's throughput, average out the speed of any given web server and the math is fairly obvious.
