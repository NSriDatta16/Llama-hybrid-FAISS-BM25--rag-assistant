Flex AdvancedDataGrid Tree Custom Drag

I'd like to implement a custom drag on an AdvancedDataGrid tree structure, which only allows the drag on the branches (not leaves). I'm having much difficultly with this, trying to use the MouseDown event, but not having luck! Okay, I think I've got the mousedown able to figure out if the item is a branch of leaf. Any help on how to perform the custom drag with an advanceddatagrid?? var grid : AdvancedDataGrid = AdvancedDataGrid(event.currentTarget); if(grid.selectedItem.hasOwnProperty("categories") && grid.selectedItem.categories!=null) { Alert.show("yes"); } else { Alert.show("no"); }
