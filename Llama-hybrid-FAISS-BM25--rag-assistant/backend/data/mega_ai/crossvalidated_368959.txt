First, when you state: I actually want to analyze correlation between health and income, including different variables such as gender, education etc. you seem a bit confused about correlation. Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It sounds like you want some kind of regression, although it's not clear yet which type. That depends on how your dependent variable (presumably health) is measured. Second, the size of your average household seems remarkably large. Third, to your question: Why not? At least, based on what you've written here, it sounds like the combined data set would be the same as if the people collecting the data had simply done it for more years.
