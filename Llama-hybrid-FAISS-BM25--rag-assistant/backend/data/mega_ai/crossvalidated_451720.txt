Please note that if your response variable is binary, linear regression is NOT appropriate. You need to use logistic regression which is similar to linear regression in many ways. Here I created an example to show why linear regression is not a good option for binary response variable. As you mentioned, we are interested in the probability of getting 1 or 0. #Creat a dataset set.seed(123) df1 Figure 1 You can use lm() function in R to fit linear regression to your data: #Linear regression model model1 So, if you want to predict the probability of x = 16 based on above formula, you get 1.0324 which is greater that 1. In the same way, if you want to predict small values, you would get values smaller than 0 (See figure 2). These predictions are not sensible, since the true probability must fall between 0 and 1. These inconsistencies increase as data become more imbalanced and the number of outliers increase. Now, we apply Generalized Linear Model using glm() function in R on our data: #Logistic regression model model2 In logistic regression, we use the logistic function, which is defined as bellow: and produces the S-shaped curve. p(x) is interpreted as the probability of y = 1 given specific x. In our example, beta0 = -36.119568 and beta1 = 2.730215. Figure 2 shows the results of both linear and logistic regression. #plot results x_fit Figure 2 As you can see, Logistic Regression enables us to model the probability of the response variable using a function that gives outputs between 0 and 1 for all values of x.
