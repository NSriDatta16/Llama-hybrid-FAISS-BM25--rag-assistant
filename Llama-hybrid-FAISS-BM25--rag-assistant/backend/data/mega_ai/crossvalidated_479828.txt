See Uniqueness of the SVM Solution by Burges and Crisp for most of the answers. Regarding "accuracy of the solution" - a couple of notes: in the real world we always find an approximate solution, in other words from a purely numerical stand-point we're always within some $\epsilon$ of the training performance of the optimum. Note that in terms of actual performance (i.e., on test data not training data), stochastic methods tend to generalize better, even though they may not reach as "optimal" a value on the training data. Under the assumption that we're solving convex problems then non-uniqueness may actually be a bit more robust since we are likely to find a solution in the interior of the optimal region - rather than for strictly convex problems (with a unique solution) where by definition we can only be in the vicinity for the training data. I don't have any formal proof of this though.
