How to make a jQuery object undraggable?

I'm trying to modify the jQuery-ui Photo Manager demo so that the images in the Trash are undraggable but I'm unable to do so. I've changed the demo so that the Gallery is no longer droppable, but the items in the Trash still follow my cursor if I mousedown. Of course, they they revert back because they have nowhere to go, but is there a way to make them ignore the mousedown to begin with?
