Neural Networks (NN) model the feature interaction through the non-linear weighting of hidden nodes. Random Forest (RF) are tree-based models. Tree-based learn feature interaction through recursive, conditional splitting. In the example you mention, a tree-based model would learn to split on feature 1 and then split on feature 2.
