I know you mentioned using LotusScript, but if you don't mind writing a small Java agent (in the Notes client), this can be done fairly easily - and there is no need to modify the existing form design. The basic idea is to have your Java code open a particular document through a localhost http request (which is simple in Java) and to have your code capture that html output and save it back to that document. You basically allow the Domino rendering engine to do the heavy lifting. You would want do this: Create a form which contains only the rich-text field you want to convert, and with Content Type of HTML Create a view with a selection formula for all of the documents you want to convert, and with a form formula which computes to the new form Create the Java agent which just walks your view, and for each document gets its docid, opens a URL in the form http://SERVER/your_database_path.nsf/NEW_VIEW/docid?openDocument , grabs the http response and saves it. I put up some sample code in a similar SO post here: How to convert text and rich text fields in a document to html using lotusscript?
