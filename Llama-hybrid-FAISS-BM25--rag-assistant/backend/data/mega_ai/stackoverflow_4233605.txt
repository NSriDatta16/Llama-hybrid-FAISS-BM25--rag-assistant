Elegant way to get the count of months between two dates?

Let's assume I have two dates in variables, like $date1 = "2009-09-01"; $date2 = "2010-05-01"; I need to get the count of months between $date2 and $date1 ( $date2 >= $date1 ). I.e. i need to get 8 . Is there a way to get it by using date function, or I have to explode my strings and do required calculations? Thanks.
