Highly reliable storage for a 'log' / time series

In an application I'm working on, I need a write-behind data log. That is, the application accumulates data in memory, and can hold all the data in memory. It must, however, persist, tolerate reasonable faults, and allow for backup. Obviously, I could write to a SQL database; Derby springs to mind for easy embedding. I'm not tremendously fond of the dealing with a SQL API (JDBC however lipsticked) and I don't need any queries, indices, or other decoration. The records go out, and on restart, I need to read them all back. Are there any other suitable alternatives?
