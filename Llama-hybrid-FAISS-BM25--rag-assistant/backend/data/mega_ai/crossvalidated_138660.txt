By "variability," the authors mean any reasonable measure of the dispersion of CHD conditional on age. Study this by slicing the data into narrow age groups (as shown by different colors in the right hand scatterplot), computing the dispersion of the CHD values within each age group, and plotting those dispersions against age (shown in the left hand dot chart). Because CHD is binary and encoded with zeros and ones, it is a Bernoulli variable. The CHD values within any age group $i$ are completely summarized by their count $n_i$ and the count of (say) the ones, $k_i$, which thereby has a Binomial distribution with (unknown) probability $p_i = \Pr(1)$. Although there are many ways to estimate $p_i$, we needn't be fussy; the proportion $\hat p_i = k_i / n_i$ will do nicely. An appropriate measure of the dispersion of CHD then is the estimated standard deviation $\sqrt{\hat p_i(1-\hat p_i)}$. It can vary from $0$ (when $\hat p_i$ is close to $0$ or $1$) up to $1/2$ (attained when $\hat p_i = 1/2$). The full range of possible standard deviations is shown on the horizontal axis in the left plot. Clearly all of them are in the high (rightmost) range, explaining and justifying the assessment that "the variability at all ages is large." Hosmer and Lemeshow go on to analyze these data into eight age groups rather than the eleven shown here. The conclusion of consistently large variability begins to break down with more age groups: we can see in the right hand plot that all CHD values are constant at the very lowest and very highest ages, exhibiting no variability at all. That is to be expected: when we use many groups, some groups will have few values, resulting in high uncertainty concerning the true dispersion within each group. The authors, by limiting the number of groups, maintain fairly high counts $n_i$ within each group, thereby achieving a robust picture of the dispersion of CHD conditional on age. A more sophisticated, but slightly more opaque, method to estimate the conditional dispersion is to smooth CHD against Age using a local estimator of the mean. This smooth can be converted to an estimator of the dispersion using the same formula as before: I have highlighted (in red and by thickening the line) the "large" standard deviations--that is, those greater than the middle value of $1/4$. These data are available in the file chdage.dat found at ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/logistic/alr.zip . The R code used to create these plots is reproduced below for those who would like to experiment with them. # # Applied Logistic Regression, Table 1.1 # folder 1/4 plot(CHD.smooth$x, CHD.sd, type="l", lwd=2, col="Gray", xlab="Age", ylab="Standard Deviation", main="Smoothed Dispersion of CHD", cex.main=0.75, cex.lab=0.75, cex.axis=0.75) #$ lines(CHD.smooth$x[large], CHD.sd[large], lwd=3, col="Red")
