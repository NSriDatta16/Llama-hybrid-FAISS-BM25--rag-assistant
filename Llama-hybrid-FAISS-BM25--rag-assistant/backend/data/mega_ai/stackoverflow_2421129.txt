No, the representation you see from po is the result of -[ debugDescription] , which by default returns -[ description] , as described in http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2004/tn2124.html . Unless the instance you're dealing with just happens to provide a description which is a serialized form of itself, you're SOL. Most objects don't. The real question, as Dave points out is, what are you trying to do? po only works in the gdb console, so I assume this is a debugging issue. In that case, do you know that the gdb console supports sending messages to instances? So you can do: po [ methodReturningAnOtherObject] or po [ valueForKeyPath:@"some.long.key.path"] to follow the object graph from within the debugger console.
