linear neural networks are an example where you generate polynomials in the coefficients.https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6120. In that paper they explain that though representationally equivalent to a linear regression, the optimisation is non convex and shows some of the same difficulties in optimisation (ie finding a solution) as nonlinear neural networks Note linear neural networks are proposed in the paper as a way of studying the optimisation behaviour of (nonlinear) neural networks; they have the same representation power as linear regression. So to answer your question, you cannot find the solution using standard least squares linear algebra when your coefficients are polynomials. Note that if your coefficient is $\beta_1^2$ then it is forced to be positive, so in your example a solution may not even exist.
