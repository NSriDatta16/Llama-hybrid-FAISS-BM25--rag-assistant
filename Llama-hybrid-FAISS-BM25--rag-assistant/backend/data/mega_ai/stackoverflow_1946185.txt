Can I move window using an object inside that window?

Is it possible in Cocoa to move a window by dragging an object which is inside that window? For example: I have a webview inside a window, big as the window, so setMovableByWindowBackground will obviously not work. Is there a way to click and drag the web view and move the whole window?
