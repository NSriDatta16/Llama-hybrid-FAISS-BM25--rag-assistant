Coding as a categorical or continuous variable?

I have a question/IV in my study which has been answered: 1- No 2- Do not know 3- Sometimes 4- Yes I was advised to remove the answer 2 (all do not know responses) and to regard these as missing data as there is not much value in this response for the question. Thus, I ended up recoding with 1- No 2- Sometimes 3- Yes Would this variable be considered continuous or categorical in a binary logistic regression? Inputting this as it is a continuous factor in a binary logistic regression reveals it is a significant effect: those who scored higher (3) (which would mean yes) were more likely to do the DV behaviour. However, I am very doubtful of the statistical correctness of this. Should this variable be considered categorical in my regression? Should I keep the do not know responses? If so, and if I am regarding it as continuous what order of this response (i.e. from 1 to 4) would be most appropriate?
