As suggested by KenB the ENV['MONGOHQ_URL'] was not setted on my local machine developement environment : lsoave@ubuntu:~/rails/heroku/mp3upload$ rails c Loading development environment (Rails 3.0.5) ruby-1.9.2-p136 :001 > ENV['MONGOHQ_URL'] => nil ruby-1.9.2-p136 :002 > this was a branch without the initializer, so on my local machine I had to skip that. I did it like that: if ENV['MONGOHQ_URL'] CarrierWave.configure do |config| config.storage = :grid_fs uri = URI.parse(ENV['MONGOHQ_URL']) config.grid_fs_database = File.basename(uri.path) config.grid_fs_host = uri.host unless uri.host.blank? config.grid_fs_port = uri.port unless uri.port.blank? config.grid_fs_username = uri.user unless uri.user.blank? config.grid_fs_password = uri.password unless uri.password.blank? config.grid_fs_access_url = '/gridfs' config.cache_dir = "uploads" config.root = Rails.root.join('tmp') end end I think that should be a very better way to skip a Ralis 3.0.5 initializer during the boot process, conditionally to the ENV['MONGOHQ_URL'] parameter value. If you have a better way, could you please share it ? Many thanks :-) luca
