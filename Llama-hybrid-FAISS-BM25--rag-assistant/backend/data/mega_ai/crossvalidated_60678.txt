Is binning data valid prior to Pearson correlation?

Is it acceptable to bin data, calculate the mean of the bins, and then derive the Pearson correlation coefficient on the basis of these means? It seems a somewhat fishy procedure to me in that (if you think of the data as a population sample) the scatter of these means will be the standard error of the mean and hence very tight if $n$ is large. So you will probably get a much better correlation coefficient than from the primary data, and that seems wrong. On the other hand, people often average replicate measurements before a correlation calculation which isn't very different.
