I would not use the QDockWindow since it seems you will not use the client area. In addition, you don't want docking to the MainWindow borders but just added the widget to the MainWindow. I think you can try to use multiple QWidget with a QGridLayout. When dragging QWidget outside of the MainWindow, just remove QWidget from the layout. When dragging inside the MainWindow add the QWidget to the right place in the QGridLayout. With this method you can too switch widget's places into the Main Window. I don't know if it is clear enough but I'm thinking to the same way it is done in QtDesigner when dragging new elements into a layout. When dragging widgets you can see the place where it will be added when releasing the mouse button. In my mind this method can be the one you are searching for. Hope that helps
