An unsupervised approach to classification that does not overfit is described in: Cheeseman, Peter, et al. "Autoclass: A Bayesian classification system." Readings in knowledge acquisition and learning. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., 1993. You will find several similarly titled related reports and articles. Scan several of these as the technical depth varies. Your desired model, a Gaussian mixture model , is a subset of the problem domain AutoClass addresses. Cheesman et. al. provide a very thorough theoretical framework for their solution. The AutoClass software is available for downloading .
