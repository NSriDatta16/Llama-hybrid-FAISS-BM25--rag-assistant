This serves as a reply to @cbeleites's post Thank you for your answer. I've chosen to write another response because my comments for your answer is rather lengthy and it's just easier to write it here. First I would like to clear up some misinformation in my question above: The graph above is actually the signal from SERS enhancement. The SERS signal are the peaks that you can see under the 500 range. In the multiple Raman scans that I've collected, my SERS peaks fluctuates significantly across multiple readings. I am fully aware that SERS is a highly localized phenomena, so it is very difficult to achieve uniformity across different readings ( aka the SERS uncertainty principle ). Hence, I want to be able to tell PLS to pay less attention to those regions. You solution of "down-weighting" the signal actually makes a lot of sense in this case. Second of all, I am interested to identify only peaks ("bands" in your vocabulary) because I am trying to build a database of spectra of known chemicals for a research project. My goal is to do the following: given a sample of mixed chemical, will I be able to tell what is present based on the database of spectra from different chemicals I've collected? I agree with your example that the absence of certain signal is an important part of identifying a chemical. However, consider this scenario: Chemical A has peaks at 300 and 500 and Chemical B has peaks at 400. If I have a mixture of containing A and B, I should only be checking the presence of peaks 300 and 500 for A and 400 for B against the signal of my sample. The absence of 400 in A's signal does not serve a purpose here because the presence of signal at 400 does not imply the lack of A in the mixture. Regarding your comments on data scaling, I did not realize this behavior of PLS. If variance scaling my data is not recommended, what about scaling each wavenumber independently? The result of this operation will allow PLS to properly treat each wavenumber's difference across rows without being interfered by other wavenumbers with higher intensities. What will be the best chemometric models for my pursuit?
