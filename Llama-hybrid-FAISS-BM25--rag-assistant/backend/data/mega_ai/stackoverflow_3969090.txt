C# - List of Multiple progress bars. What components to use?

I have an app that requires multiple progress bars to be added dynamically to a form (whenever a new upload is added and started). I've been Googling and the results suggested embedding progress bars in a ListView or a DataGridView. Can anyone suggest any other techniques, as neither ListView or DataGridView hacks I've seen so far seem appealing?
