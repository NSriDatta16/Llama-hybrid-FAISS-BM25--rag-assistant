here may also be legal guidelines in place that will guide the decision process for a particular collection. Ingest: Send digital material to the predetermined storage solution. This may be an archive, repository or other facility. Preservation action: Employ measures to maintain the integrity of the digital material. Store: Secure data within the predetermined storage facility. Access, use, and reuse: Determine the level of accessibility for the range of digital material created. Some material may be accessible only by password and other material may be freely accessible to the public. Routinely check that material is still accessible for the intended audience and that the material has not been compromised through multiple uses. Transform: If desirable or necessary the material may be transferred into a different digital format. Occasional Actions: Dispose: Discard any digital material that is not deemed necessary to the institution. Reappraise: Reevaluate material to ensure that is it still relevant and is true to its original form. Migrate: Migrate data to another format in order to protect data for using better in the future. Related terms The term "digital curation" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms such as "digital preservation" and "digital archiving." While digital preservation does focus a significant degree of energy on optimizing reusability, preservation remains a subtask to the concept of digital archiving, which is in turn a subtask of digital curation. For example, archiving is a part of curation, but so are subsequent tasks such as themed collection-building, which is not considered an archival task. Similarly, preservation is a part of archiving, as are the tasks of selection and appraisal that are not necessarily part of preservation. Data curation is another term that is often used interchangeably with digital curation, however common usage of the two terms differs. While "data" is a more all-encompassing term that can be used generally to indicate anything recorded in binary form, the term "data curation" is most common in scientific parlance and usually refers to accumulating and managing information relative to the process of research. Data-driven research of education request the role of information professional gradually develop tradition of digital service to data curation particularly at the management of digital research data. So, while documents and other discrete digital assets are technically a subset of the broader concept of data, in the context of scientific vernacular digital curation represents a broader purview of responsibilities than data curation due to its interest in preserving and adding value to digital assets of any kind. Challenges Rate of creation of new data and data sets The ever lowering cost and increasing prevalence of entirely new categories of technology has led to a quickly growing flow of new data sets. These come from well established sources such as business and government, but the trend is also driven by new styles of sensors becoming embedded in more areas of modern life. This is particularly true of consumers, whose production of digital assets is no longer relegated strictly to work. Consumers now create wider ranges of digital assets, including videos, photos, location data, purchases, and fitness tracking data, just to name a few, and share them in wider ranges of social platforms. Additionally, the advance of technology has introduced new ways of working with data. Some examples of this are international partnerships that leverage astronomical data to create "virtual observatories," and similar partnerships have also leveraged data resulting from research at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and the database of protein structures at the Protein Data Bank. Storage format evolution and obsolescence By comparison, archiving of analog assets is notably passive in nature, often limited to simply ensuring a suitable storage environment.
