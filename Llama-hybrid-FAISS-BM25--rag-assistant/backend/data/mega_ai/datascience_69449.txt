The ROC curve requires probability estimates (or at least a realistic rank-ordering), which one-class SVM doesn't really try to produce. https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/99179/232706 https://stackoverflow.com/q/41266389/10495893 https://stackoverflow.com/a/14685318/10495893 https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/993 When you call roc_auc_score on the results of predict , you're generating an ROC curve with only three points: the lower-left, the upper-right, and a single point representing the model's decision function. This may be useful, but it isn't a traditional auROC. Finally, note the end of https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html#overview-of-outlier-detection-methods : The svm.OneClassSVM is known to be sensitive to outliers and thus does not perform very well for outlier detection. This method is better suited to novelty detection than outlier detection. By training on some of the outliers, you've told the model that those are "normal" points.
