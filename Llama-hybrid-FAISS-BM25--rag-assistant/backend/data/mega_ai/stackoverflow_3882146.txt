Where did I go wrong in my regex lookaround?

I'm trying to pull the first paragraph out of Markdown formatted documents: This is the first paragraph. This is the second paragraph. The answer here gives me a solution that matches the first string ending in a double line break. Perfect, except some of the texts begin with Markdown-style headers: ### This is an h3 header. This is the first paragraph. So I need to: Skip any line that begins with one or more # symbols. Match the first string ending in a double line break. In other words, return 'This is the first paragraph' in both of the examples above. So far, I've tried many variations on: "/(?s)(?:(?!\#))((?!(\r?\n){2}).)*+/ But I can't get it to return the proper match. Where did I go wrong in my lookaround? I'm doing this in PHP (preg_match()), if that makes a difference. Thanks!
