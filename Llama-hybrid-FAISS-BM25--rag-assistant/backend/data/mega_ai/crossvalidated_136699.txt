Correct term for negative difference between two values

A very newbie question! If the absolute difference between two values is the distance between them (and therefore always positive), what is the correct term for the distance between two values that does consider direction? For example, if the average score in a test was 50 and my score was 45 the absolute difference would be 5, but this does not quantify my lack of intelligence!
