For merging all of your JavaScript into one file you can use something like YUI Compressor . You need to be looking for a minimizer first, compression second. A minimizer just takes the files and merges them together and gets rid of whitespace. A compressor will actually try to optimize the js for you by changing variable names and removing unnecessary code. As for unit testing I am unsure of how you will want to do that. There are a few unit test libraries out there. A popular tool for testing is Selenium. I don't currently do unit testing so I am out of my element there.. For setting up your code you could always look at using a JavaScript framework like ExtJS or JavaScriptMVC. Those help you with setting up your code in the proper way and also helps focus your team on the proper standards and coding structure while also writing a lot of the code for you so you don't have to re-invent the wheel. EDIT: Just a quick after thought. Even if you don't want to use a JavaScript framework, I would suggest checking them out, especially ExtJS, just to see how they organize their code and some of the tricks they do to keep it clean.
