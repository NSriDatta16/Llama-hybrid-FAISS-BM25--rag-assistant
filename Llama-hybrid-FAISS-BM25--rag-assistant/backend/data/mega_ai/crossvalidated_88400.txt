Why are fitted values different from one-step ahead forecasts?

Let's say I fit an ARIMA model on a time series up to date t. I want to forecast the 10 next values without refitting the model but also using the latest data available for each date. So forecast for (t+1) uses the model fitted from 1 to t and the time serie from 1 to t forecast for (t+2) uses the model fitted from 1 to t and the time serie from 1 to t+1 forecast for (t+3) uses the model fitted from 1 to t and the time serie from 1 to t+2 ... This is not the same as simply using "forecast" with an horizon of 5, as I want to take into account all data points prior to the forecasted point. (e.g. a shock on t+2 woudl have an effect on the forecast for t+3, even though we do not refit the entire model) One way would be to fit the model using data from 1 to t, and then apply this model to all the data and take the fitted values as forecasts. However this does not work. Even for an horizon of 1, the two methods produces different results. library(forecast) data
