Without seeing all your code / diving in too deeply, I'm not sure what the cause of this problem is. Do you have some special stuff going on in the routes.php file? If you have a specific route defined for users, that could be it. However, you could make a quick fix -- in UsersController (or AppController if you want to ensure this behavior doesn't pop up elsewhere) just add a line to the beforeFilter() method to capitalize / decapitalize (whichever is more appropriate) the controller parameter. [edit] - sorry, didn't finish that first paragraph. It still could be the routes file, even though it works on one server and not the other, because it's possible that the working server uses a case-insensitive apache module that normalizes all urls. This is why it's so nice to have your staging and dev setups being EXACTLY the same as production.
