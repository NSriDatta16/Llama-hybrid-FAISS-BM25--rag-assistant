How is VIF calculated for dummy variables?

I have a logistic regression model with 11 explanatory variables, 5 of which are dummy variables, when I use vif() function from library car in R, it gives me a VIF value for each of them. As far as I understand the vif of a variable is 1/(1-R^2), where R^2 is obtained from the regression on that explanatory variable as response. But when this variable is dichotomic, itÂ´d be running a logistic regression, so R^2 is no use. Any ideas on how is the VIF calculated then? or is it not valid?
