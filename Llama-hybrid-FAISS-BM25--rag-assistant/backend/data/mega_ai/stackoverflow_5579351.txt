CSS z-index mystery

I have some problems with CSS and z-index. Let me show you an example Suppose that on a first moment it only appears the tag pointers. Then, when I click one of this pointers appears a tag globe. I want that the tag pointers appears always under the tag globes, and I want too that every time I open a tag globe it appears over all other tag globes opened. My div structure is: And the related CSS code is this: .tag { z-index: 3; position: absolute; left: 0; /*JavaScript modified*/ top: 0; /*JavaScript modified*/ width: 19px; height: 26px; padding: 0 11px 10px 15px; background: url('../../images/zoom/tag.png') no-repeat center; } .small { cursor: pointer; width: 19px; height: 26px; } .globe-arrow { position: absolute; left: 23px; bottom: 30px; width: 8px; height: 6px; background: url(../../images/zoom/tag_arrow_UR.gif) no-repeat; z-index: 5; } .globe { position: absolute; left: 23px; bottom: 30px; z-index: 4; } .in-globe { font-size: 11px; margin: 0 0 3px 3px; padding: 3px; background: #FFF; border: 1px solid #000; } The 'tag' is all the conglomerate, and its background is the tag pointer image. However, this image has some shadows and I only want that a certain zone can be clicked. Then, the 'small' div has this function. The 'globe' and 'in-globe' divs are where the content of the globe is written (it could be an only div, there are two for historical reasons), and the 'globe-arrow' div is basically a little image to show this small arrow over the globe. With this structure it doesn't work. In a same conglomerate, a globe is always over a tag, but an entire conglomerate defined before in the html code appears entirely under a newer one. In the same way, although a globe is inserted by JavaScript always after an older one (logically) the tag conglomerate is inserted when the page is loaded and then the overlapping works like I said. Can you propose an smart way to reach my objective? Think that I'm interested on positioning the globe respective to the tag, because when I drag a pointer with a globe opened I want that the globe moves with it by CSS, not by JavaScript.
