If you haven't done so already, have a look at the time series view on CRAN , especially the section on multivariate time series. In finance, one traditional way of doing this is with a factor model, frequently with either a BARRA or Fama-French type model. Eric Zivot's "Modeling financial time series with S-PLUS" gives a good overview of these topics, but it isn't immediately transferable into R. Ruey Tsay's " Analysis of Financial Time Series " (available in the TSA package on CRAN) also has a nice discussion of factor models and principal component analysis in chapter 9. R also has a number of packages that cover vector autoregression (VAR) models. In particular, I would recommend looking at Bernhard Pfaff's VAR Modelling (vars) package and the related vignette . I strongly recommend looking at Ruey Tsay's homepage because it covers all these topics, and provides the necessary R code. In particular, look at the "Applied Multivariate Analysis" , "Analysis of Financial Time Series" , and "Multivariate Time Series Analysis" courses. This is a very large subject and there are many good books that cover it, including both multivariate time series forcasting and seasonality. Here are a few more: Kleiber and Zeileis. " Applied Econometrics with R " doesn't address this specifically, but it covers the overall subject very well (see also the AER package on CRAN). Shumway and Stoffer. " Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples " has examples of multivariate ARIMA models. Cryer. " Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R " is a classic on the subject, updated to include R code.
