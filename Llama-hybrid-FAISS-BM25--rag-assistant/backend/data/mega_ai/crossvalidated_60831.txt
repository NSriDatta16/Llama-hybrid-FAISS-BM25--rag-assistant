I think you would be better off using linear regression, which is essentially the same as an AN(C)OVA, but slightly more general. Using a linear regression allows you to control for the influence of group membership and intellect separately, as well as by interaction. I would not recommend throwing away data. Selecting data post hoc introduces sampling bias so that you can no longer safely assume a random sample. This essentially means that your results are less valid and less generalizable. You should organize your data in a different way. In SPSS the rows contain cases, and the columns contain variables. The best way to organize your data would be to include all 51 cases over 51 rows. Instead of having every measure three times for every group, you will have one variable for every measure plus two dummies to indicate group membership. You need two group dummies because you always need k-1 amount of dummies to discern between k number of groups. How to code dummy variables is explained here .
