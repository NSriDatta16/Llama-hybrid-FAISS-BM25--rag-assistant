Is it possible to predict on new data using PLS SEM?

Using the seminr package in R, I have fitted a model based on PLS SEM with several exogenous (latent) variables and one endogenous latent variable (ELV) measured by three indicators. Beyond the usual out-of-sample evaluation commonly done in the PLS SEM framework, I would like to use the model to predict the construct score for the ELV (or the values of its indicators, alternatively) for new samples where the new samples do not contain data on the ELV and/or its indicators (similar to a common machine learning model). Is this possible or not? I have assumed that this should be possible as PLS SEM's "predictive capabilities" are highlighted in relevant literature (and because of the fact that out-of-sample evaluation is a common prodecure in PLS SEM). I took a look at the seminr source code (in particular, the pls_predict and related functions) but maybe I am moving into a dead end here.
