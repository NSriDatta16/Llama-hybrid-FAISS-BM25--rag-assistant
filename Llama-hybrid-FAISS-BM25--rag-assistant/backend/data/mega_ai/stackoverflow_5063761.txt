Well I fixed the laggy issue with dragging the image: After animating opacity to 100%, the alpha filter remains there even after the animation has finished, even though the filter does absolutely nothing it still has to process which was what was causing the huge lag. Solution to drag lag: - After animation unset css opacity: $(this).css('opacity', '') As for the jpeg being interpretted as bmp, I guess it wasn't the cause of the drag lag, and at the end of the day it doesn't matter
