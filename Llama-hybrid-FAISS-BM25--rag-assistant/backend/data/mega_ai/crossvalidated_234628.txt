Asymptotic distribution of average of non-identically distributed variables

I have data from a random variable $X$: $$\{x_{1},\dots,x_{N}\}$$ I am interested in the asymptotic distribution of the sample average $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i}}{N}$. These draws are independent but not identically distributed. They have mean $\mu_{i}$ and variance $\sigma^2_{i} I know the Lindeberg–Lévy Central Limit Theorem does not hold because moments are not identical. But assume the Lyapunov’s condition holds. Then, $$ \frac{1}{s_{n}}\sum_{i=1}^N(x_{i}-\mu_{i}) \xrightarrow{d} N(0,1) $$ where $s_{n}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_{i}^2 $. Is there anything I can be certain about the sample average? Some sufficient condition? Can I not infer some degree of asymptotic normality? My data support normality of the average. I wonder if there is some theoretical basis behind that, or just mere coincidence.
