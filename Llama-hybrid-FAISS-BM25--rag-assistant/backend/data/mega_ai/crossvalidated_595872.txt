We would use the geometric mean if it was the same good declining by different prices throughout time (which would be appropriate for averaging growth/decline rates for the same thing), but you have different goods. I think you want to know how a basket of goods has declined in price as a wholeâ€”so for that, I would actually just sum the previous week prices across all goods, and sum the current week prices across all goods, and calculate the percent change of that. So it would be $(15-5)/15=.67$ decline. Does that make sense?
