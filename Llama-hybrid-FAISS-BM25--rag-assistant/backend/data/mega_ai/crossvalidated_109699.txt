I don't think it works well in general to assume the null hypothesis when forming an estimator other than occasionally an estimate of a variance. More likely to work is the bootstrap bias estimator akin to the Efron-Gong optimism estimator. Here's an example. Suppose you are interested in more unbiasedly estimating the true odds ratio for the largest or most significant odds ratio from among the 1000. For B repeats (B may be typically 400 to 2000) find the largest or most significant odds ratio from among the 1000 in a bootstrap sample (sample with replacement). Then estimate the same odds ratio for the same feature in the original sample. Record the drop in log odds ratio. Average this over the B simulations to estimate the average optimism (bias) in log-odds ratio. Subtract this from the original most impressive log odds ratio and anti-log.
