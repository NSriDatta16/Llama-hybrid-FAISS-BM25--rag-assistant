This may be not a leak, but just the runtime heap not releasing memory to the operating system. This can also be fragmentation. Possible ways to overcome this: Split into two applications. The master application will have the simple logic with little or no dynamic memory usage. It will start the worker application to actually do work in such chunks that the worker application will not run out of memory and will restart that application periodically. This way memory is periodically returned to the operating system. Write your own memory allocator. For example you can allocate a dedicated heap and only allocate memory from there, then free the dedicated heap entirely. This requires the operating system to support multiple heaps. Also note that it's possible that your program runs differently on Ubuntu and on the target system and therefore different execution paths are taken and the code resulting in memory leaks is executed on the target system, but not on Ubuntu.
