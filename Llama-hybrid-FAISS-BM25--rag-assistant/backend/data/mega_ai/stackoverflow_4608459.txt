I believe the correct solution to this is tagging. I don't believe it's a good idea to separate your solution across different repositories. It's advisable to keep all projects that are even slightly related in the same repository, and use a standard repository layout, i.e.: /branches /tags /trunk With all your working solution folders described above in /trunk. Trunk can contain as many projects/solutions as you feel is manageable, and could even be further organized by project type. One of my trunk folders is /trunk/websites and I keep all my website solutions in there. When you are ready for a release version, you can "tag" your trunk, or part of your trunk, with that release or build version, using "Branch/Tag" over to /tags/ This affords you an opportunity to also record your release notes in the tagged copy. For more information on branching and tagging in SVN (assuming Tortoise) see Branching / Tagging in the TortiseSVN docs. For more info on these terms, see this question in StackOverflow. I hope this is helpful. I do not know what limitations, you may be faced with from your SVN host. These suggestions are based on my experiance in hosting my own VisualSVN Server repository. I came to SVN from SourceSafe, and it took me some time to see the value in this standard, and to begin using these practices. They are invaluable to me now.
