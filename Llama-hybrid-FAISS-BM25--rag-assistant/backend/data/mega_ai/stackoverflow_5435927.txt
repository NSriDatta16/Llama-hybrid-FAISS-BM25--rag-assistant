How to do a Rails webapp for writing an ebook collaboratively?

I want to write an ebook and I would like to create (if there's none already) a Web Application that could meet most (if not all) of my requirements: An online web application in Rails (because it is what I know) Editing in a wiki style syntax Registred users can leave comments on each paragraph of the book but can't change the content Registred users are notified when a new chapter is available online Content can be used to generate a book (or an intermediate format like DocBook) I wish to publish my book on paper once it is written (using Lulu.com and the like). So, the application should be able to output the content of the website in PDF ordered like a real book (title page, TOC, Introduction, etc.) Also, I want to be able to record the comments from the (beta) readers while I'm writing it (like PragProg does ). Do you know if there is some existing plugins that could give me a head start or an existing Rails application that I could customize to meet my needs?
