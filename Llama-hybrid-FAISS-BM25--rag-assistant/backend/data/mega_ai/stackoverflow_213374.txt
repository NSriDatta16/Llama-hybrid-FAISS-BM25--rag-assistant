How do I debug Resharper 4.0 add-ins?

Ok, I love Resharper and its addins, but even the best of fanbois have to admit that its API documentation is suboptimal. I'd like to build an addin myself (based on the Agent Johnson plugin). Thankfully that plugin works in 4.0, so I can use it as a starting point for my own work. My question: how do I run and debug the app? The resharper plugins are in the \v4.1\Bin\Plugins\ directory -- do I set my output directory to that folder, run it, then start another instance of Visual Studio? Or is there some other hack/workaround I should try?
