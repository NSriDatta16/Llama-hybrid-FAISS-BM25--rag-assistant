It really depends on your user base. You can use all of the structure elements by calling them to display as block. header, section, footer,aside,article,nav ...{display:block;} Get's tricky with IE because it doesn't allow you to use the elements unless they are in the DOM. So to get the website to even show up you have to inject the elements into the DOM. You are relying on javascript for the page to load so you thats why I said it depends on your user base. document.createElement("header"); document.createElement("footer"); document.createElement("nav"); document.createElement("article"); document.createElement("section"); document.createElement("aside"); You can also do some user agent detection to see if someone is using IE and prompt them to download Google Chrome Frame http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/
