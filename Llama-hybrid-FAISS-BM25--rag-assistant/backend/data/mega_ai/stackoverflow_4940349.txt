How to get the value of a Maybe in Haskell

I'm relatively new to Haskell and began to read "Real World Haskell". I Just stumbled over the type Maybe and have a question about how to receive the actual value from a Just 1 for example. I have written the following code: combine a b c = (eliminate a, eliminate b, eliminate c) where eliminate (Just a) = a eliminate Nothing = 0 This works fine if I use: combine (Just 1) Nothing (Just 2) But if I change, for example, 1 to a String it doesn't work. I think I know why: because eliminate has to give back one type, which is, in this case, an Int . But how can I change eliminate to deal at least with Strings (or maybe with all kind of types)?
