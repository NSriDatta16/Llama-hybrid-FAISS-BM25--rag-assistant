As others already wrote, %ProgramFiles% is not the right place to store user data. The correct solution obviously is to redesign the application so that it uses a different storage location. As an alternative there exists a quick and dirty (!) fix: If the application does not have a manifest, User Account Control Data Redirection kicks in, transparently redirecting write requests to system areas to a safe place in the user profile. The redirection target is %LocalAppData%\VirtualStore\Program Files. Details about this kind of built-in virtualization can be found here . So you could be done by simply removing the manifest from your application.
