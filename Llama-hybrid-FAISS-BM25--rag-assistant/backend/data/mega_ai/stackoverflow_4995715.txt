Scraped from Quora The majority of sound on the web is done through Flash. Flash doesn't inform the browser when it is making sound. That is to say, if two different tabs are running Flash, the browser can't know which is the one making sound. The introduction of the HTML5 media tags could help in this area, but I suspect an audio indicator that only worked some of the time (for non-Flash pages) would be more frustrating than no audio indicator. (Pay no attention to the comment below (in the linked Quora question) saying Chrome displays a 'play' icon when sound is played. That's Soundcloud changing the title of its own page, not Google Chrome)
