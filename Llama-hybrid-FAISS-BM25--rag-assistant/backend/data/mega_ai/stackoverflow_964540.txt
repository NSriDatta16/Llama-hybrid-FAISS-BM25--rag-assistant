Creating a shared HSQLDB database

In-process HSQLDB database are not expected to be opened by others, even for file-based storage. The documentation hints that this is possible: Server Modes , Advanced Topics , but I've not yet found a URL for how to activate this behaviour. Did anyone do this so they can share how to?
