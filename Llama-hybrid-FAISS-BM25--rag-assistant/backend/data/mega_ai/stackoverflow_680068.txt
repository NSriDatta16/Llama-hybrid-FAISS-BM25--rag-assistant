Generally I will create a seperate project called 'LookAndFeel'. This class contains the App.xaml that defines sall of the style that you want your application to use. If you are doing any kind of module based design it is helpful to have this in a seperate project so you can manage the 'look and feel' in one place. In order to leverage this project you will of course need to create a reference to it.
