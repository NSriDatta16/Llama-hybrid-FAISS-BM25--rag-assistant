The original paper states: The first layer of the GAN, which takes a uniform noise distribution Z as input, could be called fully connected as it is just a matrix multiplication, but the result is reshaped into a 4-dimensional tensor and used as the start of the convolution stack This matches with their implementation , where they apply a dot product of the input with some weights, before normalization, activation and reshaping to an image tensor. So the first layer seems to be a dense layer.
