Are flat file databases any good?

Informed options needed about the merits of flat file database. I'm considering using a flat file database scheme to manage data for a custom blog. It would be deployed on Linux OS variant and written in Java. What are the possible negatives or positives regarding performance for reading and writing of both articles and comments? Would article retrieval crap out because of it being a flat file rather than a RDBMS if it were to get slash-doted? (Wishful thinking) I'm not against using a RDBMS, just asking the community their opinion on the viability of such a software architecture scheme. Follow Up: In the case of this question I would see “Flat file == file system–based” For example each blog entry and its accompanying metadata would be in a single file. Making for many files organized by date structure of the file folders (blogs\testblog2\2008\12\01) == 12/01/2008
