Parse String to Organize By Row with PHP

This is probably something easy to accomplish. I have some dates in my MySQL database, (and I am using PHP). Some are stored as such 2010-08-25 11:00:00 , while others are stored as 2010-08-25T08:00:00 My question is: I am selecting the dates from the database, and then using ORDER BY start_date However, I have noticed that when the date string includes a "T", it is pushing it down in the order. For example, my dates being returned are: 2010-08-25 11:00:00 2010-08-25 14:15:00 2010-08-25T08:00:00 2010-08-25T14:30:00 2010-08-25T15:00:00 As you can see, events at 8am are showing up after events at 2:15pm. Any ideas on how I can re-arrange it so that the 8am events are moved toward the top? Thanks.
