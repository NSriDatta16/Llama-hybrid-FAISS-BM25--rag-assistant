Though effective answers are given and in much detail, I wish to add that "Greatest risk comes from within" is a canonical paradigm in the work. For one thing, study crypto to start - there is a great deal of prior work documented in the Java source code. My thoughts on the matter at the moment is wishing anyone who would do the work ( infosec ) study accounting controls in parallel with known crypto - all the study you can do revolves around access control and trace records ... if Greatest risk comes from within then how do you defend against that when most web traffic consists of games and, uh, difficulty deriving from operations arena where most users don't want to know how the machine works. You have to realize that browsers expose consumer grade operating systems to traffic. Consider what traffic that actually is. One example is just in the last few years ( an authority ) ( who is supposed to know better ) ( having legal authority ) instructed our shop to forward all names for authentication on one piece of paper with related information on that paper. The controller for the shop declined without any crypto training even remotely. The remarks of Wyatt Barnett though attracting attention from unwanted observers holds key fields up for view, and the ipv4 nonsense shows the worth and value of Wyatt's snarkle. There are way too damn many User Izatwits at the keyboard exposed to folks who watch "Criminal Minds" every night on TV. In that context, the Security Theater becomes a Threat Theater more befitting a Troma flick than correctly constructed for the accounting controls that are appropriate for an area where someone can tack %20 on the end of a url - most users cannot grasp that issue, let alone something like a salt or IV vector. It's too easy to become someones pawn, that is a known and expected area of expertise for anyone who would do the work. It is a given that you are there to defend your employer's valuable property. In doing that you will be frustrated by the authority for the machine you are to defend not knowing many basic precepts and practices. That is difficult when most security ( infosec ) cases that make it to contested review center on statements made by persons with virtually no training in the matter or ( more likely ) using software that they could not write themselves. For wireless, I would study the engineering already established therein. I looked at it for a router I bought - it is totally sufficient if correctly installed and maintained. To understand how it works, it's just about totally a straightforward study of crypto and basic networking. There will be a wealth of study material on that.
