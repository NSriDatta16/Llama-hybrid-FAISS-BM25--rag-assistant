If you're so inclined you can give our EasyPDF SDK tool a try (disclaimer: I am on the engineering team that creates it). There's an evaluation copy available from pdfonline.com. It doesn't convert SWF files to PDF but it can capture Flash images that are embedded in Web pages. Some Flash images take longer to load than the rest of the webpage, so if you decide to try it, pay particular attention to a property called WaitTimeAfterPageIsLoaded which determines how long to wait for the page to load before beginning the conversion. The WaitTimeAfterPageIsLoaded property exists on both of the HTML conversions classes, IEPrintJob and IEExtendedPrintJob. As you can see we're fans of long descriptive class names :) Anyhow I can't tell you with 100% certainty that it'll work without knowing more about your webpages, but it's worth a look if you're still looking for something. Cheers
