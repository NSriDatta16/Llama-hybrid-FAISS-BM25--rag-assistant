xgboost with Skewed data

I am attempting to run xgboost on response data ( Whether a product is sold or not).However, I have a feature 'number of employees' which is highly skewed. I'm thinking of convert this continuous into categorical by binning. But I'm not sure about this step. My question is what is the best approach when dealing with such situation (Skewed data,xgboost) Thanks in advance !
