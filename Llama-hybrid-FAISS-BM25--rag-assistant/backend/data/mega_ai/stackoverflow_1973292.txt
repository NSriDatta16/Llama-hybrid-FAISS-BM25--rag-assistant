You can make an additional call to the database in the afterOpen method of the Data Source using Java. You can use JavaScript or a Java Event Handler to execute the SET ROLE statement, or to call a stored procedure that will execute it for you. This happens after the initial db connection is made, but before the Data Set query runs. It will be a little tricky to use the data source connection to make that call however, and I don't have the code right now to provide as an example. Another way is to create a stored proc Data Set that will execute the desired command, and have that execute first. Drag and drop the Data Set into the report design, and make it invisible. It will run first before any other queries. Not the cleanest solution, but easy to do Hope that helps Le Birt Expert
