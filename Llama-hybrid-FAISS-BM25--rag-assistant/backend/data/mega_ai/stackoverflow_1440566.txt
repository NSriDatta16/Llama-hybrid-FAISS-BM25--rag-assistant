Flash ComboBox stops playback of stream AS3

Ok, this one is driving me batty. I've made a custom video player in CS4. Basically, I just used The Gimp to draw a video player and saved it as a PNG, which I dragged to the stage. I didn't want to use FLVPlayback, so I used Actionscript to add a Video to the stage. var video:Video = new Video(480,360); addChild(video); I'll spare you the details of how I hooked it up, but it works perfectly. The problem starts when I try to drag a ComboBox to the stage. Before I add any handlers or anything, if I select an item from the ComboBox, it terminates playback on my Video (and NetStream). Wierd! Why? And how do I keep it from doing so?
