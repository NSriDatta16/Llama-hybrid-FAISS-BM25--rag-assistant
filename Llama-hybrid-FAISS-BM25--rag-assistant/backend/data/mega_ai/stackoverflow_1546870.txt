select deck.name, coalesce(x.ave,0) as ave, count(card.*) as count -- card.* makes the intent more clear, i.e. to counting card itself, not the field. but do not do count(*), will make the result wrong from deck left join -- flatten the average result rows first ( select deckId,sum(value)/count(*) as ave -- count the number of rows, not count the column name value. intent is more clear from score group by deckId ) as x on x.deckId = deck.id left outer join card on card.deckId = deck.id -- then join the flattened results to cards group by deck.id, x.ave, deck.name order by deck.id [EDIT] sql has built-in average function, just use this: select deckId, avg(value) as ave from score group by deckId
