Can any one explain WMI to an old SNMP chap?

In response to my question about .NET SNMP support ( Looking for an .NET SNMP Extension agent ) @ Lex Li indicated that Microsoft are basically lavishing their instrumentation love on WMI rather than SNMP. With this in mind can anyone recommend any good learning resources for WMI and .NET? Bonus kudos for any sites that explain the WMI equivelent of SNMP traps and WMI/SNMP interoperability (if there is any!)
