How to use a Python REPL in a script

I am learning Python to use QT with Python, not only C++, and am curious if I can embed a Python interpreter in my application as a REPL? I want to allow users to script either loading a file and that file act as a plugin, or by evaluating code entered in a text box or something similar to embedding the interpreter in C or C++ and script the application using Python. Can this be done if the application is itself written in Python and made into a standalone binary using py2exe or something similar, something like Anders did with the C# REPL or Miguel with Mono.
