QTMovie delegate methods not being called

Hey, I'm trying to trap the QTMovie progress delegate method calls, and the delegate methods don't seem to be getting called. I'm trying to trap the conversion progress event by implementing - (BOOL)movie:(QTMovie *)movie shouldContinueOperation:(NSString *)op withPhase:(QTMovieOperationPhase)phase atPercent:(NSNumber *)percent withAttributes:(NSDictionary *)attributes but the method is not getting called. I've looked at apples sample code here http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/QTKitProgressTester/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003631 and can't seem to see very much difference between my code and their code. The file gets converted fine and shows up on my desktop and I can play it without issues. I just can't get the progress events. Any ideas? Here is my demo app that I'm using to test this with. #import "testProjAppDelegate.h" #import @implementation testProjAppDelegate @synthesize window; - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification { QTMovie* movie = [QTMovie movieWithFile:@"/Users/Morgan/Desktop/sample_iTunes.mov" error:nil]; if (movie) { [movie setDelegate:self]; NSDictionary *dict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], QTMovieExport, [NSNumber numberWithInt:kQTFileType3GPP], QTMovieExportType, nil]; [movie writeToFile:@"/Users/Morgan/Desktop/test.mp4" withAttributes:dict error:nil]; NSLog(@"DONE"); } } - (BOOL)movie:(QTMovie *)movie shouldContinueOperation:(NSString *)op withPhase:(QTMovieOperationPhase)phase atPercent:(NSNumber *)percent withAttributes:(NSDictionary *)attributes { NSLog(@"PROGRESS"); return YES; } @end
