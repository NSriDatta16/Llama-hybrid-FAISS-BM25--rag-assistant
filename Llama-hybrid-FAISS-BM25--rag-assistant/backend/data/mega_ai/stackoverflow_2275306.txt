How do I create a shallow copy of an object so that it may be serialize and sent via a web method call?

I would like to serialize the properties of the HttpBrowserCapibilities object so that it may be returned via a web method call. Currently the object cannot be serialized: Cannot serialize member System.Web.Configuration.HttpCapabilitiesBase.Capabilities of type System.Collections.IDictionary, because it implements IDictionary. ...which is understandable. However, I would like to simply copy out the properties and their values to a hierarchy, i.e. true I'm starting to think I would need to use reflection to copy this object, but I haven't reached a conclusion. Does anyone have any suggestions to keep this simple? Thanks, George
