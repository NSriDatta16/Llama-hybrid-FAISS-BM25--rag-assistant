Jquery/Javascript: Local storage plugin wont allow me to store an index, why? what am i doing wrong?

NOTE: I just figured out that this will make it work: $.Storage.set("whichp", ""+myindex) , adding the quotes, then a plus, then the variable. why wont it work with just the variable like this: $.Storage.set("whichp", myindex) ? If I even just remove the quotes and leave the plus, like so: $.Storage.set("whichp", myindex) it wont work either. I'm using a Jquery plugin that stores local data, if your browser has the capability. If not, it stores a cookie instead. On the developers site he says: Names and values should be strings. Some browsers may accept non-string values, but not all do. The format to set data is: $.Storage.set("name", "value") and to get the value: $.Storage.get("name") I thought I could set a variable, then insert that var as the value, like this: var myindex = $(this).index() $.Storage.set("whichp", mystring) but it's not working... if I were to do this though: var mynote = "this is a test" $.Storage.set("whichp", mynote) then it will work.... I don't understand why it wont allow me to put the index into storage... my full code for this click event is below. $('P').click(function () { var myindex = $(this).index() if (!$.Storage.get("whichp")) { $.Storage.set("whichp", myindex) } else { alert($.Storage.get("whichp")) } }); Jquery plugin It just doesn't set it in local storage/cookie, it's just empty.
