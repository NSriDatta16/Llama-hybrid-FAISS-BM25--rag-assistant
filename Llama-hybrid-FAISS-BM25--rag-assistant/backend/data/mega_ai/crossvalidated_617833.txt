Your question is more involved than it seems. Let me explain. First, you have to decide on a tentative model for regression. Well, every Bayesian model involves a likelihood function and a prior probability. The likelihood function usually is rather well understood. Broadly speaking, the likelihood function describes how the data agree with the tentative model. But what about the prior? The prior requires you to specify everything you know about the solution . For example: images cannot have negative pixel values, and physical processes cannot change abruptly. All of this is part of your professional knowledge. Or should be. And YOU have to decide on your prior! Second, after multiplying the prior probability distribution and the likelihood function, you have obtained an unnormalized posterior probability distribution. But your model is still tentative. There is no alternative than to compute the normalization constant. This constant is sometimes called evidence or partition function . Third, the next step is "model selection." The evidence is a numerical indication of the quality of the tentative model. But with the evidence values of several alternative models at hand, you can make a well-motivated selection of the best model. Only after you have selected the best model can you start with predictions and the corresponding error bars. I have written a tutorial about this subject What is your model? , which describes the many pitfalls. You don't need to buy it as you can read 80% for free on Amazon. Good luck.
