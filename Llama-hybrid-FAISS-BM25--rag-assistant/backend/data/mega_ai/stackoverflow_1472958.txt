Criteria.setProjection(null); Criteria.setResultTransformer(Criteria.ROOT_ENTITY); Will effectively "reset" the criteria between the rowCount projection and execution of the criteria itself. I would make sure your Order hasn't been added before doing the rowCount, it'll slow things down. My implementation of PaginatedList ALWAYS runs a count query before looking for results, so ordering isn't an issue.
