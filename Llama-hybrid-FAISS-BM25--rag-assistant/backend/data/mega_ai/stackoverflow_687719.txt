The short answer... Any alphanumeric characters or underscores, as long as the name starts with a letter. The longer answer... The MATLAB documentation has a section " Working with M-Files " that discusses naming with a little more detail. Specifically, it points out the functions NAMELENGTHMAX (the maximum number of characters in the name that the OS will pay attention to), ISVARNAME (to check if the variable/function name is valid), and ISKEYWORD (to display restricted keywords).
