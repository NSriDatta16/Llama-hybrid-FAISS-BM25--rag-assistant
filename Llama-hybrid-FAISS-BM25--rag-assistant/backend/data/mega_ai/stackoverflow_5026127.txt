Just use .each : a = [{"name" => "Ganesh", "magic_number" => 7}, {"name" => "Comrade", "magic_number" => 2} ] a.each { |x| x['magic_number'] = 8 } # a is now [{"magic_number"=>8, "name"=>"Ganesh"}, {"magic_number"=>8, "name"=>"Comrade"}] The argument to the block is a reference to the original elements so you can change them as desired. Note that this changes a in-place which I think is what you're after.
