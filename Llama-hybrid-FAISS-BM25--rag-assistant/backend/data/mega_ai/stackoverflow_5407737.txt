Scroll Indicator and uiScrollView methods

When you drag or flick scroll the Scroll Indicators appear then when everything stops moving they disappear. I would like to do some stuff during this time (or while they are showing) I know I could use (void) scrollViewDidScroll to start my things, but, and here is the question, is there a single method for the end? I know there are individual methods for drag or deceleration (after a flick) but there must be a single one because I bet that Scroll Indicator is using it??? many thanks for any help..
