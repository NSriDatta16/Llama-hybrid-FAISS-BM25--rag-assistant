Statistically support a conclusion of time series

I'm currently submitting a paper about elements in soil solution. Reviewers told me to justify the conclusion by the data, and I need some of your unlimited knowledge. Here is a plot of $\textrm{Al }$ present in soil solution over $6$ years. My conclusion to be supported is that during winter (trees dormancy, the purple line is $21~\rm Dec. $ of each year), more $\rm Al$ is released in solution. My initial intuition is to support it using time series analysis. However, despite knowing some stuff about statistics, I never did time series analysis. So, here are my questions: Is my analysis relevant given my conclusion to be supported? How in R, analyze using the forecast library? I already did : sarima_model summary(sarima_model) which gives me : Series: tsdata ARIMA(0,0,2) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ma1 ma2 mean 0.3591 0.3215 0.1127 s.e. 0.0569 0.0564 0.0119 sigma^2 estimated as 0.01387: log likelihood=197.92 AIC=-387.84 AICc=-387.69 BIC=-373.4 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -0.0001118715 0.1171314 0.07782753 768.5151 1255.721 0.9025749 0.02918578 But I am not able to interpret results.
