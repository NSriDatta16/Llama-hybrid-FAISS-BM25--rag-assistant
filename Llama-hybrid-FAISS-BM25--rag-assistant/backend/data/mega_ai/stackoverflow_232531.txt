Users won't mind filling in long forms if and only if they feel that the questions that you ask are important: otherwise they will be discouraged, and become impatient with it. Remember, in a web application people have very, very short attention spans. When the user starts feeling that you are asking too much, they're usually right . Keep required information as few as possible: other info should only be optional, and you have to give something in return to the user to compel them to complete that information.
