Generating a 3-month half life weighting series in R

I am using the lm() and princomp() functions in R to perform regressions on foreign exchange time series. I would like to weight the regressions (and PCA) such that 50% of the influence on the regression comes from the past 3 months, 25% from the previous 3 months, etc, but in a smooth fashion. Both functions take such a weighting series. What is a simple formula for generating a decaying weights series with a half life of 3 months (or any other period, for that matter), in R? Ideally the sum of the weights will equal 1, although I don't think this is mandatory in lm().
