Yes, by using Array#map! : lines.map! { |e| e.strip } lines.map! { |e| e.upcase} # ... Often, an immutable method like map is paired with a dangerous one like map! , which causes the receiver to be modified. I recommend against using these, since half the point of nice, functional-style enumerable programming is to get the benefits of immutability (referential transparency, etc.). But if you're going to reassign on each enumeration, you might as well use map! .
