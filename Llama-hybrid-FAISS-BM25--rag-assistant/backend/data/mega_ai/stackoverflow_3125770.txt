Embedding happens at compile time; not at run time. You can't embed an element using a set method. Here is some info about embedding assets, such as PNGs in Flex: http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=embed_4.html [Embed(source="assets/images/test.png")] [Bindable] public var folderIcon:Class; And you can use it like this: folderOpenIcon="{folderIcon}" folderClosedIcon="{folderIcon}" defaultLeafIcon="{folderIcon}"
