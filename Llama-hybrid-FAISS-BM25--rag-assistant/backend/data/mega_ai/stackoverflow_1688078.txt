Besides what Draemon write about struct x {...} x , I took the liberty of correcting the various other small problems like the printf() : void main() { struct x { int xx; char *y; int *num; struct x *next; } x; struct x* temp; int b = 10; temp = ((struct x *)malloc(sizeof(struct x))); (*temp).num = &b; x.next = temp ; printf("%d %d\n",*temp->num, *x.next->num); } Just out of curiosity: What are you trying to achieve?
