Documentary The documentary The Great Hack, produced by Netflix, examines how Cambridge Analytica used personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent to influence electoral processes, including Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Brexit referendum in the UK. It highlights how personal data exploitation can compromise the holding of free electoral processes in democratic countries, privacy and individual freedoms. The documentary features interviews with several key figures: Brittany Kaiser: former director of business development at Cambridge Analytica, who decided to blow the whistle by providing inside information about the company's operations. David Carroll: professor at Parsons and The New School, who fought in court to obtain a copy of his personal data used by Cambridge Analytica, to help shed light on how the scheme worked.
