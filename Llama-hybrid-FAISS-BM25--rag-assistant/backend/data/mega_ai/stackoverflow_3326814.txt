Assuming one thread and one core, at any nanosecond, the thread is either doing something (100%) or it is waiting (0%). Partial CPU utilization is only possible as a time-average between running and not-running. So, basically, to get 50%, just let it sleep half the time. The lengths of the sleeps is up to you.
