Hypothesis testing with p-values from similar tests as prior

I hope to work on a hypothesis testing problem to test $\beta$ against the null hypothesis ( $H_{null}$ ) $\beta=0$ , and we can consider Wald test with the test statistics $$ W = \dfrac{\beta^2}{var(\beta)} $$ Then, with $W$ , I can get p-values, which is essentially "getting a value of the test statistic as extreme as or even more extreme than what is observed by chance alone", so $p(t > W | H_{null})$ . However, the sample size I have to calculate $\beta$ and $var(\beta)$ is fairly small. The results, although p-values for some covariates are small, are not very convincing. On the other hand, I have some p-values calculated for the same set of covariates, from a larger body of samples. Basically, I have a prior $p_0(t>W_0|H_{null})$ . In addition, sometimes I also have $\beta_0$ . I wonder whether/how I can calibrate $p(t > W | H_{null})$ with $p_0(t>W_0|H_{null})$ . Some of my current efforts I learned a way to do this is to simulate a large amount of data that leads to $p_0$ if we conduct the test, and then combine the simulated data and my real ones to do the hypothesis testing, but I hope there are more efficient ways to do it. Bayesian hypothesis testing sounds relevant, but it assumes $p_0(H_{null})$ instead of $p_0(t>W_0|H_{null})$ , and it leads to a MAP result. I hope we can still have a p-value at the end.
