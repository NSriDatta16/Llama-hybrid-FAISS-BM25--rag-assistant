Why not use a linear mixed model instead? You can consider sample to be a random effect in this context. The relationship might not be linear, but a monotone transformation yields an approximately linear relationship: Square-root transformation of time ($\sqrt{\text{time}}$) Logarithmic transformation of time ($\log(\text{time} + 1)$, add one because your time series starts at 0 and $\log(0)$ is undefined) Squared transformation of the response ($y^2$) I don't know how to include the output on this forum yet, but here is an example using your data: plot(y ~ log(time + 1), data = d) plot(y ~ sqrt(time), data = d) plot(y^2 ~ time, data = d) library(lme4) # for linear mixed models # Using a square-root transformation: LMM.sqrt Now sample is a random effect (I guess this is also what you will want to put in Error() for the RM-ANOVA) affecting the intercept. The best model in terms of AIC turns out to be the log-transformed model: anova(LMM.sqrt, LMM.log, LMM.sqry) You can get the effect of treatment by looking at the fixed effects under the summary: summary(LMM.log) You can get confidence intervals for inference: confint(LMM.log) The effect of the random effect is small, but significant at $\alpha = 0.05$. Treatments differ significantly and the interaction between time and treatment is also significant. This means a starts higher than b and also increases with time more than b.
