I think your question has a false premise. While computer vision is an interesting problem with many challenging facets, I can name half-a-dozen obscure fields which have equally -- or even more -- "serious" ML practitioners. These include fields like e-discovery, automated risk assessment, and financial algorithms. And I think you're placing too much emphasis on what you yourself find interesting -- while you don't like sorting cats from dogs, some people like working on problems where there are obvious correct and incorrect answers. Most of the problems I work on are much less well-defined, and that can be frustrating. One important consideration is that computer vision likely has considerable private and public funding behind it for various reasons (commercialization of the technology for things like like self-driving cars, or military applications). Your university might be better able to shed light on their labs' naming conventions, but my guess is that they have funding for a computer vision lab for whatever reason. In turn, this implies that you could answer this question by checking out who is underwriting the grants to machine vision specialists. I'll bet you a dollar that a substantial number in the US receive funding from the Office of Naval Research, DARPA, or similar organizations. Another reason is that the basic science of machine vision is neither inherently proprietary nor confidential. An e-discovery corpus is almost always under protective order, and financial algorithms are the "secret sauce" of a algorithmic trading enterprise, so neither is likely to be discussed openly.
