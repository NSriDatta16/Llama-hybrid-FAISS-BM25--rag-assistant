They aren't poopooing the importance of correlation. It's just that the tendency is to interpret correlation as causation. Take breastfeeding as the perfect example. Mothers almost always interpret the (observational studies') findings about breastfeeding as a suggestion as to whether or not they should actually breastfeed. It's true that, on average, babies who are breastfed tend to be healthier adults in order age even after controlling for longitudinal maternal and paternal age, socioeconomic status, etc. This does not imply that breastfeeding alone is responsible for the difference, though it may partially play a role in early development of appetite regulation. The relationship is very complex and one can easily speculate at a whole host of mediating factors that could underlie the differences observed. Plenty of studies look to associations to warrant a deeper understanding of what's going on. Correlation is not useless, it just is several steps below causation and one needs to be mindful of how to report findings to prevent misinterpretation from nonexperts.
