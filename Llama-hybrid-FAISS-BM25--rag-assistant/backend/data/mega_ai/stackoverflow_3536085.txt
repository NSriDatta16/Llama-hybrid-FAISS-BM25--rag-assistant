d.innerHTML += " "; That's your problem. Never ever innerHTML+= anything . What it does is serialise the document objects in the parent element into HTML, add the string, and then parse the whole string back into new DOM objects. This is slow and loses all information that cannot be stored in serialised HTML markup, like field values, JS references and event handlers . So any event handler you added on the gets destroyed immediate by the next line. HTML is not the definitive storage of page data in a browser; you can't edit it directly. You can only serialise part of the document content into new HTML (which may look little like the HTML you put in to the parse the page), and parse HTML into completely new objects. So instead, continue to use DOM methods: d.appendChild(document.createElement('br')) Aside: a.innerText = item.name; That's an IE extension that isn't supported everywhere. You can use it as fallback for IE where the standard textContent property isn't supported, or, for maximum compatibility just use plain old document.createTextNode() and append that to a . Since you appear to be using jQuery, use text() to do this, and click() to bind the event, as in the other answers.
