JQuery reposition div elements on page load

I am implementing a portlet/widget JQuery interface using Interface and JQuery. The user drags and drops widgets adn the screen can handle it. I am able to use serialize which displays the order of the div elements on the screen. I can save this in a cookie or DB - that doesnt matter yet. My question is how is it possible to load a page repositioning the divs to match the order in the cookie/DB? A cookie based example would be nice, but it doesn't really matter. Is there a certain JQuery method I can call that is able to reposition the divs in the order I want them to be?
