Magento - How to check if a product has already been removed from the cart

I'm writing a small module that will add a product to the cart automatically (based on certain criterias). However if the user subsequently removes that automatic product from the cart I need to know so that I don't add it again in the current session. Does the cart object hold anything that can tell me if a product has been removed from the cart already?
