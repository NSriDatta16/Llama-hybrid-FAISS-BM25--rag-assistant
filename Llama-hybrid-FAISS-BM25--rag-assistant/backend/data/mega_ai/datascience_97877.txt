Comparing Multiclass classifiers with "No Answer"-Class

I have three classifiers to classify some words into four classes. Every word that does not fit into any of these four classes gets classified as "No Answer". I would like to compare the classifiers with Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Do I have to ignore the "No Answer" class to calculate the average Precision and so on or is it important to include it?
