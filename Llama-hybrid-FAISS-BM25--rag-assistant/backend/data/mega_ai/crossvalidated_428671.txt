I think the following perspective might further clarify the confusion. Generative Adversarial Networks attempt to solve an unsupervised learning problem by jointly solving a supervised learning problems, an optimization problem. Suppose we have training data that takes the form x1,...,xN without labels. Since there are no labels, this problem is unsupervised. Suppose we train a generator to produce fake samples, while simultaneously training a discriminator to tell real samples from fake. Training the discriminator is a supervised learning problem. Training the generator to fool the discriminator is an optimization problem. In summary: It is possible to train a GAN on data without labels, unsupervised learning. Doing this require us to jointly solve a supervised learning problem and an optimization problem.
