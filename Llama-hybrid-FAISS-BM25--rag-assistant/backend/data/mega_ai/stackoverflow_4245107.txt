There are two ways essentially. One is a "hacky" and not very elegant way directly from within GWT, the other makes use of the Google Visualisation API. The hacky way involves constructing a table and placing your data in it. Furthermore, you need to decide how to "bin" your data values into ranges and then you assign colours to the bins (which you specify in your CSS file). Subsequently you attach the the appropriate CSS to a table cell using the column/row formatter. I have actually done heatmaps in this way within GWT and it works.... The non-hacky way is to go to the Google Visualisations API and to wrap the heatmap that is there already in GWT using JSNI.
