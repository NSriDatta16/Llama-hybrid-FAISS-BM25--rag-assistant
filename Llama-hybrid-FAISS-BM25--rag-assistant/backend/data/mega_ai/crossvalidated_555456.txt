Making predictions with support vector classification

I am reading this book (chapter 8.3 - 8.5) about SVM's, while also trying to work with the ksvm() function from the kernlab package in r . While fitting a model is fairly straightforward, I don't know how to derive the method 8.3 prediction step on page 174, namely manually computing the linear combination needed for classification of a datapoint. Equation 8.35c states $\hat{y}(x_{*}) = sign(\hat{\alpha}^\top K(X,x_{*}))$ . I suppose this might be an equally relevant question to ask on stackoverflow about the r part, but I struggle to translate the mathematical notation into a "real" problem, so I decided to post it here instead.
