Can you be more specific on $\beta$, is it a variable or a constant? if constant, what values can it take? I believe, it is a constant. These are time series models. The equations with time trend is a model of deterministic trend, however, it could easily be shown that $y_t$ is stationary if $\beta$ approaches $0$. The second model is an AR(1) model where the coefficient of $y_{t-1}$ is 1. The DGP in both cases is sensitive to the values $\beta$ takes. To see this, run simulations in excel varying the values that $\beta$ can take.
