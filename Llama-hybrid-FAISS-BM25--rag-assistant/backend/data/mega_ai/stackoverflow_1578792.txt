Considering you'll have many of those classes, I wouldn't exactly call them singletons. You just defer the attribute to a singleton class. It seems better to make sure the class actually is a singleton. The problem with your solution is that you would have to implement both a del method (which is fine) but also a reference-counter, which seems like a bad idea. :-) Here is a question with several implementations: Is there a simple, elegant way to define singletons? Which one is for you depends on what kind of singleton you want. One object per a certain value, but for any value? A set of predefined singletons? A proper singleton, ie, just one single object?
