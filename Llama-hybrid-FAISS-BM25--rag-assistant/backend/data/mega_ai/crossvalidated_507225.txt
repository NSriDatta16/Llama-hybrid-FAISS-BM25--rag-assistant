Explanation on Google’s PageRank is Webpages as Eigenvectors

Help understand what is the matrix A and the vector x discussed below. Mathematics for Machine Learning Example 4.9 Google uses the eigenvector corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of a matrix A to determine the rank of a page for search. The idea for the PageRank algorithm, developed at Stanford University by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1996, was that the importance of any web page can be ap- proximated by the importance of pages that link to it. For this, they write down all web sites as a huge directed graph that shows which page links to which. PageRank computes the weight (importance) x i > 0 of a web site a i by counting the number of pages pointing to a i . Moreover, PageR- ank takes into account the importance of the web sites that link to a i . The navigation behavior of a user is then modeled by a transition matrix A of this graph that tells us with what (click) probability somebody will end up on a different web site. The matrix A has the property that for any ini- tial rank/importance vector x of a web site the sequence $x, Ax, A^2x$ , . . . converges to a vector $x*$ . This vector is called the PageRank and satisfies Ax∗ = x∗ , i.e., it is an eigenvector (with corresponding eigenvalue 1 ) of A . After normalizing $x*$ , such that || $x*$ || = 1 , we can interpret the entries as probabilities. More details and different perspectives on PageRank can be found in the original technical report (Page et al., 1999). I suppose A is a linking from a source web page FROM which has a link(s) to another page TO. Is x like a one-hot-encoding of a web page to identify a specific page, then $Ax$ will result in multiple pages? Then the next step $A(Ax)$ will be multiple concurrent steps? A web page is an eigenvector means that the matrix A has as many eigenvectors as the web pages existing in the world?
