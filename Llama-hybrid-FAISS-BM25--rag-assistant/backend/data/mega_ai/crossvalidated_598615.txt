effect size for paired t test

I have question regarding effect size for paired t test some textbooks and statistical software like spss use this formula Cohen′sd = d/SDofdifference to calculate effect size for paired t test and other use this Cohen′sd = d/SDaverage SDaverage = sqrt((1sd ^2 +sd^2)/2) both give different result! so which one should I use for paired t test? And why there are two way that give different result?
