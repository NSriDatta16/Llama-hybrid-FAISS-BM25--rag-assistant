Following suggestions from @Robert Long and @Henry (see the comments above), the issue is now solved. Apparently, reversing Boldness scores as I mentioned in my original question also reversed it's skew and so log transformation didn't help for Rboldness because it was negatively skewed. Therefore the model assumptions of linearity and heteroskedasticity were violated and so the non-significant correlation. However, reversing boldness scores by division as suggested by Henry made Rboldness positively skewed, and log transformations helped in reducing the skewness of the data. Subsequently, the model's assumptions were not violated, and the correlation coefficient was similar when analysed with the model consisting the un-reversed Boldness scores, but opposite in sign.
