How can I show/hide one when a radio button is clicked on, when all the s have the same class?

I have this JavaScript code: $("#midden-offertes form .subvragen").hide(); $("#midden-offertes form .veld .radio :radio").change(function() { if (this.value === 'Ja') { $("#midden-offertes form .subvragen",this).show() } else { $("#midden-offertes form .subvragen",this).hide(); } }); I also have a with different radio buttons. When I click on a radio button, the .subvragen must be shown. But every .radio button has its own .subvragen . How can I change this JavaScript code so that only the .subvragen within each radio button is shown when I click on that radio button? When I click on a radio button now, all the .subvragen s are shown. Edit: I have uploaded the files. You can see them here: http://mikevierwind.nl/karel/offerterelatie.html
