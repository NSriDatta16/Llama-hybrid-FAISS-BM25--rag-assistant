The simplest over sampling technique is to repeat the smaller classes. Here is a Python script to do that. I will try to add some noise to it. This is because over sampled data can be very repetitive and this causes machine learning tools to over fit to the over sampled data. I would use SMOTE to add the noise but I don't think that works for binary. I'll see if I can swap some values within classes. A colleague commented: "I don't think oversampling is a good idea... If you have very many classes and insufficiently correlated attributes then I'm afraid there's not that much you can do to improve the accuracy. As a first step, I'd try to pool some of the classes (if that's possible, I don't know if that would work in your application)."
