I've previously used Troy Gilbert's pixel perfect collision detection class (adapted from Andre Michelle, Grant Skinner and Boulevart) which works really well (handles rotation, different parents, etc.): http://troygilbert.com/2007/06/pixel-perfect-collision-detection-in-actionscript3/ http://troygilbert.com/2009/08/pixel-perfect-collision-detection-revisited/ and from there he has also linked to this project (which I've not used, but looks really impressive): http://www.coreyoneil.com/portfolio/index.php?project=5
