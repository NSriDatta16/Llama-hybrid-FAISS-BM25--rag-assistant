Summarizing Bayesian rating formula

Based on this url i found Bayesian Rating , which explains the rating model very well, i wanted to summarize the formula to make it much easier for anyone implementing an SQL statement. Would this be correct if i summarized the formula like this? avg_num_votes = Sum(votes)/Count(votes) * Count(votes) avg_rating = sum(votes)/count(votes) this_num_votes = count(votes) this_rating = Positive_votes - Negative_votes Gath
