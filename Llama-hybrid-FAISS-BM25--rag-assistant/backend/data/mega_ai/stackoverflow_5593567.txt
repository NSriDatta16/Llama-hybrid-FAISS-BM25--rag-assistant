I usually start designing my page to be used without CSS. I outline the titles using Hx tags, the paragraphs, links, lists and images. Then I hand-draw a mockup splitting my page in big blocks and using divs, positioning and floats I create the structure of the layout. Then I concentrate on each of these big blocks, decomposing them in smaller blocks until I have positioned everything where it should be. Then I refine the basic elements (lists, links, text) trying to find out common styles to reduce as much as I can the number of selectors. Finally I open all the available web browsers to test the differences and apply hacks/conditional stylesheets. I NEVER had good experencies using visual editors, but I have to admit that I quit using them many years ago.
