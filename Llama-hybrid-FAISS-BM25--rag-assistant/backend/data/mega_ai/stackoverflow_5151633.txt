If I'm understanding your question correctly your wanting to change tax rates based off the order total? NY, USA has something similar to this called Luxury Tax I had to find a means to do such. Here's what I found, as it may not be a direct solution to your problem but can at least give you a starting point code wise. Obviously exhaust all core abilities of Magento first to make sure its NOT possible before attempting such, as there may be a means without code changes, more details on your question would help, anyhow... protected function _unitBaseCalculation($item, $request) { // If USD and from NY Region, apply tax rate based on grand total if(Mage::app()->getStore()->getCurrentCurrencyCode() == "USD" && $request['region_id'] == "43") { if($item['discount_amount'] != 0) { $package_id = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($item['product_id'])->getAttributeText('package_id'); if($package_id == "SHOES") { $price_minus_discount = $item['price'] - $item['discount_amount']; if($price_minus_discount getProduct()->setTaxClassId('7'); } else { //$rate = "8.875"; $item->getProduct()->setTaxClassId('6'); } } } http://www.molotovbliss.com/ny-luxury-taxes-with-discounts-and-magento
