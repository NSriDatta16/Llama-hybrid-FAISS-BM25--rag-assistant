When you have a normal distribution, the following are true. The mean $\mu$ is at the $50^{\text{th}}$ percentile. Within one standard deviation $\sigma$ of the mean, $68\%$ of the data are contained. The distribution is symmetric about the mean. This means that $34\%$ of the density is above $\mu$ but below $\mu+\sigma$ , and $34\%$ of the density is below $\mu$ but above $\mu-\sigma$ . $$ 50+34 = 84\\ 50-34 = 16 $$ Those numbers $-$$16$ , $50$ , and $84$$-$ look familiar, don't they? In the normal distribution, $\mu-\sigma$ corresponds to the $16^{\text{th}}$ percentile, and $\mu+\sigma$ corresponds to the $84^{\text{th}}$ percentile. In other words, when you have a normal distribution from your MCMC, you get $\mu-\sigma$ , $\mu$ , and $\mu+\sigma$ by looking at those those three percentiles, $16$ , $50$ , and $84$ , respectively. When you don't have a normal distribution, you still get the same quantiles with which you are familiar from the normal distribution. If you do not have a normal distribution, then $\mu-\sigma$ , $\mu$ , and $\mu+\sigma$ might correspond to percentiles other than $16$ , $50$ , and $84$ , respectively.
