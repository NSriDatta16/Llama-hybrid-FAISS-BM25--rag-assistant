Drawing a continuous rectangle

i m currently working on visual c++ 2008 express edition.. in my project i have a picturebox which contains an image, now i have to draw a rectangle to enaable the user to select a part of the image.. I have used the "MouseDown" event of the picturebox and the below code to draw a rectangle: Void pictureBox1_MouseDown(System::Object^ sender, Windows::Forms::MouseEventArgs^ e) { Graphics^ g = pictureBox1->CreateGraphics(); Pen^ pen = gcnew Pen(Color::Blue); g->DrawRectangle( pen , e->X ,e->Y,width,ht); } now in the "DrawRectangle" the arguments "width" and "ht" are static, so the above code results in the drawing of a rectangle at the point where the user presses the mouse button on the image in picturebox... i want to allow the user to be able to drag the cursor and draw a rectangle of size that he wishes to.. Plz help me on this.. Thanx..
