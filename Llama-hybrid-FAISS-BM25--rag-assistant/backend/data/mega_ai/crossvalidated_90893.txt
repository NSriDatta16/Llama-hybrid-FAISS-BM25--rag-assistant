Why use a z test rather than a t test with proportional data?

When testing the difference between 2 proportions why do we use a z-test rather than a t-test? Further, is there a simple way to conduct an omnibus test for significant differences between more than 2 proportions (in the form of percentages). Is there an equivalent to a one-way ANOVA for this? I imagine that you could use logistic regression (assuming you have the original data for the proportions in the form of 0s and 1s) Are there other options?
