Does Android encourage reusing their Menu-Icons? Where to get them all?

They do not write anything about licenses at http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html#menuapx (Menu Icons) I guess they want to have standard icons look the same in all apps, so users dont get confused. Right? Now I would love to use the Menu-Icon "see map" (a folded map) from the Google Places App. Where can I get it for a commercial project? (Its not in here )
