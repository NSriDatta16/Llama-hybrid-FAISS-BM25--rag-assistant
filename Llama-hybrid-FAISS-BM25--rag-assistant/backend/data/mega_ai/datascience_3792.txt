Object Recognition for classification, is it being used in industry?

I'm wondering if e-commerce companies where products are offered by users, such as EBay, are using Object Recognition to ensure that an uploaded image corresponds to an specific type of object (clothing, shoes, glasses, etc) either to classify automatically or more importantly to filter undesired images (such as non related or even illegal types). If so, which algorithms and/or open platforms could be use for doing so? From what I've looked it seems that HOG+Exemplar SVM might be one of the most accurate methods developed so far ( http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/exemplarsvm-iccv11.pdf ), even having couple of public repo's with Matlab implementations ( https://github.com/quantombone/exemplarsvm ), but I'm still wondering if this is being used in industry.
