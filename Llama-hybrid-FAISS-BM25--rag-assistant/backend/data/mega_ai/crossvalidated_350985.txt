non parametric test to detect price discrimination

Let us say that I have these columns for a product: Day Price Channel of sale (e.g. web or snail mail) Number of sales Looking at the distribution, they can be bi modal as products can be on sale/promo or not. Let us say there are only 2 channels. Is it possible to test for the null hypothesis that prices are on average (median?) not different for both segments? Can I use a Wilcoxon test (paired?) for this. Any input would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
