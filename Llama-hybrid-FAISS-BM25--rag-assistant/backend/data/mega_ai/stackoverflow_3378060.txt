UITableView: Drag a row onto another one

I have a UITableView that represents a list of objects, I'd like the user to touch an object, drag it onto another one (as to combine them) and seeing the two disappearing and a new one appearing. I guess that I can't do this with the standard table view editing methods (a row cannot be dragged onto another one, am I right?). Shall I write my touch listeners? how can I do that?
