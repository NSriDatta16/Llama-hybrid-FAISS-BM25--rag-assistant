HTML code to indent without using blockquote (so there is no space on the next line)

I am trying to create a block of indented text without using block quote. The reason I want to do this is because block quote adds an additional space between the indented block of text and the previous paragraph. I wan the indented piece of text to be flush up against the the non-indented piece of text.
