You have a sequence of pitch observations, and want to match this to a known sequence. This is a classic problem within many areas, such as gesture detection and speech recognition. There are two typical approaches: classification or sequence decoding. Classification means training a supervised machine learning model to detect the sequence. This is good if you have few things to detect (1-100), but infeasible for large number of classes (say every possible sequence of 8 semitones). Viterbi decoding The Viterbi algorithm allows to output the most likely sequence that matches a sequence of observations. This paper on Hidden Markov Models and Viterbi Algorithm explains how it can be used to decode chord sequences. The librosa library now contains a Viterbi module that could be used for this.
