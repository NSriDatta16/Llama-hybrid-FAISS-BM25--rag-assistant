Use Process Explorer (www.sysinternals.com) and look at the Virtual Address Space of your process. In contrast with "Private Bytes" (which is the amount of memory taken by the process), the Virtual Address Space shows the highest memory address in use. If fragmentation is high, it will be much higher than the "Private Bytes". If your application really needs that much memory: Consider going to 64-bit Enable the /LARGEADDRESSAWARE flag, which will give your 32-bit process 4GB of RAM under a 64-bit operating system, and 3GB if a 32-bit Windows is booted with the /3GB flag.
