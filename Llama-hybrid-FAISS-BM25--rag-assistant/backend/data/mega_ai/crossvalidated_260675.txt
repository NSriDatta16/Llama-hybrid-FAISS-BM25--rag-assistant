Look at the time series plot, how to tell if the data is "random" and nonnormal or not?

I tried to solve this exercise in the book of "Time Series Analysis with Application in R": Simulate a completely random process of length 48 with independent, chi-square distributed values, each with 2 degrees of freedom. Display the time series plot. Does it look “random” and nonnormal? Repeat this exercise several times with a new simulation each time. I run this command five times and get five plots: plot(rchisq(48, 2), type='o') rchisq as time series"> Look at the above plots, how do I say if they look "random" and nonnormal or not? How can I know that a variable is "nonnormal" or "random" by looking at the time series plots? Thank you so much.
