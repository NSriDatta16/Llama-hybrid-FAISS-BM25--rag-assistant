If this were the command line curl you'd throw in the -v parameter. Pay attention to the lines starting with > Cookie: . The php version of this is: curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_VERBOSE,TRUE);//and set CURLOPT_STDERR to STDOUT And if this were a browser I would debug with one of these: you can use Fiddler on IE, TamperData or Firebug (net) on Firefox, the inspector on Chrome and on Safari , or a proxy with any browser to watch how the form is submitted by a "normal" browser. The proxy approach might work if you set php's curl to use it. curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL,TRUE);//& CURLOPT_PROXYPORT CURLOPT_PROXY If you want to just add cookies to one request you could write a line like: $ch->headers[] = 'Cookie: recent=543..; _session_id=6185..; __utma=572.1.1.1.1; __utmc=572..; __utmz=572.1.1.1.1.utmccn=(referral)|utmcsr=domain.com|utmcct=/request/path|utmcmd=referral'; but I'm not certain about that one, these might be more along the same line: curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_COOKIE,"recent=543..; _session_id=618.."); // Possibly, but I think this might overwrite other headers. curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, "Cookie: recent=543..; _session_id=6185..");
