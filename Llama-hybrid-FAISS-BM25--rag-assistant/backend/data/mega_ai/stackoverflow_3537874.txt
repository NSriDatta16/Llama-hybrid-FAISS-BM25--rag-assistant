F# upcasting TextBlock to UIElement

What is wrong with: let (x:UIElement) = upcast new TextBlock() The error is: The type 'System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize' is required here and is unavailable. You must add a reference to assembly 'System, Version=4.0.0....' TextBlock is a subtype of UIElement ... Note that doing what the error message says does solve the issue, but why is that necessary to do something as basic as upcasting?
