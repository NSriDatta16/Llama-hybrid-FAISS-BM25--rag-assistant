How to approach Supervised Regression Problem of MR image to 256 element vector data?

I want to train a neural network to predict 256 values as below: Inputs are 3D MR images. The dataset contains 20 subjects and their corresponding coil values. Now patch operation will not be possible to augment data since coil values depend on different parts of the brain. How the 256 real values vary in 20 subjects: from the histogram, it can be seen that out of 256 coils nearly 170 values do not change significantly. As a beginner, I can say it is supervised regression problem. Can these 256 values be predicted using the neural network? I am using ResNet architecture. More details can be shared if required.
