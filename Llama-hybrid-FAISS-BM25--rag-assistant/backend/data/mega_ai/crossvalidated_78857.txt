You can plot the predicted value of Y from the equation at various levels of $X_1$, but you have to choose values of $X_2$ and $X_3$ for those lines. One choice would be the median value of each. Taking a step back: 1) Are you sure you want multiple regression on a time series? This can cause some problems (e.g. if Y and any of the X are both increasing over time) 2) Where is 'time' in your formula? Is it one of the X's?
