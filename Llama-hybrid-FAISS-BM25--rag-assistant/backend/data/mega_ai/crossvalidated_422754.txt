What is first order difference in trend analysis?

I am following this paper: Measuring, Predicting and Visualizing Short-Term Change in Word Representation and Usage in VKontakte Social Network where in Differencing Statistics section they describe that they performed first-order differences of their trends. More specifically, for word frequecy time series and tf-idf time series they have taken subtraction , and for word embeddings they have used cosine similarity . My first question is why they have considered first-order difference without doing remaining tragectory clustering starightly using the original time-series data? My second question is how first order difference is performed using substraction and cosine simialrity as it is not mentioned in the paper? I am happy to provide more details if needed.
