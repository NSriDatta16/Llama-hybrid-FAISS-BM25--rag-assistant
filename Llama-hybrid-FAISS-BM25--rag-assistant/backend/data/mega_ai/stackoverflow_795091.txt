Your problem sounds similar to one we faced - that you are acting as a white-label, and that each client needs to have their own separate database. Assuming this concept parallels yours, what we did was leverage a "master" database that stored the hostname and database name for the client (which could be cached in the application tier). The server the client was accessing could then dynamically shift its datasource to the required database. This allowed us to scale up to thousands of client databases, scattered across servers.
