Disable auto-fill-mode locally (or un fill-paragraph) with emacs

I use M-q for fill-paragraph, can I do the un-fill-paragraph in auto-fill-mode? With org mode, I sometimes enter [[Very long HTML][Name with spaces]] , and for the 'Name with spaces' the auto-fill mode break the whole line based on the inserted space, which makes it very ugly. Is there a command something like un-fill-paragraph? Or, is there a way disable auto-fill-mode temporarily/locally?
