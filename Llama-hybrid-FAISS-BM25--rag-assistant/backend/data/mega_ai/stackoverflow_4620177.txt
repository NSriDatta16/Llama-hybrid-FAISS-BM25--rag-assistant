The only way you can realistically do this is to enforce a user login for comments, as IP addresses aren't sufficiently unique and cookies are trivial to erase at the client end. That said, there is of course nothing to stop people creating multiple users accounts with a variety of email addresses (gmail/Yahoo, etc.) so you'll want to create your own tools/admin view so you can trivially check IP addresses if you suspect people are still misbehaving. (A tool for your armoury if nothing else.) On a similar basis, you could also log the browser agent header.
