For the $\chi^2$ distribution to hold needs more than asymptotic Normality. The condition is basically that $$\sqrt{n}(\hat\beta-\beta)\stackrel{d}{\to} N(0,I^{-1})$$ where $-I$ is the average expected second derivative of the log likelihood. Suppose, more generally, that $$\sqrt{n}(\hat\beta-\beta)\stackrel{d}{\to} N(0,V)$$ and look at the test for all the parameters rather than just a subset of them, to simplify things. Let $\ell(\beta)$ be the loglikelihood and $\beta_0$ the null hypothesis value. Assume we can do a second-order Taylor expansion $$\ell(\beta_0)= \ell(\hat\beta)+ (\hat\beta-\beta_0)\ell'(\hat\beta)+\frac{1}{2}(\hat\beta-\beta_0)^t\ell''(\hat\beta)(\hat\beta-\beta_0)+o_p(\|\hat\beta-\beta_0\|^2)$$ The second term on the RHS is zero because $\hat\beta$ is the maximum, so $Q=-(2\ell(\hat\beta)-2\ell(\beta_0))$ is asymptotically a quadratic form in $\hat\beta-\beta_0$ . Note now that $\ell''(\hat\beta)=-nI(\hat\beta)$ (by definition). Asymptotic normality of $\hat\beta$ now implies that the asymptotic distribution of $Q$ is a quadratic form in Gaussians; the distribution of $$\sum_{i=1}^p\lambda_iZ_i^2$$ where $Z_i$ are iid $N(0,1)$ and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $IV$ . If $V$ is obtained by maximimising $\ell$ , then $V=I^{-1}JI^{-1}$ , where $J$ is the variance of $n^{-1/2}\ell'(\beta_0)$ , so $IV=JI^{-1}$ The distribution will be a $\chi^2$ distribution if the eigenvalues are all 0 or 1, otherwise it won't. If we're looking at the test for all parameters, this means $JI^{-1}$ must be the identity, and so $V=I^{-1}$ . When testing just some parameters the same arguments as usual extend to show you still want $V=I^{-1}$ . In many situations it's fine for the distribution to be a more general quadratic form in Gaussians, since $\lambda_i$ can be estimated and there are several algorithms for computing the tail probabilities of the linear combination of $Z^2$ . In particular, in survey statistics these tests are called the Rao-Scott likelihood ratio tests (especially in the case of loglinear models for contingency tables ), and the tail probabilities are typically approximated using the Satterthwaite approximation.
