separate database for SSIS logging

I read it somewhere" "A separate database should be created if SSIS logging is required. (Do not use the Sysdtslog90 table in either master or msdb. This is not a security related concern but could be a performance issue since SSIS can generate a lot of logging data. Microsoft recommends creating a separate database for logging." Why? Just to keep things separate and be more organized or there is a deeper meaning to this? Regards Manjot
