I really dont get what you are trying to achieve here.. there is nothing wrong in writing more code.. it doesnt matter what the size of you code is so long as it is concrete and well organised. what you should be worrying is how do you reduce database interactions, retrieve only required properties from the db. as your code shows you retrieve the entire customer object and then end up displaying some properties why dont you retrieve only the properties that you need. also if you are using the properties of Mailing address why dont you pass the entire mailingaddres object as a property why are you splitting up into other properties.
