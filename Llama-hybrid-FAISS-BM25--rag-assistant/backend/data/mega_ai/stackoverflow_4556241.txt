Embedding HornetQ in Spring

I am trying to evaluate HornetQ and the possibility of embedding it in a spring application. To start with a simple setup I am just trying to initialize it as follows. I didn't find much documentation about how to do this, apart from the fact that 'you can'. I am using Spring 3 and HornetQ 2.1.1GA My Spring configuration looks like this, however if theres a simpler cleaner configuration it would be better. I want the minimalistic approach first and then build on it.: With this config I am getting the error: SEVERE: Unable to deploy node [queue: null] DLQ javax.naming.NoInitialContextException: Need to specify class name in environment or system property, or as an applet parameter, or in an application resource file: java.naming.factory.initial at javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getInitialContext(NamingManager.java:645) at javax.naming.InitialContext.getDefaultInitCtx(InitialContext.java:288) ... 29-Dec-2010 18:16:34 org.hornetq.core.logging.impl.JULLogDelegate error SEVERE: Unable to deploy node [queue: null] ExpiryQueue javax.naming.NoInitialContextException: Need to specify class name in environment or system property, or as an applet parameter, or in an application resource file: java.naming.factory.initial at javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getInitialContext(NamingManager.java:645) ... 9-Dec-2010 18:16:34 org.hornetq.core.logging.impl.JULLogDelegate error SEVERE: Unable to deploy node [queue: null] ExampleQueue javax.naming.NoInitialContextException: Need to specify class name in environment or system property, or as an applet parameter, or in an application resource file: java.naming.factory.initial at javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getInitialContext(NamingManager.java:645) at javax.naming.InitialContext.getDefaultInitCtx(InitialContext.java:288) at javax.naming.InitialContext.getURLOrDefaultInitCtx(InitialContext.java:325) Its must be something obvious related to JNDI, but I would appreciate the proper minimalistic configuration to start with and then expand on it afterwards. The HornetQ configuration files are the default ones that come with the distribution (default queues, default users etc.)
