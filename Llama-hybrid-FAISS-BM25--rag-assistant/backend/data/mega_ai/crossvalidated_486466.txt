A Robust Technique to Detect Outliers from Time Series Data

I want to extract outliers from time series data which contains faulty values. I want to filter out outliers from stock prices. I have around 14,000 such timeseries and I can't analyse them manually. I need a robust technique that would do this task. What statistical methods can be used to detect outliers apart from IQR and Percentiles?
