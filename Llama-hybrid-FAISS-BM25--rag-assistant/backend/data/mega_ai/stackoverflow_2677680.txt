HTML5 drag and drop API is available in the bleeding-edge browsers like the others said. Google Gears (a "plugin") can add the drag'n'drop functionality (I know Google Wave used gears at least in the Google Wave dev preview) for older browsers (FF and IE). Note that gears will not be supported forever
