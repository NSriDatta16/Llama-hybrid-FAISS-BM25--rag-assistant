NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. Programming language source code are synthetic (or unnatural) languages. Thus, NLP tools are not useful for processing programming language source code. Understanding programming language source code is done by the compiler or interpreter. Compilers and interpreters perform many functions, including lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic analysis. For Python language, language analysis is relatively straightforward since the main Python implementation, named CPython, compiles Python programs into intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the virtual machine. The dis module supports the analysis of CPython bytecode by disassembling it.
