This is a bit off-topic but you seem to be new to threading - for one thing, only lock where threads can overlap. Then, try to minimize those places. Also, instead of trying to lock every method, think of what the thread is doing (overall) with an object and make that a single call, and lock that. Try to get your locks as high up as possible (this again increases efficiency and may /help/ to avoid deadlocking). But locks don't 'compose', you have to mentally at least cross-organize your code by where the threads are and overlap.
