Determining whether or not a new observation in a time series is significantly different from past observations

Edit: The question is whether or not this methodology is valid, assuming both underlying distributions are normal. Data: A time series of difference data (e.g. Distribution 1 value - Distribution 2 value), where higher values are better. Goal: To determine if a newly observed difference is significantly higher or lower than the 30 period moving average trend. Method: Compute the mean and sample standard deviation of the past 30 observed differences, and do a simple z-test of significance on the new data point (I compare the out of sample number to the mean and variance of the past data). This also gives me a time series of the z-scores. Problem: I feel that this is too simple a solution and that I'm missing something important (e.g. I think by doing this I've assumed that the two underlying distributions are normal and that I can sum them to create a new normal distribution).
