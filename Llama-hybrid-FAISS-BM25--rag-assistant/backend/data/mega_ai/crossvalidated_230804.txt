There's a much easier way to run LDA now. Chetan Ganjihal wrote a wrapper to vw --lda that does all the heavy lifting users usually have to deal with to use vw for LDA. You may feed this script with a list of files or a directory tree from the command line and it will run vw --lda plus do all needed pre and post processing to find LDA topics from these files. Check out vw-lda in the source tree Please note that you also need to have the vw-doc2lda utility in your PATH for it to work.
