how to do 'sanity check' for a projection matrix?

I have a PCA model in production. I take the 5 eigen vector which correspond to the 5 largest eigen values. Imaging the input data is 200 dimension, there will be a 5x200 matrix $V$ that project the raw data into eigen-space; after that, we project the low dimension 'feature' vector back to the 200 dimension raw space with $V^{T}$ Put together, the projection matrix is $V^{T}V$, which is 200x200 square now here comes the question: if I need to generate such a matrix every day, how can I do sanity check on the projection matrix? Since the input samples are quite similar, this projection should not vary too much on daily basis. Therefore, I want to make sure that this matrix won't suddenly change a lot --- this is what I mean by 'sanity check' I tried to plot a 'heatmap' out of the matrix, but it does not really tell much --- a 'top view' always shows the same thing. What I am now using is the max min value of all the numbers in the matrix, but I feel it is not enough Is there any other thing that I should be looking at? determinant ? trace? any suggestions?
