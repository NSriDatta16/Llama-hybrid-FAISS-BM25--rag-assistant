C# Storage of User Entered Data

I'm trying to write a C# program, where when a user enters some data into a text box and clicks on a "save" button, the information is stored in some sort of file that when the program is opened the next time around, the information is automatically loaded in. I'm using Visual C# express. What's the best way to do this without requiring some sort of database like MySQL or MSSQL or Access? If the only way or easiest way is a database, I'd rather use Access. If so, does the user of the program need Access installed for my program to run on their computer? What if I go with another database? p.s. I forgot to mention, I'd rather the user not be able to access this file and read the contents easily. Text file without encryption would be easy to open. Any way to encrypt this? Also, if I use a delimiter like ':', then that means the user cannot use that character. So any other way? Thanks!
