The appropriate method for your situation is multinomial logistic regression . This is because your response variable is categorical, with more than two categories. MLR is a generalization of logistic regression, with which you are probably familiar (if not, my answer here: difference-between-logit-and-probit-models may be helpful, although it was written in a different context). A nice discussion of MLR on CV can be found here: interpreting-expb-in-multinomial-logistic-regression . For books, I would recommend the works by Agresti. He has put out a rigorous treatment of the subject ( Categorical Data Analysis ), and an introductory version . For a quick guide to get you to the point where you can run a MLR, you may want to peruse the UCLA stats help pages .
