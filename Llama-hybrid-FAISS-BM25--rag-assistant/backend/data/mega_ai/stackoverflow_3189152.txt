You didn't tell us much about the platform, where you run this example, but in any case such a dramatic slowdown when you are using optimizing flags looks very weird. You might have a measurement problem, but here also we can only speculate, since you didn't show us your TIME_THIS macro. In any case such measurements as you present them can not be very conclusive, since you may have all kinds of side-effects if you run each of your functions only once and always in the same order. To be conclusive, you should run the functions a few times without measuring and then in a loop in random order, accumulating the times and averaging at the end. And yes, as others stated, first look into the assembler to see if there is some weirdness.
