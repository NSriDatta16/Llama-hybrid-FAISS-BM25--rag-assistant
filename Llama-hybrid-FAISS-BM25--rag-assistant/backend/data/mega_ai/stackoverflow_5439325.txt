The expression SoftwarePassionView.this only makes sense if the code in the example snippet is found in a non-static inner / nested class, and one of the enclosing classes is SoftwarePassionView . It says "give me the enclosing SoftwarePassionView instance ". If this code is not in that context, (as the compiler error would indicate), you need to replace the expression with a normal variable name, or method call that gives a reference to some SoftwarePassionView object. For the record, here is an example where SoftwarePassionView.this wouldn't be a compilation error: public class SoftwarePassionView { public class Inner { ... public void doIt() { Thread thread = new Thread(null, vieworders, "MagentoBackground"); thread.start(); m_progressDialog = ProgressDialog.show(SoftwarePassionView.this, "Please wait...", "Retrieving data...", true); } } }
