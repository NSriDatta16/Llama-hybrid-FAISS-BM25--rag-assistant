Help with improveProb function in Hmisc in R

Please bear with me, I am very new to R. My question is regarding the use of the improveProb function in the Hmisc package. I have two logistic models, the only difference being that the second model contains my novel marker of interest. I am trying to calculate NRI and IDI. I have the PredRisks for both models - PredRisk1 and PredRisk2, and my outcome is disease 0/1. How do I define this in R in order to run improveProb(x1, x2, y) ? The data are the same for both models. We are looking at ways to validate our findings. We have performed k-fold cross-validation (MSE=0.08) and bootstrapping with optimism (AUC original = 0.826 After correction =0.791) to check for overfitting. Is this appropriate? The LRT was significant for both logistic regression models, but I need to check this. Also, the AIC for model 2 is lower than model 1. Thanks again for your expert knowledge :)
