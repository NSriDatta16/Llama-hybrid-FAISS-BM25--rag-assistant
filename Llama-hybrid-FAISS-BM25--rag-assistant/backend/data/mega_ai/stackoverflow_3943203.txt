jquery : find the element below one element

I am creating a simple application using jquery, in this application I can drag an element(DIV) along the document. I can place the DIV at any position in the document, If I place this DIV above another element how can I find out what is the ID of the element that is below the dragging object, for example if I place the dragging DIV over an element I want to know the ID of the element below the dragging DIV Thanks a log
