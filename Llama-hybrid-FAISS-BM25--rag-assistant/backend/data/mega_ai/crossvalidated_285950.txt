Learning an Infinite Vector

I am trying to solve the following problem: Choose $(a_1, a_2 , a_3 \dots)$ (this is an infinite sequence) in such a way that $$ \frac{2|a_3|^p + |a_1 + a_2 + a_4|^p + \sum_{j=2}^{\infty}|a_j + a_{j+2}|^p }{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|a_j|^p} $$ can come close to $3$ with arbitrary precision $\epsilon$ and so that $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|a_j|^p What work and algorithms in machine learning might help me solve this problem?
