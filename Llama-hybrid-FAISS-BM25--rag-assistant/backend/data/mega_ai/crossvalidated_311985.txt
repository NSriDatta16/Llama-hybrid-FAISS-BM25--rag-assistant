There are many options to increase the performance of your model. You should not mix pre-processing and training/validating/testing a ML model! In my experience, when it comes to NLP, pre-processing is key. I am no expert in Russian, but there are frameworks that help you to lemmatize/stem your texts ( NLTK with snowball ). Apart from pre-processing, you have the following options on the ML side: Try different algorithms: SVM, tree-based algorithms, neural nets (your data set might be too small), ensembles (boosting or bagging). In my experience, ensembles work pretty well. Don't Overfit though (maybe read this )! perform a parameter optimization Try to pre-train your model on other public available, comparable data sets (might be difficult in your case) Also remember: if you have a highly class-imbalanced data set, accuracy is not a good performance metric. Try e.g. F1-Score... Hope i could help.
