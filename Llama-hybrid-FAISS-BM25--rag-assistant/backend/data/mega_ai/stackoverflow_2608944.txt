Simple explanation on artificial neural networks?

I've Googled, StackOverflowed, everything, and I cannot seem to find a tutorial I can understand. I understand the concept of genetic algorithms, and how to implement them, (Though I haven't tried) but I cannot grasp the concept of neural networks. I know vaguely how they work... And that's about it. Could someone give an explanation that can help someone who has not even graduated middle school yet?
