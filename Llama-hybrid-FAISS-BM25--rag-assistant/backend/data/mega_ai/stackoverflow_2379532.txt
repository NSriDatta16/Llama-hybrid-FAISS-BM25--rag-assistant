How to put variable value inside value of resource file

I have been working with resource files for a while now and I was wondering if there is some nifty way I don't know of yet to put variables inside a resource value. A simple example: You have bought #amountOfBooksBought books. My current way of working would be to declare two resource values (for 2 labels): BoughtBooksAmountPreTextLabel.Text : "You have bought " BoughtBooksAmountPostTextLabel.Text : " books." Inbetween the two labels with this text, there would be a label named BoughtBooksAmountValueLabel which contains the amount of books bought. Is there a more elegant solution to this or is this just it?
