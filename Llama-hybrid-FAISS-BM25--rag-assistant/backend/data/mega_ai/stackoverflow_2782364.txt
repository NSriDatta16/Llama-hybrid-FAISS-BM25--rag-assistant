Yes, machine learning research is now dominated by researchers trying to solve the classification problem: given positive/negative examples in an n-dimensional space, what is the best n-dimensional shape that captures the positive ones. Another approach is taken by case-based reasoning (or case-based learning) where deduction is used alongside induction. The idea is that your program starts with a lot of knowledge about the world (say, it understands Newtonian physics) and then you show it some positive examples of the desired behavior (say, here is how the robot should kick the ball under these circumstances) then the program uses these together to extrapolate the desired behavior to all circumstances. Sort of...
