I'd recommend a combination of libsndfile and libsamplerate http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC SRC provides a small set of converters to allow quality to be traded off against computation cost. The current best converter provides a signal-to-noise ratio of 145dB with -3dB passband extending from DC to 96% of the theoretical best bandwidth for a given pair of input and output sample rates. http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ Ability to read and write a large number of file formats. A simple, elegant and easy to use Applications Programming Interface. Usable on Unix, Win32, MacOS and others. On the fly format conversion, including endian-ness swapping, type conversion and bitwidth scaling. Optional normalisation when reading floating point data from files containing integer data. Ability to open files in read/write mode. The ability to write the file header without closing the file (only on files open for write or read/write). Ability to query the library about all supported formats and retrieve text strings describing each format.
