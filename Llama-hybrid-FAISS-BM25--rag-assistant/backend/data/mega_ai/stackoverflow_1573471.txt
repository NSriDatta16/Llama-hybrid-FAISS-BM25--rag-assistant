I don't know about TextBlocks, but here is how you would do it in a RichTextBox. You could use a RichTextBox instead of a TextBlock. RichTextBox rtbTest = new RichTextBox(); rtbTest.IsDocumentEnabled = true; FlowDocument fd = new FlowDocument(); Paragraph para = new Paragraph(); Run r4 = new Run("Some Text To Show As Hyperlink"); Hyperlink h4 = new Hyperlink(r4); h4.Foreground = Brushes.Red; //whatever color you want the HyperLink to be // If you want the Hyperlink clickable h4.NavigateUri = new Uri("Some URL"); h4.RequestNavigate += new RequestNavigateEventHandler(h_RequestNavigate); // Leaving the two previous lines out will still make the Hyperlink, but it won't be clickable // use this if you don't want an underline under the HyperLink h4.TextDecorations = null; para.Inlines.Add(h4); fd.Blocks.Add(para); rtbTest.Document = fd; For normal text, I just used the HyperLink, but removed the two lines that made it clickable. This would give the text the color, but it wouldn't be clickable. Though it still makes the cursor change still. Though I am sure there is a property to change that also.
