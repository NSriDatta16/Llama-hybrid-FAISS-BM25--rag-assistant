We all missed it! Sorry guys and thanks for all your help but I just figured. If you pay attention to the RemoveAll() method you will see that IÂ´m trying to delete the "q" object which is not an entity, but a IQueriable instead of passing "employee". It was lack of attention. The right code would be: public void RemoveAll() { var q = from employee in _session.Linq() select employee; var p = q.ToList(); foreach (var employee in p) { _session.Delete(employee); } }
