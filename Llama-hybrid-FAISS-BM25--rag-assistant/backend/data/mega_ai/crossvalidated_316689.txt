How to evaluate deterministic vs stochastic components of a time series?

Suppose we are working with a real data set , say in R. What are the approaches/methods for determining underlying structure. That is, How can we separate stochastic components vs deterministic? Can we use state space modelling, and if so, how to best implement in R? Thank you all for any advice.
