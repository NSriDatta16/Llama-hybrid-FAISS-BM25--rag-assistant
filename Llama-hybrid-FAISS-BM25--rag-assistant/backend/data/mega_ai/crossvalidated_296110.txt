Machine Learning model on dataset with mainly zeros

I have a text field dataset. Each observation counts the number of appearances of that particular word, and the columns (variables) are most frequently appeared words. Within each column, zeros dominates with a percentage of over 90%. I have a binary response variable that I am predicting. So far, CART and neural network methods failed, and they always predict way too many 1s than 0s, and sometimes even don't predict any zeros. What methods/other models should I use to improve the accuracy?
