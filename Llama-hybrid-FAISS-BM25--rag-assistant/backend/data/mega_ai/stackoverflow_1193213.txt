How fine grained should modules in Prism be?

I am currently working on a project of mine using Prism (the Composite Application Library/Guidance). The application will be a specialized MSPaint-like application for basketball (predefined objects for balls, players etc.). Now I am wondering how to go about organizing my application into Prism modules. Especially when thinking about the drawing part of the software. Should I split the general drawing view (2 columns: toolbox, canvas) in 2 modules (toolbox and canvas) or would the overhead created by the constant communication of these modules be too overwhelming? How fine grained should Prism modules really be? Thanks in advance and best regards, crischu
