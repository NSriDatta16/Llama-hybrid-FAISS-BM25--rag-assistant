I am a fan of embedded DSLs, a la http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/using-vs2010-to-edit-f-source-code-and-a-little-logo-edsl/ http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/fun-with-turtle-graphics-in-f/ where you just use leverage F# syntax with some good function names and possibly other syntax cleverness (lists, workflows, ...) to get code that "looks like maybe it is another language" but is actually just F#. But yes, for external DSLs, you just need a grammar/parser/etc tool chain, and either FsLex/FsYacc, or maybe ANTLR or FParsec are various choices. (I don't have enough experience with any of these to know trade-offs among them.)
