Inconclusive test is a test for which you cannot determine the result. For example, what if you had a test that uses some kind of an external resource (Internet connection, for example). If the connection is currently not available, this doesn't really mean the test is a failure. On the other hand, you shouldn't just mark it as successful without actually running it through. So you mark it as inconclusive and this can be seen in the test report. NOTE: In general, you shouldn't use such external resources in your tests, since this can make the tests fragile. For tests that haven't been finished yet, I use MbUnit's Explicit attribute.
