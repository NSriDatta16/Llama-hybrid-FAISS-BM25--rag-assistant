Deep Learning Project to Predict Stock Prices

So I have a background in computer programming and a little in machine learning in general. What I would like to do is create a fun project in A.I. with deep learning. I have a dataset that has a whole bunch of stock prices at a certain date, with a bunch of features for each entry to go with it. I also have some "experts" who made predictions on whether the stock will go up or down. As my dataset grows I can evolve the game to make selections from multiple stocks...etc Essentially what I would love to do is create an A.I. app that will be fed the same data that the "experts" had and see if I can create something more accurate and beat them at it. Is this a viable approach?
