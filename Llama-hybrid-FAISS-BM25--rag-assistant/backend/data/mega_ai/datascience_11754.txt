In plain English, how to descibe i/o of the TensorFlow for language modelling?

I have followed the tutorial here about language modelling using Tensorflow to create LSTM and used PTB dataset. The code is here I failed to understnad the exact specific input and the output of the model. My question is: how many words do you feed to the model and how many words do you expect at the end? How the data processing happens? For example: if I have the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.". This will be turned into vectors using word2vec. Then how are these given to the NN?
