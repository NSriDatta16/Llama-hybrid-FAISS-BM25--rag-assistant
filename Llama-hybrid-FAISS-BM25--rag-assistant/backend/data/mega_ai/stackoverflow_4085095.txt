If you really need to do this on MySQL-side you can create stored procedure (or stored function) in which: create temporary table (because MySQL's stored routines can't handle arrays, so you have to use temporary table as an array) create WHILE cycle to parse your strings using LOCATE() , LEFT() and RIGHT() functions ( MySQL Manual: String functions ) inserting every value in temporary table perform needed select (with intersections and so on) from this temporary table But this solution is really far from being elegant. Storing tags in separate table (as mentioned above, one tag per row) is much more preferable.
