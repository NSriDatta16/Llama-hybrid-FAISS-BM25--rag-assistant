Two identical pieces of jQuery behaving differently

I have a PHP loop that outputs a bunch of links, then each link has a href='javascript:$(\"#rnn\").val(" . $foo . ");$(\"#rnnNotifUnsub\").submit();' What is it supposed to do is to pass a certain piece of info pertaining to that link, over to a hidden input in #rnnNotifUnsub. However, it doesn't even submit when I try it out. I tried running the code without passing the variable to the hidden input and it submitted but of course didn't do anything. That means my problem lies in $(\"#rnn\").val(" . $foo . "); messing up the code. Here's my form, just in case: " name="url"/> I have an identical set of code for an identical form, just with different names, and that works perfectly. Although that passes a int as a variable rather than a string to the hidden input. Perhaps that's the problem?
