how do i get system stats in PHP

i am launching a beta version of a web app and i want to log system information about resources. system monitors eat up way too much resources and do a lot more than what i need. What i want to do is get key stats and log them every time a user logs in. these are the stats i am interested in: number of users - i have done this already system 5 min and 15 min loads - php's get load average outgoing bandwidth on eth0 - ???? free memory - ???? so how do i get outgoing traffic and free memory statistics?
