Panel data: dealing with lagging and binary dependent variable with plm

I am attempting to run a pooled logistic regression with panel data and a binary dependent variable. Since I wanted to lag some of the variables, I used the plm package to create them. When I tried to do it other ways, I ran into problems. I can't use lag or embed, because it is panel data. hybridsubsidies I wanted to put all the variables into the original data frame (hybridsubsidies) before I ran the pooled analysis. I'm pretty sure I don't need to, but I'm a visual person, and would like to verify the format of the data is appropriate before running any analysis. From the output below, it looks like everything is done correctly. head(lag(hybridsubsidies$eespending,1)) ALABAMA-1999 ALABAMA-2000 ALABAMA-2001 ALABAMA-2002 ALABAMA-2003 ALABAMA-2004 NA 58294 55378 26982 28264 2566 head(hybridsubsidies$eespending) ALABAMA-1999 ALABAMA-2000 ALABAMA-2001 ALABAMA-2002 ALABAMA-2003 ALABAMA-2004 58294 55378 26982 28264 2566 26906 My problem is that when I try and assign this lag variable as a vector in the data frame, this way, hybridsubsidies$lagee it does so(when I call the names in the dataframe, they are included), but then I can no longer view the dataframe. R says to me: Error in edit.data.frame(get(subx, envir = parent), title = subx, ...) : can only handle vector and factor elements How can I solve this so that I can view the data frame before I run the analysis? I want to look at it, since it looks like I will have to use glm instead of plm (pooling) for this analysis since the dependent variable is a binary variable and plm does not support these d.v.'s This has been giving me problems for awhile now. col1 ST YR EELAG EE [1,] 1 1 NA 58294 [2,] 1 2 58294 55378 [3,] 1 3 55378 26982 [4,] 1 4 26982 28264 [5,] 1 5 28264 2566 [6,] 1 6 2566 26906 [7,] 1 7 26906 29466 [8,] 2 1 NA 355 [9,] 2 2 355 259 [10,] 2 3 259 224 [11,] 2 4 224 217 [12,] 2 5 217 241 [13,] 2 6 241 231 [14,] 2 7 231 231 [15,] 3 1 NA 5111 [16,] 3 2 5111 3753 [17,] 3 3 3753 2211 [18,] 3 4 2211 1452 [19,] 3 5 1452 2913 [20,] 3 6 2913 3128 [21,] 3 7 3128 7132 [22,] 4 1 NA 1597 [23,] 4 2 1597 905
