ing a quantum speedup of the deliberation time of reinforcement learning agents employing internal quantum hardware. In March 2021, a team of researchers from Austria, The Netherlands, the US and Germany reported the experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup of the learning time of reinforcement learning agents interacting fully quantumly with the environment. The relevant degrees of freedom of both agent and environment were realized on a compact and fully tunable integrated nanophotonic processor. Breakthrough Solutions to Barren Plateaus The barren plateau problem [1] where quantum algorithms encounter flat optimization landscapesâ€”has seen significant theoretical and practical advances in 2025. Los Alamos National Laboratory researchers have provided the first mathematical characterization of why and when barren plateaus occur in variational quantum algorithms, establishing theoretical guarantees for algorithm scalability. This work solves a key usability problem for quantum machine learning by providing rigorous theorems that predict whether a given architecture will remain trainable as it scales to larger quantum systems. The breakthrough eliminates the previous trial-and-error approach that had led to researcher fatigue in the field. Skepticism While machine learning itself is now not only a research field but an economically significant and fast growing industry and quantum computing is a well established field of both theoretical and experimental research, QML remains a purely theoretical field of studies. Attempts to experimentally demonstrate concepts of QML remain insufficient. Further, another obstacle exists at the prediction stage because the outputs of quantum learning models are inherently random. This creates an often considerable overhead, as many executions of a quantum learning model have to be aggregated to obtain an actual prediction. Many of the leading scientists that extensively publish in the field of QML warn about the extensive hype around the topic and are very restrained if asked about its practical uses in the foreseeable future. Sophia Chen collected some of the statements made by well known scientists in the field: "I think we haven't done our homework yet. This is an extremely new scientific field," - physicist Maria Schuld of Canada-based quantum computing startup Xanadu. "When mixing machine learning with 'quantum,' you catalyse a hype-condensate." - Jacob Biamonte a contributor to the theory of quantum computation. "There is a lot more work that needs to be done before claiming quantum machine learning will actually work," - computer scientist Iordanis Kerenidis, the head of quantum algorithms at the Silicon Valley-based quantum computing startup QC Ware. "I have not seen a single piece of evidence that there exists a meaningful [machine learning] task for which it would make sense to use a quantum computer and not a classical computer," - physicist Ryan Sweke of the Free University of Berlin in Germany. "Don't fall for the hype!" - Frank Zickert, who is the author of probably the most practical book related to the subject beware that "quantum computers are far away from advancing machine learning for their representation ability", and even speaking about evaluation and optimization for any kind of useful task quantum supremacy is not yet achieved. Furthermore, nobody among the active researchers in the field make any forecasts about when it could possibly become practical.
