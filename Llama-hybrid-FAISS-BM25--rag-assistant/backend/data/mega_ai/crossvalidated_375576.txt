I suspect what Fox et al 2005 refers to is Bartlett 1946 which is a more "general" form of the AR1-based variance estimator (Bartlett 1935). Bartlett 1946's estimator was later adapted for bivariate time series by Quenouille 1947 as a DoF estimator. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two time series of length $N$ where $\rho_{XX,k}$ and $\rho_{YY,k}$ are the autocorrelation coefficients of $X$ and $Y$ , respectively, on lag $k$ . Then Quenouille 1947 found the effective DoF to be $$ \hat{N} = N \left(\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} {\rho}_{XX,k} {\rho}_{YY,k}\right)^{-1}, $$ while Bayley & Hammersley 1946 found, $$ \hat{N} = N\Big(1+2\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\frac{(N-k)}{N}\rho_{XX,k}{\rho}_{YY,k}\Big)^{-1}. $$ There are many approximations of Bartlett's original estimator. One nice review of these variants can be found in Pyper and Peterman 1998. It is however very important to note that all above estimators assume $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated ( $\rho = 0$ , which in neuroimaging is far from reality). The problem is that once the assumption is violated, these estimators remarkably overestimate the variance due to a confounding of autocorrelation and crosscorrelation, a phenomena also known as statistical aliasing; see Appendix D of Afyouni et al 2018. So: No correction over-estimates DoF (underestimates variance) and the above corrections under-estimates DoF (overestimates variance). What can be done? See the estimator has recently been proposed in Afyouni et al 2018, \begin{equation} \begin{split} \mathbb{V}({\hat\rho})&=N^{-2}\left[\vphantom{\sum_k^M}(N-1)(1-\rho^2)^2 \right. \\ &\quad +\rho^2 \sum_k^M w_k (\rho_{XX,k}^2 + \rho_{YY,k}^2 + \rho_{XY,k}^2 + \rho_{XY,-k}^2)\\ &\quad -2 \rho \sum_k^M w_k (\rho_{XX,k} + \rho_{YY,k}) (\rho_{XY,k} + \rho_{XY,-k}) \\ &\quad +2 \left.\sum_k^M w_k (\rho_{XX,k}\rho_{YY,k}+\rho_{XY,k}\rho_{XY,-k}) \right], \end{split} \label{Eq:fastMEIntro} \end{equation} where $w_i=N-2-k$ . While this is an involved expression, we show that -- with sensible regularisation of the autocorrelation and crosscorrelation function -- this gives accurate DoF / variance estimates over a range of settings.
