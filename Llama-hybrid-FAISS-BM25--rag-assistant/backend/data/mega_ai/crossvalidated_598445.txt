Logistic regression with two slopes and one intercept

I am using R to fit a logistic model to some data. The problem is as follows: "The effects of the dose of poison $(x)$ , in milligrammes, and the method of delivery $(w)$ on the probability of survival were examined in a study of rats. The two methods of delivery were as a solid with food or as a liquid in water. For each combination of dose and method of delivery, a certain number of rats $(r)$ were used and the number who survived $(y)$ is recorded. Below are the data. Now when I plot these data, it looks like a model that has a different slope for each delivery method but the same intercept would be suitable: How would I tell R to do this? I know that to fit a model with different intercepts but the same slope is "glm(p~x+w,...)" and to fit a model with two slopes and two intercepts is "glm(p~x+w+x:w,...)" but can't figure out the case for different slopes and the same intercept.
