For temporary local storage of large amounts of data a memory mapped file is usually a good idea. It hands over the memory management responsibility to Windows which knows best how to do it. If you don't specify a file it will map into the paging file and never go to the physical disk unless it becomes necessary. If you are using .NET 4.0 you got a managed API to memory mapped files.
