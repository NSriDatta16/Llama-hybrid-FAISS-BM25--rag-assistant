If you really want a colleague to avoid putting too much trust in a point estimate, then you can report a confidence interval or credible interval first, and save the point estimate for later (or skip it altogether). Similarly, if you want to express the amount of uncertainty that surrounds a certain method of measuring some characteristic or of collecting or processing data, you can present alternate methods side by side. Those who might be inclined just to size up the key fact on a given topic will be struck by the lack of any one key fact to seize upon. This will likely result in a) more nuanced consideration of the complexities you seek to present, b) impatient calls for a simpler presentation (which you can try to turn around towards [a])*, or c) delegation of the issue, leaving it up to those who are willing to struggle with the complexities. As to the "how does one decide" question, this is probably too broad for any single answer, and doesn't likely have any answer that the community would judge as correct. *Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but no simpler.
