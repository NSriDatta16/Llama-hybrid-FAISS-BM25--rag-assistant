A Markov chain {Xn, n ≥ 0} with states 1, 2,3 has the transition probability matrix with an initial distribution (1/2,0,1/2), what is P(X1=3|X2=1)

A Markov chain {Xn, n ≥ 0} with states 1, 2,3 has the transition probability matrix P \begin{bmatrix}0&0.4&0.6\\1&0&0\\0.3&0.3&0.4\end{bmatrix} with an initial distribution A (0.5,0,0.5), what is $$P(X_1=3|X_2=1)$$ ? (I know a Markov chain property is the future, given the present, is independent of the past. the question here look like given future, what is the probability of the past? I am wondering $$P(X_1=3|X_2=1)=P(X_1=3)=A_3=0.5$$ or $$P(X_1=3|X_2=1)=P_{13}=0.6$$ or else?
