Let's assume non-linear regression means non-linear least squares which is a common way of measuring pharmacokinetic curves. That is the intent of the package "drc" which has been renamed "drm". However this is not the right methodology to measure fatality. Pharmacokinetic curves predicts the concentration of drug, or it's conjugates or metabolites, in the right medium (blood, urine) as a function of time and/or subject characteristics. They typically require multiple measurements over time, multiple administrations of drug (possibly at several levels), and the resulting curves may be "fed forward" in a heirarchy or network to predict, e.g. symptom resolution, tumor response, or death. If you are administering one-and-done dosing with no in-vivo markers of drug activity like repeated biospecimen sampling, a typical failure analysis will be the right way to go. You should plot the survival curves of the species using a stratified Kaplan-Meier curve and test either with a parametric survival or Cox-model / log-rank test. These confer more power than a simple logistic regression because we additionally consider the time until death.
