Custom definition of likelihood in bayesian framework

I'm reading Trifinov et al. (2013) and I am trying to understand why likelihood is defined in a certain way. In particular, the definition of likelihood is given by: A lesion $M$ is a result of a random process with a given distribution $P^m(M)$ , which specifies the probability of occurrence of the lesion $M $ due to $m$ utation. [...] we define first the likelihood that a lesion $M$ is a driver lesion given that $D$ is a driver gene as $$L(M|D) \quad \underline{deff} \quad P^m(M)·δ(D ∈ M)$$ where $δ(D ∈ M)$ is $1$ if the lesion $M$ includes the gene $D$ and $0$ otherwise This is defined as the likelihood, i.e. the probability of data under the hypothesis. However, I am unable to map the definition of likelihood to the actual problem, i.e. the lesion $M$ is a driver lesion given that $D$ is a driver gene. If I understood correctly the definition, there would be no need for the first term of the definition, i.e. $P^m(M)$ , since the indicator function will suffice. This because, if $D$ is in $M$ , the $M$ lesion is a driver lesion, $0$ otherwise. Could you point me to a way, or a reading, to understand how to map the definition and to understand if the actual definition captures the hypothesis it wants to test? Trifonov, Vladimir, et al.
