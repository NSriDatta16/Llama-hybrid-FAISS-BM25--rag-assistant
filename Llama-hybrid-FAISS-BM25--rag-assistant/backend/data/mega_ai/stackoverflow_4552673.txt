Just to let everybody know: I managed to get GAE+Restlet+JSON+GWT working after much fiddling. The process was really chaotic (reminded me of days programing for the Win32): I was just changing settings until it started working. The problem that I was having is: It was serving the wrong representation (JSON, XML, GWT) to the wrong clients. Later it turned out that I had to pay attention to the order of methods inside the class. WTF?? I could not get it to work on sub-path, e.g. /rest/*. I'm not going to use Restlet for the following reasons (hint to authors): Documentation is scarce, inaccurate and sometimes contradictory (explaining thing in different ways in different parts of documentation). Configuration is not standard JAX-RS. I know they have an option to configure it as JAX-RS, but all examples in docs are not based on this. Since then I switched to Jersey .
