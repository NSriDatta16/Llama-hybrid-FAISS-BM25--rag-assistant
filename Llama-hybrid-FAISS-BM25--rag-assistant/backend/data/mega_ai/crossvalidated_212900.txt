We can solve this graphically. Only easy additions, multiplications, and divisions are required. Constructing the Markov Chain The question refers to just three faces of the die: the 1 , the 2 , and the 6 . At the outset, none of these faces has been rolled. Let's call this state S (for "start"). The relevant states that can be reached from it are S (with probability $4/6$), 1 , and 6 (each with probability $1/6$). Continue building the Markov chain by considering what can be reached from the new states that were encountered, 1 and 6 : From 1 , we may roll a 1 (staying in state 1 ), a 2 (ending the chain with the state 12 , which is one of the states we are looking for), a 6 (thereby moving into state 6 ), or back to S otherwise. The chances are all $1/6$ for the first three moves, leaving a remainder $1-3\times 1/6=1/2$ for the chance of returning to S . From 6 , we may enter states 1 , 66 , or S with chances $1/6$, $1/6$, and (therefore) $2/3$, respectively. The only new states to be considered are the terminal states 12 and 66 . Thus, we have generated all the states of the chain (and computed their transition probabilities when we did so). Here is a graphical picture showing the states as nodes and the transitions as directed edges (or "pipes"), labeled by their probabilities. Solving by Means of Graphical Reduction Probability flows like a conserved fluid through this pipeline. (This is merely an intuitive way to restate the axioms of probability.) Ultimately we want to know what fraction of the fluid entering at point S will make it to 12 (and the remaining fraction will make it to 66 ). All we need to do is keep track of it. I will show how to do so by eliminating intermediate points and combining redundant pipes until the diagram is so simple we can read the answer directly from it. We may eliminate the node S by noting that any "probability fluid" there will stick around for awhile (undergoing S to S transitions) but eventually will end up in either state 1 or state 6 . The relative probabilities of those are the relative chances of the transitions, $1/6$ divided by $1/6+1/6$: each equals $1/2$. Thus, if we make a transition from 1 to S (which occurs with chance $3/6$), then half the time we will wind up right back at 1 and the other half of the time we will end at 6 . Similar considerations cause two new pipes to be constructed in place of S to carry probability from 6 to 1 and 6 back to itself. These four new pipes are shown with dotted lines at the left of the next figure. We may combine the probability flows between any two nodes that occur in multiple pipes: replace them by a single pipe with the sum of the flows. This is shown at the right. As a reminder of where the numbers originate, I haven't completely done all the arithmetic. The same idea applies to the self-transitions at nodes 1 and 6 . For instance, any probability that reaches 1 will stay around at 1 for awhile, but eventually some of it will flow to node 6 and some of it will go to 12 . The relative proportions are $1/6+3/12=5/12$ to node 6 and $1/6$ to node 12 , in proportions $5:2$. After also eliminating the 6 to 6 transition we obtain this diagram: At this juncture we may split the diagram into two parts, again by eliminating round trips. Starting at node 1 , we may ask what proportion of the probability ends at 12 . The graph shows that either the probability flows directly to 12 , or else it flows to 6 , at which point $3/4$ of it promptly returns. The remaining $1/4$ will end up forever at 66 . After applying the same reasoning to node 6 , to determine what proportion of its probability ends up at 66 , we obtain these two separate partial graphs: Finally eliminating the self-transitions as before, we literally see the following: The flows with rates $2/7$ and $1/4\times 5/7$ out of 1 are in proportion $8:5$. Thus, $8/(8+5)=8/13$ of the probability at 1 ends up at 12 . The remainder, $5/13$, must end up at 66 . The flows with rates $1/4$ and $2/7\times 3/4$ out of 6 are in proportion $7:6$, whence $7/13$ of the probability at 6 ends up at 66 and the remaining $6/13$ ends up at 12 . That's (obviously) as far as we can go in reducing the original graph. Recall, now, that all probability begins at S . When we eliminated it, we had to direct half the probability to 1 and half the probability to 6 . Accordingly, the proportion that ends up at 12 is half the proportion reaching 12 from 1 plus half the proportion reaching 66 from 6 : $$\Pr(\text{12 is final state}) = \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{8}{13} + \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{6}{13} = \frac{7}{13}.$$ This is the answer: there is a $7/13\approx 0.53846$ chance that 12 is encountered before 66 . (Either by carrying out a parallel calculation, or noting that eventually all the probability reaches either 12 or 66 , we conclude that $6/13$ of the time, 66 is the final state.) Comments Looking back at the original diagram of the Markov chain, we can now see why 12 is slightly favored. The graph is nearly symmetric (identifying 1 with 6 and 12 with 66 ), except that the self transition from 1 to 1 causes more probability to collect at, and reside in, node 1 . Consequently slightly more of it flows to 12 (which can only be reached via 1 ) than flows to 66 (which can only be reached via 6 ).
