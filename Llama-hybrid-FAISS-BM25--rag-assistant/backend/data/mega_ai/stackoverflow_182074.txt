One thing that I would look at is the model-view-view model pattern. It is a very elegant pattern which naturally separates everything into nice buckets ... including your xaml. For example, it helps you keep a clear boundary between the developer and the designer and even allows for test driven development. There is a whole bunch of info out there on it, but I would start with John Gossman's blog posts: http://blogs.msdn.com/johngossman/archive/2005/10/08/478683.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/johngossman/archive/2005/10/09/478894.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/johngossman/archive/2006/02/26/539598.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/johngossman/archive/2006/02/27/540304.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/johngossman/archive/2006/03/04/543695.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/johngossman/archive/2006/04/13/576163.aspx Update: Just want to point people to another StackOverflow post with lots of good info on M-V-VM in it.
