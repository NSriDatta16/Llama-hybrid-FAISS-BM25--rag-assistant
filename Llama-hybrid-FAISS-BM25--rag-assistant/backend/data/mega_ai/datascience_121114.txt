Deleting part of saved XGBoost-Model (JSON) and reloading it

I am training an XGBoost-model on part of the ForestCover-Dataset. Then I save the trained model to json. Now I load the model and "update" the saved model with the data, that I previously omitted in training, using the "xgb_model" parameter of the train-method. I also save this "updated model" to json. What XGBoost does here is it simply adds trees to the old model. What I want to do now is manipulate the updated model. My first idea was just to delete the "old part" of the model and see how only the new part does. So I manipulated the json-file and deleted the old trees, changed the tree_info parameter, changed the num_trees parameter and changed the IDs of all remaining trees to start at 0 again. Then I attempt to load this manipulated json-file as a new model. However, when trying to do so I get the following error: XGBoostError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[22], line 2 1 bst_test = xgb.Booster() ----> 2 bst_test.load_model("modified.json") File ~/personal/folder/lib/python3.10/site-packages/xgboost/core.py:2441, in Booster.load_model(self, fname) 2437 if isinstance(fname, (str, os.PathLike)): 2438 # assume file name, cannot use os.path.exist to check, file can be 2439 # from URL. 2440 fname = os.fspath(os.path.expanduser(fname)) -> 2441 _check_call(_LIB.XGBoosterLoadModel( 2442 self.handle, c_str(fname))) 2443 elif isinstance(fname, bytearray): 2444 buf = fname File ~/personal/folder/lib/python3.10/site-packages/xgboost/core.py:279, in _check_call(ret) 268 """Check the return value of C API call 269 270 This function will raise exception when error occurs.
