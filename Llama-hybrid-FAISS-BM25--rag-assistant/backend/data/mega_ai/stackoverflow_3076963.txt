It is highly unusual to mix structures containing Objective-C types with objects in Objective-C. While you can use NSValue to encapsulate the structure, doing so is fragile, difficult to maintain, and may not function correctly under GC. Instead, a simple class is often a better choice: @interface MyDataRecord:NSObject { int myRecordID; // don't use 'id' in Objective-C source NSString* picfile; NSString* mp3file; NSString* orgword; NSString* desword; NSString* category; } @property(nonatomic, copy) NSString *picfile; .... etc .... @end @implementation MyDataRecord @synthesize picfile, myRecordID, mp3file, orgword, desword, category; - (void) dealloc { self.picfile = nil; ... etc .... [super dealloc]; } @end This also makes it such that the moment you need to add business logic to said data record, you already have a convenient place to do so.
