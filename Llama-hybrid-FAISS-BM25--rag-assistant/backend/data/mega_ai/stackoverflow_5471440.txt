Expand the SQL Server Agent node and right click the Jobs node in SQL Server Agent and select 'New Job' In the 'New Job' window enter the name of the job and a description on the 'General' tab. Select 'Steps' on the left hand side of the window and click 'New' at the bottom. In the 'Steps' window enter a step name and select the database you want the query to run against. Paste in the T-SQL command you want to run into the Command window and click 'OK' . Click on the 'Schedule' menu on the left of the New Job window and enter the schedule information (e.g. daily and a time). Click 'OK' - and that should be it. (There are of course other options you can add - but I would say that is the bare minimum you need to get a job set up and scheduled)
