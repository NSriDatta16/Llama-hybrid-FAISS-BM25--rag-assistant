You don't need to write a program. The “Replace” tool is sufficient for this: Replace Y with [Y] (EDIT: see the comments below, because it's a little more complex than that indeed) Replace ^w with nothing ( ^w means whitespace ) Replace ^p with nothing ( ^p means paragraph markers ) EDIT: if you need a macro, just do the above once while recording a macro. EDIT: by applying the method discussed in the comments, I get the following VBA macro: Sub ProcessATCG() Selection.Find.ClearFormatting Selection.Find.Replacement.ClearFormatting With Selection.Find .Text = "([!ACGT^13^32])" .Replacement.Text = "[\1]" .Forward = True .Wrap = wdFindContinue .Format = False .MatchCase = False .MatchWholeWord = False .MatchAllWordForms = False .MatchSoundsLike = False .MatchWildcards = True End With Selection.Find.Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll With Selection.Find .Text = "[^13^32]" .Replacement.Text = "" .Forward = True .Wrap = wdFindContinue .Format = False .MatchCase = False .MatchWholeWord = False .MatchAllWordForms = False .MatchSoundsLike = False .MatchWildcards = True End With Selection.Find.Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll End Sub
