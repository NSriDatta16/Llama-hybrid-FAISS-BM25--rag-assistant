I'd grade you A, if you re-worded your hypo as "the die is biased against the marked side" because you're testing one sided hypo. The current wording is "the die is biased" allows for bias for the marked side, i.e. asks for a two sided hypo. For non symmetric distribution like binomial the two sided hypo is tricky. The average is $np=25/6$, so how would you construct the tails here? I'd stick with one sided and submit it with an appropriate wording of the hypo
