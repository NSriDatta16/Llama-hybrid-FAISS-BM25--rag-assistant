Two simple examples : A thousand scientists measure the height of one person a thousand times (one time / scientist), each with their own ruler and methodology. Now we know the height of this person veeeery well. The "true" average height of this person can be estimated with very low uncertainty. However, that does not gives us a lot of information about the "true" height mean of all the population this person is supposed to be from. Confidence interval can not even be estimated in this case. Hence the necessity, if one wants to be able to generalize, to get a sample of many randomly chosen people from this population. Better 1 measurement on 1000 individuals than 1000 measurements on 1 individual. Suppose I am interested in atmospheric CO2 concentration. There is only one planet so asking what is the true mean CO2 concentration in the population of atmospheres is silly. However we really wish, in this case, to know better of our one and unique atmosphere. So it is appropriate to measure 1000 times the concentration of CO2 in the same atmosphere. Although it would be wise to make each measurement in very different conditions so as to get a global perspective on this unique "individual". Or maybe the question asked is about the evolution of atmospheric CO2 content over time. We would then gain more knowledge by sampling the "same" volume of free atmosphere repeatedly over time. Take home message : it all depends on the question that is asked. If you have one individual only, don't make hypothesis about the population. But you can learn a lot about this individual ! And maybe add external knowledge / logic to argue in favour of the generalizability of this result. Asking the wrong question will almost inevitably lead to false degree of freedom => lower uncertainty estimate / anomalous p-values => false claims. That problem of asking the wrong level of question is called "pseudoreplication" and participate significantly in the reproducibility crisis of science in general...
