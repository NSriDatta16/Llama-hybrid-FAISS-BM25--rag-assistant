I think your permutation idea is solid. Assume there are only two measurements y1 and y2. Here's how I'd do it in R: set.seed(1245) group = abs(t1.stat)), "Permutation p-values - Var 2 ", mean(t2.collection >= abs(t2.stat)), "\n") The one thing that this doesn't cover is that you have prior beliefs about which variables are most likely to pop. Sounds like you'd need to go bayesian for that, and your model looks like a standard multivariate regression (all variables have the same single group regressor). Sometimes I wish I was a bayesian!
