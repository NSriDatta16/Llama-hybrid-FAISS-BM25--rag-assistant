Causal impact response time series

I am trying to analyze the effects of an online advertising campaign. The campaign was in market globally except for "Country A". In my response time series, I am using orders from all countries except "Country A". As one of my controls, I am using orders from "Country A" only. Is this the logically appropriate way to set up this analysis, or should the response variable include all orders, irrespective of country? (Note, I am using the CausalImpact library from R .)
