optimizers in deep learning

I'm new to the deep learning field and I've a question that I didn't get for it a clear answer or explanation in the course, I understand the tensors and the idea behind batches but I don't really get the concept of an optimizer like adam optimizer . why we are using them and for what , where is the purpose . By the way I'm learning pytorch.
