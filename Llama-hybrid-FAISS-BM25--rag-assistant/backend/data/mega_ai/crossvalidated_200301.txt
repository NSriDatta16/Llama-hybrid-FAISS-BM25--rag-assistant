It makes little sense to standardize dummy variables It cannot be increased by a standard deviation so the regular interpretation for standardized coefficients does not apply Moreover, the standard interpretation of the dummy variable, showing difference in average level of Y between two categories is lost Your interaction results could be interpreted as follows for: Among those who are females (sex dummy 1=female 0=male), 1 standard deviation point increase in age (standardized age, mean=0, std=1) has a positive/negative (significant / insignificant) effect of (exact value of the coefficient of the interaction term) on your dependent variable (Y-variable).
