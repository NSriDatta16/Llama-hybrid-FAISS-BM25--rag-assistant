The error Specified cast is not valid is encountered when one type cannot be directly cast to another. Usually, this mistake is made when the programmer thinks they have one type, but actually have another. Take for example a textbox which has been constrained to only accept numbers. A programmer might well read the value, and later on make the mistake of expecting it to be a number string myValue = myTextBox.Text; // later someComponent.ValueExpectingANumber = (int)myValue; // specified cast is not valid in the above example, the number would have to be "Parsed" rather than cast.
