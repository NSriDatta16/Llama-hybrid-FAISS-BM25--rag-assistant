Okay so in java you have three different types of access to a classes member functions and variables public protected package-private and private All classes in the same package can see each others public, protected, and package-private elements. Packages are not hierarchical in the system. Usually they are organized in a hierarchical way, but as far as runtime is concerned com.example.widgets is a completely different package from com.example.widgets.cogs Packages are arranged as directories, which helps keep things organized: your file structure is always similar to your package structure. They are planning on adding a module system to Java in JDK7 (called Project Jigsaw ) and there is an existing module system called OSGi . These module systems will/can give you a lot more flexibility and power then the simple package system. Also, package names are usually all lower case. :)
