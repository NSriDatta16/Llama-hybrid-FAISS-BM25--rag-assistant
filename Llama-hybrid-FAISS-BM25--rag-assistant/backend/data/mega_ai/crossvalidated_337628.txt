Terminology: Using "distribution" when referring to densities?

I've been looking through some literature on probability theory, and I have noticed that some authors seem to use the term "distribution" very loosely, and more than once when referring to probability densities . An example from the wikipedia article on marginal distributions: Similarly for continuous random variables, the marginal probability density function can be written as $p_X(x)$. This is $$p_X(x) = \int p_{X|Y}(x|y)p_Y(y)dy $$ where $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ gives the joint distribution of X and Y, while $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ gives the conditional distribution for X given Y. Again, from the article on Posterior Probability: The posterior probability distribution of one random variable given the value of another can be calculated with Bayes' theorem by multiplying the prior probability distribution by the likelihood function, and then dividing by the normalizing constant, as follows: gives the posterior probability density function for a random variable X given the data Y=y, where ... Now a probability density determines a distribution, but they are not interchangable. The reason I ask is I am reading some algorithms and proofs for MCMCs and it is often very unclear whether the computations are done via densities or probabilites, and looking at different sources is often more confusing than helping, since the terminology seems to differ. Am I missing something, or is this inconsistant usage of the terms?
