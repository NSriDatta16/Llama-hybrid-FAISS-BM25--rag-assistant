Is there some sort of secure local storage on Windows?

I was thinking of making a small tool. It is not important what the tool will do. The important thing, is that the tool will need to store some sensitive information on the user's HDD. EDIT: The information that will be stored is USER'S information - I'm not trying to protect my own content, that I distribute with the app. I understand that I need to encrypt this information. But then, where do I safely store the encryption password? It's some sort of an infinite recursion... So, is there a way, to encrypt information on windows, and have windows securely manage the passwords? When I say windows I mean Windows XP SP2 or later. I should also note, that users on the same system must not have access to other users information (even when they are both running my application). I'm looking for both - .NET 2.0 (C#) and native (C/C++) solutions to this problem.
