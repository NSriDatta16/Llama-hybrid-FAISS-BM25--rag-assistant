You should simply do this: svn checkout https://vatsa.com/svn/dcs/branches/doc This will create a local working copy folder named "doc" in the current working directory. Your mistake was that you gave a file name as the last argument. You can only checkout folders, not individual files. The first argument after svn checkout is the URL of the folder in the repository. The second argument is optional, and is used to specify the name of the local working copy folder in case you don't want to use the same folder name as in the repository or if you want to specify a location other than in the current working directory. Finally, seeing a branch named "doc" makes me wonder whether you've misunderstood what branches are for. See the explanation What's a Branch in the SVN book. Branches are for concurrently maintaining different copies of your whole project, not for organizing different components (like source and documentation) of the same project.
