As an exploratory method, PCA is a good first choice for an assignment like this IMO. It'd also be nice for them to get exposed to it; it sounds like many of them won't have seen principal components before. In terms of data I'd also point you to the World Bank Indicators, which are remarkably complete: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator .
