How to partition a sample into representative subsamples?

The problem is the following: take a sample $X$ of the general population $\Omega$ . Each element of $\Omega$ (and hence, each element of $X$ ) is described by a vector of characteristics, each characteristics has a finite support (think of gender, age, education level...). The joint distribution of these characteristics in $\Omega$ is known. Take a measure of dissimilarity between distributions (say, the Kullback-Leibler divergence), $d$ . We want to find a partition of $X$ in $n>1$ subsamples $(S_1,\ldots,S_n)$ such that the subsamples are the most representative possible of the general population. In practice, we would take a criterion like minimizing the average dissimilarity between $S_i$ ( $i:1...n$ ) and $\Omega$ . I am interested in any variant of the problem: e.g. where one does not choose $n$ ex ante, or where the $(S_i)_{i:1...n}$ are still mutually exclusive but do not cover all $X$ , or with another choice of criterion. I am mostly interested in algorithmic implementation of a solution. A bibliographic research didn't give me any interesting result, but maybe I tried the wrong keywords.
