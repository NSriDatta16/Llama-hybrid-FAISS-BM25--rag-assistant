How to Learn Kernels/Filters for Deep CNN's

I am familiar with NN's when drawn like this In the diagram above, each layer (except the input layer) takes as inputs the outputs of the previous layer, a weight matrix, and a bias vector. When looking at diagrams for Deep CNN's I understand that the various kernels used at each layer are learned via back propagation. But how do you decide how many will be used at each layer and how/are these kernels represented in the NN diagram? I am aware that a major difference between the first and second diagram is that the first is fully connected and the second is not. But I do not understand how it is possible to have multiple kernels run over the image in one layer. Looking at the first diagram I would have assumed that each layer would be responsible for one and only one convolution?
