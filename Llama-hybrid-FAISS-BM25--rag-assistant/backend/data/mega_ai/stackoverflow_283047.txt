You want to use the new Advanced Segments feature. It's in the top-right corner of the page and create a new segment. Drag the dimension Visitors > User-Defined Value into your dimension and put in a term that matches. You might want to use regexes to group versions, something like 6.* to match all version 6 Java. With this, you'll be able to slice and dice any report by your Java versions. Note however that I've found the Advanced Segments to be a little flaky. It's still beta and I've been getting some weird numbers on some segments.
