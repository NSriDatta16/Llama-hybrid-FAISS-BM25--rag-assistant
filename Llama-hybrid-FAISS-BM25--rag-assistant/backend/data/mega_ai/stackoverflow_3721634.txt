Populate label from single field in sql server

I have a column in a table that contains a message and I want this message to be displayed in a label. Here is my code which currently doesn't populate the label. Protected conString As String = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("sqldirectory") Dim cnn As New SqlConnection(conString) Dim cmd As New SqlCommand("select message from [database].[dbo].[table]") Dim dr As SqlDataReader Try cnn.Open() dr = cmd.ExecuteReader() lblMsg.Text = dr(0).ToString Catch ex As Exception dr = Nothing Finally cnn.Close() End Try
