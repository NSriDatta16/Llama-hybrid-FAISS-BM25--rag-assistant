One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests using Tukey-Kramer method for multiple comparison analysis is one possible approach. As a result various plots are generated where in each graph, the mean of the classifier performance measure and an interval (95% confidence interval) are clearly represented. Two means are significantly different if their intervals are disjoint, and are not significantly different if their intervals overlap. In the reference, I have included a research article from our group, where we statistically compare the outputs from different classifiers, and take out the best one. Reference: M.L.
