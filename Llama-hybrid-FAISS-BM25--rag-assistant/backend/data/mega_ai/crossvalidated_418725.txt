When dataset is very small, do i need to evaluate performance several times using multiple splits?

Dataset size is very small. Sample size is 100. I try to make machine learning model which can predict disease status. What i have done: train-test split hyperparameter tuning using 5-fold cross-validation, with train data only. training model using best h-param set. evaluate the performance with test data. I got acceptable AUC(0.8) using above scheme. But my colleague said "you should test the model's performance several times with multiple train-test split. (e.g. python StratifiedShuffleSplit)" So, Do i need to split dataset several times and apply the above scheme for each split data?
