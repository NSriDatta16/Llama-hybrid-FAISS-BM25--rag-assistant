Random Effect Levels The five levels argument (which I believe was originally noted by Gelman & Hill, 2007, p.271) is often used because we want our models to have enough information to begin with, but whether or not we "need" five is dependent on the data. A practical reason to use a random effects model is to reduce a lot of variation in data that you would otherwise not be interested in theoretically, but are aware can influence the overall relationship of your IVs and DVs. For this, it is helpful to have many levels but not entirely necessary depending on what you're doing. Having many levels can also ensure greater stability in estimation (to achieve convergence), but that also isn't immediately a given fact if there are other issues with your random effects (such as imbalances in units, etc.) as noted in Austin & Leckie, 2018 and Clarke, 2008. Finally, if you have something like a two-level factor that you are considering as a random effect, it is often easier to just include it as a fixed effect (indeed this was advice originally given by Gelman and Hill). A good example is if we measure math ability as predicted by IQ, which may vary between two neighborhoods. The neighborhoods here could be considered fixed or random, but if we only have two, its simply easier to contrast their coefficients in a regression if there isn't a lot of variation between them. To summarize, the five-levels heuristic is a useful one, but its not a law. It is useful to know more about your data before adding random effects in anyway. References Austin, P. C., & Leckie, G.
