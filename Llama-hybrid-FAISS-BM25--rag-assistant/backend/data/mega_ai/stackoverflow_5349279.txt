According to this MSDN article on user-agent strings you can assume that a user-agent platform token containing the string "Windows NT 6.0" indicates that the client machine is running Windows Vista. For example: var isWindowsVista = function() { return (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Windows NT 6.0") >= 0); }; alert(isWindowsVista()); However, Windows 7 is called "Windows NT 6.1" so unless there are version numbers like 6.0.x.y then I doubt you can detect the Vista patch level in an "official" way. Perhaps there are browser/DOM quirks that could let you infer patch level differences though.
