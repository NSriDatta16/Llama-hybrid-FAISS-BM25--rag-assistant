What does it mean for a variable to be statistically significant but not selected as important by classification methods?

I'm basically playing around with some lipidomics data to practice, so my question is purely theoretical. I wanted to see if I could find lipid classes that differ between two groups and I was comparing the results. When I use hypothesis tests (parametric and non-parametric) I consistently find one lipid class that is significantly altered after adjusting for multiple comparisons. However, when I run other types of analyses like Naive Bayes, random forest, and LASSO (as multiresponse Gaussian regression) I get very low accuracy and the important variables are completely different. The data looks like this: The x-axes represent log2-transformed total concentration per lipid class. LPE is the class that keeps coming up as significantly altered, but not important to classification methods. Could these results indicate that the hypothesis tests are innappropriate for this data?
