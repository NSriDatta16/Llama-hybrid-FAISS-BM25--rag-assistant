Off the top of my head, there are a couple of things that might be going wrong: You have either an over-released instance variable (EXC_BAD_ACCESS crash), or You are using too much memory (i.e. you are not releasing any of your allocated objects) and you get a LowMemory crash. Can you post a crash log? (If you're testing on a device, you can find out by checking the crash log in Xcode: Window->Organizer->iPhone Development(sidebar)->Crash logs.
