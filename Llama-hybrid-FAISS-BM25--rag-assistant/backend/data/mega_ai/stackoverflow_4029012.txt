There is no technical reason for this limitation - that is proven by the fact that compiler do what you evidently expect within the context of a single class. Still, removing the "limitation" does complicate compilers further, slow them down, increase their memory usage, and crucially - would not be backwards compatible (as matches in a more localised scope (namespace) would presumably be selected over other symbols seen earlier). IMHO, it also makes code harder to read and understand. Being able to read from top to bottom and comprehend the code as you go is very useful, and encourages more thoughtful and structured expression of your problem solution.
