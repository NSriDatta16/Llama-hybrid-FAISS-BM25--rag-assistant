$ {\newcommand\P[1]{\operatorname{P} \left(#1\right) }} {\newcommand\PC[2]{\P{#1 \, \middle| \, #2}}} {\newcommand\A[0]{\text{no evidence}}} {\newcommand\B[0]{\text{absence}}} {\newcommand\PA[0]{\P{\A}}} {\newcommand\PB[0]{\P{\B}}} {\newcommand\PAB[0]{\PC{\A}{\B}}} {\newcommand\PBA[0]{\PC{\B}{\A}}} $ tl;dr â€“ Absence-of-evidence isn't (significant) evidence-of-absence when the odds of not finding evidence aren't (significantly) affected by absence. Following the derivation in @fblundun's answer , this claim works when $$ \PA ~=~ \PAB \,. $$ Three notable cases: When this equality holds perfectly and unconditionally, $$ \PA ~=~ \PAB \,, $$ the claim is unfalsifiable . For example, consider a magical pink unicorn that watches us from outside of reality. But, under no circumstance does it physically interact with us in any way: it exerts no physical effects, including gravitational effects, whatsoever. Since we can never test for the existence of this magical pink unicorn, it's unfalsifiable. It doesn't really exist nor not-exist; neither claim is meaningful. When this equality is approximately true, $$ \PA ~\approx~ \PAB \,, $$ then it's the sort of scenario where people tend to say The absence of evidence isn't the evidence of absence. For example, say a historian is trying to find evidence that prehistoric people saw a particular star in the night sky. They may fail to find, say, a cave-drawing with that exact star somehow depicted. But since it seems pretty unlikely for there to have been a cave-drawing of that exact star anyway, that absence-of-evidence (a lack of cave-drawings depicting the star) isn't much evidence-of-absence (evidence that prehistoric people didn't see that star). When this equality isn't approximately true, $$ \require{cancel} \PA ~\cancel{\approx}~ \PAB \,, $$ then the claim The absence of evidence isn't the evidence of absence. doesn't really work. Basically, if you wouldn't expect to find evidence of something even if it's true, then there's no sense in saying that it's false when you don't find evidence. Discussion: How Bayesian reasoning works. Naively, Bayesian-logic requires us to recognize that we have some pre-existing beliefs about how likely things are. Then, as we continue to make observations, we can find evidence for/against that adjust the likelihoods up/down. Strictly speaking, anything that makes something less probable is evidence-of-absence. For example, did someone get a perfect score on their elementary-school-spelling-test last week in your hometown? You could check your local news, and if you don't see a story reporting on it, then that's technically evidence against it (since there was some possibility of it being reported, and it not being reported excludes that line of possibilities). But since it was a really small branch of probability-space (a Bayesian tree) that got excluded, this absence-of-evidence isn't (significant) evidence-of-absence. However, absence-of-evidence can be evidence-of-absence. For example, if you have a kid in your household who brags a lot whenever they get a perfect score on a test, but you didn't hear any bragging last week, then that would be relatively significant evidence that they didn't get a perfect score last week. Then there's the odd-ball case: unfalsifiable scenarios. Whenever a proposition being true/false would literally have no effect on reality whatsoever, then it's unfalsifiable. Unfalsifiable claims can never be evidenced, neither for nor against, so the claim that absence-of-evidence isn't evidence-of-absence holds perfectly in those scenarios. This point may come up in discussions about religion.
