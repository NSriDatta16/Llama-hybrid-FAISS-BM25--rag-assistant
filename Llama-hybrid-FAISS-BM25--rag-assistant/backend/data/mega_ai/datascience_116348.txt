Feature engineering time series data to capture a specific pattern or pay more weight to that pattern

We want to know how to apply Feature engineering(or any other ways) to time series data to capture a specific pattern like the blue line shows, the raw data is: time stamp , and value . And we got a few samples with labelled data like y representing if the current time is in that desired phase . But performance is bad when applied to test data. Now thinking about applying a regression model to it in a sliding window and how close the value in that sliding window fits the desired pattern linearly. Below is some information we know before the training, that most of the label==True fell in the green boxed area. So that's why we are happy to pay more attention to feature engineering to capture this pattern. The ideal result I want is a classification prediction: if the value is in the charging phase TLDR version: input(ts, value, label) --> feature eng --> model --> output: pred_label This is what some of our time-series data looks like: Some motifs it found and the motif we want :
