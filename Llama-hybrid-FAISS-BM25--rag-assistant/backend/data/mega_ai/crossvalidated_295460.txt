Deep neural networks need a LOT of data to power up. Not all the domain has huge amount of data like computer vision and natural language processing. (For example, in Internet, we can easily get millions of images about cat / dog. Or build a web crawler to get millions of articles about "computer network".). On the other domains, for example, medical research, the data is very expensive and hard to get (think about controlled trails). Without huge amount (if not "infinite data"), having a very complex model may lead over fitting. In addition, with a deep neural network, we lose the power of "explaining things / interpolation". In addition, here is a slide of "basic recipe for machine learning" by Andrew Ng. Note, we need bigger network when the model is not able to handle existing training data. With relative limited training data in other fields, not-so-big network (if not classical linear methods) is sufficient.
