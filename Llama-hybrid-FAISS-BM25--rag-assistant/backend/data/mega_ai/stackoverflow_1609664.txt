From the documentation : Whether or not this function returns a valid pointer or NULL depends on many factors, all of which depend on how the string was created and its properties. In addition, the function result might change between different releases and on different platforms. So do not count on receiving a non-NULL result from this function under any circumstances. You should use CFStringGetCString if CFStringGetCStringPtr returns NULL .
