IMO, the "major" versions to date are: 1.0 1.1 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 (I believe these were split out due to major C# extensions) 4.0 Frameworks on different lines install side-by-side and do not run each other; those on the same line can be used interchangeably so long as the host machine has at least the version of the assembly installed. All .NET versions currently come with Windows - they are now considered part of the operating system and follow its life cycle. (See http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/?alpha=.NET+Framework&sort=PN ) If your users have been keeping their computer up-to-date, you should have no problems using the latest .NET Framework version. Make sure that, for your configuration files later than 1.0, you include the element: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w4atty68.aspx As Jim Schubert mentions in his comment, your C# code may compile on later versions, but there are some breaking changes.
