Advice on checking if inputs are empty (.NET)

In my form, I have 8 textboxes. All of these need to be filled in, and I wanted to check if they are filled in before going to run the rest of the code. The only way I've done it thus far is 8 nested IF statements, and this looks unorganised and seems like a horrible way to do it. Can someone tell me a better way to do this? If there is one, of course. Thanks :)
