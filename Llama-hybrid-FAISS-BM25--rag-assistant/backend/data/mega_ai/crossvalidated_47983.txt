How does a Daniell kernel differ from a two sided average?

As far as I can understand, the Daniell kernel, is simply $K(j/M)=\frac{1}{2M+1}1(|j|\leq M)$. Namely, this is a two sided average. Why do people call this an untruncated kernel and differentiate it from a kernel of the form $K(j/M)=1(|j|\leq M$) when the only thing different is the scaling factor?
