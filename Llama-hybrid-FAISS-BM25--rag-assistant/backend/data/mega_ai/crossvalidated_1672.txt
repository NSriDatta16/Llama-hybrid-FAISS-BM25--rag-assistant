Although it's not specifically computational statistics, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R - Brian S. Everitt and Torsten Hothorn covers a lot of topics that I've seen covered in basic and intermediate statistics books - inference, ANOVA, linear regression, logistic regression, density estimation, recursive partitioning, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis - using the R language. This might be of interest to those interested in programming. However, unlike other books, the emphasis is on using the R language to carry out these statistical functions. Other books I've seen use combinations of algebra and calculus to demonstrate statistics. This book actually focuses on how to analyze data using the R language. And to make it even more useful, the data sets the authors use are in CRAN - the R Repository.
