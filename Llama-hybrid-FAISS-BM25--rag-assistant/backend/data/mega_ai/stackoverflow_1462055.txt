Is it correct that "Developers have read-only access to the filesystem on App Engine"?

According to this Wikipedia article on Google App Engine : Developers have read-only access to the filesystem on App Engine. I have heard of App Engine apps that allow uploads and Google also sells additional storage - if so, wouldn't this statement appear to be incorrect?
