I think you need to rewrite your query. Another way to ask for the details you want, is: "Give me the sum of the salaries for the selected employees in the selected companies, organized by the company name". So, with the employee salaries in focus, we can write: //Expression > ep = x => x.Name.StartsWith("John"); //Expression > cp = x => x.Name.StartsWith("Micro"); Expression > ep = x => x.Name.StartsWith("John"); Expression > cp = x => x.Company.Name.StartsWith("Micro"); var salaryByCompany = dataContext.Employees .Where(ep) .Where(cp) .GroupBy(employee => employee.Company.Name) .Select(companyEmployees => new { Name = companyEmployees.Key, SumOfSalaries = companyEmployees.Sum(employee => employee.Salary) }); var companies = salaryByCompany.ToList();
