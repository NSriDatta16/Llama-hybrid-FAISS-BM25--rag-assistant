Why not just define an object with an image member, and the correct/incorrect answers ? public class ImageAnswer { private final Image image; private final String answer; private final String[] wrongAnswers; // constructor and methods follow. } (note sure about the name - depending on its behaviour you can rename appropriately) That way you can define everything together (atomically) using a constructor, and embed behaviour particular to that within the object. Remember - objects should do this for you, not provide fields for you to do things with .
