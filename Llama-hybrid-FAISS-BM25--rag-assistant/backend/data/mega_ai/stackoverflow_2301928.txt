measuring response time through packets?

good day! im developing an app in c++ and winpcap that will list all the URL accessed in the browser with its corresponding response time.. currently, i can now track or monitor all accessed url through capturing and analyzing packets.. is there any way of measuring the response time of a web page to load, from the request made to the server's response?.. any easy way? thanks..
