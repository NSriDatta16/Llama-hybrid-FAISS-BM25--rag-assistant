You're right, but because this is generally not the best thing to do: in the case of classification it takes a majority vote among all the trees and assigns a class. That is a common conception about Random Forests, but it is not how many standard implementations work. Instead, the trees "vote" probabilistically: the individual trees assign probabilities for each record which are the ratio of the number of positive classes to total training examples in the terminal node containing the data point. Then these individual tree probabilities are averaged across all the trees to get an overall predicted probability. Assigning class membership is no-where required, and is external to the random forest (an almost all other) machine learning algorithms.
