Your intuition regarding the optimality of standard maximum likelihood estimators post-selection is correct. The `true' maximum likelihood estimator of a selected model is the conditional maximum likelihood estimator: Tractable Post-Selection Maximum Likelihood Inference for the Lasso | arXivLabs Post-selection estimation and testing following aggregated association tests | arXivLabs Also, standard tests are invalid: Exact post-selection inference, with application to the lasso | arXivLabs Recent Advances in Post-Selection Statistical Inference | Robert Tibshirani, Stanford University
