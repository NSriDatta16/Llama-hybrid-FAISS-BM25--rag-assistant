Intelligent Voice Recording: Request for Ideas

Say you have a conference room and meetings take place at arbitrary impromptu times. You would like to keep an audio record of all meetings. In order to make it as easy to use as possible, no action would be required on the part of meeting attenders, they just know that when they have a meeting in a specific room they will have a record of it. Obviously just recording nonstop would be inefficient as it would be a waste of data storage and a pain to sift through. I figure there are two basic ways to go about it. Recording simply starts and stops according to sound level thresholds. Recording is continuous, but split into X minute blocks. Blocks found to contain no content are discarded. I like the second way better because I feel there is less risk for losing data because of late starts, or triggers failing. I would like to implement in Python, and on Windows if possible. Implementation suggestions? Bonus considerations that probably deserve their own questions: best audio format and compression for this purpose any way of determining how many speakers are present, assuming identification is unrealistic
