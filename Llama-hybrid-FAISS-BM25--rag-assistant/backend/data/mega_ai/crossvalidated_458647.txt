Performing a CMH test in R

I'm trying to perform a CMH test to examine differential item functioning by sex in R. I've tried cmh.test and mantelhaen.test functions, but I'm struggling to correctly format my data. Here's what I've tried thusfar: dfcmh But I get the following error message: Error in mantelhaen.test(dfcmhtest) : 'x' must be a 3-dimensional array Any advice about how to correct format this array would be much appreciated! Edit: I am trying to look at differential item performance on a nine-question assessment by sex and overall assessment score (above vs. below average). The dataframe I created (dfcmh) consists of a column for sex (dichotomous: the reference category is female), a column for each question (dichotomous: correct or incorrect), and then a final column for overall score (dichotomous: above or below the group average).
