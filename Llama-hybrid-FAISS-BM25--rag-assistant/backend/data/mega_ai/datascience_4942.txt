High-dimensional data: What are useful techniques to know?

Due to various curses of dimensionality , the accuracy and speed of many of the common predictive techniques degrade on high dimensional data. What are some of the most useful techniques/tricks/heuristics that help deal with high-dimensional data effectively? For example, Do certain statistical/modeling methods perform well on high-dimensional datasets? Can we improve the performance of our predictive models on high-dimensional data by using certain (that define alternative notions of distance) or kernels (that define alternative notions of dot product)? What are the most useful techniques of dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data?
