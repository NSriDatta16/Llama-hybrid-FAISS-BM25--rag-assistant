How to implement convolution in Graph convolution recurrent neural network?

I'm currently trying to understand this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01926 The author defines convolution on a graph (p.5) and later constructs Graph Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit.(p.6) The problem is that author uses graph convolution for h_t-1 when it is only defined for signal on a graph of size equal to a number of nodes in the graph when h_t-1 can have arbitrary form depending on the number of units in the GRU cell. So, is there some problem with my understanding or with the paper?
