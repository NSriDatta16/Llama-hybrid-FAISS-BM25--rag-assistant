Stationarity check

My panel regression model is as follows: $$Y_{it}=PS_{it}+PF_{it}+EF_{it}+ \mathbf X_{it}+e_{it}$$ where $i$ : country, $t$ : year, $Y_{it}$ : GDP per capita, $PS_{it}$ : Political stability, $PF_{it}$ : Political Freedom, $EF_{it}$ : Economic Freedom, $e_{it}$ : error term. There are other independent variables as well in equation ($\mathbf X_{it}$). My question is that we normally check stationary for time series data and I want to know do I need to check stationarity for the panel-data case?. I further explain that I am using heritage foundation aggregate economic freedom index and freedom House political freedom index as independent variable in my analysis. Do I also need to check both indexes stationary?
