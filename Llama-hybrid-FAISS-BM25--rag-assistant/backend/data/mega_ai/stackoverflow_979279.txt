If the purpose of the structure definition is to declare a logical data structure that has meaning outside of the local module, then you would expect to see the first construct in a header file. In real world C code, structures are often declared for purley pragmatic reasons that are local in scope. For example, formatting data that will be copied into a buffer. In these cases it's very handy and logical to merge the structure type and variable declaration. Also, using an anoymous declaration for the structure type avoids cluttering the namespace with a name that is not needed. I do have one critisim of these examples: in C, names with a leading underscore are considered to be reserved for compiler vendors by convention. So I don't think the last example is consistent with best practice.
