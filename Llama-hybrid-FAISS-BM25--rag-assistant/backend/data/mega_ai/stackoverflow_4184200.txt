Favicon.ico on multi-domain sites?

We’re using add-on domains for our multi-site Magento setup running off one skin file on domain1.com and was wondering how we go about setting up a favicon for each store? We will have a total of 10 domains by the time we finish setting up this project so obviously want 10 different favicon’s. I’ve tried this - http://vanesz.awardspace.info/magento_favicon_tweak/ Which works in some respect and show’s the relevant icon on things like google webmaster tools but it doesn’t work as a bookmark icon and as an icon at the top of the page on browsers like chrome. Any help on this would be great.
