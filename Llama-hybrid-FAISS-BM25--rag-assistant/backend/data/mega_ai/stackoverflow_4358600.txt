doesn't this mean that passwords are being stored insecurely, or even in plaintext? Could be. A pure hashing-based storage method would make it impossible to compare for similarity: Only perfectly identical passwords could be found out that way. They could be using an algorithm like SOUNDEX to check similarity - that wouldn't be as awful a practice as storing plaintext passwords, but still a terrible thing to do. But of course, it's possible that the passwords are stored as plain text. You'd have to ask.
