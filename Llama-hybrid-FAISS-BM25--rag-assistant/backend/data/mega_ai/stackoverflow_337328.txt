RConnection should be the class that triggers the access point selection dialog. If you write your own code, get one instance of RSocketServ and 3 instances of RSocket. That should be enough. The access point selection dialog will only occur when the connection is established, which will happen only once until you hit a non-coverage area or your downloads time out.
