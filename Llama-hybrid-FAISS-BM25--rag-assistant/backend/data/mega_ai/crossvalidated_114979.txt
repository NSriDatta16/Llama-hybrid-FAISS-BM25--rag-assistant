R: random sampling for multivariate normal and log-normal distributions

I want to generate random monthly (m) temperature ( T ) and Precipitation ( P ) data considering that both variables are intercorrelated ( rTP[m] ) The tricky thing is that my random variables that have specific quantitative properties: temperatures are normally distributed, while precipitations follow a log-normal distribution and should be log-transformed mvrnorm of the package MASS could be used. mT=c(1,2,4,7,10,15,17,18,17,10,5,1) mP=c(3.9,3.7,3.9,4.1,4.5,4.7,4.8,4.8,4.4,4.1,4.2,3.9) #log-transformed sdT=c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) sdP=c(0.7,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.5,0.6,1,0.8,0.6) #log-transformed rTP=c(0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4) covTP=rTP*(sdT*sdP) simP=NULL for (m in 1:12) { out=mvrnorm(500, mu = c(mT[m],mP[m]), Sigma = matrix(c(sdT[m]*sdT[m],covTP[m],covTP[m],sdP[m]*sdP[m]), ncol = 2), empirical = TRUE) simP[m]=mean(exp(out[,2])-1) } In this case I generate two random time-series that are inter-correlated which is great. However, simulated precipitations ( simP ) are on average higher than the observed one ( mP ) plot(exp(mP)-1, type="l", lwd=2, ylim=c(0,250)); points(simP, type="l", lwd=2, lty=2) I could use rlnorm or rlnorm.rplus to consider than precipitations are log-transformed, but then I have troubles with temperatures that are normally distributed. My question is: How can I create random sampling for variables that have specific quantitative properties (log-normal and normal distributions)?
