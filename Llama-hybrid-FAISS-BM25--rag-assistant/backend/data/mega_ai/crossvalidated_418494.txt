There is no general answer here, it depends on your goals. But in the setting of logistic regression, where the likert variable is to be used as a predictor, I would try to code it with its integer values, but represent it in the regression equation via regression splines. If the number of distinct values is very low, maybe just represent it via dummys ( one-hot encoding ). In the extreme case with only three distinct values, say $1,2,3$ , then representation via dummys or via a quadratic polynomial would use equal df's, so both would be saturated (so giving the same fit.) With many (say 9) distinct values, you could compare three nested models: linear, with regression spline, or with dummys.
