With automated hyperparameter tuning available, do we still need to learn hyperparameter tuning

Tools like AWS Sagemaker have capability to do automated hyperparameter tuning, even with complex algos like Neural Networks using Tensorflow. So do we still need to learn how to do hyperparameter tuning, or simply leave it to tools like Sagemaker? Thx
