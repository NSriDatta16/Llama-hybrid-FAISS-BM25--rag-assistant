Open a new browser window/iframe and create new document from HTML in TEXTAREA?

I'm trying to write a web application using the new offline capabilities of HTML5. In this application, I'd like to be able to edit some HTML—a full document, not a fragment—in a , press a button and then populate a new browser window (or , haven't decided yet) with the HTML found in the . The new content is not persisted anywhere except the local client, so setting the source on the window.open call or the src attribute on an is not going to work. I found the following question on StackOverflow: " Putting HTML from the current page into a new window ", which got me part of the way there. It seems this technique works well with fragments, but I was unsuccessful in getting an entirely new HTML document loaded. The strange thing is when I view the DOM in Firebug, I see the new HTML—it just doesn't render. Is it possible to render a generated HTML document in a new window or ? EDIT : Here's a "working" example of how I'm attempting to accomplish this: Test new DOM function runonload() { return $("#newcode")[0].value; } $(function() { $("#runit").click(function() { w=window.open(""); $(w.document).ready(function() { $(w.document).html(w.opener.runonload()); }); }); }); &lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;New Page Test&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Testing 1 2 3&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Run it!
