The Microsoft and Java stacks are comparable in performance terms. Whether you can achieve 500,000 transactions per day (or better) depends more on what those transactions are doing and whether you get your system architecture right. So I would recommend that you design your system architecture first, then decide between the various implementation alternatives based on: how well the stacks (and related third party technologies) can implement your design, a "total cost of operation" assessment taking into account hardware, software licenses, staff and training costs, and consideration of your organization's long term IT plans.
