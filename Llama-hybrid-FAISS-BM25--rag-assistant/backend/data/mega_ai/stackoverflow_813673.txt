If you're speaking of pragmatics, then certainly... you can imagine a programming language with no ability to read or write files (e.g. a language that can compute any function on integers but that's it)... Just because a language can't operate my toaster doesn't mean it's not Turing-complete, but it does mean there are things it cannot do , so I am not sure how 'important' or useful this distinction is.
