If you're not able to use a library, then I guess you're either forced to cheat, as in "call out to a shell or some other environment that already has this capability". I'm not very familiar with QNX or the environments where it's typically run, not enough to dicount this possibility on my own anyway. By the way, before skipping this: libcurl is known to build on QNX, so try that before even reading further. Failing that, taking the question literally, I guess you need to implement the relevant parts of the HTTP protocol yourself. Since you now need secure access too, you're in a world of hurt. You just don't want to implement that type of code on your own, it is a lot of work, many many wheels to re-invent. At the very least, I'd recommend taking a hard look around to see if any of the things you need to do this are already implemented. This page implies that OpenSSH is available for the QNX platform, which is encouraging.
