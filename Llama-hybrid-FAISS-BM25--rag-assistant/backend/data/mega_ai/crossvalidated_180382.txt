Angles expressed in degrees of arc as regression variables

I have binary count data as a response variable in my logistic regression. The independent variables include, among others, two variables of inclination and orientation measurements, annotated in degrees of arc. For 'orientation' (or aspect), it ranges from 0° to 360°, and for 'inclination' from 0° to 90°. In cases where 'inclination' is 0, the orientation is annotated as '-1', because horizontal surfaces do not face any direction. For a logistic regression, my workflow would include to use R's scale-function to standardize all continuous variables, among them 'inclination' and 'orientation'. And that is what I did. But does that make sense here? Keep in mind, that an orientation of 0 (north) is the same as 360 (also north), and that 1° and 359° are only two degrees apart. How can I standardize those measurements? How would you recode an orientation of '-1', which isn't either north nor east, south or west? At this point, both variables appear to be highly influential on my model fit, but can i trust that conclusion?
