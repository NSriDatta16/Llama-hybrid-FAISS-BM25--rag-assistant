I have read that deeper trees reduce the bias, while more trees reduce the variance. Does this consequently mean, that my dataset is somewhat biased and thus increasing the number of samples, increases the bias of the model, but this does not happen, when the depth is not restricted? No. "my dataset is somewhat biased" is an assertion that needs to be clarified. On the other hand, a biased estimator is a notion that is clearly defined ( Wikipedia definition). Therefore, the bias of the random forest is not related to a kind of bias in the data . But not only the model size is larger, the accuracy is higher as well Regarding the issue about accuracy of your model decreasing with the number of sample, it is quite hard to know where it comes from. Was the sampling performed randomly ? If so, did you fix the seed you use ? (both before sampling and before training the random forest) ? Though they are not parameters of the model, they can impact the accuracy you measure.
