It's in regards to the rejection region for the non-parametric sign test for a paired experiment. Keep in mind (though I guess you're aware of this) that once you take the signs of the differences, it is a one sample test on those signs. I'm not sure if I'm understanding.. for these types of problems, can I always reject H0 if the p-value I find is less than (or equal to) 2a You reject if the two-tailed p-value is less than $\alpha$ (i.e. $2\times \alpha/2$), not $2\alpha$. Also, how do I find $x_L$ and $x_U$? It depends on what resources you have. Are you working from tables? How are those tables organized, exactly? You need to determine the quantiles that have as close as possible to a probability of $\alpha/2$ equal to or beyond them (i.e away from p=$\frac12$ toward the tails), without going over . Then the lower one is $x_L$ and the upper one is $x_U$. Consider 8 pairs, for example, with $\alpha = 0.10$. The probabilities (from the binomial distribution) of the number of positive signs is: n+ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 prob 0.00391 0.03125 0.10938 0.21875 0.27344 0.21875 0.10938 0.03125 0.00391 Here $\alpha/2$ is $0.05$. Let's go in from the bottom end to find $x_L$. If $x_L$ were 0, we'd have $\alpha/2=0.00391$ which is way below $0.05$. Now try $x_L=1$ -- now the proportion at or below $x_L$ is 0.00391+0.03125 = 0.03516 which is still below 0.05. But if we try $x_L=2$ the sum of the terms is above $\alpha/2$ so $x_L$ must be $1$ here. Similarly working from the top end (or using the symmetry about $4$), $x_U$ in this example would be $7$. Note that because the distribution is discrete we don't actually have $\alpha$ at $0.10$, it's (almost) always smaller*. In this particular case the true significance level is $0.0703$. * unless you're one of those people that actually randomizes tests in practice, but I expect that's not been mentioned in your book.
