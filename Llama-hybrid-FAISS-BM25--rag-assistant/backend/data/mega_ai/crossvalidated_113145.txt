Estimating parameters and latent variables in a split Poisson distribution using R and JAGS

I am trying to estimate parameters and latent variables in a split Poisson model that describes observable and unobservable counts in time assuming the split probability is $\pi$. An observable event in time is denoted as $O_t$ while an unobservable event is denoted $U_t$. The distributions of $O_{t+1}$ and $U_{t+1}$ are assumed to follow the conditional distribution: $O_{t+1}|O_{t},U_{t}$ ~ Poisson$[\pi(\mu_{t}O_{t}+\mu U_{t})]$ $U_{t+1}|O_{t},U_{t}$ ~ Poisson$[(1-\pi)(\mu_{t}O_{t}+\mu U_{t})]$ $\mu$ and $\mu_r$ are type specific rates where $\mu_{t} = \mu$ if $t \le C$ and $\mu_t = \mu_r$ if $t \gt C$; $t=1,2,\ldots,C-1 , C, C+1, \ldots,N$. Data is available for all $O_t$. Each latent variable $U_t$ is to be updated using the relation above and assuming that $U_{t} = 0$. It is desired to estimate parameters $\pi$, $\mu$, $\mu_r$ and the latent variables $U_{t}$ for all $t$. Bayesian method is chosen to carry out these estimations and my code is given below: library(R2jags) # sample observable data for 30 time points o I simulated the observed data above by fixing parameters and writing function below: set.seed(123) C =7;mu=2;mur =0.4;pi=0.7 o In this case, the unobservable is: u I want to recover the parameters and the latent variables back but the results I got were not OK and was thinking I have mis-specified some of the distributions. Can anyone please help look this problem? Thanks!
