That depends. Are you seeing your data more as set of objects (and relational database is just a storage medium) or as set of facts represented and analyzed natively by relational algebra. Some ORMs/Frameworks/Tools don't have good support for multicolumn primary keys. If you happen to use one of them, you'll need additional id column. If it's just a many-to-many relationship with no additional data associated with it, it's better to avoid additional id column and have both columns as a primary key. If you start adding some additional information to this association, then it may reach a point when it becomes something more then many-to-many relationship of two entities. It becomes an entity in it's own right and it'd be more convenient if it had it's own id independent to entities it connects.
