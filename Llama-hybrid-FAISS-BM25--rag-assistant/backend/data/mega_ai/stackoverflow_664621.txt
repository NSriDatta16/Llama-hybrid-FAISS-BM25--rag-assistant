Some of the best features come from adding Team Foundation Server: Continuous integration builds can be set up to run unit tests on every build Code coverage figures can be gathered based on the unit test run Reports of build success, unit test success, code coverage %, etc. can be produced daily Code check-in can mark a work item (bug report) fixed, or can start the workflow to do so It not only gives the developers a better idea what's going on with their code, and of how to fix it (unit tests, code coverage, code analysis), it also gives Management an overall picture of the same, without having to come around and bug the developers individually.
