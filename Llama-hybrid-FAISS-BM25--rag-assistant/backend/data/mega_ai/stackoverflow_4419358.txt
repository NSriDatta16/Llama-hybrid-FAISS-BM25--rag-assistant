Should I be concerned with large number of dependencies?

I was just about to include the HtmlUnit library in a project. I unpacked the zip-file and realised that it had no less than 12 dependencies . I've always been concerned when it comes to introducing dependencies. I suppose I have to ship all these dependencies together with the application (8.7 mb in this particular case). Should I bother checking for, say, security updates for these libraries? Finally (and most importantly, actually what I'm most concerned about): What if I want to include another library which depends on the same libraries as this library, but with different versions? That is, what if for instance HtmlUnit depends on one version of xalan and another library I need, depends on a different version of xalan? The task HtmlUnit solves for me could be solved "manually" but that would probably not be as elegant. Should I be concerned about this? What are the best practices in situations like these? Edit: I'm interested in the general situation, not particularly involving HtmlUnit. I just used it here as an example as that was my current concern.
