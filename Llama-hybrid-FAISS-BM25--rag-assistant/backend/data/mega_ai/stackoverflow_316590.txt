How to count lines of code including sub-directories

Suppose I want to count the lines of code in a project. If all of the files are in the same directory I can execute: cat * | wc -l However, if there are sub-directories, this doesn't work. For this to work cat would have to have a recursive mode. I suspect this might be a job for xargs, but I wonder if there is a more elegant solution?
