colorbox wraps the popup content in it's own div (#colorbox), so you could just hide the mediawiki editing tools, if they have ids/classes you can target with CSS: #colorbox .editor { display: none; } Update: this may also be of interest (from the colorbox page): ColorBox leverages jQuery's load method for handling ajax. If you are loading a document from the same domain as your current document, you can use a selector pull out just the portion of the document that is needed. Example: $('#example').colorbox({href:"document.html div#content"});
