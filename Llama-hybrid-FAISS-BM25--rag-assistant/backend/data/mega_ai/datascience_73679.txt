Deriving answers to specific queries from a text

Introduction I am looking to extract out sentence(s) from a news article for questions like 'who', 'when', 'what', 'why' and 'how'. Now I did some research and found bert model which can be utilised to make query based summarizer. But it was not satisfactory as it sentences extracted were small and wrong by huge margins. It makes sense as it was designed to answer full questions and not something like just 'when'. Spacy I knew about spacy and from that I was able to guess answers for 'who' and 'when'. Also 'what' isn't difficult as it can be obtained from description or first few sentences. Problem Now I have no idea for 'why' and 'how'. Only thing I can think of is finding words that are used to describe when we give reason to something (why) and words that describe a process(how). But again many things become subjective here as it depends on the writer. What is best way possible right now for achieving this, or anything closest to it?
