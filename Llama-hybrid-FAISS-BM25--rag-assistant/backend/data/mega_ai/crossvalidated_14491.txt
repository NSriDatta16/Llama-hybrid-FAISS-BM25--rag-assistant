Don't really agree with Macro. To me, it seems like what you're asking is how to perform a Bayesian analysis, in which you specify prior distributions over your $\beta_i$ and combine your observed data to obtain a posterior ("predictive") distribution, which you can sample from. This not only has benefits in terms of avoiding overfitting the regression, but also is a more natural way to handle uncertainty within your model (IMHO). In order to do this, I'd suggest reading up on the Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. The basic idea is that you formulate conditional distributions over each of your parameters in terms of the other parameters in your model, and take draws from each parameter in turn. You record every $k$th observation in the chain and the samples will be drawn from the posterior distribution (thanks to some beautiful mathematics). You can use this to estimate moments, quantiles, etc.
