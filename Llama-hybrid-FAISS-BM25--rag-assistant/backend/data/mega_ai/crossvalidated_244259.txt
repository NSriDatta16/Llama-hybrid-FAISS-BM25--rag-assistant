Multivariate analysis approach for multiple classes with varying concentrations?

I am working with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to discern the lowest concentration one can see of certain neurotransmitters. Concentrations I use are usually around the nanomolar range. I want to use multivariate analysis (specifically PCA) to classify my samples as either neurotransmitter A, B, C, etc, to show that I am able to discern very low concentrations of said neurotransmitter. I am not necessarily looking to predict concentrations nor find a limit of detection. My problem is that characteristic neurotransmitter peaks begin to disappear at lower concentrations; some peaks disappear while other peaks are very weak relative to higher concentrations. Due to this, when I perform PCA the lower concentrations of each neurotransmitter will cluster together more than with their respective class. I'd like to point out, however, that the lower concentrations still look different from each other because of each neurotransmitter's characteristic peaks. Is there anything that I can do to solve this issue? Should I try to perform PCA solely on lower concentrations? I was thinking that maybe past a certain concentration the neurotransmitter spectra look entirely different (i.e. a different regime). I have tried different scaling preprocesses, but it hasn't been too helpful. Maybe I need a different multivariate technique?
