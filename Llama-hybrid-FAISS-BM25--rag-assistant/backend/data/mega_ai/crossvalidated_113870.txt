MCMC of a mixture and the label switching problem

I generated some data according to a mixture of two lognormals: $f(x) = p \cdot \mathcal LN(\mu_1, \sigma) + (1-p) \cdot \mathcal LN (\mu_2, \sigma)$. given $p$ and $\sigma$, this is my code to find $\mu_1, \mu_2$ by MCMC with the mcmcPack R Package: the mixture density: d.lognorm.mix } the loglikeli function, the data ist stored in the dat variable (with $\mu_1=2, \mu_2=8$) loglikeli find the two parameters library(MCMCpack) post.samp but the result is way off: summary(post.samp) Iterations = 501:20500 Thinning interval = 1 Number of chains = 1 Sample size per chain = 20000 # Empirical mean and standard deviation for each variable, plus standard error of the mean: Mean SD Naive SE Time-series SE [1,] 2.0703 0.062859 4.445e-04 1.146e-02 [2,] 0.6896 0.003494 2.471e-05 7.299e-05 # Quantiles for each variable: 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% var1 1.968 2.0745 2.0797 2.0844 2.0934 var2 0.683 0.6876 0.6896 0.6917 0.6959 Is this an example of the label switching problem? Is there an R package for MCMC of mixtures? I'd also appreciate an explanation of what exactly the label switching problem is.
