You should be fine. I assume (from the pSOS) that you're coding to a Moto 68000, which is a 32-bit processor; working with 64-bit numbers is slightly slower there because it needs a few more instructions (eg, add, check carry, branch or add to high word) but I doubt you're worried much about a four cycle cost. If you are on a 64-bit processor, then 64-bit ops are exactly as fast as 32-bit ones. Doing this will increase your memory storage overhead of course, but again that's only a concern if you've a great many structures containing these counters.
