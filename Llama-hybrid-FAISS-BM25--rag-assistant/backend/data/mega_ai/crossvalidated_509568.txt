A problem of likelihood function in a dynamic setting?

I'm having a problem regarding perhaps conditional maximum likelihood problem, but I'm not sure. Suppose time horizon we consider is $T=4$ , our goal is to minimize the loss function $$ \sum_{t=2}^T L(y_t - u_{t-1} -v_t - \sum_{k=1}^K a_k \phi(u_{t-1}) ) $$ where $\phi$ is some known function. The goal is to estimate parameters $(a_1,\cdots,a_k)$ . More structure is $$ y_t = u_t + v_t, \forall t= 1,\cdots,T $$ and $$ u_t = u_{t-1} + \eta_{t} $$ That is, $y_t$ is observed; $u_t, v_t$ are unobserved; $u_t$ is independent of $v_t$ ; $u_t$ follows a random walk process. I want to follow other people's work to use likelihood-based method to solve it, but the additive structure poses a challenge. The likelihood-based objective function is: $$ argmin_{a_1,\cdots,a_K} = \sum_{t=2}^T E_{y_t} \left[\int L(y_t - u_{t-1}-v_t - \sum_{k=1}^K a_k \phi(u_{t-1})) \cdot f(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,v_1, v_2,v_3,v_4 | y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)\,du_1 du_2 du_3 du_4 dv_1 dv_2 dv_3 dv_4 \right] $$ Next, since the density is infeasible ( $u$ and $v$ are unobserved), use a Bayesian interpretation, treating the density as "posterior density". Use MCMC to draw those unobserved variables. However, when applying the Bayes rule I have a problem, the likelihood function becomes $$ f(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,v_1, v_2,v_3,v_4 | y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4) \propto f(y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4 | u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)\cdot f(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4) \cdot f(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4) $$ However, the first term $f(y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4 | u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$ will degenerate to a constant, because once $u_t,v_t$ are controlled, $y_t=u_t+v_t$ is determined. I figure out a trick to avoid this by replacing the overall density $f(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,v_1, v_2,v_3,v_4 | y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)$ in the integral by $$ \prod_{t=2}^T f(u_{t-1},v_t | y_t). $$ By Bayes rule: $$ \prod_{t=2}^T f(u_{t-1},v_t | y_t) \propto \prod_{t=2}^T f(y_t | u_{t-1},v_t) \cdot f(u_{t-1}) \cdot f(v_t) $$ But I'm unsure whether this replacement has any theoretical guarantee? Is it still a likelihood-based problem? I am not sure whether it is related to the concept of conditional likelihood method? Any reply would be appreciated! Update: New idea: for each $t$ , use $f(u_{t-1},v_t | y_t)$ in the integral, rather than the overall big density. But in the MCMC produce, to draw values from their product as discussed above!
