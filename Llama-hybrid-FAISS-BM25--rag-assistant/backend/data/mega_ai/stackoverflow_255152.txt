From the help: One or more of your procedures contain so many string constant expressions that they exceed the compiler's internal storage limit. This can occur in code that is automatically generated. To fix this, you can shorten your procedures or declare contant identifiers instead of using so many literals in the code. So maybe try putting some of those strings in consts or other variables (non local).
