How to predict the rows of a table using machine learning?

In my work, I need to manipulate lots of tables from databases. And I want to check whether the table not lost data, the basic way to do is checking the amount of rows. For example, the amount of rows usually at about 500 million, but one day it changes to 480 million, there may some data lost. Could anyone tell me which algorithm I should use to do this check? I want to use history rows amount data to do a predict , and if today's data is far away from the prediction do a alarm. I think I just have the daily data of the amount of rows, so I don't have right answer given(or I just have one feature -- amount of rows ), how could I use regression to solve this?
