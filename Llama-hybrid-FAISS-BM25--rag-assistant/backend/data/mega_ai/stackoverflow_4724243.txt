How to get the data type of an uniform variable

I am trying to get the type of an uniform variable defined in a fragment shader: uniform vec3 color; uniform float zoom; uniform int max; void main() { ... } The glGetActiveUniformARB(program, index, maxLength, *length, *size, *type, *name) seems to be the right API function to use but I don't know how to determinate index from a variable name. glGetUniformLocationARB returns the location of an uniform variable, that seems not to be the same as the index .
