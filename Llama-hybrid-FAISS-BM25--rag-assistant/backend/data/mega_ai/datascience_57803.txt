I guess you need to work on data pre-processing more. You need to explore your data: Check for outliers in every column, you can use z-score for that. If you have missing data, then you need to see how are you imputing the missing values. If you have some categorical variables, you need to see how you can encode them like use one-hot encoding or label encoding or binary encoding, target mean encoding etc.. Try to do feature selection and ranking and study the correlations between them using heatmaps or pearson coefficient or if you have categorical variables that may have some sort of ordinal ranking among them you can go for spearman coefficient. Because one thing is clear your dataset is too complex for the neural net to make out any pattern or establish any kind of linear or non linear relationship amongst the features in your manifold of data created in some high dimensional plane. So you need features that are in some way related to each other and try to reduce the number of redundant features. One thing that you can do is use RFECV with any gradient boosted tree algorithm and get a baseline of how many features you actually need, and after that try scaling your data. If it is not normally distributed try normalization or otherwise you can use Min max scaler or standard scaler and see what works best for you. Scaling your data properly is very important while using neural networks because if not done properly neural nets tend to become biased and go kind of awry. You also should try better resampling strategies or increasing you k-folds might help. If you can give some explanation about your dataset that might help others to answer you queries in a better way. Like: What are you doing? What are you predicting? What is your problem statement?
