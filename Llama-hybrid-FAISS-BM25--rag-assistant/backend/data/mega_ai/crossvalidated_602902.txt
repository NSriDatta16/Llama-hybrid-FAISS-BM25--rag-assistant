Does this formula hold for the coefficients of a logistic regression $\pmb{\hat{\beta}} \sim N(\pmb{\beta}, (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\sigma^2)$?

A person on Cross Validated states that the coefficients of the general linear model follows the following distribution $$\pmb{\hat{\beta}} \sim N(\pmb{\beta}, (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\sigma^2)$$ Does this still hold for logistic regression? Same question for probit regression.
