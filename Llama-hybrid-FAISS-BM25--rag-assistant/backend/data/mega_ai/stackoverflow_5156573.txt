Your question seems to imply that you keep your PHP and HTML in the same file. You might want to think about separating the two. This would leave you with an HTML template that would look like your first example. Not only will this make it easier to focus on either PHP or HTML, but like lonesomeday mentioned you will be able to leverage your IDE's HTML handling capabilities which can make things a lot easier for you. Plus it's easier to let web designers work on the frontend without them having to understand PHP.
