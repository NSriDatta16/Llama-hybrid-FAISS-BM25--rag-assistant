$\{X_t(\omega)\}$ is clearly nonstationary , because $\mathbb{E}(X_1)=\dots=\mathbb{E}(X_t)$ does not hold. This is because $\mathbb{E}(X_1)=y_1,\dots,\mathbb{E}(X_t)=\dots=y_t$ , and we know that $y_1=\dots=y_t$ does not hold, since the share price of Tesla has not been constant the whole time from day 1 to day $t$ (today or yesterday, depending on whether the stock exchange has already closed today or not). (Note that $\mathbb{E}(X_\tau)=y_\tau$ for every $\tau=1,\dots,t$ because for every $\omega\in\Omega_0$ we have $y_\tau(\omega)=y_\tau$ by the definition of $\Omega_0$ .) Since ergodicity is only defined for strictly stationary processes (see e.g. this answer by Michael), $\{X_t(\omega)\}$ is not ergodic . The fact that $\{X_t(\omega)\}$ is nonstationary unless $y_1=\dots=y_t$ seems to make modelling the conditional process $\{X_t(\omega)\}$ indefinitely more complicated than modelling the original process $\{Y_t(\omega)\}$ . And while modelling $\{Y_t(\omega)\}$ may be much easier, this seems irrelevant for those who only care about the particular time series (Tesla's share price in OPs example) but not about the hypothetical other realizations (trajectories) from the same data generating process $\{Y_t(\omega)\}$ . I am still trying to figure out what that implies...
