How to select features for Text classification problem

I am working on a problem where we need to classify user query into multiple classes. Problem : Suppose we are running a website for selling products. The website has a form where the user can write any complaint or issue. In order to resolve users issue, we thought to classify issues into predefined classes so that we can understand what type of problems users are facing. Issues classes can be like Class 1: Payment Issues Class 2: Registration issues Class 3: Order booking issues Class 4: Problem accessing website app ... I am thinking to apply random forest but cannot decide what features should I select. Any suggestions would be of great help thank you
