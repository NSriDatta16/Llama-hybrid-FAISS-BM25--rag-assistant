Persist and rearrange the order of Core Data records

I followed the Core Data tutorial at http://macresearch.org/cocoa-scientists-part-xxiii-itunes-ifying-core-data-app The finished application displays data in an NSTableView. Is the ordering of the data persistent as well? And is there a way that you can allow drag and drop rearrangements to the order of the records? I am thinking about something that resembles how iTunes allows you to rearrange songs in a playlist with drag and drop.
