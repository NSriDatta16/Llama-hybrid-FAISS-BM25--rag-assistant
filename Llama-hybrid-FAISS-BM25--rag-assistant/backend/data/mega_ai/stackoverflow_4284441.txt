You can use the answer of Robert and RPK to get the MX record of a given domain. But you'll need a DNS server to do the job. If you want to detect the DNS server of the machine where your code is executed, you can use the following. NetworkInterface[] adapters = NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces(); foreach (NetworkInterface adapter in adapters) { IPInterfaceProperties properties = adapter.GetIPProperties(); if (properties.DnsAddresses.Count > 0) foreach (IPAddress ipAddress in properties.DnsAddresses) dnsServers.Add(ipAddress.ToString(), 53); } There is a complete solution (or at github here ) that will do the whole job if you don't want to rewrite everything. Look for GetMxRecords static method.
