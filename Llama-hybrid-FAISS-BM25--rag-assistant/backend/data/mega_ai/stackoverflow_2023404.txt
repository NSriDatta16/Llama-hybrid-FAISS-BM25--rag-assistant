try using dragonfly . It has a whole lot of automation stuff built into it. You don't need the speech recognition part in order to use the automation stuff. For example: from dragonfly import Window Window.get_all_windows() will return a list of all the windows. you also want to look at the FocusWindow() and Keys() objects in dragonfly.
