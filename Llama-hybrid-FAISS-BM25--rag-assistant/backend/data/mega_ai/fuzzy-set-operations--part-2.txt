, 1, ..., 1) = one Axiom h2. Monotonicity For any pair <a1, a2, ..., an> and <b1, b2, ..., bn> of n-tuples such that ai, bi ∈ [0,1] for all i ∈ Nn, if ai ≤ bi for all i ∈ Nn, then h(a1, a2, ...,an) ≤ h(b1, b2, ..., bn); that is, h is monotonic increasing in all its arguments. Axiom h3. Continuity h is a continuous function. See also Fuzzy logic Fuzzy set T-norm Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems De Morgan algebra Further reading Klir, George J.; Bo Yuan (1995).
