Nokogiri find text in paragraphs

I want to replace the inner_text in all paragraphs in my XHTML document. I know I can get all text with Nokogiri like this doc.xpath("//text()") But I want only operate on text in paragraphs, how I can select all text in paragraphs without affecting eventually existent anchor texts in links ? #For example : some text This should not be changed another one
