Using logistic regression to model cumulative probability of a ordinal response

I have observations of students test results (response variable) as the ordinal variable test score (grade A school s. The predictor is education_type . However, I could not get the test score of each individual student, but only the cumulative distribution of the score among students per school i: Prob{grade=A|school=i}, Prob{grade 0 I was suggested to do the following analysis. For every sampled school, we end up with 3 estimated cumulative probabilities. Using the cumulative probabilities as response, we apply a logistic regression with grade and education_type as predictor. Could someone help me to clarify whether the above method is valid? Would the 3 cumulative probabilities be non-independent? and how can I disentangle/model such dependency, by introducing school as a random factor?
