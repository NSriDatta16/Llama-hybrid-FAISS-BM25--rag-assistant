NLS_LANG setting for JDBC thin driver?

I am using the thin Oracle JDBC driver ver 10.2.0 (ojdbc14.jar). I would like to configure its NLS_LANG setting manually. Is there a way? Currently it fetches this setting from the VM variable user.language (which is set automatically by setting the current locale, or on startup from the system environment). This is a problem when the users switch the application locale to a one that is unsupported by the Oracle JDBC driver (e.g. mk_MK). In this case, the next time I fetch a connection I get the following exception: ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL level 1 ORA-12705: Cannot access NLS data files or invalid environment specified I can change the locale on the fly just before I fetch the connection and switch back to the user's selected one back and forth, but this seems unelegant and unefficient.
