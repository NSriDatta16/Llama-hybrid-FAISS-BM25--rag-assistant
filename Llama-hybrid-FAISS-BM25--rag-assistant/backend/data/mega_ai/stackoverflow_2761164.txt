floated div drops when height of above DIV is greater than X

css: .listingContainer { margin:auto; overflow:hidden; padding:0 0 16px 16px; width:660px; } .listingItem { float:left; margin:0 2% 3% 3%; min-height:250px; width:44.999%; } html: Some Content Some Content Some Content If the content in any given "listingItem" DIV becomes too great, the div directly below will drop to the NEXT row. the content looks like: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] but if a div has say 1 extra paragraph in, rather than stagger the divs, it is pushed to the next row: [1] [2] [4] [3] [5] [6] this isProbably working as intended, but how can i fix this? can't provide a live page sorry. any ideas? thanks
