Your idea is to use the logit (I call it $f$ to make clear that what $f$ is does not matter in what I will explain) in order to fall between 0 and 1. This idea of yours is not especially related to logistic regression. It is similar to using a log link function in order to deal with a positive $Y$. So the difference between model 1 and model 2 is the same as if you used a log. The first is transformed linear regression, the second is GLM. The key difference is : Transformed : $E(f(Y)|X)=\beta X$ GLM : $f(E(Y|X))=\beta X$ What is best ? It depends on what you want. One of the problems with transformed linear regression is explained here (with log): http://davegiles.blogspot.fr/2013/08/forecasting-from-log-linear-regressions.html . If this bias on the mean is a true problem for you then GLM solves this problem. Otherwise transformed linear regression would more natural (see gung's answer).
