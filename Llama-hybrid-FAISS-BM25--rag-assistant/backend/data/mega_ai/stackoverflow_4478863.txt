Show image from blob in javascript

i am using localstorage html5. first i am saving mysql db values into localstorage then i am fetching where i want.its fine. i want to save images (like images of products) into localstorage and then want to show them where i want, i did an experiment as I saved images in blob in mysql, and i am able to fetch and show them using php but i dont want to use php here,the purpose is of offline working.i am unable to show image via javascript any one can help me?? There might be two ways, one is can we encript image (i have to path to image)in some sort of string in javascript and then can i show that on anywhere. Second way.. as i said i saved it in blob can i use javascript to just show image from blob. by the way i can fectch value from database easily.now the only thing is to save that value into javascript and show its image where i want. I will wait for reply thank you:)
