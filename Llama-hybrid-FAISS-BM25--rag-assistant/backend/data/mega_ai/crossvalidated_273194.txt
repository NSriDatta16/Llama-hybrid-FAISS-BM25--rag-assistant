Huy, I heartily encourage your interest in teaching statistics through simulation. The more I see of statistical [mal]practice in the social sciences (including medicine), the more convinced I become that simulation holds the key to a meaningful engagement with statistics at all levels . For you and your students, I would discourage the use of any black-box tools. Rather, a spreadsheet that your students can inspect and modify themselves will give them the most proper exposure to these ideas. Also, to teach your students effectively, I think you will need to have built the spreadsheet yourself so that you understand in depth what's going on 'under the hood'. To start, I would suggest you build a 5-column spreadsheet. The first 3 columns would give the potential outcomes for the study participants, one row for each subject. Column 1 will have the weight change that person would (or did) experience if put in the control group. (You could fill this column in with one of the random-number functions from your spreadsheet program.) The next 2 columns would have the weight changes that would happen in each of the 2 treatment groups. (These columns might be filled in by adding random 'treatment effects' to the control-group weight changes.) Column 4 would have a randomly-generated indicator telling which group the person actually got assigned to. Column 5 would use an appropriate formula to copy over the actual weight change from one of the columns 1..3; some if-then logic should suffice. Once you've done this, columns 4..5 will look like (very much simplified) raw data from the study. You will have to decide how to generate the treatment effects, of course, and this work actually amounts to deciding what your model is! By suitable use of parameters entered into cells off to the side of the main $N \times 5$ grid of data, you can even explore how strong the 'Chocolate effect' would have to be to get detected in studies of different sizes. If you have 20 students in your classroom, you can even model a null effect, and show that 1 in 20 trials still (on average) gets a 'positive result'! Once again, thank you for your work to bring these important matters alive in your classroom â€” during Math and Statistics Awareness Month , no less!
