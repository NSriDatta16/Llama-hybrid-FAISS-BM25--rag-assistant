Cobine p-values, same data, same test, different labels

I have a dataset (300 samples vs 4000 features), I'm trying to extract meaningful features related to two condition A and B . Both conditions have levels 0, 1 and 2 that stand for none, mild, severe. Since features don't follow a normal distribution I used a non-parametric Kruskal test, now I have two lists of p-values pValA and pValB that contains significance levels of each feature in my dataset for condition A and condition B . How can I merge both lists and select meaningful features? I used to do the average but my supervisor faked a heart attack when he saw my code.
