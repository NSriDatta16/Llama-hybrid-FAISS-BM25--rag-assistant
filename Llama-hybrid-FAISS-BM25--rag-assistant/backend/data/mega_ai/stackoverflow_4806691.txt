Code coverage report incorrectly indicating 100% coverage of a controller

I'm running a series of PHPunit tests and have a controller that is reporting 100% coverage. In the coverage report however, only 5 of its 84 lines of code are marked "green" I'm wondering what factors might be causing this issue? One interesting point that might be causing it is 'indirect calls'. This particular controller is the parent of a number of other controllers, and since so many other objects inherit from it maybe the code gets called for elsewhere... but then wouldn't it turn green? As it stands the only method that is turning green is the __construct method. I don't know if that's actually enough to go on, but if anyone has a bit more knowledge of how Unit Testing determines coverage I'd love to hear it. Edit in response to `Gaurav's comment: The phpunit command line is phpunit --configuration admin.xml and admin.xml reads ./admin/applications/admin/ ./admin/applications/shared/ ../admin/applications/admin/controllers ../admin/applications/shared/controllers ../admin/applications/shared/helpers ../admin/lib/controllers ../admin/lib/helpers ../admin/lib/models ../admin/lib/utils ../dm_admin/applications/shared/controllers/DashboardController.php ../admin/lib/crons In response to jakenoble: the helper is reading 100% coverage but inside we see It goes on for 1099 lines, with the occasional green... but no red.
