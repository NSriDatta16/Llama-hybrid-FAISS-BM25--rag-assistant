IF/ELSE makes stored procedure not return a result set

I have a stored procedure that needs to return something from one of two databases: IF @x = 1 SELECT y FROM Table_A ELSE IF @x = 2 SELECT y FROM Table_B Either SELECT alone will return what I want, but adding the IF / ELSE makes it stop returning anything. I tried: IF @x = 1 RETURN SELECT y FROM Table_A ELSE IF @x = 2 RETURN SELECT y FROM Table_B But that causes a syntax error. The two options I see are both horrible: Do a UNION and make sure that only one side has any results: SELECT y FROM Table_A WHERE @x = 1 UNION SELECT y FROM Table_B WHERE @x = 2 Create a temporary table to store one row in, and create and delete it every time I run this procedure (lots). Neither solution is elegant, and I assume they would both be horrible for performance (unless MS SQL is smart enough not to search the tables when the WHERE class is always false). Is there anything else I can do? Is option 1 not as bad as I think?
