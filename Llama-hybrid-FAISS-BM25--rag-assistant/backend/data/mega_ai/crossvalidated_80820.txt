We can be even more precise than @Mike Shi's data: the most dangerous of all birthdays is the very first one . The 1st day mortality rates reported there are around 0.2 % for industrialized countries and 0.8 % average for all countries. Which means that the risk of dying on the day of birth is at least as high as the risk of dying at any of the following birth days*. * I think it is a safe assumption that 1st day deaths do not appear in @Mark Shi's file, as the US 1st day mortality rates are reported to be 0.3 % ( other source: 0.26 % ). Which is almost the total birth day death rate in the social security file. So either babies who die at the day of birth do not get a social security number, or dying on a birth day > 1 year is extremely improbable. side note: There are other days, such as Chirstmas and New Years Eve which are known to have higher-than-average mortality rates as well .
