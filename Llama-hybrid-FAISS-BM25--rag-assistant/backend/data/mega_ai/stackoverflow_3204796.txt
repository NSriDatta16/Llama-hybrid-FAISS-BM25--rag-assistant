Indoor Custom Maps Application

I am currently in the research phase of my project on Android. I am interested in developing indoor custom maps application. There are 2 problems I am currently facing in this: I can't use GPS as it won't work in the indoor settings like a building or a mall I can't use Google Maps API as I need to show my location on a indoor custom map(like a floor-plan of a building). I'm assuming here that I have the custom map of the building or mall. Now my goal is to find location of the Android phone using some methods and display it on the custom map.To find the location I have following options, Use of Bluetooth dongles or transmitters, I am assuming that Bluetooth dongles or transmitters are kept at known locations on the custom map and I know the coverage area for all of them. I will use methods like RSSI to get nearest dongle from my Phone.The problem here is I don't know how do I use this information to plot the location of my phone on the map.I have heard of shape files for Windows Mobile which are used for this purpose.Don't know how I can make use of them in Android. Use of WiFi Access Points - Similar to Bluetooth.But cost is more than Bluetooth. Can anyone please suggest some solutions to these problems. Thanks.
