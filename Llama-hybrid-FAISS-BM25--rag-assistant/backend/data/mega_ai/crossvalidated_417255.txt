What is the kernel width defined as, for these Gaussian distributions? Is it just the variance? In kernel density estimation the width of the kernel densities (called the "bandwidth" in this context) is left as a free parameter and estimated from the data. For the case of a Gaussian KDE the estimated density is: $$\hat{f}_h(x) = \frac{1}{n h} \sum_{i=1}^n \phi \Big( \frac{x-x_i}{h} \Big),$$ where $\phi$ is the standard normal density and $h>0$ is the "bandwidth". As you can see, this bandwidth parameter is effectively just the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernels used in the density estimator. In practice, this parameter is estimated from the data, which can be done using maximum likelihood estimation, or other methods . Given some estimator $h_*: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ you estimate the bandwidth as $h_*(\mathbf{x})$ and so your estimated density is then: $$\hat{f}(x) \equiv \hat{f}_{h_*(\mathbf{x})}(x) = \frac{1}{n h_*(\mathbf{x})} \sum_{i=1}^n \phi \Big( \frac{x-x_i}{h_*(\mathbf{x})} \Big).$$ From what I understand, you add the probability densities corresponding to each point to get the full KDE. What does the resulting value curve physically mean? Is it some sort of cumulative probability density? You average the kernel density at each point (rather than just summing them) so that you get a density function as your output. The resulting density curve is the estimated density of the distribution that generated the data . The above formula gives a probability density function, not a cumulative distribution, but you can easily get the latter by taking the corresponding average of normal CDFs instead of PDFs.
