Normal approximation to Poisson: With Continuity Correction the Approximation Seems Worse

This is Exercise 3 in Section 6.3 of Probability and Statistics, 4th edition, by DeGroot and Schervish: Suppose that the distribution of the number of defects on any given bolt of cloth is the Poisson distribution with mean 5, and the number of defects on each bolt is counted for a random sample of 125 bolts. Determine the probability that the average number of defects per bolt in the sample will be less than 5.5. Let $X$ be the total number of defects; we want $P(X / 125 Below, the first probability is the true probability; the second is the estimate computed with the continuity correction; the third is the estimate computed without it: ppois(q = 687, lambda = 625) = 0.9931787 pnorm(q = 687.5, mean = 625, sd = 25) = 0.9937903 pnorm(q = 687, mean = 625, sd = 25) = 0.9934309 The estimate computed with the continuity correction is worse than the estimate computed without it. Did I make a mistake? If I didn't, why does using the continuity correction produce a less accurate estimate?
