Where is the cost parameter C in the RBF kernel in SVM?

RBF kernel using SVM depends on two parameters C and gamma. If the equation of the kernel RBF as the following: $K(X,X')= \exp(\gamma||X-X'||^2)$ In the equation I can see where can I use gamma, but I can't find the C parameter. So, can enybody tell me please? Thanks in advance,
