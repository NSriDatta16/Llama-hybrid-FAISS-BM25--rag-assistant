Not too sure exactly what you mean by efficiency , but embedding a large number of files is generally not considered best practice. You generally only want to embed things that need to show up immediately when the application loads, or that are so small it would be overkill to load them via URLLoader and the like. Say you only view 5 of your animated swfs at startup, and the as the user clicks around and goes to different screens/views, they are revealed the rest. Then you could just load the swfs at runtime via URLLoader or the Flex Module architecture. The benefit of having your swfs and assets not embeddded in your main swf is that: it dramatically decreases swf size it makes it easier to swap out graphics at runtime (or without needing to compile) If I were you I would remove as many [Embed] tags as possible, and replace them with either loading via modules or urlloader.
