TOST on mediation result

Dear people of the internet I have made a mediation test on a multiple linear regression and it comes out insignificant. However, I am having trouble trying to make a TOST equivalence test of the result. Can I save the ACME result as a statistical model, so I can use the "equivalence_test" function? Or is there some way to figure out the mean and standard deviation of ACME, so i can use the TOSTER-package/calculate it manually? For the mediation test, I use the mediation package and function of the same name. EDIT: The mediator, independent variable and the dependent variable are all indexex made from PCA components. Therefore, the results have no immediate practical meaning or effect.
