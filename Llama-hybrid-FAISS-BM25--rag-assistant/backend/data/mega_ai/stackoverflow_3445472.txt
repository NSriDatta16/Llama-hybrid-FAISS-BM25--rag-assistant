Okay, so here I am working on my second iPhone app, starting over with a new tab bar application, and I have the SAME EXACT PROBLEM! This is so frustrating! Last time the slow double clicked worked, but this time it didn't. What I finally wound up doing was dragging a new Tab Bar Controller over to the main window, and configuring that (just use the same exact configurations from the Tab Bar Controller that is already there). It worked like a charm!
