Why does this expectation equal this autocovariance?

I'm learning about time series and saw this in my book relating to a stationary time series, AR(1) process $X_t = \phi X_{t-1} + w_t$ In one derivation they write something like: $E(X_{t+1}X_{t}) = \gamma(1)$ Is it assumed that the mean of $X_t$ is 0? That is the only way I see that this equation is true but that assumption is not mentioned in my book.
