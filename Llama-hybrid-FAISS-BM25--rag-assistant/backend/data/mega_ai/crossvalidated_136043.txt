Likeness of brands using tweets - is Chi-square appropriate?

I'm trying to determine if brand x is more similar to brand y or brand z using tweets. I have a data set for the words that occurred in each brand's tweets, and I'm considering using the chi-square test with the main brand's (x) word distribution being used as my expected values, and secondary brands (y, z) being used as observed values. Is that the right test to use? Also, for a set of 5,000 tweets I found 2200 unique words with average occurrences of 5 and a median of 1. Does the >5 expected values rule of thumb hold with large sets of values?
