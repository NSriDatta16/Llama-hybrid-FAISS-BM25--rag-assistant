The Freebase Suggest documentation shows lots of examples of how to filter the results. For example, you can constrain the autocomplete to only show companies and organizations like this: $("#example4") .suggest({ "type": ["/business/company", "/organization/organization"], "type_strict": "any" }).bind("fb-select", function(e, data) {}); What are you trying to build with Freebase suggest? What results would you like it to display?
