If you are a start-up, you may be able to afford Microsoft's stuff after all. Check out their BizSPark program which gives you software for free for a few years. I am not sure that I agree that MySQL is not your best option though. Doesn't FaceBook use MySQL? Are you expecting to be bigger? If you think that InnoDB will be too slow for you, there are other storage engine options on MySQL. For example, have you investigated TokuDB ? Have you considered a hosting service like Linode.com instead of your own hardware? This might be a better fit for your cashflow profile. If you really feel the DB load is onerous, you could have dedicated or multiple servers. Start with a dedicated DB box and scale up from there. You could also go with a cloud service like Amazon EC2 . EDIT: I just realized that Tokutek have a social networking case study: http://tokutek.com/customers/a-social-networking-case-study/ It sounds to me like you are unlikely to outgrow MySQL any time soon. If you grow busy enough to need anything like TokuDB you can thank me with a few shares. :-)
