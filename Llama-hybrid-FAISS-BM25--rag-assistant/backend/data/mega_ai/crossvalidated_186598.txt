You could use a heatmap (matrix) where each column is a classifier and each row a dataset. For each row you rank your classifiers best to worst and assign a color gradient (green to red for instance). Then ideally you do not display classifiers (columns) randomly but from the best one (highest average or median score if they are comparable between data set) to the worst one... You should see a matrix with green on the left and red on the right if few classifiers are constantly doing better than others. if you see some green in the middle of red it means that, as you said in your post, on this specific dataset a given classifier is doing very well.
