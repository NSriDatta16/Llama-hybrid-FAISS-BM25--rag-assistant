How to build a hybrid graph with CNN and RNN Architecture?

For an instance, we have M matrix of size n*k, I would like to treat each matrix independently and perform the convolution operation at each one in order to introduce to an LSTM layer the outputs of the convolution layer. can I treat each matrix independently or do I have to use the channel technique and how I can provide each LSTM cell? you find the architecture link below, thank you in advance!!
