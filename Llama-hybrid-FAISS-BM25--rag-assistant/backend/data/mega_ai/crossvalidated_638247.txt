It may be useful to try and specify your question in terms of the levels of analysis here. As you've noted, there is no way to map seedling-level bacterial composition to seedling-level root length outcomes, so examining within-plan variation in the relationship is impossible with these data. (You could imagine modifying the experiment to try and get at within-plant variation. For instance, if you could somehow stratify the seeds collected from the same plant in a way that would capture variation in their bacterial composition, then you could look at variation at the level of the stratum nested within each plant. But that's for some other day.) So, it seems that it's only feasible to examine the relationship between plant-level variation in bacterial composition and plant-level average root length outcomes. If M for each plant is pretty big and if M is equal across all N plants, then it seems like not the worst thing in the world to average the measurements up to the plant level and just do your regression. There will be some measurement error in the predictor because the bacterial composition measurements are sample averages rather than the true plant-specific typical bacterial composition, which is why it would help for M to be big and equal across plants. (If M varies across plants, then the degree of measurement error would also vary from plant to plant, which makes for a big mess.) If you don't like averaging the data, then the thing to do is conceptualize the problem as being about the latent plant-level attributes, and to think of the seedling-level measurements as manifest, noisy measurements of those attributes. From this perspective, you could analyze the data with a multi-level, multi-variate model, treating both the bacterial composition measurements and the root length measurements as distinct outcomes at the seedling level, with seedlings nested within plants. The multivariate random effects in this model could be interpreted to understand how root length covaries with bacterial composition at the plant level. I think Goldstein's 2011 book on multilevel modeling covers this sort of model. It's also possible to set up models like this in a structural equation framework, where the seedling measurements are indicators for plant-level latent factors, with root length as one factor and bacterial composition as another factor.
