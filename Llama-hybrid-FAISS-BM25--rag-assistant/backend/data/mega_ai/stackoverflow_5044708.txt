Is there a way of switching connectivity on and off in an AndroidTestCase?

I am planning to start writing some android test cases and I would like to know if there is a way of switching connectivity on and off programmatically in the emulator. // High level puesdo code Test: is Message Pushed to Local Storage if Phone is Not Connected to Network: Connectivity = off Create message try push message to webapp assert message in local storage Connectivity = on New to test cases in android so apologies if answer is obvious.
