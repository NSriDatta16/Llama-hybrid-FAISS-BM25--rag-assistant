I think NHibernate is a good choice to replace typed datasets, I just successfully did that on a project I was on recently. I wouldn't do a "big bang" approach though. I would write new features using NHibernate and maintain old features using typed datasets. Once the new features are working well with NHibernate and you have the appropriate usage patterns in place, I would carefully transition the typed dataset and sproc code to use NHibernate instead. The speed at which you do the replacement doesn't really matter, just move at a comfortable pace. Big bang is always a highly risky approach and incremental progress is easier for everyone to swallow. I honestly don't see a compelling reason to switch a project in production from VB.NET to C#, there are so few meaningful differences and it helps to have VB.NET (in addition to C#) experience on your resume. I would not encourage use of LinqToSql nor would I encourage use of Entity Framework 3.5. EF 4 may be a reasonable option using the same incremental approach.
