Can my data be described as a random walk or not?

I'm trying to figure out whether the observed "time series" can be described as a random walk or not. Unfortunately a major problem regarding my data is in time intervals: Problem: Time intervals are not equal. Example: TimePoints = 1854, 1901, 1914, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1950, 1958, 1974, 1980, 1984, 1986,1988,1990,1991,1992,1993,1994,1995,1996,1997,1998,1999,2000 Associated data are cumulative values and go like this: Values: 40, 51, 53, 60, 61, 65, 83, 88, 113, 125, 97, 81, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 73, 72, 71, 64, 75, 74, 73, 68 If time intervals were equal then I wouldn't have this confusion, but now (due to my lack of experience) I am puzzled whether or not my data can be described as a random walk. Any suggestions?? Is there any test designed to handle such situations?
