Indeed, it would be best to have a deeper description of the variables at stake, to better understand the available resources and the logistics of the problem. However, if you say that your goal is to forecast delays, just note that those are a time series in themselves; hence, you can directly model them, disregarding delivery times. Now, you have two choices: Parametric modelling Non-parametric modelling (aka Machine learning ) the choice of which entirely depends on the resources at hand (do you have reliable covariates? Enough observations?), the logistic of the implementation (do you have to write a production sotware? Will it run on a cloud/PC/Rasperry/...? Are you interested in knowing about the functional form of the relationship?) and indeed, a good exploration of the data.
