The functional API does not change how you can call the predict function. The output shape does not depend on the loss function. You should look at the output layer and check its shape. Multi-label classification should indeed give you a series of probabilities, one for each of the classes you are predicting. So if there is 5 classes, you would get 5 probabilities. The threshold is up to the modeler. You can choose 0.5 as a rule of thump, but that is not necessarily the best, as there is a trade off between precision and recall. StatQuest has an excellent video about this > https://youtu.be/4jRBRDbJemM If you are interested in more in-depth details about choosing the threshold, you can check out the Bayesian Decision Theory, nicely explained in Kevin Murphy's "Machine Learning: a probabilistic perspective" section 5.7.
