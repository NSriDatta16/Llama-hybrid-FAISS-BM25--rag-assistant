Dynamically add SWFObject using Wicket

I am trying to add a Flash (*.swf) file to my Wicket application. I found some information here , but unfortunately it is not working, and I don't know why. On a web page, the elements and tag render as Clearly, this is not the path of my Flash file. Also, I want to load the file dynamically, but the method of embedding Flash discussed in the above link is static. How can I load swf files dynamically?
