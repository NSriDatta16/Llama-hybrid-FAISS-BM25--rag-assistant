What you want to do requires use of the MAPS API but it's not very hard if you know some javascript. Essentially, load the datapoints into a Javascript array, plot them on the map and then populate your html with the array information. This link is a page I recently wrote that does the above and also dynamically repopulates the array from the db as the user drags the map (hardly any CSS at present either). map with dynamic links Happy to answer any more comments. P.S. Cool map icon! Tim
