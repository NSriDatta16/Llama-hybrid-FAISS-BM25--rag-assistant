Since this is a generic machine learning problem, there are any number of methods. A good place to start would be reading a high-quality textbook such as Elements of Statistical Learning . If you know the form and want to estimate the parameters, you should look into nonlinear least squares. If you don't want to use least squares, you could use a different loss like $\log \cosh$ .
