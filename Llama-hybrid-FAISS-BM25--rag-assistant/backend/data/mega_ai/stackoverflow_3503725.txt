Sure it makes sense to me. I do it all the time. For example, I am working on a complex polymorophic nested model form and it only has two views. An index, and a partial for dynamically adding more attributes to it. If you know AJAX, that can really help your UI in that your users will not even have to click a save button. To accomplish a bare minumum of this. Set up an index.html.erb with your form inside it. In your controller, you could specify your actions like so : def update @quick_fact = @organization.quick_facts.find(params[:id]) if @quick_fact.update_attributes(params[:tab]) flash[:notice] = 'Text Tab was successfully updated.' redirect_to quick_facts_organization_path(@organization) else render :action => "index", :id => params[:id] end end
