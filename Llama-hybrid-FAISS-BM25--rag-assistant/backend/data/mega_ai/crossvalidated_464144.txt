So you have pre-post data and want to study the effects of some treatment. Assuming you also have a control group, and maybe some other covariables, you can start with an ancova model of the form $$\tag{*}\label{*} y_{\text{post}} =\mu+\alpha y_{\text{pre}}+\gamma \text{Treatment}+\beta x+\text{Error} $$ An alternative is change scores defined by $y_{\text{post}}-y_{\text{pre}}$ . To look at that subtract $y_{\text{pre}}$ from both sides in $\eqref{*}$ : $$ y_{\text{post}}-y_{\text{pre}} =\mu+(\alpha-1) y_{\text{pre}}+\gamma \text{Treatment}+\beta x+\text{Error} =\mu+\alpha y_{\text{pre}}+\gamma \text{Treatment}+\beta x+\text{Error} $$ But, when using change scores $y_{\text{pre}}$ is typically not included on the RHS, so that use is equivalent to assuming that $\alpha=1$ in $\eqref{*}$ . That way using change scores is a special case of ancova. In the model $\eqref{*}$ we could also include, say, an interaction between treatment and the pre score, which is not possible when using change scores. There is an earlier post Best practice when analysing pre-post treatment-control designs with good answers and many references, and ancova seems to be the recommendation, at least for randomized studies. For non-randomized studies the situation is less clear, see this paper . But there is an additional complication, that you have observational data and not experimental data. There could be systematic differences between the treatment and control group. Hopefully you have many additional covariates, and if those covariates can explain pre-differences between the two groups, maybe there is no problem. But you could look into propensity scores, many posts, search this site. And maybe add the tag causality which might attract the attention here from knowledgeable users on that topic. Register-based data analysis is an example, see this .
