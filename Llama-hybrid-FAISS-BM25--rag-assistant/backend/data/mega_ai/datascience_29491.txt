Assume you are measuring the number of page visits as x and the time spent on the page as y, let’s say you measure it for each visitor/customer for a specific page. If you create a scatter plot of x vs y, then you’ll get a Gaussian cloud of points in a 2-dimensional space. PCA can transform your data (cloud) from 2D to 1D, you can explain your data with a single variable rather than 2 variables. Once you decrease data dimensionality your problem (for example clustering or classifying the customers) would be easier to solve.
