Digg have some interesting articles on this question. Essentially, you're shifting the burden of processing to writes rather than reads, which may be desirable in highly scalable applications. Cassandra specifically is also highly available. Simplistically, Cassandra is a distributed database with a BigTable data model running on a Dynamo like infrastructure. It is column-oriented and allows for the storage of relatively structured data. It has a fully decentralized model; every node is identical and there is no single point of failure. It's also extremely fault tolerant; data is replicated to multiple nodes and across data centers. Cassandra is also very elastic; read and write throughput increase linearly as new machines are added.
