What I do is, I hash the useragent, tack the user ID the end of the string. When a user is not logged in, I check for the cookie, split the string, verify that the useragent is the same, and then proceed to log the user ID in. This btw is not too secure, but it is basically the way It is done. This is remember me btw. For an auto login like xtgem, an url with the username and unique identifier is given to you. This is bookmarked and when the user clicks it, the page makes the checks and logs users in.
