I expect it will vary by browser: some will start to render before the page is completely received; others will wait for the whole html file before starting. I note that the HTTP Response specification provides a "206 Partial Content" header which might offer some hope for a cross-browser solution which is worth looking into. There's almost certainly a number of ways to cut it, but my immediate idea would be to deliver the stub page, then use ajax to pull and render the fragments on demand. eg a lot of big sites seem to be delivering a minimal view initally, then if you scroll down enough it fires an ajax request to retrieve more data and append it to the page. eg: facebook, slashdot. I can't imagine this being too hard to implement; even with coldfusion. You start the spinner when you fire the ajax request and stop it when the callback is invoked.
