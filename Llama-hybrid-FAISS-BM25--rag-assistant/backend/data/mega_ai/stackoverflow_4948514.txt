Does jQuery UI's sortable has a bug when the handle is outside the element?

I have a list of dynamically added fields which uses jquery UI's sortable() . I have a dragging icon inside a absolute positioned tip that has each fields options. When I try to sort the fields up and down, the placeholder (it's a red box in the demo) doesn't move. After some testing I found that If I remove the position: absolute; css rule using firebug it works, but that breaks the layout. Here is a demo of the problem: http://mahersalam.co.cc/projects/namodgMaker/ First add 2 or more fields, then try to drag one of them to see the problem. How can I fix this problem ? Update : I tried to make the tip outside of the sorted field by using negative margins and floating and the problem still happened, maybe it's a jquery UI bug ?
