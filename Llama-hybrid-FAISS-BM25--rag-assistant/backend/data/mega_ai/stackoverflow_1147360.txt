If you want to use the built in session API, you should implement your own Session-State Store Provider . Should not be too hard, since you can change the storage model only, and do not have to worry about acquiring and releasing session state for requests, this is done by the built-in Session state provider. Edit: It seems that Oracle themselves provides an implementation of Session state, that you could use. http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/dotnet/aspnet/index.html
