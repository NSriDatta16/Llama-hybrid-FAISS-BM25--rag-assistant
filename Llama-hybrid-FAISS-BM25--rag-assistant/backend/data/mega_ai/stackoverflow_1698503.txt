You can could use the Web Developer Toolbar for this. The changes you make in its CSS editor ( CSS > Edit CSS ) are applied to the page immediately (without saving to file), but it also has a Save... option, so you can overwrite the existing CSS file with it. It's a pretty basic text field, though, that just displays the plain CSS file. It doesn't have any syntax highlighting nor organize the CSS rules according to the cascade etc. like Firebug does. Also see this related question: Why canâ€™t I save CSS changes in FireBug?
