How to solve MALA when the target density is known up to a constant?

If you look at the wikipedia explanation of Metropolis adjusted Langevin Algorithm, the acceptance ratio is given by The second equation involves taking the gradient of the log of $\pi(x)$. However, the whole reason for doing MCMC is that you do not know the exact formula for $\pi(x)$, only within a multiplicative constant. That's why take the ratio as shown in the 1st equation is ok. So how do you implement MALA given this limitation?
