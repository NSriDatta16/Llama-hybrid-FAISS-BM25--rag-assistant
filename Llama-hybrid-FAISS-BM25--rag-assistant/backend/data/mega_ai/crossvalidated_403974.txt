Biased coins: Probability such that the first player throws heads

Let $A$ , $B$ be the two players. Each one has a coin has a probability of getting heads of $p_i$ . Player $A$ always starts first. What is the probability such that $A$ wins? Ex. The both coins land 'heads' on average 1 out of 2 times. The solution says $\frac{1}{2}$ as the result. My approach was to draw a probability tree and compute the probability such that $A$ throws heads. We know, that this is geometrically distributed, but don't know how to get the result.
