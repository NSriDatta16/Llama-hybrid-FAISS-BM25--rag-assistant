{ if (i % 2 != 1) i++; } fprintf(feven, "%d", even); fscanf(dog, "%d", &number[i]); else { i % 2 == 1; i++; } Should be: if (i % 2 != 1) { i++; fprintf(feven, "%d", even); fscanf(dog, "%d", &number[i]); } else { i % 2 == 1; //BTW this doesn't do anything. i++; } EDIT: I've taken a few liberties so this might not be exactly your intent but it should be close enough. You need to work on a lot of small things which hopefully looking at the code will help with. Remember to understand what the functions do. And walk before you run. #include #include int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { int number; // check to make sure that all the file names are entered if (argc != 4) { printf("Usage: %s \n", argv[0]); exit(1); } FILE *dog = fopen(argv[1], "r"); FILE *feven = fopen(argv[2], "w"); FILE *fodd = fopen(argv[3], "w"); // check whether the file has been opened successfully if (dog == NULL) { printf("File %s cannot open!\n", argv[1]); exit(1); } if (feven == NULL) { printf("File %s cannot open!\n", argv[2]); exit(1); } if (fodd == NULL) { printf("File %s cannot open!\n", argv[3]); exit(1); } while (fscanf(dog, "%d", &number) == 1) { if (number % 2 == 0) fprintf(feven, "%d ", number); else fprintf(fodd, "%d ", number); } fprintf(feven, "\n"); fprintf(fodd, "\n "); fclose(dog); fclose(feven); fclose(fodd); }
