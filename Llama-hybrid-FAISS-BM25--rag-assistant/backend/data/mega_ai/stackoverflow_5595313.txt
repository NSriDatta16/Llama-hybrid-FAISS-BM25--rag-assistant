In my experience going down the cookie path can lead to bloat in that every user interaction someone wants to persist becomes another cookie. Cookies slow down the responsiveness of websites. Don't forget, cookies are sent by the browser each time it accesses that server. I think what you should really ask yourself is what is the benefit of persisting this have on your site? It is purely cosmetic; a nice to have feature if the user has JavaScript enabled? What is the impact if JavaScript is disabled? That said, if you want to use jQuery to read/write your cookies you will need one of the (many) jQuery cookie plugins. I think the most well known is this one . Or have a look at Can jQuery read/write cookies to a browser? which has some good answers. Personally, I think progressive enhancement is the way to go. Support the automatic display of the slideToggle() s by using local storage to persist/read the data to/from. No cookies to worry about as you have simple client-side persistence. The major drawback of course is that this is relatively new and not all browsers support it . If progressive enhancement (which amongst other things means offering users with modern browsers an enhanced version of the page) does not fit in with your requirements and you have to implement this feature for older browsers as well, you may want to look at store.js and a nice article on why it is good.
