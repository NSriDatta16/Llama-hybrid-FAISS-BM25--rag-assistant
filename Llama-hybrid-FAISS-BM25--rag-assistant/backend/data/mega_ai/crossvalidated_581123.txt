ARIMA makes assumptions about the distribution of the innovations - specifically, it assumes they are normally distributed with mean zero. In the course of fitting an ARIMA model, the variance of this distribution is estimated. Thus, a fitted ARIMA model will not only give you a point forecast, but a full predictive density . So my recommendation would be to sample from this predictive density. In R: library(forecast) model In your particular case, you note you have ten different time series. You can fit an ARIMA model to each of them, and sample 100 future realizations from each, for 1,000 samples altogether. (Whether this makes sense depends on how your ten original time series hang together.) Note that each sample will of course come from the same fitted ARIMA model. But ARIMA models come with model uncertainty (pertaining to the model form, i.e., the AR, MA and integration orders), as well as parameter uncertainty (pertaining to the values of the parameter estimates). If you want to capture these, you could slightly perturb your original time series, then fit a model, then sample just once from this model. Do this entire process 100 times for each time series, and you will get a far wider range of simulations, which will likely be more realistic. Of course, fitting 100 times as many models will also take much more time.
