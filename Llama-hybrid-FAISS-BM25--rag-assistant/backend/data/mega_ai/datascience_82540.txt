How can I make a better unsupervised text classifier model? Is POS tagging part of Machine Learning and Data science?

I have got complaints data, which is not good, and often contains less than 3 words in every complaint (sometimes so short that only one word of them makes sense). The objective is to find what's trending in these complaints i.e. what people are complaining about. I tried LDA/NMF and other topic modeling techniques but it's not performing well and mixing up different complaints in one. Also, there is no way to monitor these techniques in Production and monitor the performance (what if new types of complaints start coming in the future and the classes start mixing up? I can not fix the number of classes in LDA in production.). To add, LDA/NMF models are computationally expensive. I built a system to identify Verbs and Nouns as keywords (using texthero - off course after extensive cleaning and lemmatization) and make classes of every complaint being received. Like 100 complaints being received are "delivery" related, another 50 are "quality" related, etc. So far, this system seems to have performed the best, and without any misclassification (obviously). Now I have two questions: Is POS tagging part of Data Science and Machine learning? I am in a Data science role and how can I justify this work? Is there anything else that I can try given such a dataset?
