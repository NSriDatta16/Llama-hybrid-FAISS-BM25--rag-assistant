Yes, a foreign key is a type of constraint. MySQL has uneven support for constraints: PRIMARY KEY : yes as table constraint and column constraint. FOREIGN KEY : yes as table constraint, but only with InnoDB and BDB storage engines; otherwise parsed but ignored. CHECK : supported as table constraint and column constraint in MySQL 8.0.16 and later; parsed but ignored in earlier versions. UNIQUE : yes as table constraint and column constraint. NOT NULL : yes as column constraint. DEFERRABLE and other constraint attributes: no support. The CONSTRAINT clause allows you to name the constraint explicitly, either to make metadata more readable or else to use the name when you want to drop the constraint. The SQL standard requires that the CONSTRAINT clause is optional. If you leave it out, the RDBMS creates a name automatically, and the name is up to the implementation.
