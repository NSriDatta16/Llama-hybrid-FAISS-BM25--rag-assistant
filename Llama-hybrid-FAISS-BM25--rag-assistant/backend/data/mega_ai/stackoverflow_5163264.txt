You have two "good" choices in my mind. The first is to initiate a post request every time the ordering changes. You might be changing the ordering using jQuery UI sortable . Most libraries that support dragging and dropping also allow you to put an event callback on the drop simply within the initialization function. In this even callback, you'd initiate the $.post as you have written it in your code (although I would urge you to look up the actual documentation on the matter to make sure you're POSTing to the correct location). The second strategy is to piggyback on a form submission action. If you're using the jQuery Form Plugin to handle your form submissions, they allow you to indicate a before serialize callback where you can simply add into your form a field that specifies the ordering of the elements. In both cases, you'd need to write your own function that actually serializes the element IDs. Something like the following would do just fine (totally untested; may contain syntax errors): var order = []; $('span.myElement').each(function(){ // N.B., "this" here is a DOM element, not a jQuery container order.push(this.id); }); return order.join(',');
