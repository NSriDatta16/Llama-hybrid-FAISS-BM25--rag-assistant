RegEx: Split String at Capitalized Letters and Non-capitalized letters to Create Small Cap Fonts

So i've purposefully stayed away from RegEx as just looking at it kills me...ugh. But now I need it and could really use some help to do this in .NET (C# or VB.NET). I need to split a string based on capitalization or lack thereof. For example: I'm not upPercase "I" "'m not up" "P" "ercase" or FBI Agent Winters "FBI A" "gent " "W" "inters" The reason I'm doing this is to manually create small caps, in which non-capitalized strings will be sent to uppercase and their font size made 80% of the original font size. Appreciate any help that could be provided here.
