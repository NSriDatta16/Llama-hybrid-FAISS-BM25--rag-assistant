How to know when an DOM element moves or is resized

I'd like to know if there is a DOM event to listen for that tells me when a DOM element moves is repositioned or is resized on the page. I am not talking about an elements being drag/dropped. An example is if a have a list of three items on a page, and I use JS to remove one of the top two list items from the page (or hide it or whatever), I'd like to attach a handler to run when the third list item gets moved up in the page. I am using jQuery, so plain javascript or jQuery answers are acceptable. Maybe there are no move/position/resize events at the element level, so if there is a page/doc level event that will tell me that the page was repainted and I can check if I need to call a function again? Background I put a transparent div over an element while a webservice call is made to delete that element. Since I need to absolutely position that overlay div, I want it to track the element that it covers initially. In effect anchoring it to the base element.
