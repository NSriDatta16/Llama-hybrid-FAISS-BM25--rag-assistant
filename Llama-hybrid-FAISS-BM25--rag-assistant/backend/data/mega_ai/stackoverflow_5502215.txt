Organizing files in Cocos2d

I have just started learning Cocos2d using the great tutorials Ray Wenderlich has produced. However I'm getting to a point where my HelloWorldScene main file is getting a little large. I would like to be able to sort sprite generation methods into one file, misc. methods into another and so on, leaving me with the core level files containing the different scenes and init methods. Is it possible to copy methods over to a new .m file and bring them into the HelloWorldScene.m when I need them? How do you organize your game files?
