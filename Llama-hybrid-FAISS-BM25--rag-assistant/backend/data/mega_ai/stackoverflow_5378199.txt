Its up to you really and what are you used to, just be consistent whit naming. I name my controls like: lblUsername, txtAddress, btnSave, chbRemeberMe, cmbCategory... After some time you may not remember how and why you called something the way you did. But you may know that you are looking for textbox or button. Since we read from left to right, i think this way is better, more organised and easier to find controls.
