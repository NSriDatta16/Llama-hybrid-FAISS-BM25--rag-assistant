As the range of the integral is $(0,1)$ , it is better to take an importance density restricted to $(0,1)$ like the Uniform $\mathcal U(0,1)$ or a Beta $\mathcal Be(a,b)$ , rather than an importance function with a larger support like Exponential or Normal. Intuitively, including a random number of zeroes in the Monte Carlo average is both a waste of computer time and an unnecessary source of randomness! Here is a comparison of the four (for 10³ simulations, replicated 10² times): that seems to put a black mark on the Beta. However, the choice of a Beta $\mathcal B(2,1)$ is quite poor as $$\frac{\exp(-x)}{x^{2-1}(1-x)^{1-1}}$$ has infinite variance. Using instead a Beta $\mathcal B(1/2,1)$ leads to much better performances: As a final experiment, restricting the simulations of both Exponential and Normal variates to $(0,1)$ leads to an obvious improvement with a zero variance in the case of the truncated Exponential importance function, since it uses the probability of being between $0$ and $1$ , which is the value of the integral itself.
