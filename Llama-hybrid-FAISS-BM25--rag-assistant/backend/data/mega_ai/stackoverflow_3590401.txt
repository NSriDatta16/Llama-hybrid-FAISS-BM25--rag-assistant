A symbol is a name for a thing. A variable is a mutable pointer to a mutable storage location. In the code snippet you showed, both let and a are symbols. Within the scope of the let block, the symbol a denotes a variable which is currently bound to the value 1 . But the name of the thing is not the thing itself. The symbol a is not a variable. It is a name for a variable. But only in this specific context. In a different context, the name a can refer to a completely different thing. Example: the symbol jaguar may, depending on context, denote OSX 10.2 a gaming console a car manufacturer a ground attack military jet airplane another military jet airplane a supercomputer an electric guitar and a whole lot of other things oh, did I forget something?
