The main difference is the response variable. While logistic regression deals with a binary response in linear regression analysis and also nonlinear regression the response variable is continuous. You have a variable(s) (aka covariate(s)) that have a functional relationship to the continuous response variable. In the analysis of variance the response is continuous but belongs to a few different categories (e.g. treatment group and control group). In the analysis of variance you look for difference in the mean response between groups. In linear regression you look at how the response changes as the covariates change. Another way to look at the difference is to say that in regression the covariates are continuous whereas in analysis of variance they are a discrete set of groups.
