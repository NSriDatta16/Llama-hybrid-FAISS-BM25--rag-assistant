Dynamically added javascript not executed in Safari & IE

i'm having trouble executed a block of javascript that is dynamically loaded and insert into the page. This is the code that is loaded (simplified): i am html-code alert("i'm here"); This piece of code is injected with this Mootools command: new Element('div', { 'class': 'foo'+item_data[id].contenttype, 'id': '123', 'html': code }).inject($('presentation')); (The variable code contains the first code snippet.) In Firefox, this works. When the inject command is called, the paragraph is displayed and the javascript is executed. In IE and Safari, only the paragraph is displayed. Any hints how I can cope with this problem without 'eval'? Thx in advance.
