"A mixin is a fragment of a class in the sense that it is intended to be composed with other classes or mixins." -DDJ A mixin is a class or code fragment which is not intended for stand-alone use, but instead you're supposed to use it inside of another class. Either composing it as a member field/variable or as a code segment. I have the most exposure to the later. It's a little better than copy-pasting boilerplate code. Here's a great DDJ article that introduces the subject. The Half-Life 2 / "Source" SDK is a great example of C++ mixins. In that environment macros define sizable blocks of code which can be added to give the class a specific "flavor" or feature. Look at the Source wiki example: Authoring a Logical Entity . In the example code the DECLARE_CLASS macro can be considered a mixin. Source SDK uses mixins extensively to standardize the data-access code and ascribe behaviors to entities.
