Note that there a several ways to do a factor analysis which differ in the way you extract the factors: "Principal Factors", "Principal Component Factors", "Iterated Factors", "Maximum-Likelihood" are, for instance, implemented in Stata. In Principal Factors, for example, you start by calculating the RÂ² for each variable on all other variables and use them as a lower bound of communality. They are saved in an extra matrix which you subtract from the original correlation matrix. Then you continue by calculating a SVD on this reduced data matrix. PCA is simply a SVD on the original data's correlation matrix. Therefore you can see differences. Rotation only refers to the rotation after the extraction.
