Add tuning stage to DVC pipeline

I have an ML pipeline built with DVC that I use for experiment tracking. This allows running and tracking several experiments. Also, using hydra integration I can grid search hyper parameters. However, I would like to tune hyper parameters using more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., bayesian optimisation) through Keras Tuner for example. I am aware that I can just write a script using Keras Tuner. However, I would like to avoid duplicating the code and also integrate the tuning into the pipeline so that tuning is dependent on stages like data import and preprocessing. My question is what is the best way to do this.
