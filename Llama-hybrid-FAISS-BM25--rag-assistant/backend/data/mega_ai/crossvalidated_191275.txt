I could assume that this meta-analysis is conducted with a Bayesian approach. A credibility value is sort of a confidence interval with a probability distribution. You can read more here: Wikipedia Focusing on the second paragraph you can see different methods to choose a credibility value for the interval: Credible intervals are not unique on a posterior distribution. Methods for defining a suitable credible interval include: Choosing the narrowest interval, which for a unimodal distribution will involve choosing those values of highest probability density including the mode. This is sometimes called the highest posterior density interval. Choosing the interval where the probability of being below the interval is as likely as being above it. This interval will include the median. This is sometimes called the equal-tailed interval. Assuming that the mean exists, choosing the interval for which the mean is the central point. It is possible to frame the choice of a credible interval within decision theory and, in that context, an optimal interval will always be a highest probability density set.
