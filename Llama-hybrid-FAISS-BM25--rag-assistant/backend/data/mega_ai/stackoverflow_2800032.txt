How do I regenerate statistics in Openx?

Due to faulty hardware, statistics generated over a 2 week period were significantly higher than normal (10000 times higher than normal). After moving the application to a new server, the problem rectified itself. The issue I have is that there are 2 weeks of stats that are clearly wrong. I have checked the raw impressions table for the affected fortnight and it seems to be correct (ie. stats per banner per day match the average for the previous month). Looking at the intermediate & summary impressions tables, the values are inflated. I understand from the openx forum ( link text ) it's possible to regenerate stats from the raw data but it will only regenerate stats per hour, meaning regenerating stats for 2 weeks would be very time consuming. Is there another, more efficient way to regenerate the stats from the raw data for the affected fortnight?
