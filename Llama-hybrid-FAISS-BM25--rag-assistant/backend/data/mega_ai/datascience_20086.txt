Multioutput regression with MLPRegressor - Does it work?

I apologize if this has been addressed before, but I did not find a solution for this issue. I am currently trying to solve a problem with four dependent variables and four independent variables, all non-categorial. They seem to have non-linear dependence and multicolinearity - standard multivariate regression yielded reasonable results, but I am trying to compare them with results from Random Forest and Neural Networks. According to this link , it should be possible to get multi-output with the MLPRegressor. However, when I try to apply the .fit method, I get an error message: fit() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y' Here is the code that I am using: # Data Preprocessing - Importing the Libraries import pandas as pd # Importing the dataset dataset = pd.read_csv('Rock_Properties_4T.csv') y = dataset.iloc[:, 4:8].values X = dataset.iloc[:, 0:4].values # ANN from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor regressor_ANN = MLPRegressor(tol = 1e-16) MLPRegressor.fit(X, y) There you go... Any idea of what could be the problem?
