Methods for determining temporal covariance among many time series?

We are trying to quantify synchrony in water chemistry variation among several thousand sites. For each site we have a time-series of concentration. We'd like to quantify the overall temporal covariance (are concentrations going up and down at the same time) among the sites and are interested in different statistical approaches to to do this. The different chemistry parameters have very different absolute concentrations (e.g. 1-100 ppm for carbon, 0.001 to 1 ppm for phosphorus) so a relative metric is necessary. We have done this previously with the mean of pairwise scaled covariances ( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12897 ), but there surely is a more elegant method . . . We are happy to use R, Pyton, or Matlab. Thanks!
