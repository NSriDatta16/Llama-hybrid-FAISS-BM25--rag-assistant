Call function with parameters via databinding

OK Im at a crossroads with something. Take a gander at the code below. I have a data repeater, and throughout the repeater I want to call GetNavUrl, supplying it with a parameter found in my data I am binding with. NavigateUrl=' ' So, for example, I want navigateURL to equal the result of GetNavUrl(123), Any ideas? thx!
