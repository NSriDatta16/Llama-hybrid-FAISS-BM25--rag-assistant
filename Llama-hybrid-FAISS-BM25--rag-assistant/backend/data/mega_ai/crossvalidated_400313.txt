Alert: Not an expert, but have had some experience with seasonal data of different frequencies. Like other econometric timeseries, GDP data can be broken into Trend, Seasonality and Noise. To predict the trend, annual timeseries (constructed from summing quarters) might be enough to predict next Calendar Year's (CY) GDP To predict, next quarter's GDP, we need to know what % of Next CY's GDP comes from next quarter. This you can infer from 18 quarterly points, e.g the annual GDP is decomposed into: Q1:20%, Q2:30%, Q3:10%, Q4:40% To estimate noise in quarterly forecast, you can probably use last 18 quarter's stdev. Other possibilities: Option 1: You can convert all your quarterly numbers into annual numbers and get a longer time series Advantage: Simplicity Disadvantage: We're wasting information stored in quarterly frequency e.g. cyclical variations Option 2: Convert all annual numbers into quarterly numbers by either expectation maximization through likelihood or multiple imputation methods Advantage: Information of frequency is retained Disadvantage: Since data is NMAR, quarterly values imputed for earlier periods might just not have enough value and may bias your results since it's a longer time interval
