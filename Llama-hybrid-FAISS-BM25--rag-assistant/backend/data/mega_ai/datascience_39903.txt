The problem is you do not need to pass through your parameters through the PCA algorithm again (essentially what it looks like you are doing is the PCA twice). Just add the .explained_variance_ratio_ to the end of the variable that you assigned the PCA to. For example try: pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(df_transform) Setting instead your var_exp = to: var_exp = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
