If the goal is to obtain $Pr(\theta | Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n)$ where the $Y$s are the cumulative data, then a simply application of Bayes Rule shows that: $$Pr(\theta | Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n) = \frac{Pr( Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n | \theta) Pr(\theta)}{Pr(Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n)}$$ And under the assumption of independence of the $Y$s (being consecutive observations across time): $$Pr(Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n) = Pr(Y_1) \cdot Pr( Y_2) \cdot \ldots \cdot Pr(Y_n)$$ and also $$Pr(Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n | \theta) = Pr(Y_1| \theta) \cdot Pr( Y_2| \theta) \cdot \ldots \cdot Pr(Y_n| \theta)$$ So you see that yes you can run the analyses sequentially if the time series is independent. Alternately, if there is a time series autocorrelated effect, you can rely on the general factorization of the likelihood $$Pr(Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n) = Pr(Y_1) \cdot Pr( Y_2 | Y_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot Pr(Y_n | Y_{n-1} \ldots, Y_2, Y_1)$$ So by simply modeling the autocorrelation using some form of ARIMA or something, you can run a sequential analysis.
