Suppose you deal with a linear regression $y=X\beta$ , where a common estimator is $\hat\beta=(X'X)^{-1}y'X$ . The variance (uncertainty) $\hat\sigma_\beta$ of the estimator $\hat\beta$ is inversely proportional to the variance of the data $\Omega_X=X'X/n$ . So, if you replace the variables with PCA factors $F=AX$ , then you would like to preserve the variance because: a) if you decrease the variance, then you increase the variance of the estimators $\hat\beta_F$ , on the other hand b) if you increase the variance, it is only through artificial noise amplification, and the increased precision of the estimator $\beta_F$ is not real, i.e. you'll be underestimating the uncertainty of the coefficients.
