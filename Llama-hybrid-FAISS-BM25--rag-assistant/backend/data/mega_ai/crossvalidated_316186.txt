In what way does the RV coefficient measure similarity?

The Pearson correlation coefficient is a cosine between two vectors. That's easy to understand but what happens when instead we look at the correlation between two matrices through the RV coefficient? I get the math that goes on but intuitively what is the similarity that is being measured? I thought it would be something like average pairwise cosine between the vectors but I can't relate that to the calculations.
