What is lagrangian?

I'm watching an SVM tutorial . At 6:38 he mentions lagrangian , which is a term I'm not familiar with. So I googled it, hoping to find the Wikipedia article about it, but it seems like this term is actually ambiguous, and Wikipedia suggests several articles. Which of the suggested articles should I read in order to understand the meaning of lagrangian in this context?
