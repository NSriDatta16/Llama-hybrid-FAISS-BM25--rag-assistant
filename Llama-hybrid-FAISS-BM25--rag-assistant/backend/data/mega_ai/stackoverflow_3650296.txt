If size is important to you I think you are worrying about the wrong thing. You are more likely to include unused code, or DLLs, or large resources, than have names that are too long. Remember the file is zipped and text compression is very good so the effect of repeating the same long control name 1000s of times is minimal. Also don't forget to re-zip your XAP files with better zip software (as the zip compression you get in XAP files built by Visual Studio is not optimal!) You are much better off worrying about progressive loading as most Silverlight apps out there are way too bulky (and take way more than the expected/recommended 8 second attention span of most web-users).
