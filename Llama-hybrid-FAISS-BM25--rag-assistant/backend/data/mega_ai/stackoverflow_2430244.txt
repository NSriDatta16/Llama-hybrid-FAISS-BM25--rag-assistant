Making GWT application crawlable by a search engine

I want to use the #! token to make my GWT application crawlable, as described here: http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/ There is a GWT sample app available online that uses this, for example: http://gwt.google.com/samples/Showcase/Showcase.html#!CwRadioButton Will serve the following static webpage to the googlebot: http://gwt.google.com/samples/Showcase/Showcase.html?_escaped_fragment_=CwRadioButton I want my GWT app to do something similar. In short, I'd like to serve a different flavor of the page whenever the _escaped_fragment_ parameter is found in the URL. What should I modify in order for the server to serve something else (a static page, or a page dynamically generated through a headless browser like HTML Unit )? I'm guessing it could be the web.xml file, but I'm not sure. (Note: I thought of checking the Showcase app provided with the GWT SDK, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to support serving static files on _escaped_fragment_ and it doesn't use the #! token..)
