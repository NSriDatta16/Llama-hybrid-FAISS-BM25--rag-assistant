For C++, section 12.7, paragraph 3 of the Standard covers this case. To summarize, this is legal. It will resolve to the correct function to the type of the constructor being run. Therefore, adapting your example to C++ syntax, you'd be calling BaseObject::LoadState() . You can't get to ChildObject::LoadState() , and trying to do so by specifying the class as well as the function results in undefined behavior. Constructors of abstract classes are covered in section 10.4, paragraph 6. In brief, they may call member functions, but calling a pure virtual function in the constructor is undefined behavior. Don't do that.
