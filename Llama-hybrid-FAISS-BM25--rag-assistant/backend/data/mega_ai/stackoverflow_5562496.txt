You are getting the term data hiding wrong. It is not hiding from the user, it means hiding from the other programmers. For example, you are using a Stack class developed by another programmer. You have methods to push and pop value. But you don't know how the stack is actually implemented. It could have used an array, or it could have used a linked list to store the values. But you don't care about that details as a user of the class. You all know that you can push and pop to and from it. Here the internal data of stack is hidden from you. It's the responsibly of the developer of stack to maintain the internal storage, not yours when you are using that.
