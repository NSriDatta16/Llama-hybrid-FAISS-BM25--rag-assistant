Residuals for logistic regression and Cook's distance

Are there any particular assumptions regarding the errors for logistic regression such as the constant variance of the error terms and the normality of the residuals? Also typically when you have points that have a Cook's distance larger than 4/n, do you remove them? If you do remove them, how can you tell if the model with the removed points is better?
