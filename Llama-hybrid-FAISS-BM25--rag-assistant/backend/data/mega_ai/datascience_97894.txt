Conditional variational autoencoder: Feeding labeled MNIST to encoder with Keras

I am looking for a code implementation of a CVAE using MNIST in Keras. I found this Youtube video: https://youtu.be/8wrLjnQ7EWQ that does VAE, but I am not sure how do I convert this and make encoder to take in labels as well. I have: ont-hot encoded the lables normalized images reshaped them Now I want to feed it to the encoder. I have this following code: input_img = Input(shape=[input_shape], name='encoder_input') x = Conv2D(32, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(input_img) x = Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same', activation='relu', strides=(2, 2))(x) x = Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(x) x = Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(x) conv_shape = K.int_shape(x) # Shape of conv to be provided to decoder How do I modify input to pass labels with the image data? PS: This code only works with keras 1x compatibility. Would be interested to know how to convert it to so it works in keras 2x as well. I am fairly new so help will be appreciated.
