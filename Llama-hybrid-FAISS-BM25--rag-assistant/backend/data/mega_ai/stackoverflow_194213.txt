Database and version control system

I'm work on project with django framework and use control version system to synchronize my code with other peoples. But i don't know how organize work with database. In django, any people, worked on project, may changes django models, and tell 'syncdb' to synchronize model objects with db. But other people don't about this changes, and it's code revision may not works. Please, tell me some ways to solve this problem (maybe, different db or something another). Thanks, and excuse my english :)
