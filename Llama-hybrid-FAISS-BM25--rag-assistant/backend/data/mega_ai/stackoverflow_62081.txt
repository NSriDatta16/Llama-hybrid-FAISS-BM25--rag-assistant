Just to add my thoughts to the stack I always prefer to use the axes explicitly in my XPath, more verbose but clearer IMHO. Depending on how the rest of the XML documents looks (assuming this is just a fragment) you might need to constrain the reference to "ancestor::people" for example using "ancestor::people[1]" to constrain to the first people ancestor.
