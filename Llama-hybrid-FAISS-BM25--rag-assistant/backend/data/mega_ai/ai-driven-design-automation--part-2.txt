 aimed to build an open source, independent toolchain. It used machine learning, parallelization and divide and conquer approaches. A much-publicized but controversial demonstration of RL's potential came from Google researchers between 2020 and 2021. They created a deep reinforcement learning method for planning the layout of a chip, known as floorplanning. They reported that this method created layouts that were as good as or better than those made by human experts, and it did so in less than six hours. This method used a type of network called a graph convolutional neural network. It showed that it could learn general patterns that could be applied to new problems, getting better as it saw more chip designs. The technology was later used to design Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) accelerators. However, in the original paper, the improvement (if any) from AI was not demonstrated. There was no comparison with existing non-AI tools performing the same task, and since the data is proprietary, no ability for anyone else to perform this comparison. Various efforts to reproduce the AI algorithm, and compare its results with various commercial and academic tools, have yielded mixed results with no conclusive advantage to AI. 2020s: Autonomous systems and agents Entering the 2020s, the industry saw the commercial launch of autonomous AI driven EDA systems. For example, Synopsys launched DSO.ai (Design Space Optimization AI) in early 2020, calling it the first autonomous artificial intelligence application for chip design in the industry. This system uses reinforcement learning to search for the best ways to optimize a design within the huge number of possible solutions, trying to improve power, performance, and area (PPA). By 2023, DSO.ai had been used in over 100 commercial chip productions, which proved that the industry was widely adopting it. Synopsys later grew its AI tools into a suite called Synopsys.ai. The goal was to use AI in the entire EDA workflow, including verification and testing. These advancements, which combine modern AI methods with cloud computing and large data resources, have led to talks about a new phase in EDA. Industry experts and participants sometimes call this 'EDA 4.0'. This new era is defined by the widespread use of AI and machine learning to deal with growing design complexity, automate more of the design process, and help engineers handle the huge amounts of data that EDA tools create. The purpose of EDA 4.0 is to optimize product performance, get products to market faster and make development and manufacturing smoother through intelligent automation. Applications Artificial intelligence (AI) is now used in many stages of the electronic design workflow. It aims to improve productivity, get better results, and handle the growing complexity of modern integrated circuits. AI helps designers from the very first ideas about architecture all the way to manufacturing and testing. High level synthesis and architectural exploration In the first phases of chip design, AI helps with High Level Synthesis (HLS) and exploring different system level design options (DSE). These processes are key for turning general ideas into detailed hardware plans. AI algorithms, often using supervised learning, are used to build simpler, substitute models. These models can quickly guess important design measurements like area, performance, and power for many different architectural options or HLS settings. For example, the Ithemal tool uses deep neural networks to estimate how fast basic code blocks will run, which helps in making processor architecture decisions. Similarly, PRIMAL uses machine learning for guessing power use at the register transfer level (RTL), giving early information about how much power the chip will use. Reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian optimization are also used to guide the DSE process. They help search through the many parameters to find the best HLS settings or architectural details like
