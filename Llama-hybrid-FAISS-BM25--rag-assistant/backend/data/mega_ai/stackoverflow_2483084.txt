It's possible to not use Xcode, but trying to develop iPhone apps without it would make your life so much harder I'd strongly encourage you to use it. You'll have to install the dev tools that includes it anyway, and it's mandatory for deploying the app on the iPhone to test it so you may as well get using it now.
