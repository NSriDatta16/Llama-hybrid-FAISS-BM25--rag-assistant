Your whole modeling framework is inefficient because a large fraction of observations cluster in a small fraction of the range. You would benefit from switching to log(Profit) and log(Number of Employees). Then the effects you are seeing will be less pronounced. Then the fitted distribution of the small companies will not be as influenced by the long tail of big companies. Currently you are simply not fitting the small companies well. In formal terms, big companies are currently acting as high-leverage points . Switching to logarithms is a well-known trick in economics, finance, etc.
