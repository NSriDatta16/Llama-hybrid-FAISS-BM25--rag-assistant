Well, as I see you have something like 2 populations, where [ones/whole_population] 6/30 & 17/30 are computed as weights, being weighted average... but you didn't prove the Normality of your distribution - with any test - { moreover, your experimental data more suits binomial distribution - having either 0 or 1 output, not Normal !!}... - & as so as C.I.=mean+/-3*sqrt(variance) IS VALID only for Normal distributed variables -- you're getting strange results
