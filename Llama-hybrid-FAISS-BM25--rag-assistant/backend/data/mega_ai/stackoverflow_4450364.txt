You may want to consider first adding the private key (or keys) to the authentication agent. From that point and on, all ssh commands will re-use the cached key: # Add a new key to the authentication agent $ ssh-add # List current keys $ ssh-add -l # Delete all loaded keys $ ssh-add -D # Add a new key and store the passphrase in your keychain $ ssh-add -K $ ssh-add -K # After storing the private keys passphrase in the keychain, # you can load them all, at any time $ ssh-add -k When the authentication agent has a private key loaded, you should be able to use Xcode to connect to (domainname or IP) with no problems.
