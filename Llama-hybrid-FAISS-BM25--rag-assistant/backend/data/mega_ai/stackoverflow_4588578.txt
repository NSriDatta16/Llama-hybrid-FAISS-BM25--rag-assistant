You didn't mention the type of error message you're getting. Was it something like Cannot find "php" or something else. You might be having trouble with quotes. Here's a few recommendations: Use qq() instead of quotation marks. That'll make things a bit cleaner. Build the command into a variable called $command which you can print out in case you have errors. That might help you understand where you maybe having a problem. Set a variable called $error when executing system , and then check that variable. It's a lot clearer than the backwards style of and/or stuff that you have to do on failure and success, and it's a lot easier to maintain. Example: my $argString = qq("$args{NUM_AGENTS}" "$args{HOST_NAME}" ) . qq( "$procStartTime" "$i" "$args{TARGET_PAGE}" "resplogfile" ) . qq("$reqlogfile" "$args{USER_NAME}" "$args{USER_PASS}" ) . qq("$execDelay" "$args{COMMON_SID}"); my $command = qq(php loadAgent_curl.php $argString); my $error = system qq($command); if ($error) { die qq(ERROR: Failed to execute "$command"\n\n$!); } At least this way, you can see what command failed, and get a better idea why it might not have executed.
