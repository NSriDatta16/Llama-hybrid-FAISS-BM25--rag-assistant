The reason your second code doesn't work in IE is because in IE you have to explicitly enable ActiveX (or Flash) content by clicking on the object (an appropriate warning is shown too). The only way to overcome this is to use an alternative embedding option in the form of a JavaScript which basically uses document.write to place the content, bypassing the need for activating ActiveX. With and exception for the first code you have posted, I did manage to get the players working in IE7. Have you tried using the AC_FL_RunContent script for embedding ? It comes with Flash and I haven't had any problems with it so far. You can find more info about it and get it on the Adobe Developer Center website . Regarding the player that holds the audio/video controls, I got some weird behavior while trying to play the video in both IE and FF in the form of the buffering graphic being stuck on the screen along with the placeholder image while the sound already started playing. I have too tried a bunch of freeware players until I decided that I'm better off building my own. That of course, is a whole different can of worms.
