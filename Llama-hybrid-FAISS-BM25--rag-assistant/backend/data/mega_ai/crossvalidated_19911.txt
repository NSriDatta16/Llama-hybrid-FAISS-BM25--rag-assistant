Temporal analysis of variation in random effects

I am looking at patient data where the main outcome of interest is mortality within 30 days following hospitalisation with an emergency condition. I am working on data from 2003-2017, with approximately 100,000 observations per year. I had previously understood that this was to be a "simple" multilevel logistic analysis, with which I have some experience, but I have just learned that the main interest lies in the changes in hospital-level variation in the outcome during the period. So there is also a time series element to it, but the data are not repeat measurements at the patient level (in fact patients with multiple admissions are to be excluded). The clinical lead said he thought that the data should be sliced into a data set for each year, and the same model run on each data set and then look at how hospital-level variation has changed. This strikes me as not ideal. On the other hand I don't know what is ideal. Any suggestions or links to similar studies would be most appreciated.
