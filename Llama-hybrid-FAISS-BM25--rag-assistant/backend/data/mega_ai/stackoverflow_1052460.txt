Geolocation assisted ATM monitoring

we would like to write a web based application to monitor the ATM machines in the bank to have the following functionality: Display location of each terminal Display general status of the terminal in color coding or simple icon (ATM up/Down/needs attention, low cash, etc.) Have a facility to drill down on the status of the machine with more details (display counters, up time, etc.) Have the facility to zoom in the map and pan the map, and to search for locations by address or geo location The status of the machine is available in an Oracle database, and the geolocation is to be added to the terminal definition is there any ready open source API available to use to implement the above requirements? if there is something for Oracle it would be great PS: we are looking for an API to support the following countries (UAE and GCC, Kazakhistan, Egypt and North Africa) Thank you
