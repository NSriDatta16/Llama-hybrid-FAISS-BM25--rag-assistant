Accessing huge data from Remote Server in C#

I have a database based in NY and my HK users are trying to get the data from this database. The data retrieved is approximately 20 mb (if you save the Datatable as csv the file size is 20 mb). It is taking around 20 mins for the data to come. I am using SQL Server 2005 as database and c# as desktop application. I cannot have a separate database for HK Users due to budget constraints. Can anyone please suggest a way to bring the retrieval time to around 5 mins? Regards, Pavan
