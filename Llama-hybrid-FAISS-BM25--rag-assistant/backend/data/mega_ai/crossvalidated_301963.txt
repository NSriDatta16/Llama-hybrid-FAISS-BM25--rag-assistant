The first term -- the within-group variance -- is simply a weighted average of the variances within each group (the $s^2_i$ values). If the population variances are the same (as is assumed in ordinary ANOVA) this is a natural way to estimate the common population variance. (note that the term "subjects" just means the units you're taking the measurements on; whatever things had the values you collect) If there were no differences in population mean, the sample means would vary (be different from each other) just due to randomness. The amount they would vary is proportional to how much variation there is in the population about the population mean -- i.e. to the common population variance. Imagine for the moment all the groups are the same size. We could just treat the set of means for each group like a sample and calculate their variance. That would be smaller (because the means are less variable than the data they came from), but in a specific way we can calculate. (The situation is similar when the sample sizes differ but it's a bit more complicated; nevertheless we can still get something that's expected to be proportional to the variance. So we can actually scale the variation of the means from the overall average up to be an estimate $\sigma^2$ and if the population means are really the same it should be about the same size as the one from the within-group calculation, since they both estimate $\sigma^2$. On the other hand, if you shifted population means so that the population means were very different (other things being the same), the denominator wouldn't change, but the numerator would become larger -- besides the part due to noise there would be another part due to differences in population means. So the numerator would then be larger than the denominator, and your F statistic would tend to be bigger than you'd anticipate when the null hypothesis was true. My main aim was to find how F-statistic compares two models in ANOVA. That sounds like you're talking about partial F's; the F in one-way ANOVA may not be particularly helpful for that.
