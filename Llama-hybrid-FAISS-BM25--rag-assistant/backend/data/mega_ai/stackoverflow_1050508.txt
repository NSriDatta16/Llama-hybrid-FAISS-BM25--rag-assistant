Yep, you can have some serious performance issues. I have done this type of thing for years. Oracle, Sql, and DB2 - ugh. Sometimes I have had to set it up on a timer at 5:00am so when I get in at 7:00 it's done. If your dataset is significant enough, it is often faster to build a table locally and then link the data. For remote datasets, also look into passthroughs. For example, lets say you are pulling all of yesterday's customers from the oracle db and all of the customer purchases from the sql db. Let's say you have an average of 100 customers daily but a list of 30,000 and lets say your products have a list of 500,000. You could query the oracle db for your list of 100 customers, then write it as in IN statement in a passthrough query to the sql db. You'll get your data almost instantly. Or if your recordsets are huge, build local tables of the two IDs, compare them locally and then just pull the necessary matches. It's ugly but you can save yourself hours literally.
