"happily using CVS for over x years", is an interesting idea :-) It's a huge step up from keeping lots of copies, but ... I'm guessing you have got used to all it's quirks, or don't do much branching and merging. There is a worse possibility; People in your organisation have got used to cvs limitations and your work practises have adapted accordingly; for example never having more than one developer work on one package at a time, only using branching in emergencies etc. The basic principle is the more difficult something is, the less people do it.
