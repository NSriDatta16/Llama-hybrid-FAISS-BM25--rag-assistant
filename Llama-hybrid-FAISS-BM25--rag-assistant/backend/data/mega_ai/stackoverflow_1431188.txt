No, because you would never want to do this. What are you really trying to achieve? EDIT Based on more info coming in, here's what I think. If you just want "sticky state" per request, you should use the state on the Instance and use InstanceContextMode.PerCall, as per marc_s's response. If you need some state to be in thread-local storage for your call, you can consider using ICallContextInitializer as a way to marshal the state over to the thread that WCF chooses to invoke your method on (and clean the thread state when the call finishes). But you should not care about "which thread". WCF will handle that with a thread pool on your behalf.
