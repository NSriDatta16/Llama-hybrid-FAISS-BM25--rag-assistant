How to calculate an average cliff date?

Please let me know if this question belongs elsewhere. In my simple data set focused on sales pursuit opportunities, I have the following columns available. Pursuit Name Status(Open, Won, Lost) Date Entered Date Closed I need to calculate the an average "cliff" date value of when a pursuit will likely either lose or never close. So if another opportunity has been open for x number of days, we can say (based on past opportunities) that this will either never close or will be lost. My assumption is that this should be based on the difference between Date Entered and Date closed, but I'm unsure of the calculations needed to produce an average "Cliff date". Is there another term aside from cliff date I should be using? Are there any ideas of how this can be calculated? Thank you for your time.
