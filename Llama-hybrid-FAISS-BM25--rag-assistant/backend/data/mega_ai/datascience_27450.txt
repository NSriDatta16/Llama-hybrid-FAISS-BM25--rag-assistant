Deep learning technique to recognize a person's silhouette

I'm reading Nielsen's book on neural networks. In the first chapter you construct a neural net to recognize handwritten digits by training the network on 60,000 samples. I wonder how would you build a neural net to recognize a person by his/her silhouette? Is there some special technique to make it possible?
