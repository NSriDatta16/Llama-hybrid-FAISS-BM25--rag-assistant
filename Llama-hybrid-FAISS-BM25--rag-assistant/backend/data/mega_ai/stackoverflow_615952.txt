If you are working with ASP.Net you can use the built in membership API. It supports many types of storage options, inlcuding; one way hash, two way encryption, md5 + salt. http://www.asp.net/learn/security for more info. If you dont need anything too fancy, this is great for websites. If you are not using ASP.Net here is a good link to a few articles from 4guys and codeproject https://web.archive.org/web/20210519000117/http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/081705-1.aspx https://web.archive.org/web/20210510025422/http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/103002-1.aspx http://www.codeproject.com/KB/security/SimpleEncryption.aspx
