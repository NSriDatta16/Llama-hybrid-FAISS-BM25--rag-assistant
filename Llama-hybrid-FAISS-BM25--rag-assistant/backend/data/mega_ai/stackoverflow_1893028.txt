google.appengine.api is a library that contains Google's version of urlfetch class. Quoting from the manual : The URL Fetch service uses Google's network infrastructure for efficiency and scaling purposes. Python has url retrieval classes in its standard library too, but those whould not be able to use the infrastructure that is available inside App Engine. In short google.appengine.api urlfetch is more powerful, but there is nothing blocking from you from using Pythons own urllib either, that too is described in the manual page I linked above.
