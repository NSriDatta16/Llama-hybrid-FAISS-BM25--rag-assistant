Mixed-Effect Poisson Regression Model without count data

I have gone in circles reading about this for days and still not quite understanding. I have aggregated data at the state level and by year estimating breast cancer incidence rate per 100 k, mortality rate per 100 k, mortality-to-incidence ratio, and a number of aggregated socioeconomic predictors including number of hospitals, percent minority, and average income. I would like to fit a mixed effect model where my outcome variable is the mortality-to-incidence ratio, which ranges from 0 to 1. If my model meets poisson model assumptions, is this valid even though Im not using a count variable as my dependent?
