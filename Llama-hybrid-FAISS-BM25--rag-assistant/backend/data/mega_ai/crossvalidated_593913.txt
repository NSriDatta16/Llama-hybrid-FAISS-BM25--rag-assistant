logistic regression sample size calculation

I m trying to find if parental involvement can positively impact student's 4 year graduation rate. My target variable is student's graduation (yes / no) Main independent variable is whether parent attended first year orientation(yes / no) I am also considering other independent variables as sex, in/out of state, admitted time, major..etc. In this case, how can I calculate sample size? Should I decide variables first or calculate sample size first? Some equation include Odds ration in sample size calculation, but how can I know my OR at this point? Do I have to complete collecting sample data and run some test(normality.. or whatever) in order to have all ingredients for calculating sample size? - I have to request student data to univ department, that is why I am trying to get sample size before I send data request. Please give me simple and clear explanation. Sadly, I won't be understand any theoretical statistics reasoning behind sample size equation.....
