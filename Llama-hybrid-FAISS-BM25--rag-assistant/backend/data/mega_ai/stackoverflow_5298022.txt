If you type in kmeans you'll get the sourcecode of the method, available in pastebin at http://pastebin.com/6VnnhU7J . I'm not sure what you mean about the parameters as those are passed in as arguments (x, centers, iter.max = 10, nstart = 1, algorithm = c("Hartigan-Wong", "Lloyd", "Forgy", "MacQueen") and you have easy access to them (what did you call kmeans with originally?)
