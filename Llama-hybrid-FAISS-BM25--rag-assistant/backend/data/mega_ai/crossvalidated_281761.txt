Bayesian approach to inference. Why do we pick specific values as our hypothesis?

So say I'm dealing with M&M. I have 5 M&Ms and one of them is yellow. I want to know if the true proportion of M&Ms in the entire bag is 10% or 20%. In the frequentist approach, my hypothesis would be: H0: P = 10% H1: P > 10% However, in the Bayesian approach, I would say: H0: P = 10% H1: P = 20% Philosophically, why is this? Updated question I'm going to attempt to solve this using the Bayesian approach. What am I missing? Say our priors are: P(H1) = 0.5 P(H2) = 0.5 $P(k = 1 | H1) = 0.33$ (I used binomial distribution) $P(k = 1 | H2) = 0.41$ (I used binomial distribution) So, P(H1 | k = 1) = $\frac{0.5 * 33}{0.5 * 33 + 0.5 * 0.41} = 0.45$ P(H2 | k = 1) = $0.55$ So we choose H2.
