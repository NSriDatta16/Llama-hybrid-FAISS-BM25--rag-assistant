It sounds like a reinforcement learning problem to me: It's a high-dimensional input space with non-linear interactions The only way to get information from the system is to use it Its behavior is time-dependent given all the intricacies of laser/optics setups There is interplay between short-term and long-term rewards (multiple local maxima vs. a global max.) You can search "reinforcement learning matlab" and "markov decision process" for some available projects and tutorials.
