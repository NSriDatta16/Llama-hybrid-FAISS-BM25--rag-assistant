So you treat them as random so that there is an averaging effect between the overall average and the average for that particular factor based on the sample size of the factor and the overall number of observations. This allows you to say that your results apply to the population at large, since you have a type of weighted average and an estimate of the variation due to that factor, if not, you really can only say that your results apply to the factor levels you used since the regression will treat them as discrete factors and not random ones that get the weighted averaging. They are also useful when you have repeated measures on the same subject, since you can use them to account for the correlation between measures on the same subject.
