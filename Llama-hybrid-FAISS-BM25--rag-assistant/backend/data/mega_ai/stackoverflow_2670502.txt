This may be better split into three separate questions, but anyway: 1) The order of elements is important in XML, but it may not be to your application. Consider XML representing a book: clearly the order of paragraphs is paramount. As such, the XML in your second example is fine. 2) They are not equivalent XML documents, but your application may choose to see them as equivalent. Or not. XML is a format for describing things; it is up to applications to interpret them. You may want to look into XML Schema for ways to validate documents. 3) Elements can be duplicated in XML and their order is important. However a given document schema can enforce rules on uniqueness and/or ordering. Therefore, both sets and lists can be represented. I suppose you could consider raw XML an ordered list by default.
