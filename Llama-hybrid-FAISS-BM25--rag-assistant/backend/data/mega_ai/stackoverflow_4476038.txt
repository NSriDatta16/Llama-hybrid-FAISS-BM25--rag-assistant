Adding Thumbnail Image on "Related Products" on the Backend of Magento

When I add a new product at the backend, I am asked to choose the "related products", "Up-sells" and "Cross-sells". I would like to be able to see the thumbnail images here at the backend, so I can choose them quickly, rather than trying to choose them by name/sku.
