Clone a div and change the ID's of it and all it's children to be unique

Using JQuery it possible to clone a Div like this and change add a new identifier to it's ID and all it's children ID's? For instance I'd like to be able to clone this: Jane Doe John Doe And have it look like this: Jan Doe John Doe Or should I just rethink my structure and use rel attributes and reusable class declarations? Thanks, Tegan Snyder
