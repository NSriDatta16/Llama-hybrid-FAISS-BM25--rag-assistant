To put it simple boxing and unboxing takes alot of time. Why - beacuse it's faster to use known type from the start then let this handle for runtime. In colection of objects can contain differnt items : string, int, double, etc. and you must check every time that your operation with variable is corect. Convert from one type to enother takes time. Generic are much faster and encourage you to use them, old collections exist for backward compability
