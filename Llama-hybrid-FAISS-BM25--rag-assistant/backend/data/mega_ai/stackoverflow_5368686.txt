The problem is still the same as in your latest question. You are accumulating values in a variable and you must tell OpenMp how to do that: #pragma omp for reduction(+: dpp) for(size_t i=0; i Use a loop-local variable for the index and that is all you need, forget about all the stuff that you are doing around that. If you want to see then what the compiler is doing of your code run it with -S and check the assembler output. This can be very instructive, because you then learn what simple statements like that amount to when they are parallelized. And don't use int for loop indices. Sizes and stuff like that are size_t .
