I can't find the detailed fix (apparently, the work email I used at the time was trashing older messages without my knowledge!) but the short answer is to create one FLA that has all the components you want to use in it, set those components (and the ComponentShim) to 'Export for Runtime Sharing'. Then, in your other FLAs, whenever you want a component, drag it from the components FLA library (it should show up in your main library with 'Import for Runtime Sharing' turned on.) Make sure you don't have a ComponentShim in your main library. You'll need the compiled component SWF file in the same folder as your FLAs. What this does is keep all the component code, including skins, in one central place, so when you compile (be it as a SWF or a SWC, though this problem mainly crops up when using SWCs) there are no conflicts.
