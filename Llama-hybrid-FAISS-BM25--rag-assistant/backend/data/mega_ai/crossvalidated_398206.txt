The issue is rounding. Log hazard ratios of 1 and 3 in normally distributed data ranging from -4 to 4 on average results in huge range of survival times, where half are less than 1, but the 99th percentile is 3682. Setting $b_1$ and $b_2$ to 1/10th their values reliably generates consistent estimates. Also to speed up your R code note you can just call etimes = rexp(n, relhazs) . Note you do recover the actual estimates from using survreg(Surv(time, status) ~ x1 + x2, data=dat, dist='exp') .
