Random Forest Classifier is giving me an array of zeroes

I used VGG16 as feature extractor on a dataset with 9 classes and trained the Random Forest Classifier on the feature vector. I tried to make prediction on the test feature vector but the prediction is an array of zeroes. What am i doing wrong ? Notebook Link
