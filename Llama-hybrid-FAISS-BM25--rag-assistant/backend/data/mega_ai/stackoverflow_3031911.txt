It seems the SOAP extension is expecting a string, but you're giving it an array. It then tries to convert the array into a string, resulting in "Array". I don't have time to check right now what the extension does you write $client->sendXml( $tarray ); , but try to use instead: $client->__soapCall("sendXml", $tarray);
