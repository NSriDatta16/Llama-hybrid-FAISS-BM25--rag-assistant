What about in ANN for regression? Your intuition is correct that neural networks are not solely limited to classification problems, even though classification is a very common application. There are lots of regression loss functions: Minimize square error ( $L^2$ loss), which is the cross-entropy for a target modeled as having a Gaussian distribution; Minimize absolute error ( $L^1$ loss), which is the cross-entropy for a target modeled as having a Laplace distribution; Minimize log cosh loss, which is a kind of compromise between $L^2$ and $L^1$ losses. See: When is Log-Cosh Loss used? And many more! A nice thing about modern neural networks software is that it's designed to allow customized models, including choosing from among many loss functions, or even allowing users to define their own losses. and why is cross-entropy hardly even discussed in ANN's encyclopedia entries? I can't speak to why Wikipedia makes editorial decisions. A key terminology note is that "cross-entropy" is technically ambiguous. In a neural network setting, it's common to use the jargon "cross-entropy" to mean "binary or multinomial cross-entropy." However, if we're being technically precise, then cross-entropy is a general way of writing down loss functions which can be described in terms of a specific probability model. For more information and some examples, see How to construct a cross-entropy loss for general regression targets? Another terminology note is that it's common to distinguish between "regression" and "classification," but there is a specific sense in which this distinction is spurious. Consider a logistic regression. It's common to speak of this as a "classification" model even though what's really happing is that we're creating a regression against the probabilities of the binomial/multinomial outcome. See: Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? As a matter of jargon , it's common enough to use "classification" to mean "this model has a categorical outcome." But it's best not to get too attached to jargon -- think of it more as a short-hand for deeper technical concepts.
