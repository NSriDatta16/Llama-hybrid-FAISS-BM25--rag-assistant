Does perfect forwarding in C++0x make reference_wrapper deprecated?

As usual, code first: #include using namespace std; using namespace std::tr1; void f(int& r) { r++; } template void g1(F f, P t) { f(t); } template void g2(F f, P&& t) { f(forward (t)); } int main() { int i = 0; g1(f, ref(i)); // old way, ugly way g2(f, i); // new way, elegant way } In C++ 98, we don't have a nice way to pefect forward parameters through template functions. So the C++ gurus invented ref and cref to achieve that aim. Now that we have had r-value reference and perfect forwarding, does it mean that ref and cref and the like should be deprecated?
