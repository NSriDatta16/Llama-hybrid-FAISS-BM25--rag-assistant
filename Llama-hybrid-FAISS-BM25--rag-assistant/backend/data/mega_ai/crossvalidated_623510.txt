Logistic regression and orthogonal array

I'm trying to conduct an experiment with 4 independent variables with 3 levels and a binary dependent variable. Because I'm interested in some first-order interactions of the IVs, and an experiment with 3^4 conditions are not feasible, I want to apply an L27 orthogonal array. I could find some documents on how to conduct an ANOVA with L27, but not with a logistic regression. Now, I have questions. 1. Is it sound to apply a logistic regression here to see the effect of the IVs on the DV? 2. Is it possible to look at interaction effects? 3. If 2 is okay, how can I do that? Any advice would be arppriciated! You may say, "You should discard some less important IVs." It's an tempting advice, but I'm curious if there would be an alternative such as above!
