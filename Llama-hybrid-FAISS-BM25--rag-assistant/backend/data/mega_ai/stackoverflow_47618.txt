Unfortunately there isn't any way to do this directly in the code. If this is an issue in house, there are various code analysis solutions that could catch these sort of problems. Have you looked into FxCop? I think that this will catch these situations and in all cases where IDisposable objects might be left hanging. If it is a component that people are using outside of your organization and you can't require FxCop, then documentation is really your only recourse :). Edit: In the case of finalizers, this doesn't really guarantee when the finalization will happen. So this may be a solution for you but it depends on the situation.
