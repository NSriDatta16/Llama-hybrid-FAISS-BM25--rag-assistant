Expected value of samples

I would like to calculate a covariance matrix of my data sample. How do I calculate the expected value for it, e.g.: $$ E[(X_{2}-\mu_{2})(X_{1}-\mu_{1})] $$ My problem is, that I don't understand how to calculate the expected value since on wikipedia's definition I need a probility function for it (where shall it come from?). The mean is no problem but it's not the mean what is required, isn't it? But I know how to calculate the covariance matrix via R or Eigen , thus I guess it is doable somehow.. but how?? Two parameters of my data sample: X1={2.75083, 2.75095, 2.75074, 2.75106, 2.75082, 2.75096} X2={376.499, 374.8, 373.288, 382.299, 377.092, 374.752} edit: I read a bit more carefully and when all probabilities are equal then it's just an average indeed. Is that correct?
