#warning and macro evaluation

I have the following code : #define LIMIT_DATE \"01-03-2010\" #ifdef LIMIT_DATE #if _MSC_VER #pragma message ("Warning : this release will expire on " LIMIT_DATE) #elif __GNUC__ #warning ("Warning : this release will expire on " LIMIT_DATE) #endif #endif The problem is that LIMIT_DATE is not evaluated when printing the warning. I searched on Google, but didn't found yet the solution. Thanks for help.
