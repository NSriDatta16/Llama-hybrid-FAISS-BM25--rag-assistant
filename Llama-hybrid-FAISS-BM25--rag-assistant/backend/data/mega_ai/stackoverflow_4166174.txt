Magento & Google Checkout & Track Conversions

I'm running an online store on Magento. I have Google Checkout as a Payment method. The problem is if someone pays using it they don't always return to the site so it throws my Google Analytics conversion rates off. Is there a way to pass this information to analytics when the people don't return to the site after the transaction?
