I have a neural network, I have a validation set, now how do I start tuning?

I don't really understand how people begin/start tuning their network and there seems to be a lot of conflicting information. One online answer I saw said: Start with the learning rate, tune that, then tune the batch size, tune that, then tune the number of epoches, ..., then add a layer. So basically you tune everything so that the network is optimal for each of the parameter. Tune everything sequentially. The assumption here is that this "optimality" stacks up when you vary other parameters. Another online answer I saw said: Come up with several set of {learning rate, batch size, ..., number of hidden units}. Then create a model with each set of parameters. Run the model for each set of parameters, pick the best one on the validation set. This one seems to require a lot more effort than the first! Which method is correct? And how do I begin tuning? Please provide a good rationale or a reference.
