How are you intending on saving the data? If you're planning on putting this into a model, great. Then you can create some form of unique value (I'd probably base it on an MD5 of IP address and user agent), store that in a field, and require it to be unique for each submission. There probably is a gem for this, but it's pretty simple anyway. If you're not putting it into a model, I think we need more details of what your intentions are.
