Confused about The Realizability Assumption

From the book "Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms", The Realizability Assumption is defined as follows: There exists $h^{\star}\in \mathcal{H}$ s.t. $L_{(D,f)}(h^{\star})=0$ . Note that this assumption implies that with probability 1 over random samples, $S$ , where the instances of $S$ are are sampled according to $\mathcal{D}$ and labeled by $f$ , we have $L_{S}(h^{\star})=0$ . The realizability assumption implies that for every ERM hypothesis we have that $L_{S}(h_S)=0$ . However, we are interested in the true risk of $h_S$ , $L_{(D,f)}(h_S)$ , rather than its empirical risk. Isn't the true risk $\big{(} L_{(D,f)}(h_S) \big{)}$ already ZERO by the definition of the realizability assumption?, I mean isn't $L_{S}(h_S)=0$ because $L_{(D,f)}(h_S)=0$ ? and if it isn't, why then the realizability assumption implies that $L_{S}(h_S)=0$ ?
