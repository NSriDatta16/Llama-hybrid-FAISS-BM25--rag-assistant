OpenCV (insufficient memory in function cvAlloc)

I made my simulation but I am faced with a problem. I'm getting images 640 x 480 in a video. But when it arrives at about 1600 frames or more I am faced with "insufficient memory (out of memory) in function cvAlloc". I released all the images and my RAM (mem storage) won't go over 28 MB. What should I do ?
