Iteration variable of different type than collection?

I have a collection of nullable ints. Why does compiler allows to iteration variable be of type int not int? ? List nullableInts = new List {1,2,3,null}; List normalInts = new List (); //Runtime exception when encounter null value //Why not compilation exception? foreach (int i in nullableInts) { //do sth } Of course I should pay attention to what I iterate through but it would be nice if compiler reprimanded me:) Like here: foreach (bool i in collection) { // do sth } //Error 1 Cannot convert type 'int' to 'bool'
