The reason that this query: SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date >= NOW() ...returns records from the future, is because NOW() includes the time as well as the date. And that time portion indicates the time at which the [function or triggering] statement began to execute. So that means the start of the day in a DATETIME data type looks like: 2010-06-24 00:00:00 (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, to microsecond precision), which NOW() would show something like 2010-06-24 14:24:31 ... Here are your options: SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date >= DATE(NOW()) SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date >= DATE(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date >= CURRENT_DATE() SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date >= CURRDATE()
