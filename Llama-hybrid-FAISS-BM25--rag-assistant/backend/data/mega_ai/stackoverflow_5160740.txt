The sequence of events for a publish is as follows: The Publisher will start up(Windows Service) A Subscriber will start up and place a message into the Publisher's input queue(MSMQ) The Publisher will take that message, read the address of the Subscriber and place that into storage(subscription storage: memory, MSMQ, or RDBMS) When it is time to publish and event, the Publisher will inspect the type of message and then read subscription storage to find Subscribers interested in that message The Publisher will then send a message to each of the Subscribers found in subscription storage The Subscriber receives the message in its input queue(MSMQ) and processes it You can leverage other messaging platforms instead of MSMQ, but MSMQ is the default. There really is no polling done, all the endpoints are signaled when a message hits the queues.
