What Robert said theoretically - nothing to add. Practically , temporal table vs. main+hist table, has other impications. For heavily maintained data (e.g. updates/deletes greatly outnumber the inserts), having a historical (sometimes also referred to as "audit" - as it is the main mechanism to enforce audit trail of DB data) table allows keeping the main table reasonably small sized compared to keeping the audit info inside the main table itself. This can have significant performance implications for both selects and inserts on the main table, especially in light of index optimization discussed below. To top that off, the indices on hist/audit table do not need to be 100% identical to main table, meaning you can omit indices not needed for querying audit data from hist database (thus speeding up inserts into audit table) and, vice versa, optimize what indices there are to specific audit queries you have (including ordering the table by timestamp via clustered index) without saddling the main table with those indices which slow the data changes (and in case of clustering on time of update, clash with main table's clustered index so you usually can't have it clustered in temporal order).
