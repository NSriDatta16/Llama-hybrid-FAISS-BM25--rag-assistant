In a time series $x_t, x_{t-1},...,$, why is $E[x_t|x_t, x_{t-1},...]= x_t$?

Sorry if obvious but in a time series $x_t, x_{t-1},...,$ , why is $E[x_t|x_t, x_{t-1},...]= x_t$ ? I don't really get what the random variable $x_t|x_t, x_{t-1},...$ represents? What I find particularly confusing is the conditioning on $x_t$ itself. Is it as obvious as the expectation of the random variable $x_t$ given knowledge of $x_t$ is of course $x_t$ ? Would then result then hold even without the other $x_{t-1}...$ 's?
