Confidence Interval around a predictor

I have a logistic regression as follows: $\log \frac{p}{1-p} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$ . I'm looking for a confidence interval around a value of $x$ , which would correspond to a specific value of $p$ . Obviously finding the $x$ is not a problem, as $x = (\log \frac{p}{1-p} - \beta_0)/ \beta_1$ , but for a confidence interval, even if I assume that the $x_{MLE} = (\log \frac{p}{1-p} - \hat\beta_0)/ \hat \beta_1$ has, approximately, a normal distribution centered at the true value - I still need the variance of this.
