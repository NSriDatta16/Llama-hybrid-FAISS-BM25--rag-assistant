Finding the F statistic of an ANN regression model

I am using the neuralnet package in R, and I wish to find out the F-statistic of a model for a particular regression fit. I have gone through this link , where they tell you the method to find the F - statistic for a linear regression. For a neural network, the training and test data are first separated. Subsequently, the training is conducted on the training data and then the prediction error is calculated from the test data. Here, what would be the number of the coefficients (or the degree of freedom)? How do I calculate or find out the degree of freedom, in order for me to find the F-statistic? Edit: I strongly believe that the system which is use to collect the data, has a strong influence on how a model behaves. I am working on Machining (Lathe CNC Machining) data. According to several papers that I have found on ScienceDirect, there is a strong influence of the type of material used and the method of machining. The most significant variable (explanatory) is different for each type of material.
