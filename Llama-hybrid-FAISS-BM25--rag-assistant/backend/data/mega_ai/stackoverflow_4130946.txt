Why does my app always crash once I disconnect it from the my Mac?

Whenever I have my iPod connected to my computer and I build/run from xcode, I have a difficult time making it crash. However, once I disconnect it and try to run the app by itself, it crashes in no time. it's much harder to debug with the little info I can get from the organizer console, so this is bothering the hell out of me because I just submitted my app yesterday. Here's part of the log in the organizer: 0 libobjc.A.dylib 0x000027d8 objc_msgSend + 16 1 TruxMap 0x0001ef50 0x1000 + 122704 2 CoreFoundation 0x0000652c -[NSObject(NSObject) release] + 24 3 CoreFoundation 0x0000a97e CFRelease + 62 4 CoreFoundation 0x00009e94 _CFAutoreleasePoolPop + 140 Any idea what may be causing this unusual behavior?
