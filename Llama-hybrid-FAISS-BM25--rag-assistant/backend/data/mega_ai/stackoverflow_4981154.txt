BLOB in SQLite?

I have created a SQLite database with an id AUTOINCREMENT and image BLOB. Now, I want to INSERT a image in the image column. I am a big objective-c nube and have been trying all sorts of stuff but they don't seem to be working. I know lots about MYSQl, but not SQLite and I can't seem to figure it out. I have uploadImage (UIImage). I am using Matteo Bertozzi's SQLite wrapper here . Here's some of my code I have after someone picks an image off their phone: - (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingImage:(UIImage *)image editingInfo:(NSDictionary *)editingInfo { [picker.parentViewController dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; uploadImage = image; NSData *dataForImage = UIImagePNGRepresentation(uploadImage); [database executeNonQuery:@"INSERT INTO process (image) VALUES (dataForImage)"]; } Thanks again!
