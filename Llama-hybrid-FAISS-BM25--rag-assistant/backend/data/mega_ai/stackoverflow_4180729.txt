Not really possible. You can launch the app using the custom URL scheme but the user will get a Safari error dialog if the app isn't installed. I guess your app could ping the server with some unique session ID when it launched and you could send this back to the web page using Ajax as a success validation.. Seems like a lot of work and pretty fragile. It may be possible to detect the safari error dialog with some clever JavaScript?
