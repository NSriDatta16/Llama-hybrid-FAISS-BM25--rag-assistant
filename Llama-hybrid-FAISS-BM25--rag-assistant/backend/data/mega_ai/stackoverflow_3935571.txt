Not sure about IE9, but Opera doesn’t seem to have any gradient support yet: http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto26/#css No occurrence of “gradient” on that page. There’s a great article by Robert Nyman on getting CSS gradients working in all browsers that aren’t Opera though: http://robertnyman.com/2010/02/15/css-gradients-for-all-web-browsers-without-using-images/ Not sure if that can be extended to use an image as a fallback.
