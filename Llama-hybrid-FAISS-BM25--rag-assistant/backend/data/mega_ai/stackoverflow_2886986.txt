If you structure your data in such a way that you can use a persistent data structure to model your neural network, functional updates to the neural network will be cheap (at least compared to copying the whole thing). If it is still not fast enough, your language may allow other techniques (such as careful use of mutation) to speed it up; for example, if you were using Clojure, you could use transients to some additional speed.
