Converting unicode for MySQL and JSON

I have some HTML that was inserted into a MySQL database from a CSV file, which in turn was exported from an access MDB file. The MDB file was exported as Unicode, and indeed is Unicode. I am however unsure as what encoding the MySQL database has. When I try to echo out html stored in a field however, there is no Unicode. This is a direct retrieval of one of the html fields in the database. http://www.yousendit.com/download/TTZueEVYQzMrV3hMWEE9PQ It says utf-8 in the source. The actual page code generated from echoing out article_desc is here: http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=22566 I need to use this html with JSON, and I am wondering what I should do. I can not use any other frameworks or libraries. Should I convert the data before inserting it into the MySQL DB, or something else?
