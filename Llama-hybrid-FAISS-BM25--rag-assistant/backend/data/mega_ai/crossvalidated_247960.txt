Can we select features by examining scatterplots?

Suppose, I have a data set with eight features in my hand. I want to find features to predict the diamonds, hearts, clubs, spades. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | f1 | f2 | f3 | f4 | f5 | f6 | f7 | f8 +--------+--------+---------+---------+--------------------------------------- | | | | | | | | f1 column is for class-labels and the rest of them are features. First, I have rendered a scatter plot by taking the features f2 and f3 and it looks like the following, Later, I have rendered a scatter plot by taking the features f3 and f4 and it looks like the following, in the 1st plot, x = f2 and y = f3 . In the 2nd plot, x = f3 and y = f4 . If $Red$ = Diamonds, $Blue$ = Spades, $Magenta$ = Hearts, and $Black$ = Clubs, I have the following questions, (1) Why are some plots cohesive and others are not? (2) What do these two plots tell about those four types of cards? (3) Which two features, among f2 , f3 , and f4 , would you choose for further experiment of pattern recognition and why?
