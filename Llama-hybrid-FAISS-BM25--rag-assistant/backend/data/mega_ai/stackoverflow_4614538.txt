Deciding between flash.now and regular flash is a pain in the ass and quite fragile in my experience. I use regular flash and then modify my partial which displays the flashes to delete the contents of each flash after the user has seen it. I think this is better because a) you don't have to think about it b) "has the user seen it?" (ie "has the flashes partial been rendered out?") is the best criterion for deciding whether or not to clear the flash, rather than any logic in your app. My flash partial looks like this - i also use a bit of jquery just to highlight the flashes (ie make them flash yellow for a second):
