Snippets and prototype projects - how to organise?

When learning a langugage, I routinely find myself prototyping new concepts outside of the current project, and often find myself with dozens of small, single use projects which I refer back to, as well as lots of useful code snippets which don't necessarily belong in a function library, but need storing non-the-less. Whats the best way to name, sort and generally look after these projects and code snippets in such a way that referring back to them when needed is quick and simple? How do you handle this?
