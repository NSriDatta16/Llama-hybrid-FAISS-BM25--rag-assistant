Kaggle is more contest platform with a jobs board more than a freelance platform. Try upwork and freelancer.com. They are the ebay of freelancing and they support a wide range of payments although some of their fees have been going up for a while and search is favoring fees over matching to best results. Still you will be able to sort by skills like visualization, machine learning, data cleaning. It will depend on what skills you have to offer. I'm sure there are others better out there and probably others without too much traction. AngelList also offer contracts for data scientists if you're looking for something more structured.
