Logistic regression and non-linear relationship

In the Titanic dataset, there are two features, "SibSp" and "Parch," which have an impact on the survival rate. For instance, the survival rate tends to increase when the values of "SibSp" range from 0 to 2, but it decreases from 2 onwards. I intend to use logistic regression for predictions and I am unsure if I can utilize these features. Although they do not show a linear relationship with the survival rate, I wonder if logistic regression can still be applied or if it is not suitable. One idea I have is to OneHotEncode these features. This way, logistic regression could identify patterns by creating new features for each class in "SibSp" and "Parch." For example, we could check if "is SibSp = 1?" and assign 1 for "yes" and 0 for "no."
