Should I run a machine learning model many times?

I am comparing different classification models and for a given model (let's say logistic regression), everytime I run it, it obviously produces a slightly different value for the Accuracy and for the AUC. Since, I want to compare the different models, I want a pretty stable metric, so I thought of running each algorithm many times and taking the average of the accuracy and for the AUC. Is this something that is commonly done ? If not, does it make sense to do this ?
