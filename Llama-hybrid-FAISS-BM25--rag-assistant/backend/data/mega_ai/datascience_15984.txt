Can we train a neural network to tell if an object is present or not in an Image?

I am new to machine learning, working on object detection, but not interested in the location of the object in the image, so I just want to know is it possible to train such a neural network, if yes, how? (I just want a list of objects present in the image). I am not sure what kind of dataset I would require to build such a network. edit: I will be more clear on my question. First I know about CNN and the models like VGG16, Inception, Resnet etc. My doubt is that these networks can be trained to identify an object i.e. it will predict which object is present in the image and give the probability. What if I want to train a network to tell whether particular objects are present in the image or not i.e. The output should be yes if any of the objects is present no if not
