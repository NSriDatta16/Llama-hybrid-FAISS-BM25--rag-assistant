You can, as long as such features are not computed using the value you're trying to predict. In time series, in order to predict today's (day $N$ ) value it is totally acceptable to have a feature -for example- containing the average value over the last 10 days (i.e. from day $N-10$ to day $N-1$ ). By itself, this does not constitute target leakage, as it's an information that you would have available at the previous day.
