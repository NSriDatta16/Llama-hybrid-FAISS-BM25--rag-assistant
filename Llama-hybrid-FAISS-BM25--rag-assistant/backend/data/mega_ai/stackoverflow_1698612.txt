As stated in the comment above, I'm not sure what I should recommend. However you might take a look at the Pragmatic Series with books like Practices of an Agile Developer or The Pragmatic Programmer if you dont know them yet. At least they drop the C parts, but unless you go for the explicit Ruby-stuff they will use languages like C# for demonstration.
