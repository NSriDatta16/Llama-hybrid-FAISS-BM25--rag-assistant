how can I get test coverage statistics for VS2008 C# project

I am using Visual Studio 2008 for a C# WinForms application and I am using the MSTest unit testing framework. It doesn't seem to have test coverage (I think it's in Team System?). What is the easiest (cheapest?) way to get some test coverage statistics for my project here? Effectively just an indication of for each *.cs file the % test coverage my unit tests are providing, and for the cases when it is not 100% which lines aren't covered. Thanks
