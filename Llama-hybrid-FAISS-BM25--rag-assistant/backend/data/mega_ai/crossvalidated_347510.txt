Results of Type-3 Wald Chi-Square Different for GLMM with Different Contrast Coding

I have just completed a multilevel, longitudinal logistic regression testing, at four different time points, whether participants in an experimental group are more likely to have committed any drug-related crime in the previous 4 weeks than participants receiving placebo. The syntax for the glmer looks like this sumDrug Where drugCrime is the binary outcome variable "have committed one or more drug-related crimes in previous 4 weeks?" (Y/N response), group is a factor indicating group allocation, and week is a factor indicating time of measurement (at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12). If I treatment code the two factors (see here ) the output of the regression (with Odds Ratios and CIs) looks like this: var Estimate Std..Error z.value Pr...z.. OR lo hi 1 (Intercept) -1.234 0.562 -2.197 0.028 0.29 0.04 2.28 2 group2 -0.108 0.779 -0.139 0.890 0.90 0.11 7.02 3 week2 -1.450 0.632 -2.295 0.022 0.23 0.03 1.84 4 week3 -0.965 0.652 -1.480 0.139 0.38 0.05 2.98 5 week4 -0.696 0.652 -1.067 0.286 0.50 0.06 3.90 6 group2:week2 -1.366 1.011 -1.351 0.177 0.26 0.03 2.00 7 group2:week3 -0.822 1.001 -0.821 0.411 0.44 0.06 3.44 8 group2:week4 -2.580 1.136 -2.271 0.023 0.08 0.01 0.59 And the output of the Anova(drugMod) in the car package returns Analysis of Deviance Table (Type III Wald chisquare tests) Response: drugCrime Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) (Intercept) 4.8248 1 0.02805 * group 0.0193 1 0.88955 week 5.5199 3 0.13745 group:week 5.4146 3 0.14383 If, on the other hand, I simple code the two factors (also see here ) the output of the regression looks like this: var Estimate Std..Error z.value Pr...z.. OR lo hi 1 (Intercept) -2.661 0.499 -5.328 0.000 0.07 0.01 2 group1 -1.300 0.742 -1.752 0.080 0.27 0.03 3 week2 -2.133 0.548 -3.890 0.000 0.12 0.02 4 week3 -1.376 0.532 -2.584 0.010 0.25 0.03 5 week4 -1.986 0.600 -3.311 0.001 0.14 0.02 6 group1:week2 -1.366 1.011 -1.351 0.177 0.26 0.03 7 group1:week3 -0.822 1.001 -0.821 0.411 0.44 0.06 8 group1:week4 -2.580 1.136 -2.271 0.023 0.08 0.01 this time the output of the Anova(drugMod) is Analysis of Deviance Table (Type III Wald chisquare tests) Response: drugCrime Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) (Intercept) 28.3890 1 9.923e-08 *** group 3.0684 1 0.0798276 . week 17.8728 3 0.0004672 *** group:week 5.4149 3 0.1438151 I understand why the regression outputs are different with the two different contrast coding schemes, but why am I getting two different Anova() outputs for these two different coding schemes, and which is the 'correct' one to report? In a reply to this post @Ben Bolker quotes the Anova() help, saying "Be very careful in formulating the model for type-III tests, or the hypotheses tested will not make sense." But I am not sure what 'makes sense' means in this context.
