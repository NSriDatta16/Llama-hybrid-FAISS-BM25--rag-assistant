In this case, what you refer to as "a document that's not explicitly referenced in a URL" seems to be what is known as a "redirect". Basically, the server tells you that you have to get the document at another URL. Normally, python's urllib will automatically follow these redirects, so that you end up with the right file. (and - as others have already mentioned - you can check the response's mime-type header to see if it's a pdf). However, the server in question is doing something strange here. You request the url, and it redirects you to another url. You request the other url, and it redirects you again... to the same url! And again... And again... At some point, urllib decides that this is enough already, and will stop following the redirect, to avoid getting caught in an endless loop. So how come you are able to get the pdf when you use your browser? Because apparently, the server will only serve the pdf if you have cookies enabled. (why? you have to ask the people responsible for the server...) If you don't have the cookie, it will just keep redirecting you forever. (check the urllib2 and cookielib modules to get support for cookies, this tutorial might help) At least, that is what I think is causing the problem. I haven't actually tried doing it with cookies yet. It could also be that the server is does not "want" to serve the pdf, because it detects you are not using a "normal" browser (in which case you would probably need to fiddle with the User-Agent header), but it would be a strange way of doing that. So my guess is that it is somewhere using a "session cookie", and in the case you haven't got one yet, keeps on trying to redirect.
