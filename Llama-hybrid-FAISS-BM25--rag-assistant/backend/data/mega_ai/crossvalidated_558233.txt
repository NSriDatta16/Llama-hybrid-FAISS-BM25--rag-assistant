Presenting only two numbers from a complex and large data set is always a tricky business. The reason why it is done here is probably to make the presentation of the figures easier in the media. But you are right that a lot of those presentations are too much simplified to give a decent view of the situation. Indeed all sorts of causes may be underlying the two numbers and one would need an overview of the entire data set, as much as possible and easily done, to get a better grasp of the situation. This oversimplification is discussed several times in Edward Tufte's work. A typical example is the discussion about oversimplification with PowerPoint and how this leads to the crash of a spaceshuttle . An example that is more specifically about the loss of context is the presentation of the time series of traffic deaths by only two data points as in this presentation of the numbers of fatality due to traffic deaths . Sidenote: a presentation that makes a comparison with previous years does make sense. Based on many indicators one can say that the upcoming wave (and in some places the peak seems to already be passed) has less volume of infections, sickness and death (at least in average Europe). So, I would see the problem more in the simplistic presentation without much context, rather than the comparison with previous years. The picking out of this single comparison may not need to be so much falicious cherry picking or if it is a false representation it may not need to be intentional. This occurs a lot in media, that the starting point is the conclusion and one looks for science and data that supports it to present it. It is in some way falicious, the practice is not correct, but that may not make the conclusion false. It may be that the conclusion has been arrived in a correct sense, but that the presentation of the arguments that are used to support it are not correct. One way how this may occur is because the information stream is a bit like the Chinese whispers game , the information gets passed on from scientists to other scientists to government officials to spokespersons to newspaper editorial to journalist to news article. At the end of that chain, what may have sticked is the part of the message that tells that the wave(s) this year might be less bad, and a creative journalist starts collecting data and facts about this that can go into the news article.
