If anyone is interested in the solution I used, I ended up writing my own mini draggable functionality - I just cloned the object during a drag event if the user moved outside of the calendar table, and manually updated the clone's css top/left values until the drag event ended. This means that the original object still gets dragged up and down within the table, which isn't quite ideal, but it's the best solution I could come up with that provides the functionality the client wants.
