Why is Pearson Principal Component Analysis so much more common than Spearman or Kendall PCA?

As I understand it, Pearson PCA finds eigenvectors of the Pearson correlation matrix. The result is a coordinate system with dimensions that are linearly uncorrelated. But, a Spearman PCA does this with the Spearman correlation matrix, and therefore the dimensions are not only linearly uncorrelated, but monotonically uncorrelated. At least to me, that seems much stronger. Is my understanding wrong? Why is Pearson PCA so much more popular than Spearman PCA? And by popular, I mean that most libraries only ever provide the former. I do understand that Pearson invented PCA, but that was more than 100 years ago.
