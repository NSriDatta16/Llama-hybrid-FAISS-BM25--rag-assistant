odd "warning C4127: conditional expression is constant" under VS2005

I'm trying to compile LightZPng with warnings on level 4. I get a lot of C4127 on lines that are clearly not worthy of this warning. An example: #define MAX_BITS 15 int values_per_bitlen[ MAX_BITS + 1 ]; for ( int i = 0; i How can this code be changed to avoid the warning other than #pragma?
