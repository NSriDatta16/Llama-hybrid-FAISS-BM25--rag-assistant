You can't return data returned by an AJAX call unless you want to call it synchronously (and you don't â€“ trust me). But what you can return is a promise of a data returned by an AJAX call and you can do it actually in a very elegant way. ( UPDATE: Please note that currently jQuery Promises are not compatible with the Promises/A+ specification - more info in this answer .) Basically you can return the return value of your $.ajax(...) call: function checkUserIdExists(userid){ return $.ajax({ url: 'theurl', type: 'GET', cache: false, data: { userid: userid } }); } and someone who calls your function can use it like this: checkUserIdExists(userid).success(function (data) { // do something with data }); See this post of mine for a better explanation and demos if you are interested.
