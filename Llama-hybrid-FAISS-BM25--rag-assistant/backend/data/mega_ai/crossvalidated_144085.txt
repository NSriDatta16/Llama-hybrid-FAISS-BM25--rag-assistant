Percentage of contribution of multiple factors to a single dependent variable

I have a set of data (underway observation along cruise track) which includes one dependent variable A and three independent variables B, C, and D. It's known that A is related with each of the three factors, so I want to find a numerical relationship that allows me to express A by means of B, C, and D, and would like to be able to evaluate the relative contribution of each independent variable to A. I'm aware PCA is the tool to use in this situation, and I've tried it in Excel, only to get a biplot where all four variables are treated equally as the same type of dependent variable, and variable A is used to explain those principal components. What I really want is to see how A behaves under the joint influence of B, C, and D, and I don't care how B, C, and D themselves relate to each other. (I'm working in MATLAB.)
