By the letter of the question, they are probably looking for an interpolation search, which is average case O(log log n). Yes, this is O(n) in worst case, but can be improved with knowledge of the distribution or using an interpolation-binary search. This plays into the M >> N hint. The average case analysis for interpolation search is pretty complex, so I won't even attempt a modification under M >> N. But conceptual, under M >> N and assuming a uniform distribution, you can assume that the value will be bounded by +/-1 of the initial search position, yielding O(1). A practical implementation could do the initial interpolation once, and if the search value is not bounded, fall back to a binary search. Not sure how multiple disks could be used to advantage in this approach, though...
