Explain db tag storage method

from this post What is the most efficient way to store tags in a database? It was recommended to store tag tables like this. Table: Item Columns: ItemID, Title, Content Table: Tag Columns: TagID, Title Table: ItemTag Columns: ItemID, TagID And another SO post said the same thing. Can anyone explain why tags should be stored like this? I am guessing ItemID is some internal val, title is the tag name (c++, sql, noob, etc) content is whatever else data i want to store with my item. why not something like Table: Item Columns: ItemID, Title, Table: TagList Columns: ItemID, Title title in item being "item name" and tag title being "c++" "sql" "noob" "etc"
