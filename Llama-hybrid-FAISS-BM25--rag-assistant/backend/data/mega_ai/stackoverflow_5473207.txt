How to bookmark code in XCode 4?

I couldn't find a way to put a bookmark inside the code in XCode 4. I know about the #pragma mark thing but it's not what I'm looking for. What I need is something that I can put and remove with a mouse click and navigate amongst with next and previous, like in VS. Is there anything that I'm missing?
