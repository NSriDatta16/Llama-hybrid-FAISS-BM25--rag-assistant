Is there a regression Model for mixed dataset? (Panel Data x Time Series Data)

I have a dataset that looks like this: As you can see, weekly returns data is time-series data and Factor 1 2 3 are present in panel data form. I would like to know if there is any regression model that could treat all of them at once or in multiple stages. What I can think of now is to aggregate time-series data to years to match the time length but ... I think this removes the advantage of the precision of time-series data which I would like to keep ... (Also because I can only get up to 5 to 10 years of panel data which is not a lot I guess?)
