Good way to output javascript selectively depending on Application settings

I am developing a site which includes several different javascript files and libraries. For optimization purposes I have implemented YUI Compressor for .Net This will minimize and combine my javascript files into one single file. Now I have put this up in a MSBuild script that automatically does the compression and minimization and outputs it to a file of my choosing. However, I still wish to keep the original javascript files in my development environment. My question is simply: Is there a good way to depending on the Debug setting for example choose which javascript to use? This to not have to change the MasterPage by hand each time I release the build. Allow me to illustrate. If I am running in Debug="true" I wish my MasterPage to include the following javascripts: If I am running in Debug="false" I wish this to be outputted in the MasterPage: Is there an elegant solution to this that I am missing here?
