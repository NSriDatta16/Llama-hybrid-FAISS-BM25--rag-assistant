You can use the profiler from FlashBuilder (not free) to see where things can be improved. You can optimise at the bytecode level (without touching your source) using TDSI for example (still in development and more optimisation will come) If you want to see what 's going under the hood and understand more the compiled code, look at the tamarin source code (Adobe VM use in the flash player) and learn the abc bytecode Or write multiple function and measure their performance , do small refactor step by step to see what are the gain, you can use gskinner library for the measurement (Don`t use the debug player since some function are slower int it). Read some paper on as3 optimisation . There are good people like Joa Ebert , Grant Skinner . But if the gain after optimisation is small prefer to keep readability of your code.
