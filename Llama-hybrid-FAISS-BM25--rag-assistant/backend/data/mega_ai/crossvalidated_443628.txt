Density estimation: the significance of smaller number of samples?

I'm reading Probabilistic Graphical Model: Principle and Techniques by Koller and Friedman. In section 18.5 Bayesian Model Averaging(p825), the author said If we are interested only in density estimation, this might not be a serious problem. Could anyone explain why smaller number of samples is not a serious problem for density estimation?
