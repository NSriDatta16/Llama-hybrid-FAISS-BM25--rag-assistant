Treatment of missing values introduced by padding lagged variables

In the case of a linear regression with lagged independent variables, what are the techniques for dealing with the NA values introduced by padding lagged variables (since t I ask because I'm implementing a random forest with lags and have to decide what to do about these missing values. Replacing them with 0 seems misguided, but imputing backwards doesn't make much sense either. I suppose I could insert a time mean, or an overall mean for the variable if I have panel data... Edit 1: Looking around more, SAS lets you choose between replacing NA with a time mean, overall mean, or zero: http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/etsug/60372/HTML/default/viewer.htm#etsug_panel_sect015.htm Any idea on the costs and benefits of these different approaches?
