Minimize SSE = Î£ i (z i -a) 2 with respect to a and you get the average of the two sample means, so it looks like your MLE is also your minimum MSE estimator, whether you have one (x,y) pair or several. Not surprising, since the expression for the SSE and the log likelihood function are almost identical.
