I'm not familiar with objective C, but this isn't possible with standard printf-style formatting. Using %g would sort-of work, but for large or small numbers it would use scientific notation (eg 9.6e+6, 4.2e-7) rather than decimal notation. The equivalent question was asked for C/C++ here , and in that case the answer is to use %f and then strip any trailing 0's from the string. Not exactly elegant.
