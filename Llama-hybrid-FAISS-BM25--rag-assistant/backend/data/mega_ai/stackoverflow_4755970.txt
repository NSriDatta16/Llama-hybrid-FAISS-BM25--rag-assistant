Qt:: Edit Image

I want to edit image in Qt application, I have use two QLabel and set two different image(using QPixmap ) on each, now I wan to set one image over another(just like photo DJ set new Frame and Add Cartoons to Image). I use drag and drop for this and I am able to move (drag) image, but this dragged image override another image. I want dragged image over second image and set position of dragged image on second image not override it. I have added image that I want(Edit Image).
