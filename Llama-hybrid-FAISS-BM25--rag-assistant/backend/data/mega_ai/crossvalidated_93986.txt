What you are describing is recursive partitioning, implemented, for example, in the R rpart package. It is with difficulty that this is accomplished, because the data are not capable of revealing the correct connections/configurations except when the signals are very strong or the sample size is extremely large. Whenever you wish to use a single dendrogram to represent the patterns (as opposed to random forests, bagging, and boosting trees) it is incumbent upon you to demonstrate that the patterns are replicable. This can be done by bootstrapping the entire process and seeing if the same or similar trees emerge each time. See http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/ComplexDataJournalClub for an example where this was done.
