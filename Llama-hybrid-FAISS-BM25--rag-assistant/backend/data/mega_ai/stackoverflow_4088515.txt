This is not very efficient, but is a very easy way to achieve what you want. That is, assuming you are asking how to store and retrieve a small array out of MySQL into PHP for the purpose of checkers. If that is not what you are asking, please clarify your question. Somewhere in MySQL, you have a table. Let's call this table boards . Whatever other columns you want to have in this table, no biggie, but leave one in there for string data. Then use JSON to encode your array. $yourboarddata=json_encode($Board); mysql_query("INSERT INTO boards (data) VALUES (\"" . mysql_real_escape_string($yourboarddata) . "\");"); When you are ready to retrieve it later, you can use json_decode . Note that this uses a decent amount of data. You could save a lot of storage by making binary data out of your board, but this is a simple way for you to start.
