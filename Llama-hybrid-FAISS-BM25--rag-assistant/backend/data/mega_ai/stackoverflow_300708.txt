You can achieve the desired result by requesting a list of distinct ids instead of a list of distinct hydrated objects. Simply add this to your criteria: criteria.setProjection(Projections.distinct(Projections.property("id"))); Now you'll get the correct number of results according to your row-based limiting. The reason this works is because the projection will perform the distinctness check as part of the sql query, instead of what a ResultTransformer does which is to filter the results for distinctness after the sql query has been performed. Worth noting is that instead of getting a list of objects, you will now get a list of ids, which you can use to hydrate objects from hibernate later.
