If stylesheet URLs in the page are absolute, everything should display correctly. Otherwise you will have to modify their URLs in the page code (either str_replace or regular expressions). Also, you can expect at least some styles of the page to break, since you are embedding the whole HTML in an "alien" HTML structure. Generally, HTML tag should always be the out-most tag in the page. I doubt you will come up with solution which works flawlessly for all websites. Why don't you use IFRAME instead?
