There's a very good reason for not doing so, because it would fragment developers. Some would learn Objective-C, some would learn Mono and if Apple supported Mono they would have to support both. If Apple were going to do anything they would add garbage collection support to iPhone Objective-C, which already exists on the desktop - but they consider the device performance constraints tight enough to not have that overhead. I am a great believer in using the framework that philosophically matches the platform you are on. It's cool that Mono works, and as a game scripting language in something like Unity I think it's a fantastic idea - but if you are doing iPhone application development you should learn Objective-C to understand how the platform really is.
