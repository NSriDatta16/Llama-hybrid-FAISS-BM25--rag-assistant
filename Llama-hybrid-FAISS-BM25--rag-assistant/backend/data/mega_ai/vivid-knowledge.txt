Vivid knowledge refers to a specific kind of knowledge representation. The idea of a vivid knowledge base is to get an interpretation mostly straightforward out of it – it implies the interpretation. Thus, any query to such a knowledge base can be reduced to a database-like query. Propositional knowledge base A propositional knowledge base KB is vivid iff KB is a complete and consistent set of literals (over some vocabulary). Such a knowledge base has the property that it as exactly one interpretation, i.e. the interpretation is unique. A check for entailment of a sentence can simply be broken down into its literals and those can be answered by a simple database-like check of KB. First-order knowledge base A first-order knowledge base KB is vivid iff for some finite set of positive function-free ground literals KB+, KB = KB+ ∪ Negations ∪ DomainClosure ∪ UniqueNames, whereby Negations ≔ { ¬p | p is atomic and KB ⊭ p }, DomainClosure ≔ { (ci ≠ cj) | ci, cj are distinct constants }, UniqueNames ≔ { ∀x: (x = c1) ∨ (x = c2) ∨ ..., where the ci are all the constants in KB+ }. All interpretations of a vivid first-order knowledge base are isomorphic. See also Closed world assumption == References ==
