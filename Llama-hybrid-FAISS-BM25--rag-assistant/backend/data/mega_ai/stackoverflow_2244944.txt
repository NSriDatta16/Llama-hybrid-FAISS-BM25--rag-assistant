Asp .net code reuse/copy question

I know the title is vague, sorry I couldn't think of a better way to title it: I have had this happen several times before; when I copy code from a asp .net page and paste it into another page none of the controls are recognized in the code behind page. I have tried to build/rebuild the page but I can't see the controls (in intellesense) and the build fails. Also any controls I drag/drop from the toolbox won't be seen after I copy the code... I assume that it has something to do with those autogenerated designer files that say not to mess with them, but there should be a way "teach" the project about the controls without having to make them from scratch; I mean I never use code snippets for controls, but what if I did??? Thanks for any advice on this. I'm using VS 2008 Professional BTW.
