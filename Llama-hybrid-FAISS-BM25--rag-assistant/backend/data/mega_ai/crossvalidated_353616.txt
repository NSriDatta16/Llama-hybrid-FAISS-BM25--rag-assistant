n * one_hot VS n_hot encoding for modeling input layer for a card game

How should I design my input layer for the following classification problem? Input : 5 cards in a card game; vocabulary is 52 cards Output : some classification using a neural network How should I model the input layer? Option A : 5 one hot encodings for the 5 cards, i.e. 5 one_hot vectors of length 52 = 260 input vector E.g. [ [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,...], [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,...], [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,...], [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,...], [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,...] ] Option B : 5 hot encoding encompassing all 5 cards in one 52 element vector [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,...] What are the disadvantages between A and B?
