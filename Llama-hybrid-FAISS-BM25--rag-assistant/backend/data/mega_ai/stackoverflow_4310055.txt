iPhone Passcode Integration

I want to integrate a passcode into my existing application. Does anyone know of any good tutorials, or such that would lend to my search? Is there a standard Apple tutorial to integrate one? I've not been able to find one, but I imagine it'd be as simple as putting a keypad view in the didFinishLaunching & resignActive methods right? Would keychain be a good place to store it? Again, I'd hate to reinvent the wheel on this, especially if there is a proven secure method out there. Here is the one good tutorial I've been able to find, but it doesn't incorporate a view, or multiple invoke points. http://gorgando.com/blog/topics/technology/iphone_development/simple-iphone-tutorial-password-management-using-the-keychain-by-using-sfhfkeychainutils Thanks!
