Training neural nets: is it important that the data is randomly sorted?

Let's say I have a neural network that classifies data into A, B or C. I've heard that it's bad to train the network with data from one class at a time, e.g. A,A,A,...,B,B,B,...,C,C,C . Now, is there a problem with other patterns in the data? For example A,B,C,A,B,C,A,B,C,... and so forth.
