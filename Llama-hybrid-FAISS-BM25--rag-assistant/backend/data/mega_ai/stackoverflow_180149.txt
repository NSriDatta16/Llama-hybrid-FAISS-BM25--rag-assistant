Puppet doesn't (easily) support the Win32 world either. If you're looking for a deployment mechanism and not just a "dev setup" tool, you might consider looking into ControlTier ( http://open.controltier.com/ ) which has a open-source cross-platform solution. Beyond that you're looking at "enterprise" software such as BladeLogic or OpsWare and typically an outrageous pricetag for the functionality offered (my opinion, obviously). A lot of folks have been aggressively using a combination of Puppet and Capistrano (even non-rails developers) for deployment automation tools to pretty good effect. Downside, again, is that it's expecting a somewhat homogeneous environment.
