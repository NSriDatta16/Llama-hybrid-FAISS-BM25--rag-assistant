Magento CSS not Loading in New Template

I have posted on the template creator's site, as well as Magento support, but no one has responded. The CSS is not loading at all on the custom theme I have installed, which is supposedly compatible with the current version of Magento. You can view the page here: shop.dearearth.net This is a fresh installation of Magento and the theme, with a fresh database. I have a feeling it should be a relatively quick fix. Thanks for looking.
