You have (an interpolation polynomial) f1(x) and (a line) f2(x) and you want to solve f(x) = f1(x)-f2(x) = 0. Use any method for solving this equation, e.g. Newton-Raphson or even bisection . This may not be the most optimal for your case. Pay attention to convergence guarantees and possible multiple roots.
