Better way to catch trouble points

User submits a CSV file which is consumed by a program. Values which are used throughout the program come from the CSV, natually if values are missed it is a problem. Below is my solution. Ip on top private List currentFieldName = new ArrayList (); As part of the method: try { setCurrentFieldName("Trim Space"); p.setTrimSpace(currentLineArray[dc.getTRIM_POSITION()].equals("yes") ? true : false); setCurrentFieldName("Ignore Case"); p.setIgnoreCase(currentLineArray[dc.getIGNORE_CASE_POSITION()].equals("yes") ? true : false); } catch (NullPointerException e) { throw new InputSpreadsheetValueUnassignedException("\"Type\" field not set: " + currentFieldName); } And the method which keeps track of a current field being looked at: private void setCurrentFieldName(String fieldName) { currentFieldName.clear(); currentFieldName.add(fieldName); } The idea there is that if user fails to submit value and i will end up getting null, before throwing an exception, i will know what value was not assigned. So, this being said, specific questions: Is what i have shown below an acceptable solution? Can you suggest something more elegant?
