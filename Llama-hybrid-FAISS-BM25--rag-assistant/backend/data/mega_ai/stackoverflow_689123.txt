Does VBscript have modules? I need to handle CSV

I have a need to read a CSV file, and the only language I can use is VBscript. I'm currently just opening the file and splitting on commas, and it's working OK because there aren't any quoted commas in fields. But I'm aware this is an incredibly fragile solution. So, is there such a thing as a VBscript module I can use? Somewhere to get a tried-and-tested regular expression that would only split on commas not in quotes? Any suggestions gratefully received.
