Foreach loop through ObservableCollection

In WPF app I use LINQ query to get values from ObservableCollection and update the state of some objects: var shava = from clc in _ShAvaQuCollection where clc.xyID == "x02y02" select clc; switch (shava.First().Status) { case 1: x02y02.Status = MyCustControl.Status.First; break; case 2: x02y02.Status = MyCustControl.Status.Second; break; ... } In fact, xyID is unique field in this ObservableCollection and its string value corresponds to names of objects in XAML (these objects are derived from a customer control MyCustControl ). What I am trying to do is: (1) to iterate through all of the records in _ShAvaQuCollection and, using xyID field, reference each particular objects, using shava as a result of query to each of the record: MyCustControl sc = (MyCustControl)this.FindName(shava.First().xyID); (2) and update the state of the object, using other values from this record, for example: switch (shava.First().Status) { case 1: sc.Status = MyCustControl.Status.First; break; case 2: sc.Status = MyCustControl.Status.Second; break; ... } All these actions apart work well, but I cannot combine it to a working iteration method, something like this (it is an idea only, because I didn't manage to get a compyleable code): public void ReadingCollection(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable coll) { foreach (var xyid in coll) { //do my actions (1) and (2) } } Please, help me to organize such an iteration in this last piece of code inside the foreach loop. I'm experiencing problems with understanding how to make a query to each particular record of the collection inside the loop. I described that all above just to make clear what I intend to do with results of such query inside this loop.
