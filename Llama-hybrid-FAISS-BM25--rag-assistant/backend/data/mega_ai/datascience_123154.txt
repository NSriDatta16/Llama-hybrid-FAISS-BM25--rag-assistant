Are we allowed to use classifiers to estimate the outcome in the first stage of Double Machine Learning when the outcome is binary?

It is clear to me how to proceed when the outcome is continuous, since the EconML and all other references I checked work with this type of examples (continuous outcome case). We simply apply a regressor to estimate it. However when the outcome is binary, should/could we employ classifiers? When the treatment is discrete, it seems that, yes, we are allowed since that's exactly the default option in the EconML documentation for the LinearDML class. model_t (estimator or ‘auto’, default ‘auto’) – The estimator for fitting the treatment to the features. If estimator, it must implement fit and predict methods; If ‘auto’, LogisticRegressionCV will be applied for discrete treatment, and WeightedLassoCV/WeightedMultiTaskLassoCV will be applied for continuous treatment. However the same does not hold for the outcome model of the first stage. If we are not allowed to use a classifier, what is the underlying reason? I would greatly appreciate references on this topic.
