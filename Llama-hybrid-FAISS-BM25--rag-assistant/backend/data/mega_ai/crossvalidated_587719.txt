By "Absolute Mean Average" I assume you mean the Mean Absolute Error: you take the difference of each separate forecast and its associated actual, then take the mean over the absolute values of these differences. Minimizing the MAE amounts to eliciting the conditional median of the future temperature distributions: Mean absolute error OR root mean squared error? and Why does minimizing the MAE lead to forecasting the median and not the mean? For temperatures, which one can usually assume to be symmetrically distributed, there should not be a lot of difference between MAE and MSE (more precisely, between the forecasts that optimize each). You might be interested in the sections on accuracy measurement in Forecasting: Theory and Practice . Whether you should remove very bad forecasts depends. I would rather try to use them to learn under what circumstances your model breaks down. Such information can be very valuable. Also, removing very bad forecasts tells your model that if it forecasts off a little bit, you will be concerned, but if it is badly off, you don't mind any more. Is this the message you want to send to your model?
