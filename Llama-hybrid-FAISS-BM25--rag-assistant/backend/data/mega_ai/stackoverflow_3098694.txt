Enabling and Disabling Save button on a GWT page

The application I am working on has pages of setup data with lots of textboxes; each page having a save button. I have defined most of the pages as a *.ui.xml file and used the GWT 2.0 UI binding. I would like to add a save button which is disabled onload and is only enabled after a user modifies the data into one of the textboxes. I know I can register an event handler against each element on the page to enable the button, but I wanted a more elegant solution. Ideally, I would like to define a button that "listens" to events on the page and changes itself. Is this possible in GWT?
