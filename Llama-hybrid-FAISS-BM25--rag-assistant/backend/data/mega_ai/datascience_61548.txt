Gradient decent in Python

I just finished working on my first machine learning algorithm i.e Linear regression. I want to reduce the rmse by optimising the model. I found out that gradient decent does the same job. But i dont know how to do it in python. I refered to some videos on youtube but every video explains y=MX+c . But i have about 50 variables in my model. Is there any library for it. Please help me out.
