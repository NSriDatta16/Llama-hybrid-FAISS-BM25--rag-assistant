Magento: Reprocessing Orders that were made in Authorize.net TEST mode

We have a client that didn't turn off TEST mode on authorize.net when their Magento site went live. Real customers have placed orders thinking that their credit cards went through. Authorize.net is set on authorize and capture mode. Is there anyway to reprocess those orders with TEST mode turned off?
