Grid search error in LIBSVM while optimizing C and g parameters

I am using libsvm for a one-class classification problem. I am trying to select the ideal C and gamma parameters for different kernels(polynomial, linear and rbf) I am using the suggested matlab code that finds the the best parameters through a v-fold validation technique. bestcv = 0; for log2c = -1:3, for log2g = -4:1, cmd = ['-v 5 -c ', num2str(2^log2c), ' -g ', num2str(2^log2g)]; cv = svmtrain(Target_train, train, cmd); if (cv >= bestcv), bestcv = cv; bestc = 2^log2c; bestg = 2^log2g; end fprintf('%g %g %g (bestc=%g, g=%g, rate=%g)\n', log2c, log2g, cv, bestc, bestg, bestcv); end end In v-fold cross-validation, we first divide the training set into v subsets of equal size. Sequentially one subset is tested using the classifier trained on the remaining v âˆ’ 1 subsets. Thus, each instance of the whole training set is predicted once so the cross-validation accuracy is the percentage of data which are correctly classified. In this code, the C and gamma take values in a range of (2^-1, 2^3) and (2^-4, 2^1) I noticed that when the svmtrain function is called there is no specified parameter for -s which controls the the type of svm. The default parameter for -s in libsvm is 0 which is for C-SVC. I have a one-class clssification problem so I should be using -s 2 according to svmtrain options. However when I modify the 4th line of the above code into cmd = ['-s 2 -v 5 -c ', num2str(2^log2c), ' -g ', num2str(2^log2g)]; I am getting this error: Undefined function 'ge' for input arguments of type 'struct'. Error in ergasia (line 37) if (cv >= bestcv), For what I know, svm returns a model of type struct. My question is, is the code I am using suitable for parameter selection in a one class classification problem? An other question: Is there a better way of defining the best C and gamma other than that? I found this method here: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf I could really use some help with that so thank you in advance.
