In PHP Dependency Injection, do I need to "require_once" the php file where the dependency is defined?

Taking Fabien Potencier's example : class User { function __construct($storage) { $this->storage = $storage; } // ... } Assuming the Storage class is defined in a different php file (say, storage.php), do I need to include it in this file where the injection is done via a require_once? Thanks, JDelage
