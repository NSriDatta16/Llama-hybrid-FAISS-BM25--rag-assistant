EFPocoAdapter has been deprecated in favor of Entity Framework 4.0. The beta release was announced less than a week ago and you can already download Beta 1 if you're an MSDN subscriber. There is no reason to use EFPocoAdapter anymore. I would also encourage you to read the ADO.NET Entity Framework Design Team blog for a list of all the features on EF 4.0, it's an excellent read. Also have a look at this blog post: POCO in the Entity Framework: Part 1 - The Experience . As to my experience with EFPocoAdapter, I was/am happy with the support for POCO, lazy loading and n-tier scenarios. Entity Framework builds on this further by providing T4 templates among other things, something which I really felt lacking (though many prefer to hand-code their POCO classes). The other issues I had were serializer issues with JavaScriptSerializer which doesn't handle circular references while DataContractSerializer which does, requires class/member attributes which prior to T4 templates weren't possible with auto-generated classes. The EFPocoAdapter was always meant to be a sort of staging platform to get feedback from the community and develop the feature-set for EF 4.0. While it is a bit rough around the edges I did manage to fulfil my requirements, albeit after a few exchanges with Jaroslaw. That and support was very bleak (few people on forums or stack overflow).
