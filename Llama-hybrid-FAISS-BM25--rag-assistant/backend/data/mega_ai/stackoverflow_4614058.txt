is http://raghu.tkiportal/extension/feide/lib/simplesaml/www working? Then reading your configuration I'm afraid the last rewrite rule takes precedence on your alias (or applies just after). So your /simplesaml/index.[html.php] is redirected on /index.php The rewrite rule contains exceptions, try to add simplesaml in the exceptions listing: RewriteRule !(^/simplesaml|^/design|^/var|.* ... To debug this you could activate RewriteLogLevel 9 and a Rewrite Log /absolute/path/to/debug.log and check that you calls on /simplesaml are rewritten by mod_rewrite
