As Elias Strehle mentioned in the comments, this does not sound like a problem for machine learning. You will be able to solve this much faster by identifying a few simple patterns that indicate which type of log you are looking at. I can already see that lines start with date string followed by a few tokens which look different in each log. You can define regex patterns that will only match a certain type of log, for example: ^(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)\s+\d{1,2} will match your Linux-syslog ^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\s+\d+\s will match your MySQL-error log ^[A-Z]+\d+, will match your Event log ^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\s+\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3} will match your FTP log And ^\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4} will match your MSSQL Server log.
