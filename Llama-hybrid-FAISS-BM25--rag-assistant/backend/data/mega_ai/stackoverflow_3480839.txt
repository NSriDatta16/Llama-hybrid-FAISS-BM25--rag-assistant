Open-source urban driving simulator

Open-source urban driving simulator needed to build an automated taxi driver. The dream feature-set may include: * easy import of external AI code * other agents, such as cars and pedestrians * simulated programmable traffic and traffic regulations * relatively realistic physics engine I had a look at TORCS, which has most of these features, only simulates a racetrack. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.
