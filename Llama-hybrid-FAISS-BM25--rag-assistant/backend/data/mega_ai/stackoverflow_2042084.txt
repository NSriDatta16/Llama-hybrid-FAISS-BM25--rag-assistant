I use the SMEStorage service for this which works really well. The GMail package I signed up for enables you to use GMail as a Storage Cloud and it works really well. There are also some windows tools that you can use. I'm using the paid version which gives me a vitual (namespace) drive, sync, and shell tools as well as MS Office and Open Office integration. If sign up for the Lifetime Cloud package (which is what I did) you can use up to 10 GMail accounts.
