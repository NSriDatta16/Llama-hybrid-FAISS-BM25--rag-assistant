How to account for spatial autocorrelation when the outcome (distance cycled) is continuous?

I aim to predict distance cycled based on population density, recreational area density, infrastructure density, road intersection density, and average gradient (hilliness). The response variable, distance cycled (km cycled per year), is continuous and strongly skewed to the right (see histogram below). Therefore, I was considering using a Gamma regression model. However, the data is areal (aggregated for small areas within a region), so I also need to account for spatial autocorrelation. Is there any 'spatial Gamma regression model' for continuous response variables (strongly skewed to the right)? I have looked at the Besag-York-Molli√© (BYM) model (popular in disease mapping) included in the R-INLA R package, but I am not sure whether it would be suitable for my continuous outcome distance cycled. Thanks! I assumed I had to account for spatial autocorrelation after conducting a Moran's I test in my model using testSpatialAutocorrelation() in the R DHARMa package. For this, I used the following code: m_glm = glmmTMB(km_c_l ~ Density_s + Recreational_a_s + Infrastructure_a_s + Connectivity_a_s + Gradient_s, family = Gamma(link = log), data = simd_gc2) res_null = simulateResiduals(m_glm) testSpatialAutocorrelation(res_null, x = simd_gc2 $lon, y = simd_gc2$ lat) These are the results: DHARMa Moran's I test for distance-based autocorrelation data: res_null observed = 0.0847314, expected = -0.0013423, sd = 0.0022684, p-value
