Can I use logistic regression when my IV is dichotomous but my DV is continuous?

I have a longitudinal data set in which my predictor/Independent Variable is dichotomous and was assessed at age 4 years, and my outcome/Dependent Variable (depressive symptoms) was assessed at 16 years. I would rather not arbitrarily dichotomize the DV, and I would prefer to avoid non-parametric stats so that I could include some covariates. Naively, I would think that one could use a dichotomous IV but continuous DV in logistic regression, though I would assume that technically I would be using depressive symptoms to predict my IV? Is there any precedence for this in the literature (or alternative analyses to consider)? Thanks.
