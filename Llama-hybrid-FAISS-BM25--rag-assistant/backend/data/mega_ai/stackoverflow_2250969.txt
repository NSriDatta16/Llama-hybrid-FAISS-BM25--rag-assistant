Should Unit Tests be in their own project in a .Net Solution

Should I start a new project for my unit tests? That would mean that I would get two executables correct? Then I am worried about the namespace organization. Would I be able to put the unit test in the same namespaces as the classes that they are testing although they are part of a different project? This raises another question. I know that namespace naming convention is CompanyName.TechnologyName.Feautre.Design. How would I get this right in my solution/project layout? Does the solution name = companyname, project name = technology name? If that is the case does that mean I can't separate my unit tests into a new project.
