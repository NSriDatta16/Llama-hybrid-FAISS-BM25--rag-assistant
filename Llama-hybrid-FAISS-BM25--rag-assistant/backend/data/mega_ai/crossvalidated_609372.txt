Which training instances are being subsampled in each iteration of XGBoost?

The subsample option in XGBoost is described here as follows: Subsample ratio of the training instances. Setting it to 0.5 means that XGBoost would randomly sample half of the training data prior to growing trees. and this will prevent overfitting. Subsampling will occur once in every boosting iteration. [default=1] Is it possible to access the list of training instances being used in each iteration? If there are N observations in the full training data and we train an XGBoost model with NROUNDS iterations, I am imagining an N times NROUNDS matrix with position (i,j) being 1 if observation i is used in boosting iteration j, and 0 otherwise.
