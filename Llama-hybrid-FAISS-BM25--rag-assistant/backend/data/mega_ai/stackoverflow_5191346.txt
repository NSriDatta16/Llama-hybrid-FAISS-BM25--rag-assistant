SML has better support for continuations. If you have a strong need for continuations, it is a better choice; OCaml has no in-language support for them, but there is the Delimcc library by Oleg for delimited continuations; being external, it is probably slower than SML's implementations. Otherwise, OCaml seems to have more traction these days, so you should expect the tooling and libraries to be slightly better. More generally, SML tends to be rather more elegant, while OCaml has some more advanced features, quirks, and users. Performance-wise they're both good. (See this for a syntactic comparison of the mostly-common fragments of both languages; of course OCaml's objects and polymorphic variants are not presented.)
