Using nm (as in Robert Gamble's answer ) is the correct answer to your question. The trick is in knowing where to look for the libraries. What does your program do? If there is a large amount of numerics going on, chances are you should be linking against math libraries (like LAPACK or BLAS) and might want to start looking there. Web searching can also be helpful - I typed "ortho2" into my favorite search engine and got this documentation that suggests it's in libfgl.a Note that when you search you should probably omit the trailing underscore - it's usually added to the routine name by the compiler.
