How does normalization reduce dimensionality of data?

While reading a SVM tutorial, the author makes the following statement on normalization technique for processing the input data: Normalizing data to unit vectors reduces the dimensionality of the data by one since the data is projected to the unit sphere. I am quite lost on how to understand the dimensionality was reduced by one. Any more explanations will be greatly appreciated.
