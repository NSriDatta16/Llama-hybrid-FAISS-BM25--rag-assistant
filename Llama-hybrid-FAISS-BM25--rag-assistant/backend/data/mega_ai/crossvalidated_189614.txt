Time series analysis (ACF, PACF)

I have this monthly time series with pronounced seasonality and a bit of trend: The ACF and PACF for 4 years (48 months) are: Can I suppose that the data don't need transformations like: log(data), diff(data)...? ACF: A spike at lag 12 in the ACF but no other significant spikes. PACF: ? R proposes ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,0,0)[12] . Could it be a good model?
