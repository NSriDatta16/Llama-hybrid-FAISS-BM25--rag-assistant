Difference between batch_size in TimeSeriesGenerator and model.fit batch_size

im wondering if there is a difference between the batch_size set in the TimeSeriesGenerator and the batch_size in the model_fit. I create some RNN Forecasts for timeseries. train_generator = TimeseriesGenerator(data=scaled_train, targets=scaled_train, length=n_input, batch_size=batch_size, stride=1, sampling_rate=1, shuffle=False, start_index=0, end_index=None) The in model.fit hist = model.fit(train_generator, # also take batch_size, shuffle, etc? steps_per_epoch=1, epochs=1000, #batch_size=32,? #shuffle=False,? verbose=1, validation_data = valid_generator, validation_steps=len(valid_generator), callbacks=[early_stop] ) I did create the TimeSeriesGenerator for valdidation and for trainingdata. Do I need to specify the batch_size again in the model.fit. If I do will it influence my results? Maybe multiplicate the batch_sizes?? Thank you.
