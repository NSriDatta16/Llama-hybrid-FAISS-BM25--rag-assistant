Got the solution on my own! Thanks to the awesome JavaScript Tutorial from Leigh Kaszick: "The Basics of Object-Oriented JavaScript". Check it out: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/the-basics-of-object-oriented-javascript/ Literal objects are always referenced while functional are not ;) That's the trick. Literal Object: var Storage = { id:'one', content:'blah' }; functional Object: function Storage(id,content) = { this.id=id; this.content:content; } var myStorage = new Storage('one','blah'); To solve my problem I created a new instance of the storage object each time when I pass data to the clipboard. And it works! ;)
