First, I'm not sure SMC-ABC is the same as MCMC-ABC with a threshold reduction; if I'm not mistaken, it's more similar to rejection-ABC with threshold reduction. So, it might not be exactly what you have in mind. You should check the maybe this paper here which explains (one version of) SMC-ABC very nicely and also gives some brief comparison to the original SMC-ABC by prof. Scott Sisson. Second, I completely agree with Xi'an's comment. MCMC is "slow", and ABC requires many simulations. So, if your bottle neck is the simulation part, not sure how you can continue - reducing $\epsilon$ or not. As Xi'an suggested, you might be able to use a surrogate to replace the actual simulator. Very simple ones can be Gaussian-Process regressions (check out this paper). Maybe a heteroscedastic GP or a multiple output GP (MOGP). They are however quite simplistic and are limited to a single mode. There is newer literature in the Machine Learning field - which is called Simulation Based Inference (SBI) . They use Neural-Density-Estimators (e.g., Mixture Density Networks, and different SotA Normalizing Flows) and they don't require any thresholds $\epsilon$ . I have a series about it on YouTube which you can find here . I see it as a natural development to the "Regression Adjustment" papers that improved classical ABC algorithms by uncovering the underlying structure between parameters $\theta$ and data $x$ . There is also a great library in Python called "SBI". My master thesis in Statistics (which is being submitted now) deals with reducing simulator calls in ABC. I tried two methods - one is using a Neural-Density-Estimator as a surrogate for the actual simulator - which is more expressive than GP-surrogates. And another one is using "Support Points" which are a class of energy-distance based representative points instead of simple sampling. Both might be helpful to reducing simulator calls, though the NDE surrogate seems to be better at-least for small dimension problems.
