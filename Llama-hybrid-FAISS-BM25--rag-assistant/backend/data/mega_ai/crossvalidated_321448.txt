You're going to have a tough time doing this without a training set on bounding boxes. Why not just use the SVHN dataset with bounding boxes, found here? http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/ To actually detect bounding boxes, you'll likely need some kind of RCNN network, because the difficulty is always with region proposals. If you want an unsupervised method you could try this: Fast Unsupervised Object Localization - Anjan, et. al.: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/285_Report.pdf
