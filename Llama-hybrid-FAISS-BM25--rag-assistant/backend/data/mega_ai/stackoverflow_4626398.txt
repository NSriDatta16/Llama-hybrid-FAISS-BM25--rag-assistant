Magento login and register form one page

I am trying to combine the login form and create account form in Magento into one page. The reason is i just think the fewer pages the better. I find Magento confusing and have limited understanding of its layout and template system. I decided the easiest way to do this would be to just add the login form to the register account page. I found the login form and register form in login.phtml and register.phtml in template/customer/form/. I simply copied the PHTML code from login.phtml into the register.phtml file that is in the same directory. This is what I ended up with: http://pastebin.com/fpkeBsxc After I fill in the email and password of an account and click login, the page returns with validation errors referring to the register account form bellow it. Basically, I'm not sure if this is because my approach is completely stupid/wrong and I can't just copy and paste code like this, or is this a simple html problem that I can't see? I think might be wrong way, as register form works. I'll post a screenshot of this in a comment, it won't let me paste more than one link. Thanks for any advice.
