Recording individual average and cummulative average and highest average score

I am trying to create a program that calculates the average scores for bowlers, the team average score, and the highest average score on the team. Problems: I am unable to figure out how to display all the individual player averages at the end without displaying everytime the loop iterates. how do I set up the code so that I can calculate the cummulative average and highest average score? Below is the code I wrote so far import java.util.*; public class bowlerama2 { public static void main(String args[]) { Scanner keyboard=new Scanner(System.in); int players;// for number of players on the team int games=0;// for number of games played int totalGames=0; System.out.println("Enter the number of players on the bowling team."); System.out.println("You must enter a number greater than or equal to three"); players=keyboard.nextInt(); //input validation while (players 300) { System.out.println("Invalid entry. Score must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to three hundred"); System.out.println("Enter the score for player " + number+ " in game " +amount+ ":"); score=keyboard.nextInt(); } total+=score; average=total/amount; System.out.println("The average score for player " +number+ " is:" + average); } } }
