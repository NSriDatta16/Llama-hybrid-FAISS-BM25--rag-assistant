Pragmatic programmer code generation exercise

I am reading the The Pragmatic programmer and doing the following exercise in .net world (Chapter 3 - Code Generators) The Exercise "Write a code generator that takes the input in Listing 1, and generates output in two languages of your choice. Try to make it easy to add new languages." Listing 1 # Add a product # to the 'on-order' list M AddProduct F id int F name char[30] F order_code int E How would you implement the solution in T4 or anything else in .net world (CodeDOM is too complex) so that we can generate the code in c# and in one other .net language (visual basic or IronRuby etc.)
