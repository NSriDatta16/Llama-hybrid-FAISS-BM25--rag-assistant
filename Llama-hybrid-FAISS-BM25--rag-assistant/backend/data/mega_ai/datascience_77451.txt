ETL and Data Engineering - is it purely the knowledge of tools or is there theory behind it?

I would like to better understand what a good Data Englineer must know or what he does. Job descriptions mostly list tools that are required, such as Python. If it is possible to separate Data Engineering from Data Science, on what principles is Data Engineering based, what is the result of the Data Engineering? Is it creating some data structures? If so, what these structures might be? Are there standards or best practices?
