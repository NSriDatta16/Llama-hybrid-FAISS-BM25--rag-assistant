ASP.NET MVC2 global authentication

I'm new to ASP.NET MVC 2 and I ran into a simple problem. The thing is that I want to force user to login to view my website. That means when user requests something like Home.Index or any other Controller.Action, I should check if user is logged in and if not, redirect request to Auth.LogIn. I could check for authorization in every Action of each Controller, but I thought that there should be some more elegant approaches for this. So. Is there?
