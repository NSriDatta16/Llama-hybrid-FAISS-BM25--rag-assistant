The Parallel extensions split the load per core - although I'm not sure if they take into account hyperthreaded cores. But, to add another answer to steer you in the right direction: Don't try and do this in parallel. The disk can only serve one request at a time, so you're likely to just slow everything down as the disk queue is just likely to get bigger. The only scenario where you might be able to get increased performance is if the location you're scanning is actually a SAN where the storage is distributed and highly replicated.
