Not really elegant, but a cute trick: var index = parseInt( $.map(array, function(i, o) { return o.id === target ? i : ''; }).join('') ); jQuery doesn't have a lot of functional constructs like that; the philosophy of the library is really focused on the job of DOM wrangling. They won't even add a .reduce() function because nobody can think of a reason it'd be useful to the core functionality. The Underscore.js library has a lot of such facilities, and it "plays nice" with jQuery.
