I.I.D. means independent and identically distributed, so $\epsilon$ is a vector of component random variables with the same distribution. The meaning of "A follows an X distribution" is equivalent to saying that it "has a distribution," which is to say that it is a random quantity that can be determined only in probability. In the example of regression that you refer to, $Y=f(X) + \epsilon; \epsilon \stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2)$ , so the response variable $Y$ is equal to some function of the independent $X$ on average , and errors are normally distributed with mean zero, i.e. the observed $Y$ is not exactly $f(X)$ .
