Predicted Values in machine learning

I remember reading an article comparing predicted probabilities of boosted, stacked encoders, random forests, and neural network algorithms. One important point I got from the article was that gbm pushes predicted probabilities towards 1 and zero. Does anyone know an algorithm that produces predicted probabilities that are close to 0.5?
