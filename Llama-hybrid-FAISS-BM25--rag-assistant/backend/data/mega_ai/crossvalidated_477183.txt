Having done scientific research in Machine learning / Statistical pattern recognition for 17 years - I can come up with a few skills that make a wanted-for data scientist stand out from others. Machine learning is about: Achieving the algorithmic knowledge of learning algorithms out there, and getting the skill of how to apply these learning algorithms successfully to practical ML-problems, Gaining the required level of knowledge in probability theory (beginning with Bayes rule), parametric statistics and nonparametric statistics as to assess and compare different types of learnable models, model performance, confidence intervals, sampling theory, and ML-estimation. Don't underestimate the level of statistical knowledge required to become a skilled professional (go though the proof of the central limit theorem , for example, and understand when this theorem is not applicable ), Understand mathematical approximation theory to a level so you can see why feed-forward neural networks (with 2 hidden layers, or more) are universal approximators - offspring of the theorem of Komolgorov, Gain practical experience from learning classifiers on many different training sets, and validate their performance on independent test sets, Understand that optimal feature selection and model selection require knowledge of how algorithmics and statistics intertwine - take as an example the branch-and-bound algorithm for feature selection. Recognize that feature selection and model selection always involve a bias-variance trade-off (between performance variance and optimal model fit), Go through the derivations by Richard & Lippmann (1991) why neural network classiÔ¨Åers estimate bayesian a posteriori probabilities, Get acquainted with major scientific breakthroughs in the last eight decades with respect to the development of statistical and algorithmic prediction models, beginning with linear discriminant analysis (a statistical classifier), Embrace the fact that no one machine learning scheme is optimal for almost 'all kinds of problems'. So - neural networks are not better than all other models, neither are support vector machines or random forests for that sake - it all depends on the statistics of the underlying domain. Practical machine learning remains an experimental science, but many relevant theoretical results have been published in literature over the years. It's hard work to be able to span algorithmics, statistics and mathematical approximation theory. I did my Ph.D. in machine learning and first really became a professional after more than 10 years of work. A final note is that it is not always necessary to be a programmer to apply machine learning algorithms. ML-suites like Weka or available classifier services like insight classifiers let data scientists apply different ML-algorithms without having to program in for example Python or R. It is a great discipline - Machine learning.
