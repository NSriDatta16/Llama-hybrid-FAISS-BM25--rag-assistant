We have about 1000 tests, large percentage of those communicating through REST and hitting database. Total run time is about 8 minutes. An hour seems excessive, but I don't know what you are doing and how complex your tests are. But I think there is a way to help you. We are using TeamCity and it has a nice ability to have multiple build agents. What you could do is split your test project into subprojects with each subproject containing just a number of tests. You could use JNunit/NUnit Categories to separate them. Then you would configure TeamCity so that each agent would build just one type of subproject. This way, you'd get parallel execution of tests. With few agents (you get 3 for free), you should be able to get to 20 minutes, which might even be acceptable. If you put each agent into VM, you might not even require additional machines, you just need lots of RAM.
