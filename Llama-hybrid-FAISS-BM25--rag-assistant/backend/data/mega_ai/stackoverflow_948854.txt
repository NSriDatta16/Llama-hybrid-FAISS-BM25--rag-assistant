Updating the users table row by row will be a time consuming task. It would be better if you could re-organise your query so that row by row updates are not required. I'm not 100% sure of the syntax (as I've never used MySQL before) but here's a sample of the syntax used in MS SQL Server 2000 DECLARE @tmp TABLE ( [MonthRank] [INT] NOT NULL, [UserId] [INT] NOT NULL, ) INSERT INTO @tmp ([UserId]) SELECT [id] FROM [users] WHERE [status] = '1' ORDER BY [month_score] DESC UPDATE users SET month_rank = [tmp].[MonthRank] FROM @tmp AS [tmp], [users] WHERE [users].[Id] = [tmp].[UserId] In MS SQL Server 2005/2008 you would probably use a CTE.
