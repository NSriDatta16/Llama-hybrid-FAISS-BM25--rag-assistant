Typically, one could use inverse variance weighing and combine the average of measurement values with a weighing function like $w_i = 1/\sigma_i^2$ . The problem here is that the variance seems to be a function of the unknown speed. As alternative you could use an iteratively re-weighted least squares approach where you estimate the variance $\sigma_i^2$ based on an initial estimate (e.g. based on equal weights) and iteratively re-compute a new estimate of the velocity based on estimates of the variances and weights computed with the previous estimate of the velocity. A requirement for this approach is an estimate of the (relative) dependency of the variance on velocity. If there are some unknown parameters in this dependency then potentially you can use a machine learning approach and optimize the parameters based on cross validation (for which you still need some standard to determine the performance).
