Where is this running, exactly? If you're running this in the browser, in Javascript, there are better ways than regular expression (e.g. jQuery selectors on tr:has(td) as a random example) If you're running it on a server-side environment, e.g. PHP, regular expression can work. Something like: (]+>.?) Reason I'm suggesting that as opposed to anything else - you want to get the entire content, so wrap the entire thing in parentheses, the TR and TD may or may not have width, never hurts to be sure about such things. The .*? construction should in most regexp engines be non-greedy, so match the smallest string that conforms - which should prevent ... being matched. Would still need multiline and case insensitivity, usually m and i, to be set as well. (I haven't tested this, however) But as robert points out, on the server side, a proper HTML parser would be better, either the DOM or XML extensions should be able to deal with it.
