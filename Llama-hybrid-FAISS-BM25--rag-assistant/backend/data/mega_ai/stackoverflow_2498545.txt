You work as normal in Netbeans until you decide that you want to commit your changes to Subversion, or update your working copy with revisions that have been committed by other users. You would be able to update the live site from the dev repository - you need a Subversion client on the live site's host machine to do this. The mod_dav_svn plugin for apache2 allows access to a Subversion repository over the web. I haven't used VisualSVN Server as I've always used Apache. It probably has everything you need and might be easier to set up. I've used TortoiseSVN as a Subversion client in the past and found it useful. If you secure your web server your brother could connect over HTTPS, but VPN would work just as well and might be easier to set up securely. Subversion can store its data in BerkelyDB, however I have always used a file system repository (FSFS) and found this to be fine. There are beginners' guides to Subversion, e.g. from the Pragmatic Programmers bookshelf, and O'Reilly.
