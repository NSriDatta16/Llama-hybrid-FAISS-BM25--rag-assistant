how can i have multiple lines of text centered if they are not wide enough, and justified if they fill the entire width?

I have a large paragraph that I want to keep in one p tag. I have seen some solution, but it requires every line to be in a different tag. the idea is to have lines justified and centered at the same time. I know in CSS it does not make sense as the property text-align defines both for some strange reason. before posting a solution, please create one or or whatever you want, fill it with three lines of text, and make sure that the first two are justified, and the last one is centered. That is exactly what I am asking for.
