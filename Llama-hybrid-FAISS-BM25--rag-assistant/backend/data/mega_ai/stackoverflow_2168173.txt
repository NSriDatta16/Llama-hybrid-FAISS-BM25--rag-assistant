What do you name a Java package when it isn't a part of a top level domain?

I've read the syntax conventions for naming Java packages, and I know the general rule of thumb, but what if you've just started building your application, you haven't chosen a license, and it is a personal project? It doesn't make sense to throw in "com.mycompany" or "org.myorganization" if that is not the case. Does anyone have suggestions for this?
