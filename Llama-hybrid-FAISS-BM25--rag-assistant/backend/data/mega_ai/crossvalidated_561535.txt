Notation used in time series

I found this wikipedia article about the concept of stationarity in stochastic processes. Let $\left\{X_t\right\}$ be a stochastic process and let $F_{X}(x_{t_1 + \tau}, \ldots, x_{t_n + \tau})$ represent the cumulative distribution function of the unconditional (i.e., with no reference to any particular starting value) joint distribution of $\left\{X_t\right\}$ at times $t_1 + \tau, \ldots, t_n + \tau$ . I do not understand what the notation $x_{t_{1}}$ means. The usual way of defining a time series would be to index a variable with a time value $t$ as in $x_{t}$ . Intuitively this would denote what the value of the time series is at time period $t$ . Why the need to add another index integer under the $t$ ?
