Detecting ellipses in an image

I’m trying to use CNNs to detect ellipses (of different shapes, sizes, orientation) in an image. How do I do this? I’ve tried using many centered ellipses as training (positive) examples and noise as negative examples. (It didn’t work in detecting a simple test ellipse). My concern is that a CNN captures features/kernels/filters (like rounded edges) from the training examples. But a curved edge captures little information regarding an ellipse. Can one SET ellipses as features/kernels/filters in a CNN? (Matlab answer preferred)
