According to Apache’s recommended example for the use of mod_deflate , the only user agents that lack proper support are: […] Netscape Navigator version of 4.x. These versions cannot handle compression of types other than text/html . The versions 4.06, 4.07 and 4.08 also have problems with decompressing html files. Thus, we completely turn off the deflate filter for them. Any other browser – especially all modern browsers – should support compression properly.
