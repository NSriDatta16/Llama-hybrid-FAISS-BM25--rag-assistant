Linq to Entities - Retrieve entity with "self-reference" from Stored Procedure

I can't quite figure this out. I have a table called Employee with and Id field. The table also contains a ManagerId field which has a foreign key pointing to the Employee's Id field. When I add the table as an entity to my entity data model it creates the new Employee entity with an EmployeeChildren collection element and an EmployeeParent element. I can retrieve all employee's and have them put into a new instance of the Employee entity perfect. The employee entity will have many children, each child entity can have many children of their own and each one has a pointer back to it's parent. What I need to do now is retrieve a subset of those employee's using a stored procedure. Right now, if I search for employee John Doe, who has 2 people above him, the stored procedure will return 3 rows. EmployeeID ManagerId Name 1 null Bill 2 1 Jane 3 2 John Doe Here is my code to do the retrieval: using (var entity = new TimeEntryEntities()) { var employees = from E in entity.EmployeeSearch(search) orderby E.Name select E; return employees.ToList (); } Right now, this code returns 3 separate entities. How can I have it group them together into one?
