Interpreting the fitted model outputs from a covariate-adjusted ROC curve in the AROC package

Below I have fitted a covariate-adjusted ROC curve (AROC) using a semiparametric Bayesian normal linear regression model available in the R package “AROC”. However, I am not clear on how to interpret/report the results of the fitting process. library(AROC) data(psa) # Select the last measurement newpsa Fitted model outputs Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.397 -1.724 -0.647 0.458 33.454 Coefficients: Variable Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>t) (Intercept) -12.9464 7.1945 -1.799 0.0764 age 0.2255 0.1049 2.149 0.0352 Residual standard error: 4.493 on 68 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.06361, Adjusted R-squared: 0.04984 F-statistic: 4.619 on 1 and 68 DF, p-value: 0.03518 Specific questions What is the unit used in the residuals and β coefficients? Is it correct to say that the predictive accuracy of marker1 was worse for those who were older (β = 0.2255 per 1-year increase, p-value = 0.0352)? Is the multiple R-squared value interpreted as the covariates in the model (i.e. age) accounted for approximately 6% of the predictive accuracy of marker1 (multiple R-squared = 0.06361)? Does the F-statistic p-value at the end refer to the multiple-R-squared and adjusted R-squared (i.e. multiple R-squared = 0.06361, p-value = 0.03518)? Is the term "multiple R squared" correct here since only age (one covariate) is adjusted for, or should it be just "R squared"?
