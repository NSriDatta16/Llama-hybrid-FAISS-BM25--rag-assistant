You could seek inspiration in a completely different area of research, psychometry. Psychometrists have broad literature on computerized adaptive testing , where the problem statement is similar: you want to assess some trait of a person, using a computerized questionnaire, using as small a number of questions as possible. It is not something that I did, so I would encourage you to check the references in the Wikipedia's article and possibly google for some more resources.
