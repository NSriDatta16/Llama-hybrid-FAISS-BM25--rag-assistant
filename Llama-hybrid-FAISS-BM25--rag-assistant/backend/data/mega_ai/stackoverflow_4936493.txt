From: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/53ezey2s.aspx Win32Exception - An error occurred when opening the associated file. 1) If you're going to use the static method of Process.Start(String) you don't really need to declare a Process object. //Use... Process p = new Process(); p.StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo(filename); p.Start(); //Or... Process.Start(filename); 2) The exception is basically saying that it can not open that file for some reason. Are you sure the path is correct? Have you tried opening that file manually? 3) Make sure to define your file paths somewhere more organized. Such as a settings file. This also helps eliminate the need for escaping the characters. But, if you insist on leaving that string inline, at least remove the need for escape characters by preceding it with the @ symbol ( @"C:\Program Files\SomeFile.exe" )
