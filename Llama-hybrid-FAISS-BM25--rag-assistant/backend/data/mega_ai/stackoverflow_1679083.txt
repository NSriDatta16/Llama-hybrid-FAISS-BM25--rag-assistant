How can i build dynamic organizational chart?

I'm trying to build an dynamic organizational chart with php. Do i need to build it myself or is there some tools for that? specification: all the positions in the company are predefined in the org chart, we only add persons in the correspondent position. I need your suggestions. Thanks. I have installed image_graphviz and graphviz in my computer. but i don't know how to use it actually. Because there is so few documentation. Does anyone have ever done this job or have some relational materials?? thanks a lot.
