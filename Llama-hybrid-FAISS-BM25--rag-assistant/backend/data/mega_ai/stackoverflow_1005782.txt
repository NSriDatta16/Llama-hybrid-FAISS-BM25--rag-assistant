SQL AVERAGE TIME

I have the following query in MSSQL: select TRANSACTION_TYPE_ID ,COUNT(TRANSACTION_TYPE_ID)AS NUMBER_OF_TRANSACTIONS ,CAST(SUM(AMOUNT)AS DECIMAL (30,2)) AS TOTAL FROM [ONLINE_TRANSACTION] WHERE CONVERT(CHAR(8), CREATED_ON, 114) >='17:30' AND AMOUNT IS NOT NULL AND TRANSACTION_TYPE_ID !='CHEQUE-STOP-TRANS-TYPE' GROUP BY TRANSACTION_TYPE_ID ORDER BY TRANSACTION_TYPE_ID I want to show the type of transactions TRANSATION_TYPE_ID as above the total amount of each type of transaction as above BUT also the average time these transactions occurred CREATED_ON which is datetime I still have not find a good way of doing this?
