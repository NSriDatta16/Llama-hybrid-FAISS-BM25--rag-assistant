My instinct would tell me that unless B is nullable and B is sparsely populated (really sparse, as low as 1% or lower as well as numbering less than 10% of the average number of values per index key A), such that inspecting B in descending order then checking for A=123 on those records is worthwhile, MySql won't have a bar of the index on B for this query. More than likely it will just use A (if A is selective enough), retrieve from the table the records, sort by B descending and return the result. This would mean your 1st case, O(N + m). N is directly proportional to table size, which is also statistically how many records on average would satisfy A={any x}
