Distributing across computers is not a builtin feature of standard SQL Server. Partitioning does not really reduce load or do anything specially better for parallelism than indexes. It DOES offer easier management of swapping partitions in or out. Partitions can be stored on different file groups for easier storage management. There is a SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse appliance product now (from the acquisition of DATAllegro).
