How far can one go with excel?

in my business we handle all analytics through Excel. This includes mostly scheduling, production planning and accounting operations. We currently are looking into adding a bit of predictive modelling and Excel does suffice to a point, but doesn't have support for complex models. As I see it, the main benefits of Excel are its ease of use and the ease with which you can find and train people to get accustomed to it. On the other hand more sophisticated environments (e.g. R, python) can handle a wider variety of analytics tasks, but require better trained individuals. I have also read this question on if Excel is sufficient for Data Science and while it is a bit out of scope for my purpose, the conclusion is that tools like R and Python are much better than Excel. My question is (in the context of data analytics): "How much far can we get with Excel, without needing to change to a more sophisticated tool?" or "At what point do we need to migrate from Excel to -let's say- R?" Thank you very much!
