Custom DragAndDrop in Java

I Have a JList with custom objects. I would like to select the object from the list and drag and drop to a JPanel. But I'm confused about all terms in DnD tutorials. I think is there more than one way to solve it. In the source, jlist, What are the key interfaces I have to implement and what classes do I need to call? And in the target JPanel? Thanks
