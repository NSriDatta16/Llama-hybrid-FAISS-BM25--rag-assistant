The question seems confused. You ask about modelling, but your focus appears to be just replacing missing values. Replacing missing values does not absolutely require a model for the entire dataset. To estimate particular missing values, you could consider using some appropriate interpolation method. The simplest is linear interpolation. Other methods that might work as well or better are cubic interpolation, cubic spline interpolation and piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation. Once you try one, it may be sensible to try others to see how far they agree. To model the entire series, using sines and cosines in linear regression is often a good method, but over a century or so, you need to think about trends too, including the possibility that the trend is itself complicated. There are any number of versatile time series model with a regression flavour that could be used, but you might need to do much more reading and/or take appropriate courses before they are within your reach.
