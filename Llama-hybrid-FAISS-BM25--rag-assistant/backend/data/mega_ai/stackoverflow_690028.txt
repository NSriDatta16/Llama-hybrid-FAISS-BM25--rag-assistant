Array Index out of bounds

This is what I'm trying to do: I'm reading a file in from the command line. The file contains a list of data,below this paragraph is what it looks like. The problem I'm having is with the if statements. import java.util.*; import java.io.*; public class VehicleTest { public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { String vehicle = "vehicle"; String car = "car"; String americanCar = "american car"; String foreignCar = "foreign car"; String truck = "truck"; String bicycle = "bicycle"; File file = new File(args[0]); Scanner input = new Scanner(file); String[] autos = new String[100]; ArrayList allVehicles = new ArrayList(); for (int i = 0; i In pseudo code this would be: while i is less than the length of the string array if you see the word vehicle create a new vehicle object and add it to the arrayList. if you see the word car create a new car object and add it to the arrayList. ..... The problems is that I get an arrayOutOfBounds exception with the code I'm using. I understand that j++ is what is wrong, but how else am I supposed to iterate through the string array so that I can read each line and create the appropriate objects? I'm at a loss as to what to do. I need some help. foreign car aMarioy Mario's house (777) 777-7777 gmario@mario.com false black Italy 4415.91 truck aDougy Doug's house (123) 456-7890 hdoug@doug.com 30 61234.56 8/10/2003 vehicle aRobby Rob's house (987) 654-3210 irob@rob.com bicycle bTommy Tom's house (246) 810-1214 jtom@tom.com 7 truck bGeorge George's house (666) 666-6666 kgeorge@george.com 25 51234.56 12/4/2004 vehicle bTim Tim's house (111) 111-1111 tim@tim.com bicycle bJim Jim's house (555) 555-5555 Ajim@jim.com 5 american car bJohn John's house (888) 888-8888 Bjohn@john.com true green false true car cKen Ken's house (999) 999-9999 Cken@ken.com false orange foreign car cMario Mario's house (777) 777-7777 Dmario@mario.com false black Italy 4415.91 american car gSam Sam's house (333) 333-3333 Hsam@sam.com false blue true false
