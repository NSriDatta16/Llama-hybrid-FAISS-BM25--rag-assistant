Calculate coefficients in a logistic regression with R

In a multiple linear regression it is possible to find out the coeffient with the following formula. $b = (X'X)^{-1}(X')Y$ beta = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% (t(X) %*% Y) ; beta For instance: > y x0 x1 x2 Y X beta = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% (t(X) %*% Y);beta [,1] x0 -0.8687015 x1 0.0611346 x2 0.9234254 > model I would like how to calculate in the same "manual" way the beta for a logistic regression. Where of course the y would be 1 or 0. Assuming I'm using the binomial family with a logit link.
