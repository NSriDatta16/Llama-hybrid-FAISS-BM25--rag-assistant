What are the advantages of using metaclasses in django-like form implementations?

First a little background ... I was going over the Django source code for forms to understand the implementation of forms in Django (and to learn some Python along the way). Django implements forms using a DeclaredMetaFields MetaClass . Here is a very crude class diagram of a Django-like form implementation ( link to sample code in gist). And here is an instance diagram. Here is a very crude implementation the same class without resorting to meta-classes ( link to sample code in gist). I understand the metaclass concepts etc. and understand how the Django code works. Now for the questions. Other than the obvious benefits such as syntactical elegance etc. are there any other benefits for the meta-class implementation? Is the meta-class like implementation possible without resorting to an intermediate object like BoundField?
