I have an object that I call 'UserAction' and each time the user interacts with the UI in some way, push another UserAction on a list with information like "clicked x" or "dragged p from x to y". It also has information like the date/time, username, etc. When an exception happens, the software auto-emails the exception message, stack trace and the dump of the UserAction log. It can be quite helpful in trying to repro the problem. I usually know what the problem is before the user has a chance to get to my office.
