It seems that page 32 of "MLaPP" is using notation in a confusing way, I made a little bit enhancement, could someone double check my work?

It seems that page 32 of "Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Patrick Murphy" is using notation in a confusing way. Define the function $F(q) = p(X ≤ q)$ . This is called the cumulative distribution function or cdf of X. This is obviously a monotonically increasing function... Here is the corresponding figure (fig_a). I guess p denotes probability here. define $f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F(x)$ (we assume this derivative exists); this is called the probability dx density function or pdf. Here is the corresponding figure (fig_b). Given a pdf, we can compute the probability of a continuous variable being in a finite interval as follows: ${\displaystyle \operatorname {P} (a As the size of the interval gets smaller, we can write $P(x≤X ≤x+dx)≈p(x)dx \tag{2.21}$ I guess p denotes pdf here (fig_b), in opposed to the notation in fig_a, is my understanding right? so, equation 2.21 is better be denoted as $P(x≤X ≤x+dx)≈f(x)dx$ , where $f(x)$ denotes the pdf, is the modification reasonable?
