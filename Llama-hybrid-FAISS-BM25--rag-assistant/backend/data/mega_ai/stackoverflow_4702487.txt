User-Agent is an HTTP header field. There are many ways to change it. For Firefox there are definitely plugins you can download that let you modify your HTTP headers on the fly. There is probably a plugin that will let you do do this on a per-tab basis. This sounds like a browser-specific question. But, in general, when it comes to HTTP, you can send whatever you want. Your browser does it automatically for you, but for Firefox, at least, you can download plugins that give you more control. For other browsers there might be a config file or setting that you can edit. If you're writing a web browser that lets you do this feature, well, that should be easy as well; the API you are using should let you modify the headers.
