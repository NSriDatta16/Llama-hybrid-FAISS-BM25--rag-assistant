Logistic Regression Odds Interpret

I was analyzing the different treatments applied to products. It started out with a a plethora of variables but I came to the conclusion that I can essentially only control the treatment applied so I only wanted to calculate those odds and dropped all other variables that I cannot control. Status = c('Fail','Pass','Pass','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Pass','Fail','Pass','Pass','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Pass','Fail','Pass','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Fail','Pass','Fail','Pass','Pass','Pass','Pass','Pass','Pass','Pass','Pass') Treatment = c('B','C','B','B','B','B','B','B','B','B','B','Z','B','B','B','B','B','C','C','B','B','B','B','B','B','B','C','C','C','C','Z','Z','Z','Z','Z','Z','Z','Z','Z','Z') length(X) length(D) df = cbind(Status,Treatment) df = as.data.frame(df) xtabs(~Status + Treatment,data = df) mylogit I want to make sure that I am interpreting the results correctly. Treatment Z increases the odds of Pass by 1200% Treatment C increases the odds of Pass by a factor 0f 44% Also, where do I get the odds for Treatment B?
