You are basically asking about the size of the effect. For the difference in means between a pair of variables, Cohen's d is a (standardized) measure of such an effect size and Cohen presented an interpretation in terms of normal distributions' overlap in his book Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences . Note that this is not necessarily the only relevant notion of what “most different” could mean in this context. Regarding the comment in the last paragraph, one important point is that the t statistic and other tests are based on the sampling distribution for the mean . They tell you how likely it would have been to observe a given difference if the null hypothesis were true, not how big this difference is. As the size of the sample increases, the variance of the sample mean decreases, as reflected in the lower standard error and narrower confidence intervals. Consequently, t can in principle be arbitrarily high and the p value arbitrarily small even if there is a lot of overlap and the difference is tiny in practical terms. Unlike the standard error of the mean, the variance of the data themselves and the overlap between their distributions obviously does not tend toward 0. Intuitively, adding observations does not make them less different from each other (but it does make their distribution more precisely known, hence the smaller standard error of the mean).
