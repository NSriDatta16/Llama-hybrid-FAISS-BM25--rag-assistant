emulate bounce effect in iphone app without UIScrollView

I am using a pan gesture to drag an item in my app. I know I could use a UIScrollView to get that "bounce" effect when dragging to an edge. However, that seems like a hack, so I'd like to find a way to get that effect when manually dragging an item (setting its frame or center point). I'm curious if there's a standard way, or a physics library in the Accelerate framework, something like that which wouldn't require me implementing my own physics engine.
