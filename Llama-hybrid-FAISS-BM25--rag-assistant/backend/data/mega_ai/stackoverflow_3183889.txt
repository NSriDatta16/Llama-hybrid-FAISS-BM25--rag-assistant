How can I embed a licence.licx file in a cpp executable?

We are using a third party UI component which requires a licence.licx file. The problem is that the executable is a cpp project and embedding the licence.licx file into the dll which actually uses the third party component does not seem to work. By "does not work" I mean that we get runtime licensing errors when executing the program on a machine which does not have the third party lib installed. We are also using Prism, which means that the dll's are dynamically loaded at runtime. Does anyone know how I can embed the licence.licx file into the cpp project or get the licensing system to resolve the licence file from a different location?
