However, when you update the app that directly gets deleted. No, it doesn't. Is there a directory I can use from Context that won't get wacked when the user goes to update the application? No files ever "get wacked when the user goes to update the application". All files in the on-board flash will "get wacked when the user" uninstalls the app. Does it have to be the SD Card since that's not always generally available on all phones? External storage is "generally available" on all Android devices that have the Android Market. It might not be available in specific circumstances (e.g., it is mounted on a host PC, external storage was removable and was actually removed).
