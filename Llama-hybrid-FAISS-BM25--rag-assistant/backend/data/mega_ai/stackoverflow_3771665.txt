iTunesConnect Technical users can upload binary files?

i'm a new iPhone developer and i'm working for a new company which ordered me an application. They are registered with the developer account and they added me with a Technical user role! My application is ready, now i need to implement and test the in-app purchase functionality because inside this app there are buyable contents. I have all the certificates and i tried the application on my iPhone and everything seems to go very well, so i: 1. created a new app through itunes connect 2. downloaded the application loader program to upload the binary files of the application in which i will implement the in-app purchase If i understand, to upload binaries i need a distribution certificate, but when i am inside my developer section, i can't see the corresponding "distribution" form. The apple guide says : "Only Team Agents are authorized to prepare and submit applications for distribution.", so if i'm a simple developer inside the company i can't upload any app ?
