Proof without words (about statistics or probability)

Are there any well known proofs without words about statistical theorems like for example the CLT, LLN, or the Gauss-Markov theorem? There are many about mathematics in general (e.g. here , or here ), but I have yet to come across one that proves a famous theorem in statistics or probability. A search on CV for "proof without words" returned exactly one elegant example .
