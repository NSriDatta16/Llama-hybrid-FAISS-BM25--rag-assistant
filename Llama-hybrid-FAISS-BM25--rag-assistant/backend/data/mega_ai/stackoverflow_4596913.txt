Formatting the results of a MySQL query as if it were run from the console

I'm writing a quick and dirty reporting script that queries a report and emails the results. When using the MySQL console the results are in a nicely formatted table: mysql> select * from users; +-----------+------------+-------+ | firstname | city | zip | +-----------+------------+-------+ | Maria | Holland | 12345 | | Rene | Doylestown | 65432 | | Helen | Conway | 98745 | +-----------+------------+-------+ 3 rows in set (0.01 sec) Is there an easy way to replicate this formatting when fetching the results with PHP? Obviously I could achieve this by writing my own report formatter but I was hoping for something a little more elegant.
