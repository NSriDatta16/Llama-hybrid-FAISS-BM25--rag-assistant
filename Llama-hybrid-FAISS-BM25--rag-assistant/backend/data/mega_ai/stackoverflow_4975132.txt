Here's something quick I mocked up. http://jsfiddle.net/meNVU/ Basically, you want to position your image absolutely in css, then set both the top and left properties to 50%. After that, set margin-left and margin-top to half the width * -1 and half the height * -1 respectively. Then, just set the z-index on the embedding the flash to 0, and the z-index for the image to 1. That should (and did) get you on the right track.
