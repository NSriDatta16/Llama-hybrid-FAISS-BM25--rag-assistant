os.listdir etc fails on shared windows path (Python 2.5)

I am seeing some weird behavior while parsing shared paths (shared paths on server, e.g. \storage\Builds) I am reading text file which contains directory paths which I want to process further. In order to do so I do as below: def toWin(path): return path.replace("\\", "\\\\") for line in open(fileName): l = toWin(line).strip() if os.path.isdir(l): print l # os.listdir(l) etc.. This works for local directories but fails for paths specified on shared system. e.g. E:\Test -- works \\StorageMachine\Test -- fails [internally converts to \\\\StorageMachine\\Test] \\StorageMachine\Test\ -- fails [internally converts to \\\\StorageMachine\\Test\\] But if I open python shell, import script and invoke function with same path string then it works! It seems that parsing windows shared paths is behaving differently in both cases. Any ideas/suggestions?
