Re DateTime ... this isn't a standard proto type; I have added a BCL.DateTime (or similar) to my own library, which is intended to match the internal serialization that protobuf-net uses for DateTime , but I'm fairly certain I haven't (yet) updated the code-generator to detect this as a special-case. It would be fairly easy to add if you want me to try... If you want maximum portability, a "ticks" style approach might be pragmatic. Let me know... Re serializing to a file - if should be about the same as the Getting Started example, but note that protobuf-net wants to work with data it can reconstruct; just IEnumerable might cause problems - IList should be fine, though (it'll default to List as a concrete type when reconstructing). Re corruption - perhaps use SerializeWithLengthPrefix - it can then detect issues even at a message boundary (where they are otherwise undetectable as an EOF). This (as the name suggests) writes the length first, so it knows whether is has enough data (via DeserializeWithLengthPrefix ). Alternatively, reserve the first [n] bytes in your file for a hash / checksum. Write this blank spacer, then the data, calculate the hash / checksum and overwrite the start. Verify during deserialization. Much more work.
