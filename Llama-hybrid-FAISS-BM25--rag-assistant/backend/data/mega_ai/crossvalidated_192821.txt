Can BIC be Used for Hypothesis Testing

Define the Bayesian information criterion as $$ \mathrm{BIC} = {-2 \cdot \ln{\hat L} + k \cdot (\ln(n) - \ln(2 \pi))} $$ (I do not drop the constant, $ - \ln(2 \pi)$, to avoid issues when equating to the marginal likelihood) Given data $Y$ and a model $H_i$, the approximate relationship between the marginal likelihood $P(Y|H_i)$ and $\mathrm{BIC}_i$ is $$-2 \cdot \ln P(Y|H_i) \approx \mathrm{BIC}_i$$ which seems to imply $$ P(Y|H_i) \approx \exp\bigg(\frac{\mathrm{BIC}_i}{-2}\bigg) $$ Given a null and alternative model, $H_0$ and $H_1$ respectively, the Bayesian hypothesis test for the probability of the alternative conditional on the data could be computed as $$ P(H_1|Y)=\frac{P(Y|H_1)}{P(Y|H_0)+P(Y|H_1)} $$ where the prior probability, $P(H_i)=1/2$ for $i=1,2$. My question is when, if ever, is it okay to approximate $$ P(H_1|Y) \approx \frac{\exp\bigg(\frac{\mathrm{BIC_1}}{-2}\bigg)}{\exp\bigg(\frac{\mathrm{BIC_0}}{-2}\bigg)+\exp\bigg(\frac{\mathrm{BIC_1}}{-2}\bigg)} $$ for Bayesian hypothesis testing. Despite the simplicity of the above equation I have rarely seen it used in practice which makes me doubt it's reliability as an approximation.
