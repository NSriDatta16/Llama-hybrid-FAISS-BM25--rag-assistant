This is how I buffer a float: static char* bufferFloat (int* bLen, float value) { *bLen = sizeof(float); char* buf = malloc (*bLen); int storage; memcpy (&storage, &value, sizeof (int)); uint32_t val = htonl (storage); memcpy (buf, &val, *bLen); return buf; } This is how I receive a float: static float readFloat (char* buf, int* bLen) { float ret; int temp; if (*bLen This is apart of some hobby networking code i wrote. I hope it helps and it seems to work perfectly for me. :D Actually, if you want that networking code go here: http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~robertm /myProjects.php and find the right project.
