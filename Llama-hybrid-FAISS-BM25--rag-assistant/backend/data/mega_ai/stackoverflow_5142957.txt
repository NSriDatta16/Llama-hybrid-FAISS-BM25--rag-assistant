Draggable popup with scrollbar issue in jQuery, Chrome

I have created a draggable popup using jQuery that has a scrollbar. When I click the scrollbar using Chrome, it moves with the mouse pointer and can not be released until I right click. For the draggable popup, I am using jQuery, e.g.: $("#id").draggable(); This works in other browsers.
