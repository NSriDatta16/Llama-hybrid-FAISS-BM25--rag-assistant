C# requiring operator overloading

I know that interfaces cannot contain operators , but is there a way I can require / tell the compiler that the + and / operators will be implemented by a certain class? I want to do something like this: public class AutoAverage where T:(overloads + and /) { private List history ; // 10-20 values public T NextAvg( T newValue ) { // implementation wants to push newValue // into history, then sum // values in history and return an average } }
