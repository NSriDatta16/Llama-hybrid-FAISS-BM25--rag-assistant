linq to sql , how to disable ChangeConflictException

i am using .net 4.0 , i hava a table agent , the agent has a field "accessed_date" which gets updated every 2 seconds , when he is logged in. i have a service operation "UpdateAgent" , and as the name suggest it updates the agent , i dont want this operation to throw ChangeConflictException , if only the field "accessed_date" is updated , since i know , thats its normal that it will get updated , how i disable ChangeConflictException to get fired on submitchanges . thanks Jamal.
