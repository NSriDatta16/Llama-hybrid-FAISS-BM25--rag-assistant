WPF DataGrid: Reordering Rows?

I am creating a WPF data grid, and I want to be able to reorder rows by dragging and dropping, like this: I click on a row and drag it up or down. As I do, a marker shows where the row will be dropped if I release the mouse. When I do release the mouse, the dragged row is inserted where indicated by the marker. Has anyone seen any articles or blog posts that show how to do this? I don't want to re-invent the wheel if I don't have to, and Google isn't turning up anything. Thanks.
