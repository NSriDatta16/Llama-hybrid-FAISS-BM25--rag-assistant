java web templates across multiple WAR files

I have a multi WAR web application that was designed badly. There is a single WAR that is responsible for handling some authorization against a database and defines a standard web page using a jsp taglib. The main WAR basically checks the privileges of the user and than based on that, displays links to the context path of the other deployed WARS. Each of the other deployed WARs includes this custom tag lib. I am working on redesigning this application, and one of the nice things that I want to retain is that we have other project teams that have developed these WAR modules that "plug into" our current system to take advantage of other things we have to offer. I am not entirely sure how to handle the page templates though. I need a templating system that would be easy enough to use across multiple wars (I was thinking of jsp fragments??). I really only need to define a consistent header and main navigation section. Whatever else is displayed on the page is up to the individual web project. Any suggestions? I hope that this is clear, if not I can elaborate more.
