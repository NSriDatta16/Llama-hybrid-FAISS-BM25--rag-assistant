C# - Is there any string representation of DateTime.Now()?

I need to parse the actual date value from a config file. So I need to know if there is any string representation of DateTime.Now()? So I can parse it via DateTime.Parse(..) ? Thanks EDIT Sorry I didn't explain my self pretty well. I reexplain my question. I have my config file that has the following section: Pay attention to what is specified in the Value attribute!
