Although product attributes are not directly translated, you may be able to use the multi-store capability of Magento to accomplish the same thing. If you set up your different languages as different store views, you can change the relevant product attributes to "Store View" level and assign different values for each store. That way, product names and descriptions can be entered in their localized form and displayed properly. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
