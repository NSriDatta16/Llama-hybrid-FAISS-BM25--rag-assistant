I don't know of any articles related to your question in the psychometric literature. It seems to me that ordered logistic models allowing for random effect components can handle this situation pretty well. I agree with @Srikant and think that a proportional odds model or an ordered probit model (depending on the link function you choose) might better reflect the intrinsic coding of Likert items, and their typical use as rating scales in opinion/attitude surveys or questionnaires. Other alternatives are: (1) use of adjacent instead of proportional or cumulative categories (where there is a connection with log-linear models); (2) use of item-response models like the partial-credit model or the rating-scale model (as was mentioned in my response on Likert scales analysis ). The latter case is comparable to a mixed-effects approach, with subjects treated as random effects, and is readily available in the SAS system (e.g., Fitting mixed-effects models for repeated ordinal outcomes with the NLMIXED procedure ) or R (see vol. 20 of the Journal of Statistical Software ). You might also be interested in the discussion provided by John Linacre about Optimizing Rating Scale Category Effectiveness . The following papers may also be useful: Wu, C-H (2007).
