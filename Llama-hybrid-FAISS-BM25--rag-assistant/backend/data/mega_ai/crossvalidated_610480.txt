From the plots the problems seem to boil down to two outliers (OK I get that these plots are from after Box-Cox transformation and before things may have looked worse), potentially leverage points. This may have a rather detrimental effect on the regression estimation, but can be handled well using robust regression. A state of the art method for this is the MM-estimator, as performed by R-function lmrob in package robustbase . Note that this will estimate a hopefully good regression for the non-outliers; the outliers, if important and correct, should be separately interpreted. Proviso: Obviously I don't see diagnostic plots from before transformation, but the outliers may affect the Box-Cox as well. Using robust regression with the same Box-Cox lambda is probably fine, but also another or no transformation may (or may not) work well with robust regression.
