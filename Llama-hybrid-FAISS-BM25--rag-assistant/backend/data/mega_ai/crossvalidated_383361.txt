What is multi-step time series forecasting?

Disclaimer: New to this field I am researching ways to forecast a given time-series. So, I understand what Univariate and Multivariate forecasting is. While going through different results, I came across multistep time-series forecasting ( link ) and ways to do that. My assumption: Whenever you forecast multiple times in a series, its called multi-step. Is this the definition or something much more detailed?
