icial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) benchmark developed by François Chollet in 2019, the model achieved an unofficial score of 87.5% on the semi-private test, surpassing the typical human score of 84%. The benchmark is supposed to be a necessary, but not sufficient test for AGI. Speaking of the benchmark, Chollet has said "You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible." Investment in AI Investment in AI grew exponentially after 2020, with venture capital funding for generative AI companies increasing dramatically. Total AI investments rose from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021, with generative AI accounting for approximately 30% of investments by 2023. According to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the United States outranked the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, number of startups, and AI patents granted. The commercial AI scene became dominated by American Big Tech companies, whose investments in this area surpassed those from U.S.-based venture capitalists. OpenAI's valuation reached $86 billion by early 2024, while NVIDIA's market capitalization surpassed $3.3 trillion by mid-2024, making it the world's largest company by market capitalization as the demand for AI-capable GPUs surged. Advent of AI for public use 15.ai, launched in March 2020 by an anonymous MIT researcher, was one of the earliest examples of generative AI gaining widespread public attention during the initial stages of the AI boom. The free web application demonstrated the ability to clone character voices using neural networks with minimal training data, requiring as little as 15 seconds of audio to reproduce a voice—a capability later corroborated by OpenAI in 2024. The service went viral on social media platforms in early 2021, allowing users to generate speech for characters from popular media franchises, and became particularly notable for its pioneering role in popularizing AI voice synthesis for creative content and memes.ChatGPT was launched on 30 November 2022, marking a pivotal moment in artificial intelligence's public adoption. Within days of its release it went viral, gaining over 100 million users in two months and becoming the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. The chatbot's ability to engage in human-like conversations, write code, and generate creative content captured public imagination and led to rapid adoption across various sectors including education, business, and research. ChatGPT's success prompted unprecedented responses from major technology companies—Google declared a "code red" and rapidly launched Gemini (formerly known as Google Bard), while Microsoft incorporated the technology into Bing Chat. The rapid adoption of these AI technologies sparked intense debate about their implications. Notable AI researchers and industry leaders voiced both optimism and concern about the accelerating pace of development. In March 2023, over 20,000 signatories, including computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, Elon Musk, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, signed an open letter calling for a pause in advanced AI development, citing "profound risks to society and humanity." However, other prominent researchers like Juergen Schmidhuber took a more optimistic view, emphasizing that the majority of AI research aims to make "human lives longer and healthier and easier." By mid-2024, however, the financial sector began to scrutinize AI companies more closely, particularly questioning their capacity to produce a return on investment commensurate with their massive valuations. Some prominent investors raised concerns about market expectations becoming disconnected from fundamental business realities. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO LLC, warned investors to "be quite careful" and drew parallels to previous technology-driven market bubbles. Similarly, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, explicitly compared the A
