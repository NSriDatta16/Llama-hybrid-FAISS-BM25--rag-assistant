Is random slopes a specific kind of multilevel model?

I want to predict a binary outcome $Y$ with two predictors, one is continuous ( $X$ ) and the other is categorical ( $G$ ) and has $n$ levels. I believe relationship between $Y$ and $X$ varies among the $n$ groups so I've built a logistic regression model $Y \sim X + G + X*G$ (which is called if I understand well a random slopes model). I've also heard about multilevel analysis but I'm not sure if it's different or not of my above model. Can someone help me to understand if there is a difference or not. Is the random slopes model just a specific kind of MLM?
