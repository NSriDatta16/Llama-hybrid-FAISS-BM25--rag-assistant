you can use System.Windows.Forms.Timer . you can drag it from your toolbox to the designer surface. Use the properties window to set the Interval Property to the time span you want(miliseconds), the Enabled property should be set to false. on the for load set the timer Enabled property to true. (The event handler in the sample are written using c# - sorry about that) private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { timer1.Enabled = true; } Double click the timer tick event to register to the event, and close the form on the timer tick private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e) { Close(); }
