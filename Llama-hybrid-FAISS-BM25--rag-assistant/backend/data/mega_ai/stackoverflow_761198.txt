Maybe the word you're looking for is "normalize". As in, move the array to a separate table, linked to the first by means of a key. This offers several advantages: The array size can grow almost indefinitely Efficient storage Ability to search for values in the array without having to use "like" Of course, the decision of whether to normalize this data depends on many factors that you haven't mentioned, like the number of elements, whether or not the number is fixed, whether the elements need to be searchable, etc.
