Thanks everybody. First, I clear the memory allocated for nets vector inside the Pop destructor by Pop::~Pop() { //nets.clear(); nets.~vector (); } The error message does not say much and I would appreciate if somebody shows me how to make MSVC 2008 to show a more detailed info. Here is what it says (I can't cut and paste it for some reason, so I am retyping it): Debug assertion failed! Programm: ... GANN.exe File: ... dbgedl.cpp line: 52 Expression: _BLOCK_TYPE_IS_VALID(pHead->nBlockUse) For information how ... When I press debug, the compiler shows me line 52 of file dbgdel.cpp: _ASSERTE(_BLOCK_TYPE_IS_VALID(pHead->nBlockUse)); inside void operator delete(void *pUserData) Here is a more of my code showing what happens before I try to sort double Pop::GA(...) { for (int gen=0;gen 0) istart=eliteSize; for(int i=istart;i Everything works properly up to the sort() point. The lSz pointer is used inside NN to hold the number of nodes in each layer of the neural network, for example lSz[3]={12,5,1} (12 inputs, one hidden layer with 5 neurons and one output). It is used to create a 3D array of the weights for each connection of the network. Each network NN (there are 100 of them) inside the Population has its own weight array. But they share the same lSz[] and other structural parameters, which unfortunately get copied from other NN instance to the other. I wanted to use static to declare these shared class members, but that would prevent parallelization.
