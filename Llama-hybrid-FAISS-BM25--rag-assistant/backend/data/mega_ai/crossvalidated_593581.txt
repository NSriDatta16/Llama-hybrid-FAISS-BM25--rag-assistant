One way, probably not the most sophisticated one but a way, would be to create one injury variable with 5 levels: "limb", "thoracic", "abdominal", "two of them", and "all of them". This way, each participant appears only once and interpretation is straightforward, though maybe not as nuanced as you need. Another way might be having three binary variables, one for each injury type, each coded for "yes" for injury present, "no" for injury not present. Then, you could predict the outcome with these 3 variables and their interactions (if you have enough data for testing interactions). If you are specifically interested in the role of thoracic injury, maybe a variable with three levels: "only thoracic injury", "thoracic injury plus other injury", "non-thoracic injury/injuries" would work best. Edited to add: these types of variables can then be used as predictors in a logistic regression.
