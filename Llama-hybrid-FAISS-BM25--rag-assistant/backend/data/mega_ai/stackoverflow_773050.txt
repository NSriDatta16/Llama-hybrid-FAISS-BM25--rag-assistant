A more elegant way might be: String value = "Testing"; String template = "text goes here %s more text"; String result = String.format(template, value); Or alternatively using MessageFormat: String template = "text goes here {0} more text"; String result = MessageFormat.format(template, value); Note, if you're doing this for logging, then you can avoid the cost of performing this when the log line would be below the threshold. For example with SLFJ : The following two lines will yield the exact same output. However, the second form will outperform the first form by a factor of at least 30, in case of a disabled logging statement. logger.debug("The new entry is "+entry+"."); logger.debug("The new entry is {}.", entry);
