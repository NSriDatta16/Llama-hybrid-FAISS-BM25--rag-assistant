Don't filter in CustomManager.get_query_set()! But what about all(), get(), filter(), exclude()?

django's manager docs has a paragraph overwritten with DO NOT FILTER AWAY ANY RESULTS IN THIS TYPE OF MANAGER SUBCLASS , but in the following text only mentions get_query_set() Is it save to filter in all(), get(), filter(), exclude()? The reason why I want to do that: I want for the automatic Manager as it gives my the power to control, what rows are send to a template-tag as described in b-list: Write better template tags Would this code be OK? class ArticleMananger(models.Manager): def get_query_set(self): return super(ArticleMananger, self).get_query_set() def all(self): return super(ArticleMananger, self).filter(published=True) def filter(self, **kwargs): return super(ArticleMananger, self).filter(published=True).filter(**kwargs) .... Edit: If someone votes down, it would be nice or just fair to explain why. What is wrong about this question?
