I've seen this problem when trying to use boost::threads. To support thread-local storage, boost::threads makes some Win32 API call that is incompatible with CLI applications. The problem gets triggered if you try to #include something from threads in CLI code. Solution is to either avoid using boost::threads entirely or restrict its use to .cpp files in native code.
