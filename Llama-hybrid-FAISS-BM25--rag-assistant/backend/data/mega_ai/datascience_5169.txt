From my perspective, for 5 million instances you need lots of trees to get a good generalization bound (a good model in the layman term). If this is not a problem then go for it,even the exact answer is relying on the nature of your problem. GBT is a good method especially if you have mixed feature types like categorical, numerical and such. In addition, compared to Neural Networks it has lower number of hyperparameters to be tuned. Therefore, it is faster to have a best setting model. One more thing is the alternative of parallel training. You can train multiple trees at the same time with a good CPU. If you are not satisfied with the results then go for Neural Nets since that means your model should be more extensive and should learn higher order information through your data. That is the due of NNs compared to other learning algorithms.
