GUI to add acrofields to existing pdf

I have a pdf created by some source which does not have any acrofields in it. I know that I can add acrofields programmatically provided I know the co-ordinates. But I would want to add the acrofields visually (drag-drop). Is there any opensource GUI tool available that allows me to edit a PDF and add acrofields ? Once I add the acrofields, I would be filling up the values programmatically. But right now all iam looking for is a GUI (opensource) that allows me to add acrofields.
