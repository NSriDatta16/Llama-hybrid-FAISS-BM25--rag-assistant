Restating my solution from a comment to Ganesh's version so I can format it: for (i=0; i Probability of winning after 1 iteration: 50% Probability of winning after 2 iterations: 75% Etc. Worst case, O(n) time O(1) space. Note that after N/4 iterations you've used up all the N/2 unique numbers, so this loop will never iterate through more than 3/4 of the array if it is as specified.
