CLR Stored Procedures: how to set the schema/owner?

I am working on a Linq based CLR Stored Procedure for some complex filtering and manipulation, which would otherwise require a lot of messy and poorly performant T-SQL code, if implemented in a more "traditional" Stored Procedure. This is working great, but I can't find how to set the schema of this Stored Procedure in phase of deployment, for a better organization and separation of the database objects in modules. Any ideas? Many thanks in advance.
