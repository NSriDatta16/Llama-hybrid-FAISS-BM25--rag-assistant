Desktop and Server Windows products have a very defined, generic, and pluggable structure into which you can insert hooks into the network layer. (Look up LSP or Layered Service Provider - this is how AntiVirus/Firewall programs plug themselves into monitoring your network traffic). As far as WinPCap, it plugs in one level lower at the NDIS driver level, but regardless, Windows Mobile just is not nearly as flexible when it comes to this. I don't necessarily think it's just Microsoft being short-sighted here, though - it takes much more power to provide a generic and pluggable LSP or NDIS layer that most mobile devices just can't afford. The most important point here - NDIS Packet Capturing is not supported for Windows Mobile . Closest you can get to a mobile platform with packet capture is Windows Embedded CE. So, in order to capture network traffic for Windows Mobile you would need to develop your own NDIS driver framework. Not a small task.
