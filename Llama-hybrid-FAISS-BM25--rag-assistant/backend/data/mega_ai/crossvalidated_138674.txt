Symmetry in moving average smoothing in "Forecasting: principles and practice"

In the textbook Forecasting: principles and practice by Hyndman and Athana­sopou­los, in the moving average smoothing section (Sec 6.2), the authors speak of even order moving average smoothing not being symmetric. What is the importance of symmetry in the sense that the text talks about? Why should it be desirable? Any help would be appreciated.
