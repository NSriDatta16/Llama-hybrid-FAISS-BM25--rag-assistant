How do you deploy a website to your webservers?

At my company we have a group of 8 web developers for our business web site (entirely written in PHP, but that shouldn't matter). Everyone in the group is working on different projects at the same time and whenever they're done with their task, they immediately deploy it (cause business is moving fast these days). Currently the development happens on one shared server with all developers working on the same code base (using RCS to "lock" files away from others). When deployment is due, the changed files are copied over to a "staging" server and then a sync script uploads the files to our main webserver from where it is distributed over to the other 9 servers. Quite happily, the web dev team asked us for help in order to improve the process (after us complaining for a while) and now our idea for setting up their dev environment is as follows: A dev server with virtual directories, so that everybody has their own codebase, SVN (or any other VCS) to keep track of changes a central server for testing holding the latest checked in code The question is now: How do we manage to deploy the changed files on to the server without accidentaly uploading bugs from other projects? My first idea was to simply export the latest revision from the repository, but that would not give full control over the files. How do you manage such a situation? What kind of deployment scripts do you have in action? (As a special challenge: the website has organically grown over the last 10 years, so the projects are not split up in small chunks, but files for one specific feature are spread all over the directory tree.)
