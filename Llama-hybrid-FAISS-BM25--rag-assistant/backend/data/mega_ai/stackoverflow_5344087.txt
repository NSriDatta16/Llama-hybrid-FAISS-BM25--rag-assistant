After seeing the image, I'm not sure where the "sagging" you're referring to is taking place. The image is rotated, but you can fix that using imrotate . The degree to which it needs to be rotated should be easy enough; just input the coordinates A and B and use the inverse tangent to find the angle offset from 0 degrees. Regarding the points, once it's aligned straight, all you need to do is specify a row in the image matrix (it would be a 1 x 3448 vector) and use find to get non-zero vector indexes. As the rotate function may have interpolated the pixels somewhat, you may get more than one index per "line", but they'll be identifiable as being consecutive numbers, and you can just average them to get an approximate value.
