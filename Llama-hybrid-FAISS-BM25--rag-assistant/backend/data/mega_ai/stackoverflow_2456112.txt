Launchd agent not starting

I'm attempting to write a launchd agent that runs a simple application for every user that logs in to the Mac OS X system. I have created a file named com.mycompany.myapp.plist and placed it in /Library/LaunchAgents . The contents of that file are: { LimitLoadToSessionType = "Aqua"; StartInterval = 10; OnDemand = NO; KeepAlive = YES; RunAtLoad = YES; Label = "com.mycompany.myapp"; Program = "/Users/thomi/myapp"; ProgramArguments = ( "/Users/thomi/myapp", "-l", "-d", ); } Initially I didn't have the StartInterval key set, since I thought the agent would start automatically. The problem is that the agent does not start unless I manually issue the following two commands: launchctl load -S Aqua -D all launchctl start com.mycompany.myapp Firther, when I run launchctl list com.mycompany.myapp I get the following output: { "Label" = "com.mycompany.myapp"; "LimitLoadToSessionType" = "System"; "OnDemand" = true; "LastExitStatus" = 0; "TimeOut" = 30; "Program" = "/Users/thomi/myapp"; ProgramArguments = ( "/Users/thomi/myapp", "-l", "-d", ); }; Notice that the LimitLoadToSessionType parameter has changed. Am I missing something here? Is there a different mechanism to start agents like this? Why has the LimitLoadToSessionType property changed?
