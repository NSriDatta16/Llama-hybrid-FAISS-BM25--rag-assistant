HTML5 is a development ground for new browser features. It is not now a usable standard in itself and won't be for a very long time. You get nothing for ‘authoring to HTML5’; the specification is unfinished and will change. Some of the features that have come out of the HTML5 effort are partially usable today: canvas, audio/video, postMessage, DOM Storage and so on. Many of these features are being broken out into their own specifications — thankfully, as the work-in-progress HTML5 spec itself is far too big and messy to cope with. Additionally, some of the features mentioned in the HTML5 spec are not new inventions, but old browser extensions that enjoyed some support already. eg. the pig-ugly but widespread contentEditable . There are even older “friends” like documented for the first time (more's the pity). When can I use... is a good overview of where we stand with several HTML5 and CSS3 features. There's also LIIP's HTML5 comparison (PDF).
