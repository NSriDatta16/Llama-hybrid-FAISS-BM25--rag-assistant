Maps are not like lists, which can be reversed by swapping head with tail. Objects in maps have a computed position, and using the value as key and the key as value would requiere to re-compute the storage place, essentialy building another map. There is no elegant way. There are, however, bidirectional maps. Those may suit your needs. I'd reconsider using third-party libraries.
