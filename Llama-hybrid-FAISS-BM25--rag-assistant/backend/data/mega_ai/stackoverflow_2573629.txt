extracting string occurrence in c

I have a string that look something like this: long_str = "returns between paragraphs 20102/34.23\" - 9203 1232 \"test\" \"basic HTML\""; Note: Quotes are part of the string. int match(char *long_str){ char * str; if ((str = strchr(long_str, '"')) != NULL) str++; // last " ? else return 1; return 0; } Using strstr I'm trying to get the whole substring between the last two quotes: "basic HTML" . I'm just not quite sure what would be a good and efficient way of getting that match. I'm open to any other ideas on how to approach this. Thanks
