Python has a wide range of ML libraries (check out mloss.org as well). However, I always have the feeling that it's more of use for ml researchers than for ml practitioners. Numpy/SciPy and matplotlib are excellent tools for scientific work with Python. If you are not afraid to hack in most of the math formulas yourself, you will not be disappointed. Also, it is very easy to use the GPU with cudamat or gnumpy - experiments that took days before are now completed in hours or even minutes. The latest kid on the block is probably Theano . It is a symbolic language for mathematical expressions that comes with opmitimzations, GPU implementations and the Ã¼ber-feature automatic differentiation which is nothing short of awesome for gradient based methods. Also, as far as I know the NLTK mentioned by JMS is basically the number one open source natural language library out there. Python is the right tool for machine learning.
