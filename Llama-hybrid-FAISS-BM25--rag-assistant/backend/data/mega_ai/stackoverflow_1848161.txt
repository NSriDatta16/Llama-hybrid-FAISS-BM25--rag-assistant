I had, what sounds like, a similar issue/question: Segfault on C++ Plugin Library with Duplicate Symbols If you can rebuild the 3rd party library, you could try adding the linker flag -Bsymbolic (the flag to gcc/g++ would be -Wl,-Bsymbolic ). That might solve your issue. It all depends on the organization of your code and stuff, as there are caveats to using it: http://www.technovelty.org/code/c/bsymbolic.html http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/performance-tools-for-software-developers-bsymbolic-can-cause-dangerous-side-effects/ If you can't rebuild it, according to the first caveat link: In fact, the only thing the -Bsymbolic flag does when building a shared library is add a flag in the dynamic section of the binary called DT_SYMBOLIC. So maybe there's a way to add the DT_SYMBOLIC flag to the dynamic section post-linking?
