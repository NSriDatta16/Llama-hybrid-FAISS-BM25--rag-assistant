Coldfusion development server is slower than production

We've built a development server to test our web applications before moving them to deployment. This is the configuration of the development server : Win Server 2k8 - 32bit - Web edition Coldfusion 9 Entreprise MySQL 5 IIS 6 This configuration is the replica of the production environment. Unfortunately, we are faced with slow execution times. Example: the execution time of an application, already launched on a production server, takes an average 45-60ms versus 500-600ms on development. And when we must restart the application, which happens quite often in development, we lose a lot of time... 6500-7000ms :( (vs 1200ms) I have tried the same application on my local server (my computer), and the response time is equivalent to the production server. This is the JVM config of the development server: -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -server -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false -XX:MaxPermSize=192m -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xbatch -Dcoldfusion.rootDir={application.home}/../ -Dcoldfusion.libPath={application.home}/../lib The source files are hosted on a NAS; we had to create a user on the NAS, exactly the same as the admin user of the server. And we had to configure Coldfusion and IIS application pools to run as the created user to address access rights. But I don't think this is the problem because I did some tests, putting the files on a disk local to server, and the execution time remains the same. I don't know where to look... ** The server monitor is shut down ** Someone would have any advice? Thanks.
