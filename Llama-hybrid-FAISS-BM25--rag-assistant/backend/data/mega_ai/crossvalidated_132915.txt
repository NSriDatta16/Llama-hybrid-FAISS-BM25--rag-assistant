Hypothesis testing, find $n$ to limit type II errors

I'm trying to solve the following (basic) problem, but I don't seem to get the last part 3). The average lifespan of a certain mechanical part is set to be at least 2 years by experts. The distribution is known to be normal with a deviation of 4 months. 9 parts are chosen at random and the average lifespan of these parts appears to be 2,2 years. Determine at 1% significance level if the experts are right. Calculate for this test the probability of a type II error if the average lifespan would be 2,25 year. How much parts should have been examined in the test above to have an probability of type II error of at most 1%. I have tried: 1) Using $H_0: \mu = 2$, $H_1: \mu > 2$ $$T = \frac{\overline X_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = 1,8 In conclusion: we do not reject $H_0$ 2) I'm firstly looking for $\overline X_n$ for which I would reject $H_0$. $$\text{rejecting }H_0 \Leftrightarrow \overline X_n \geqslant 2,325\cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 2,258$$ Then I'm calculating $$\begin{align} P(\overline X_n 3) But now I get stuck. It seems like: $$P\left(Z or $$P\left(Z >\frac{2,258-2,25}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right) > 99,99$$ but I don't see how I could calculate that? It seems like $\frac{2,258-2,25}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} Could anyone give me some pointers? What am I doing wrong? (The book's answer is 39)
