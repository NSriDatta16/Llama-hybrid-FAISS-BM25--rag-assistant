What distribution is the most appropriate?

I am given the following problem: A student S wants to take the tram to go home after his lectures are over. The tram line heâ€™s used to take leaves every 7.5 minutes on average at the university. Unfortunately, student S cannot remember the departure times. Thus, he always arrives randomly at the tram station every single weekday. I am then asked the question which distribution is the most appropriate one to model the daily waiting times of the student. The random variable $X$ reflects the daily waiting time. I thought about an uniform distribution with $a=0$ and $b=7.5$ since the student arrives randomly at the tram station and thus has equal probability for every waiting time between $0$ and $7.5$ . So far so good. What is confusing me though is the fact that the arrival of the tram is again a random variable (the tram only arrives every 7.5 min on average ). So I am not exactly sure how to model this as the upper bound $b$ of the uniform distribution would not always be exactly $7.5$ but rather a realisation of the underlying distribution. I hope someone can explain how I can model this accurately.
