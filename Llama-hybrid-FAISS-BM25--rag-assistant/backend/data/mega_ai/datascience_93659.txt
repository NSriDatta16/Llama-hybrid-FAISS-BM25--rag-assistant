Your network is too large for this much data. Reduce the number of units in the layers, go for simple 'relu' in the layers except the last one where you should use softmax. Consider reducing number of layers. I would recommend using decision trees libraries like XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM etc. for this problem. You will get the best result.
