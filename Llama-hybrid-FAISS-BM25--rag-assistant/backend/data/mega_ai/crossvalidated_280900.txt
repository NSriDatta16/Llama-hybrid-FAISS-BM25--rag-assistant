Model to forecast data

I would know what are the best predictive model to forecast consumption data with R or Python, I have got data from one month (each day and each 15 minutes) and i have to forecast data for tomorrow for each 15 minutes (00h00, 00h15,...,23h45). Thank You Edit : X1 : Names of region X2 : Date (01/01/2017,...,Today) X3 : Hour (00h00, 00h15, 00h30,...,23h45) X4 : Power consumption (5000, 6000,...,5500) X5 : Production of Power - 1 (400,200,...) X6 : Production of Power - 2 (10000,12000,...) X7 : Production of Power - 3 (400,200,...) X8 : Production of Power - 4 (100,200,...) X9 : Production of Power - 5 (0,2,...) X10 : Production of Power - 6 (4000,2000,...) X11 : Production of Power - 7 (0,-2000,-10,...) X12 : Difference between consumption and production (-8000,-8000,...) I have to predict X4, that's my TARGET, I heard about ARIMA, time series is it the best model in this case ?
