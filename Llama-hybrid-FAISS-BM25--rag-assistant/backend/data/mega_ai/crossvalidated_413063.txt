What do we call models that output probabilistic scores vs. models that output non-probabilistic scores?

In machine learning -- specifically in binary classification -- there are models that output a probability for each data-point fed to the model. For example, a logistic regression could take some patient's data as input and output the probability that he/she has cancer. There are also models that output scores (could be outside of $(0,1)$ range), such as support vector machines. These models could take the same input data but output a score (positive or negative) that doesn't have a direct probabilistic interpretation. I'm wondering how we should differentiate these types of models, specifically in name. For example, we can differentiate models as being either Instance-Based (K-Nearest Neighbours) or Model-Based (linear regression). Is there a similar naming convention for models that output probabilites vs. models that output scores ?
