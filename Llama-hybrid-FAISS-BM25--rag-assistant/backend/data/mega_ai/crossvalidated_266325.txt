From the paper that introduced GANs {1}: In the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary : a discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the data distribution. The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine articles. Two side notes: the term "network" is misleading as neither of the generative model nor the discriminative model have to be a neural network. (same issue with the term "memory networks": Where is the network in memory networks? ) Jurgen Schmidhuber claims to have performed similar work earlier in that direction. He called it predictability minimization. ( Were generative adversarial networks introduced by JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber? ) References: {1} Ian J.
