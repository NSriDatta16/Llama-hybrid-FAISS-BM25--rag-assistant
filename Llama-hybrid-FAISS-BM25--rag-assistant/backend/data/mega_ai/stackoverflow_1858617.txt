"Organize imports" in MonoDevelop

When developing for Java in Eclipse, I can hit Ctrl+Shift+O to "Organize Imports", to have the IDE figure out which libraries I'm likely trying to use, and import them automatically. Is there a similar feature in MonoDevelop for programming C#? EDIT : I'm new to C# and the whole Microsoft space. If there is no way to do this, how would one normally determine which library contained the class they were trying to use?
