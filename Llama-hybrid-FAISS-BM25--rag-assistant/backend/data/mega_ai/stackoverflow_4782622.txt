I was having the same problem and the Iconv approach wasn't working. Nokogiri::HTML is an alias to Nokogiri::HTML.parse(thing, url, encoding, options) . So, you just need to do: doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(link).read, nil, 'utf-8') and it'll convert the page encoding properly to utf-8. You'll see Rag√π instead of Rag\303\271 .
