FWIW Here are the stats I got from 1 month of logs in LogParser. 12331 hits to ScriptResource & WebResource / 183 errors Broken down by useragent info. Seems to support the IE8 only theory (plus "compatibility mode" user agents). cs-uri-stem MSIEVersion TridentVersion COUNT /WebResource.axd MSIE+8.0 Trident/4.0 100 /ScriptResource.axd MSIE+8.0 Trident/4.0 36 /WebResource.axd MSIE+7.0 Trident/4.0 44 /ScriptResource.axd MSIE+7.0 Trident/4.0 2 /ScriptResource.axd NOT IE NOT Trident 1 The single non-IE8 error has no querystring at all, coming from a Firefox/3.5.3 browser (got to be unrelated). I don't have any META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" in my pages. Although I DO have this to bounce out non-Javascript users.
