Hide files in USB from OS?

Is there a way to store data on a USB file in a way that the OS cannot read it with the standard methods? I was thinking maybe with an uncommon filesystem, but then I 'd probably have to implement the IO myself, which sounds like a huge work. Another idea would be to access the disk sectors in a low level way and store data in an incompatible way? But I do not know where to begin. For the record, I am using VB.NET. Thank you, John EDIT: Regarding the VALID security concerns you have raised: I agree, but please assume that, all I need to do for the scope of my project, is to simply hinder the average and slightly advanced user. NOT the expert. Thank you for raising the security issue, but it can be safely ignored on this particular case.
