You could do a random effects logistic regression model such as this one (for $Y_i$ = win state $i$): $$\log \text{E} Y_i = u_i + \beta x_i + \ldots,$$ where $\beta$ is a coefficient for the polling numbers for the state $x_i$, $u_i$ is a multivariate normally distributed random effect with a $50 \times 50$ unstructured covariance matrix and the $\ldots$ stands for other things you might want to have in the model. Extra effects in the model might be particularly important, if you were to look across elections - otherwise it's pretty hard to model the correlation (on the other hand, you would have to watch out for major changes througout time, e.g. changes of democratic support in the South before and after 1964, presumably slightly boosted support in the home states of each candidate etc.). Alternatively, you could actually try to get the correlation from the polling numbers, after all, one would assume those to be similarily correlated and doing some explicit modeling for them may help with issues of changing polls throughout the campaign. If you do this in a Bayesian way, you then get posterior samples and can then use these as input into the election model. I believe that is what some of the more serious prediction models do (e.g. the one of fivethirtyeight). Regarding the covariance matrix, you could use some simplifying structure, e.g. a-priori considering everything on certain regions such as "East Coast" equally correlated or as having some simple sub-structure or just have a "Region" effect. It depends a bit on what your software can handle and what you consider reasonable. I assume that e.g. Stan could handle a pretty large covariance matrix. Alternatively, I never looked at whether the guys at fivethirtyeight make the details of what they do public to the level of detail you are interested in, but from their top-level descriptions, I believe they are somehow doing something like that. If it's not public, they might be willing to tell you (or perhaps it's one of their business secrets, who knows).
