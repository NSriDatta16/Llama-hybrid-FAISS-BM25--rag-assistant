So, I finally found the problem and solved it. I was actually quite close: adb remount adb push app.apk /system/app/ This is the correct way to do it on the emulator (no adb sync needed). I watched the logcat, and found out that you need to sign your .apk file so the system does not reject it, even if that does not add any validity in this case. If you push a signed .apk this way, it will get the needed permissions and work as expected â€” in my case, turning the mobile data connection on and off. For the phone part (using ClockworkMod): Boot into recovery mode, mount the /system folder and enable USB storage. Then proceed in the same way as with the emulator, reboot the phone, and you are good to go. Hope this helps someone who encounters the same problem.
