I was wonder why you need from address filed in your email, because you had configured e-mail settings in your device. For Instance: I had configured my gmail account in my android device[abc@gmail.com], so if i send email using Intents to xyz@yahoo.com , the receiving user receives my mail with outlined my gmail id which i had configured in my device i.e., abc@gmail.com. Refer My Blog for any info regarding email using Intents , i had gave a detailed explanation http://sankarganesh-info-exchange.blogspot.com/p/sending-e-mails-in-android-using-intent.html Or still you need from address, you can send Email without using Intents Refer this article http://www.jondev.net/articles/Sending_Emails_without_User_Intervention_(no_Intents)_in_Android Here they are clearly explained abt sending emails without using Intents
