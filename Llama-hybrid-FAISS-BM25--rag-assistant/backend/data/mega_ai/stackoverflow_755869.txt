User Controls in Windows Forms - Anything similar to ASP.NET User Controls?

In ASP.NET you have something called "User Controls", which allow you to design a custom control which can be reused in the website. I am now starting developing a Windows application in .NET 2.0 and (surprisingly) I cannot find a similar functionality. What I would like to do is: - Create a new user control in the designer; - Drag & Drop a few controls on it (e.g. buttons, textboxes); - Save, and be able to resuse this user controls by dragging and dropping it on various dialogs. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Giammarco Schisani
