@ Peter Meyer , Jim Robert I tried different overflow values, to no avail. Experimenting with different values for the wrap attribute and the word-wrap style also wasn't fruitful. EDIT: @ dansays , seanb Due to some awkward application-specific constraints, the width can only be applied to the table. @ travis Setting style="word-break:break-all;" sort of worked! It still wraps differently in IE7 and FF. I'll accept this answer if nothing better comes up.
