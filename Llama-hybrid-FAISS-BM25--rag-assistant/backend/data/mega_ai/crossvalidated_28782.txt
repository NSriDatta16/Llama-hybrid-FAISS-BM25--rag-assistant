You might want to look at beta regression . It would be helpful to know what the response variable actually represents, but I would start with logistic regression (O.K. if the proportion represents the average of a large number of Bernoulli trials) and then try beta regression (which is a much more flexible solution, where the residuals are assumed to be from a beta distribution with parameters specified by the regression). Update: It seems that the data generating process for this problem means that it is not a straightforward regression problem, but instead it has three seperate modes of generating the response, one where it is zero, one where it is one and one where it can be any value in the range (0,1). The way to approach such problems is by using a compond likelihood. I have used this kind of approach for modelling rainfall, where there are lots of exact zeros for days where it doesn't rain at all. The solution is to have a model with three outputs, one which gives the probability that it will rain, and the other two giving the shape and scale parameters of a gamma distribution which represents the amount of rain that you would see if it did rain. The original paper on this was by Peter Williams, but I can't find it on line, so here is my paper, which should give you the basic idea. For this problem, you could try having a model with three outputs, one is the probability that the response is an exact zero, one that is the probability that it is an exact one and one that is a prediction of the response if it isn't an exact zero or an exact one. I doub't you will be able to get some off-the shelf code for this, but it is the approach I would take.
