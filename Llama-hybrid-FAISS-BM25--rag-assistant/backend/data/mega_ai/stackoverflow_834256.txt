Need RegEx to return first paragraph or first n words

I'm looking for a RegEx to return either the first [n] words in a paragraph or, if the paragraph contains less than [n] words, the complete paragraph is returned. For example, assuming I need, at most, the first 7 words: one two three four five, six seven eight nine ten. ignore I'd get: one two three four five, six seven And the same RegEx on a paragraph containing less than the requested number of words: one two three four five. ignore Would simply return: one two three four five. My attempt at the problem resulted in the following RegEx: ^(?:\ )((?:\w+\b.*?){1,7}).*(?:\ ) However, this returns just the first word - "one". It doesn't work. I think the .*? (after the \w+\b) is causing problems. Where am I going wrong? Can anyone present a RegEx that will work? FYI, I'm using .Net 3.5's RegEX engine (via C#) Many thanks
