There are two big features/advantages that Java/C# have over C++: Built-in garbage collection/managed memory. You don't have to worry about cleaning up your objects. Garbage collection is coming/available for C++ as well, but it's considerably less convenient to use. Java/C# make it like the air you breath. It hard to understate how much this can help your productivity and how much enjoyment this can add to your coding. The Well-organized built-in API/library. C++ probably has a much larger library available to it, if for no other reason than it's been around much longer and you can run it on my platforms, Java and C# are set apart by the amount of time, depth, and organization that went into the library that actually ships with the language. On the other hand, Java/C# depend on an external runtime. The lack of this dependency means that C/C++ are everywhere . You can use C++ to program for almost any random esoteric platform out there, no matter what the constraints.
