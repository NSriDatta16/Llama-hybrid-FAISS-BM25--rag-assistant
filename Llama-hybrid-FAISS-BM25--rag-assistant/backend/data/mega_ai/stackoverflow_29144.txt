What is the more efficient version control methodology: checkout or merge?

I've always used Subversion or CVS for version control, which use a 'merge' methodology. One of my friends raves about Perforce and how great it is with its change lists and check-out methodology. While I'm sure a lot of it comes down to experience & personal preference, I was wondering if any research had been done into which method of version control is more efficient to work in? EDIT: To clarify, I know both Perforce & SVN allow locking & merging, but SVN 'encourages' a liberal edit & merge method, whereas as I understand it, Perforce encourages a checkout-checkin method.
