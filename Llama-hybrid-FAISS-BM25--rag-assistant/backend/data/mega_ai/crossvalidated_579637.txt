As the author mentioned, the main advantage of the multiscale architecture is the dimensionality reduction. As this is a normalizing flow that requires invertibility, you cannot use traditional operators such as maxpooling, conv2d (bigger than 1Ã—1 filter) etc. to reduce dimensionality. The multiscale architecture helps reduce the dimension while using dimension preserving operators. You can see more on that in CVPR 21's half-day tutorial Normalizing Flows and Invertible Neural Networks in Computer Vision ,
