How do I use continuous integration with an Eclipse project?

I've been using maven2 and hudson for a while to do my continuous integration, but I find that Eclipse and Maven do not play well together. Sure there's a plugin, but it's cranky to mash the maven project into something that eclipse likes and the build times and unit test are too long. I'm considering switching back to a pure eclipse project with no ant and no maven involved. With the infinitest plugin and possible the JavaRebel agent, it would give me a very fast build-deploy-test cycle. However I'd still like to have automatic and testing as well, so: How do I use continuous integration with an Eclipse project? Is there a command line way to do it? Is there a build server that already supports it natively?
