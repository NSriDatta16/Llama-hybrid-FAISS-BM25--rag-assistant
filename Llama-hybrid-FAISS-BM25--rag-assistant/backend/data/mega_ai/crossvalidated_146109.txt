The following statement is very useful. Suppose $\{Z_j, j\in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a time series. Then if $\sup_jE|Z_j| $MA(\infty)$ process is invertible if there exists such a set of coefficients $\alpha_j$, such that $$\sum_{j=0}^\infty \alpha_j X_{t-j}=Z_t,$$ and $$\sum_{j=0}|\alpha_j| If we employ the backwards operator $B$ ($BX_t=X_{t-1}$), the requirement translates to $$\alpha(B)\theta(B)=1,$$ where $\alpha(B)=\sum_{j=0}^\infty\alpha_jB^j$ and $\theta(B)=\sum_{j=0}^\infty \phi_jB^j$. (Here I used the notation from the question). Now we can employ the trick where we exchange $B$ with $z\in \mathbb{C}$. We can do that because of the definition of multiplication of power series. This change however gives us another way of looking at the problem. The power series $\theta(z)=\sum_{j=0}\theta_jz^j$ is Laurent series with no negative powers of $z$ and $\sum_{j=0}|\theta_j| Having established that $\theta(z)$ is analytic we can turn our attention to $\alpha(z)$. We have that $$\alpha(z)=\frac{1}{\theta(z)}.$$ So $\alpha(z)$ is analytic whenever $\theta(z)\neq 0$, so it is analytic in a neighborhood of a disc $|z|\le 1$. However we need that $\sum_{j=0}^\infty|\alpha_j| 1$. This can only happen if $\theta(z)\neq 0$ for $|z|\le 1$.
