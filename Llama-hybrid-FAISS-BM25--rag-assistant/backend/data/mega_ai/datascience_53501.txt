Now that I can predict P1 based on A1 and T1, how do I use this knowledge to actually assign ALL the tasks - T1...Tn amongst all the agents A1...Am as to maximise the performance: sum(P1, P2, ..., Pi)? In general Genetic algorithms can deal with this kind of optimization problems. The tricky part is to define the population with this particular assignment problem. Assuming a given set of tasks T1...Tn to achieve, an "individual" in the population would probably be an assignment A1...An, that is a possible assignment of the tasks to a (subset of) the agents. Thus the tasks play the role of the "genes": a mutation consists in replacing an agent with another for a particular task/gene a crossover consists in randomly combining the pairs (task,agent) from two assignments/individuals The rest is straightforward genetic learning: the fitness function of an assignment/individual is the sum of the performances for this assignment at each generation the best assignments/individuals are selected to generate the next generation by cross-over After a few generations the population will converge to a set of optimal assignments. Mind that it might end up in a local optimum, you can tune the hyper-parameters to minimize this risk.
