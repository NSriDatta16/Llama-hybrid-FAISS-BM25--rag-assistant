Just to add to the correct answers from the others. Your assumptions about initialization of static variables are not correct. Variables with static storage are always initialized. Either explicitly if you provide an initializer or implicitly from 0 . The initializer for such a variable must always be a compile time constant expression. So the value is computed at compile time and written directly into the object. (Well if it is all zero, some systems have tricks / special sections that avoid an explicit storage of the variable in the object file.) So, no, there will be no initializer statement run when the variable is accessed the first time (how would the system know, by the value of another static variable?) but whenever you start the program the variable is already initialized.
