Interpreting results of multinominal logistic regression

I have run a multinominal logistic model with my dependent categorical variable, WINNING_PARTY , taking the following values: gov, corp, org, indiv, univ, or in part. I am using two independent variables called APPELLANT_PARTY and RESPONDENT_PARTY which have the same possible values: gov, corp, org, indiv, and univ. The screenshot below shows the output of the STATA command mlogit winning_party appellant_party respondent_party Given that the independent variables are categorical, not binary, I am unsure how to interpret the affect of the value of APPELLANT_PARTY and RESPONDENT_PARTY on the WINNING_PARTY .
