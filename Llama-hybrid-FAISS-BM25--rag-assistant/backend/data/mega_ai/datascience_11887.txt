Is there are any literature enumerating the characteristics of algorithms which allow them to be explainable? The only literature I am aware of is the recent paper by Ribero, Singh and Guestrin. They first define explainability of a single prediction: By “explaining a prediction”, we mean presenting textual or visual artifacts that provide qualitative understanding of the relationship between the instance’s components (e.g. words in text, patches in an image) and the model’s prediction. The authors further elaborate on what this means for more concrete examples, and then use this notion to define the explainability of a model. Their objective is to try and so-to-speak add explainability artificially to otherwise intransparent models, rather than comparing the explainability of existing methods. The paper may be helpful anyway, as tries to introduce a more precise terminology around the notion of "explainability". Are there machine learning models commonly accepted as representing a good tradeoff between the two? I agree with @Winter that elastic-net for (not only logistic) regression may be seen as an example for a good compromise between prediction accuracy and explainability. For a different kind of application domain (time series), another class of methods also provides a good compromise: Bayesian Structural Time Series Modelling. It inherits explainability from classical structural time series modelling, and some flexibility from the Bayesian approach. Similar to logistic regression, the explainability is helped by regression equations used for the modelling. See this paper for a nice application in marketing and further references. Related to the Bayesian context just mentioned, you may also want to look at probabilistic graphical models. Their explainability doesn't rely on regression equations, but on graphical ways of modelling; see "Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques" by Koller and Friedman for a great overview. I'm not sure whether we can refer to the Bayesian methods above as a "generally accepted good trade-off" though. They may not be sufficiently well-known for that, especially compared to the elastic net example.
