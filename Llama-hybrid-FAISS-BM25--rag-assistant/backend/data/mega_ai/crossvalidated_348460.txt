ARIMA doesn't include the trend

I have a problem with my ARIMA(1,1,1) predictions. I have a time series with no seasonal component but with an obvious trend. To get rid of it I take the first difference by setting d=1. The model predicts fluctuations pretty good, but absolutely ignores the trend :( I used Python and did model.fit(trend='c'), but that was no help. Below you can find true and predicted values, ACF and PACF, STL decomposition (after taking the first difference) and model summary. Any advice is welcome!
