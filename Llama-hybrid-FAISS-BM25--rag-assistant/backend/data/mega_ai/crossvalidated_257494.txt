Is it still worth going into machine learning/AI?

I am a high school senior about to start my undergraduate education. I've done an internship for the past two years working with constitutional neural networks and RNNs. I love doing research, and I know that's what I want to do in the future, and given my interest and proficiency in the field I had assumed that I would research AI. Recently, though, I've begun to rethink this. There has been more and more research coming out that points to the automation of AI research (for example, these three papers ). Speaking about the third paper, Nando de Freitas joked in his recent talk , "If you're designing gradient descent algorithms for MNIST, you're out of a job." We are not at the end of machine learning research, but will we be in another 10, 20, 30 years? Will we reach a point in the next few decades where there is no more major AI research to be done by humans? Starting college, I want to go into a field with a rich future and great potential for innovation. Will deep learning still be that in 10 years when I'm looking for a job?
