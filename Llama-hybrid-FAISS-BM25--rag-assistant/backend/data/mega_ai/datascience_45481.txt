Artificial intelligence is just the big set of what can be fully automated. A simple calculator is a form of AI. Everything that makes a human tas automatic is AI. Different is for machine learning which is a subset of AI and it is always mislead with it. ML focuses on those statistical techniques that allow us to automatically make predictions on something. Data science makes use of the techniques offered by AI to process and extract info from raw data which is meaningless as it is. Hope I've been clear.
