It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the correct covariance structure in advance of fitting the model. Personally I would try unstructured and AR(1) first. The issue with an unstructured covariance matrix is that the software is required to estimate many parameters: $\frac{t(t+1)}{2}$ where $t$ is the number of time points, so this can obviously become quite large where there are many time points and can lead to problems with model convergence. On the other hand, CS and AR(1) both estimate just 2 parameters. So, practically speaking US might not really be an option. If that is the case then I would use AR(1) since we know that CS is likely not appropriate. As for comparing models, I would tend to use AIC or BIC depending on the purpose of the model. As per Chakrabarti & Ghosh (2011) : The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is more useful in selecting a correct model while the AIC is more appropriate in finding the best model for predicting future observations. So let's take a look at an example. Here we use the results of an RCT that consists of a completely randomised experimental design with data collected at 7 equally spaced points in time, with two factors, Program and Time . The response variable is strength and the repeated measures are within the Subj factor. The data are available in the SASmixed R package (it's called "Weights" there. We fit 3 models, one with compound symmetry, one with AR(1) and one with an unstructured covariance matrix: m0_cs These converged normally and from them we obtain: # AIC BIC logLik deviance # # CS 1424.8 1428.9 -710.4 1420.8 # AR(1) 1270.8 1274.9 -633.4 1266.8 # US 1290.9 1348.1 -617.4 1234.9 So, we see that the AR(1) model would be selected by both AIC and BIC, so that makes life easy for us. Let's also take a look at the covariance matrices that are estimated.
