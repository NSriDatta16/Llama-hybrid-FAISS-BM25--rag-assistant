The image size does not really matter but I took the habit of putting the pictures directly into the bundle instead of counting on Xcode to do the job. Try opening the settings.bundle using the "Show Package Content" finder command, drag your pictures in there and try again. Don't forget to "clean all target" after modifying the bundle. The solution works for both iPad & iPhone
