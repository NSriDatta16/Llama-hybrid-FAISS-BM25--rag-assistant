analysis of core file

I'm using Linux redhat 3, can someone explain how is that possible that i am able to analyze with gdb , a core dump generated in Linux redhat 5 ? not that i complaint :) but i need to be sure this will always work... ? EDIT: the shared libraries are the same version, so no worries about that, they are placed in a shaerd storage so it can be accessed from both linux 5 and linux 3. thanks.
