Feature scaling in svm: Does it depend on the Kernel?

It is often recommended to do feature scaling (e.g. by normalization) when using a Support Vector Machine. For example here: When using SVMs, why do I need to scale the features? or also on wikipedia: Application. In stochastic gradient descent, feature scaling can sometimes improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. In support vector machines, it can reduce the time to find support vectors. Note that feature scaling changes the SVM result. Does this depend on the kernel? Do you recommend feature scaling on some kernels and on others not? What about: Linear Kernel Polynomial Kernel Gaussian Kernel RBF Kernel and other Kernels?
