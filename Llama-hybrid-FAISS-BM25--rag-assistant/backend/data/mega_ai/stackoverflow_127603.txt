How do I enable applets on Mac Firefox 3.0.1?

I have Java 1.5.0 installed on a Mac OS machine. I have the Java Embedding Plugin 0.9.6.4 installed and java enabled on the preferences panel. When I go to http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml the applet appears blank. Does anyone has an idea of what is happening?
