The way to send a meeting request to Outlook (and have it recognized) goes like this: prepare an iCalendar file, be sure to set these additional properties, as Outlook needs them: UID SEQUENCE CREATED LAST-MODIFIED DTSTAMP prepare a multipart/alternative mail: Part 1: text/html (or whatever you like) - this is displayed to "ordinary" mail readers or as a fall-back and contains a summary of the event in human readable form Part 2: text/calendar; method=REQUEST , holds the contents of the ics file (the header method parameter must match the method in the ics). Watch out for the correct text encoding, declaring a charset header parameter won't hurt. Part 3: Optionally, attach the .ics file itself, so ordinary mail readers can offer the user something to click on. Outlook does not really require the attachment because it just reads the text/calendar part. Send the mail to an outlook user. If you got everything right the mail shows up as a meeting request, complete with attendance buttons and automatic entry in the users calendar upon accept. Set up something that processes the responses (they go to the meeting organizer). I have not yet been able to get automatic attendee tracking to work with an Exchange mailbox because the event won't exist in the organizers calendar. Outlook needs the UIDs and SEQUENCES to match it's expectations, but with a UID you made up this will hardly work. For help on the details and peculiarities of the ics file format, be sure to visit the iCalendar Specification Excerpts by Masahide Kanzaki . They are a light in the dark, much better than gnawing your way through RFC 2445 . But then again, maybe a handy library exists for .NET.
