User controls are compiled with the project and it must be written in the same language as the project. Custom controls can be dropped on the canvas and configured by setting properties without the programmer knowing all the internals (can be good or bad). Also since the custom control is precompiled in the dll, it does not need to be written in the same language as the project. If attention is paid to detail, the Custom control can be written to display in the designer (although this may not be worth the trouble).
