How to call an object's method from within a different class in Ruby?

Sorry about the wording of the question, I don't really know how to put it. What I mean is, how could I do this: class Test def doSomething puts "I'm working" end end class numberTwo def doSomethingElse subject.doSomething puts "Doing other things" end end subject = Test.new otherObject = numberTwo.new otherObject.doSomethingElse What I want is when otherObject.doSomethingElse is called, subject.doSomething to also be called. I'm not sure how you can do this, or if it is possible. Thanks in advance.
