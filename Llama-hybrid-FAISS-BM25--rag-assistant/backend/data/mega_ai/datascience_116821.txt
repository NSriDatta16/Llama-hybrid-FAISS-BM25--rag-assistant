Azure Devops for Data Science

My team (7 people) is switching to git using Azure Devops. Iâ€™m a bit confused on how to set it up for a data science team. I used it for personal projects which is straight forward, do dev in one branch then merge to main through pull request. But when in a team setting, do we create multiple Projects (ADO term) and multiple repo, and set up dev/ stage/ main in each? Or put everyone in 1 Project and 1 repo, keep individual projects in folders, and set up one main, one stage, and dev branches related to individual projects before pulling?
