Notice the warning message at the top of the model summary: ALL 14 residuals are 0 . This suggests the model was fit using only 14 observations. You're estimating 20 parameters using only 14 independent pieces of information. I am doing a multiple regression analysis and I wanted to inspect the time effect by using factor(Year) in R. You don't explicitly use factor(year) in your model formula, though R recognizes your measure of time (i.e., dfY ) as 'categorical' by including dummy variables for each category, appending the labels to the variable name accordingly. Be careful in the future as R may 'dummy out' a measure with many levels, which may be more variables than you can afford. Do you have any suggestions why I get NA values? Again, you have too few $n$ observations to estimate all $p$ predictor variables. As a minimum, you require at least $n$ observations to estimate $p$ predictors. Your instinct based upon the warning message was to inspect the linear association between two or more of your input variables, but this is not your problem. You simply have more predictors than observations! Considerations : I see you tagged "fixed effects model" in your question. It suggests you may have wanted to fit a panel model. If this is the case, something is wrong. Do you observe multiple entities (e.g., individuals, firms, counties, etc.) over time? If so, your data frame is not in the proper format. It should be organized in long format, with each unit observed over the 13-year time period. This brings me to my next point. You indicated in the comments that the time variation spans from 2005 to 2019. If this was so, then your output would have displayed a coefficient for 2006 as well; R will estimate the time effects in their level order, thus dropping the more recent years. I'm sure this was a minor oversight, but make sure your factor levels are ordered properly as well. If the model really only has 14 observations, then you must model year (i.e., dfY ) in a different way. Estimating year fixed effects chews up way too many degrees of freedom. A similar answer to this question recommends at least $50p$ observations to reliably identify effects with reasonable power, while others have suggested roughly 10â€“20 observations per parameter (see here for more information).
