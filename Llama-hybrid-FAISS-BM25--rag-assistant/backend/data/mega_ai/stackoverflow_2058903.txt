Software metrics have been with us for a long time and as best I can tell nothing to date has emerged individually or in aggregate that is capable of guiding projects during development. The nut of the problem is that we want to use objective measures and these can only measure what has happened, not what is happening or about to happen. By the time we have measured, analyzed and interpreted some series of metrics we are reacting to things that have already gone wrong, or very occasionally, gone right. I don't want to underplay the importance of learning from objective metrics but I do want to point out that this is a reactive not a pro-active response. Developing a "confidence index" may be a better way of monitoring whether project is on-track or headed for trouble. Try developing a voting system where a reasonable number of representatives from each project area of interest are asked to anonymously vote their confidence from time to. Confidence is voted in two areas: 1) Things are on-track 2) Things will continue to be on-track or get back on-track. These are purely subjective measurements from people closest to the "action". Feed the results into a Kanban type chart where the columns represent voting areas and you should have a pretty good idea where to focus your attention. Use question 1 to evaluate whether management reacted to the previous voting cycle appropriately. Use question 2 to identify where management should focus next. This idea is based on each of us having a comfort level within our own area of responsibility. Our confidence level is a product of experience, knowledge within our domain of expertise, the number and severity of problems we are facing, the amount of time we have to accomplish our tasks, the quality of the information we are working with and a whole bunch of other factors. MBWA (Management By Walking Around) is often touted as one of the most effective tools we have - this is a variation of it. This technique is not much use at the level of individual teams because it only reflects the general mood of the team. Kind of like using someoneâ€™s watch to tell them the time. However, at higher levels of management it should be quite informative.
