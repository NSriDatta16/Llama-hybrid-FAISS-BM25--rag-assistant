Jumping ImageView when dragging in Android

Ok. So I'm doing something very similar to what the person at Strange jumping values for onTouchListener using a RelativeLayout in Android is doing. Unfortunately I'm having the same problem as that person. They supposedly solved the problem but didn't really post a solution. Does anyone by chance know how to fix this problem?
