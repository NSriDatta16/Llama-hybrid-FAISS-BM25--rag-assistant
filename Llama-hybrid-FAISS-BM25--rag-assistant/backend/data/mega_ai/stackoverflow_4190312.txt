I can recommend where not to start. I bought An Introduction to Neural Networks by Kevin Gurney which has good reviews on Amazon and claims to be a "highly accessible introduction to one of the most important topics in cognitive and computer science". Personally, I would not recommend this book as a start. I can comprehend only about 10% of it, but maybe it's just me (English is not my native language). I'm going to look into other options from this thread.
