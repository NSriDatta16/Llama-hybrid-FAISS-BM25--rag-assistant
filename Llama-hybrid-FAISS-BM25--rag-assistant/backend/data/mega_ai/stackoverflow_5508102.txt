jQuery traverse inside p

So I'm having a problem with some jQuery. Basically, I need to create a function that will split a paragraph, when it becomes too large for a container. Half of it will remain in the current container, and the rest will drop down to the next. Basically I want to go line by line through the text, testing the height of it and all lines above it. Is there a way to traverse through lines of a paragraph? Also, on resize I will have this bound to a listener so that when the width changes, the content still remains the same height in each element. I hope that all made sense!
