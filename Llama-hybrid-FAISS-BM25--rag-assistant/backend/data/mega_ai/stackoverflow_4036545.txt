I suggest deriving from UITextView to create a custom view that handles taps. You'll want to override the following methods, probably: touchesBegan:withEvent touchesMoved:withEvent touchesEnded:withEvent touchesCancelled:withEvent Make sure the userInteractionEnabled property has a default value of YES. Override hitTest:withEvent and pointInside:withEvent to figure out where in your view the user tapped. Be sure and read the Responding to Events section in the View Programming Guide for iOS, and also see the Event Handling Guide for iOS for more details. Anyway, once you figure out where the user touched, you can modify the text or reposition the karat as appropriate.
