The estimand of interest of interest is the Complier Average Causal Effect (Angrist, Imbens, Rubin 1994), also known as the Local Average Treatment Effect or LATE. Its interpretation is the average treatment effect (ATE) among the subset of subjects who comply with treatment assignment. In a situation of one-sided non-compliance this will be the same as the ATT. It is not guaranteed to be the same in a situation of two sided non-compliance. Compliers are the subjects who would take treatment (in your case click through when exposed to the prompt) when in the treatment group and would the control treatment when assigned to control. They "comply" with their treatment assignment, and if you did a different version of your experiment the complier population might be different. This population may or may not be theoretically meaningful depending on the question of interest. A note. Assuming that the estimated number of compliers is not zero the CACE is defined as the ITT/# of compliers. Estimation of this quantity will be biased but consistent, and the bias will be negligible in sufficiently large samples. Mechanically, the absolute value of the CACE will always be at least as big as the ITT, and in any situation of partial compliance will always be strictly larger in absolute terms.
