According to Wikipedia 's page on dynamic method dispatch: Smalltalk Implementation Smalltalk uses a type based message dispatcher. Each instance has a single type whose definition contains the methods. When an instance receives a message, the dispatcher looks up the corresponding method in the message-to-method map for the type and then invokes the method. [...] Many other dynamically typed languages, including Python , Ruby, Objective-C and Groovy use similar approaches. Emphasis added, and one paragraph snipped. So, at least that part seems to be similar between the two languages.
