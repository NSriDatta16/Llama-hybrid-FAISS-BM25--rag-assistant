"display:none" content copied to clipboard, visible when pasted

I'm having a problem with non-displayed HTML elements being copied to the clipboard, and then displayed when the content is pasted into MS Word, Outlook, etc. For example: Hello I'm Hidden World If I view that HTML in a browser, copy the text to my clipboard, then paste into Outlook, the middle paragraph remains hidden. Good news. However, in this example: Hello World If I do the same - copy to clipboard, paste into Outlook - the text input is visible. Is there any way I can supress this? (Without resorting to telling users to select "Keep text only" in Outlook.) Thanks!
