The covariance matrix of $B$ is decomposed as: $$ \frac{1}{n-1} B^T B = V_B L_B V^T_B $$ If we rewrite the covariance matrix of $B$ in terms of $A$ and $Q$ we have: $$ \frac{1}{n-1} B^T B = \frac{1}{n-1} (AQ)^T AQ = \frac{1}{n-1} Q^T A^T A Q = Q^T (\frac{1}{n-1} A^T A) Q = Q^T V_A L_A V^T_A Q $$ We observe that the covariance matrices of $A$ and $B$ are generally different: $$ V_A L_A V^T_A \neq Q^T V_A L_A V^T_A Q $$ We identify (wasn't sure about this step at first): $$ V_B = Q^T V_A $$ $$ L_B = L_A $$ $$ V^T_B = (Q^T V_A)^T = V^T_A Q $$ And now we have: $$ B V_B = A Q Q^T V_A = A V_A $$ Which means that the datasets are identical upon "transforming" them with PCA.
