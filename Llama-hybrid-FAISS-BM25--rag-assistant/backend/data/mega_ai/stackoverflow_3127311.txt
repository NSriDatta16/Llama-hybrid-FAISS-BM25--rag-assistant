As pointed out already, you should probably look into modules or dynamically create classes. However, you can use evil-ruby to change the superclass. There even is a fork for Ruby 1.9 available. This does only work for MRI. Should be easy to build on Rubinius (clearing methods caches would be the main issue), no clue about JRuby. Here is the code: require 'evil' class Agent def self.hook_up(calling_class, desired_parent_class) calling_class.superclass = desired_parent_class end end class Parent def bar puts "bar" end end class Child def foo puts "foo" end Agent.hook_up(self, Parent) end Child.new.bar
