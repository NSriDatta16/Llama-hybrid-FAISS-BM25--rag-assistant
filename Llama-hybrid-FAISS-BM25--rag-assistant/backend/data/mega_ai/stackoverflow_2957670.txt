If you don't want to fix your broken design, why doesn't keeping a running list of active touches solve your problem? NSMutableSet *touches; In touchesBegan you add them, in touchesEnded and touchesCancelled you remove them... You might use a "global" object (i.e. singleton) to track those and synchronize data access. I cannot see how querying this set would be different than asking UIKit directly for this information. If you need information on touches on standard UIKit objects (i.e. UIButton), you probably need to subclass those - and I am not sure if you can get the desired effect with all classes (as they - or their subviews - could handle touches in any way they want).
