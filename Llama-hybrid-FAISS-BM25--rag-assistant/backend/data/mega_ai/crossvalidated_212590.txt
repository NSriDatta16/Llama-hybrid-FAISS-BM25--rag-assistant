One possible approach is PU learning , where PU means Positive-Undefined. You search for texts which contains words like "wrench" and "screwdriver", manually check which of them are indeed about tools, and now you have some texts which are about tools (Positive set) and a lot of unlabeled texts (Undefined set). The problem of building a classifier in such circumstances is called PU learning. Another possible approach is called Interactive Machine Learning. I am not sure if it is appliable here, but it is worth checking.
