Even though extending the study in this way is safe if strict masking procedures are in place (i.e., the person doing this does not have access to treatment-stratified study outcomes), it may raise a suspicion from a reviewer, especially if using a traditional frequentist approach. It's much safer to use blocked randomization to make sure than any imbalance is inconsequential. For example, randomly choose 4-participant or 6-participants at random and generate the randomization so that each block (whether 4 or 6) is balanced on allocations. With Bayesian approaches you don't even need to do a sample size calculation except for the budget manager.
