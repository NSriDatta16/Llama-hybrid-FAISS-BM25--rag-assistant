Depth of a Convolutional Neural Network

I have a small confusion. When someone says that a convolutional neural network is 48 layers deep,does it mean that the CNN has 48 convolution layers(as in layers that perform convolution only) or 48 layers(which includes layers that perform pooling,ReLU,convolution,fully connected layer etc.)? Kindly help.
