R forecast from STL

I want to understand how forecast from STL function in R works. So, I am not giving any reproducible code here. Below is the procedure that I worked on time series I used STL decomposition on my time series. Checked residuals component from step 1 for white noise using Box.test Found that residuals are not white-noise. So, used ARIMA model to fit a forecasting model. Now, my task is to compute forecast values that consist of a. Seasonal and Trend component from step 1 above b. Residuals component from ARIMA model - from step 3 above. If I use forecast(stl(..)), it gives me Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 However, I am interested in only seasonal and trend parts of forecast. How can I get seasonal trend components? What components does constitute forecast(stl(..))
