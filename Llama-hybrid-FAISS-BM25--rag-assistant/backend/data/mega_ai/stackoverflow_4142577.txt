Mouse Cursor position changes

Hi I have a windows form application which i want to move my mouse then dragdrop will function but i have tried using mousemove mouse event to do it , but seems like dragdrop is very sensitive.So what i'm asking is whether is it possible to detect if the mouse cursor moves at least a certain distance away from the current cursor then it does the dragdrop code.
