Even if you don't end up using one: The way they structure their projects usually comes from tons and tons of experience. I personally like the Zend Framework way of structuring, and its Autoloader, best. But there are several options and philosophies out there. Framework questions: What PHP Framework to choose Best PHP framework for an experienced PHP developer? More Framework questions....
