frequency distribution of data

Let's say I have around 30k points of time series data with values ranging from 0 to 0.5. I have split this data into 5 buckets of 0.1 each which contains values within that range. I then plot these values with x axis being the bucket sizes and y axis being the number of values. I noticed that the distribution pattern depends on the size of the buckets. How do I know for sure what type of distribution my data follows? My knowledge in statistics is not very good and maybe evident from my question. Any help appreciated!
