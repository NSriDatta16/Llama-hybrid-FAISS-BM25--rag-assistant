Improving roc auc score when accuracy is good

I have got a binary classification problem with large dataset of dimensions (1155918, 55) Also dataset is fairly balanced of 67% Class 0 , 33% Class 1. I am getting test accuracy of 73% in test set and auc score is 50 % Recall is 0.02 for Class 1 I am using a logistic regression and also tried pycaret's classification algorithm
