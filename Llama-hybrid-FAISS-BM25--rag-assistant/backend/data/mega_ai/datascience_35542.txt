Are CNNs reliable when dealing with distance between two objects in the image?

I am building a CNN application in which the output is a continuous value(regression). And this value is very much related to the distance between two specific objects in the input image. Detecting those specific objects should not be an issue. But carrying the distance information in fairly accurate manner into the network is doubting me. These are the key points according to me: I did read CNNs are translation invariant. That is to some extent kernels do not carry positional information of the features. One approach would be to have a very large size kernel which can fit both the objects inside together. This seems to have two issues. One is of course large kernels. Another is, it might need kernels for every possible separation value between two objects. Hence this does not seem to be reliable. So am I having a misconception? Or else what can be done to get along with this?
