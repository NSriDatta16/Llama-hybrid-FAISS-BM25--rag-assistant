Google android-app's titles and soft clustering

I have a no-trial question: I want to soft cluster the apps from Google Store. Most of the parameters are numbers, so no big clue. There are also "tags" but this is like using categorical features. I can use a one-hot encoding. The pain is about the titles, which still contain a lot of useful info. To keep the feature-vector small, I'm attempting several solutions, but nothing really satisfying. I did a previous work using a sentence embedding solution from Facebook IA, which works great, however, the 8K vector does not seem a good idea for soft-clustering. How would you "convert" the title string into a vector suitable for a later soft clustering algorithm?
