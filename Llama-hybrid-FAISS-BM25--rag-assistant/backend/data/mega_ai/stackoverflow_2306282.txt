It is difficult to answer because the Windows API and Cocoa do not have the same role. Linux is a kernel for Linux based systems. As is darwin for Mac OS X and the Windows, or NT kernel for windows. In each of these systems you can write applications focused on interacting with the end user, with graphics, windows and such, or focused on interacting with the kernel, to do things such as networking, controlling storage. When you think of a Cocoa application, I believe you generally think of user focused, graphical applications, while the term Windows API mainly refers to low level operations. In the Windows world, the equivalent to Cocoa is not the Windows API are the various COM, COM+, DCOM and now the .NET framework with things such as WPF. If you want to write graphical applications which work on Linux similar to those in a default Ubuntu install, take a look at GTK . If you want to write sytem level programs, you'd probably need first to research Unix programming in general. A classical book is 'Advanced programming in the Unix environment' by Richard W. Stevens.
