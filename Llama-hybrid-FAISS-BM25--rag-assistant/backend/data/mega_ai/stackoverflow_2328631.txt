How to achieve effective democratic governance for an Open Source project?

How to successfully implement democratic (non- BDFL controlled) type of management for the open source project? More specifically - for the project using distributed source repositories. What style of communication is best to adopt in such environment? How to encourage merging branches into the master? I am mostly interested in establishing the situation where people can directly merge into the master branch under the "social contract" agreement that they follow the project roadmap (which they themselves help to define) and that code they commit is tested. I specifically want to encourage workflow define the problem -> define requirements and specific metrics of success -> architect -> build and test The reason is that - I often see emails like here is the problem and here is how I think it should be solved Immediately somebody else jumps in and starts a fight. Not productive at all. Often disagreement of that kind stems from not being on the same page on the problem definition, requirements or architecture. Or sometimes just because nobody even thought about such things. How to encourage people to analyze the problem properly, share great ideas and select the best solutions? How to organize communication so to avoid silly fights, make good decisions without being overly bureaucratic and move along at a good pace ? Would you have any suggestions? Are there examples of projects managed this way? How do you think adoption of distributed revision control instead of centralized affects the style of project management? edit : found some interesting links in related questions http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/
