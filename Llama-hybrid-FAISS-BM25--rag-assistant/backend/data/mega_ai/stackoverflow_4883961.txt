I assume that you have files stored on the sd-card in mind, since files stored in the internal file system is protected by default. The only way you can protect your data from other applications is to use some sort of encryption. Android gives each application its own user id and then the standard Linux file system access rights take care of protecting data stored on the internal file system. There is nothing you need to do to take advantage of this feature, as it is central to the whole security model in Android. But for external storage, like the sd-card, Android is using the FAT file system to make the cards compatible with Windows. It's a good thought, but since the FAT file system lack any access rights features, everything stored on the sd-card is available to all apps. (An app that needs access to the sd-card will need to ask for permission to do so.) (This is a huge integrity problem with Android. Sensitive information should not be stored on the sd-card, yet all photos taken are stored there. An app with access to the sd-card and the internet could easily upload all your photos to a server somewhere without you knowing it.)
