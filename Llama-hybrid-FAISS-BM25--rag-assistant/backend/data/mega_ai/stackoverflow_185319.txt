Obviously I'm biased because I work there, but we use Enterprise Random Password Manager from Lieberman Software . Yes, we do actually dogfood our own tool in our own network. It has some nice features, like web accessibility with delegation, scheduled operation with retry, propagation to other things using accounts (services, COM+ apps, etc.), system/account discovery, Linux/Unix account management, etc. I'm sure a salesperson could give a better pitch, but that I am not. I'd encourage you to check it out. :)
