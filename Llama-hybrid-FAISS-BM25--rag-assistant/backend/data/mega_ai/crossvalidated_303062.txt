Fitting distribution to data with heteroscedastic errors

I want to fit a distribution to a set of univariate observations that were obtained using two different measurement techniques, which have with different measurement errors. One thought would be to fit a mixture model to the data, in which I first fit independent distributions to the values obtained from each of the two measurement techniques, then mix them according to the relative measurement errors. However, this seems like a crude solution since the distributions are constructed independently. Another thought is using a kernel density estimate with the kernel width dependent on the measurement technique, but for communication and future modeling purposes a parametric distribution is definitely preferable. Is there a relatively straightforward way to formulate this with a Bayesian approach (in PyMC3 or Stan)?
