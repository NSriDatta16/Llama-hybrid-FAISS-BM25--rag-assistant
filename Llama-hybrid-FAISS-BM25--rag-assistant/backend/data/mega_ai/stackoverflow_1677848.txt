How do you make a picture follow your mouse pointer with jquery?

I find drag-and-drop difficult (you know, keeping the mouse button depressed while moving), and want to offer a 'select and drop' where a user clicks on an icon and clicks again on the drawing-plate to drop the corresponding element (a picture). How do you do that with jquery? Thanks. Edit: I have two divs, an icons plate to select elements from, and a drawing plate where pictures are dropped. When the mouse enters the drawing plate I want a 50% opacity of the bigger image follow the mouse pointer so that the user knows by clicking where it is going to be dropped and if it overlaps with anything already on the drawing board.
