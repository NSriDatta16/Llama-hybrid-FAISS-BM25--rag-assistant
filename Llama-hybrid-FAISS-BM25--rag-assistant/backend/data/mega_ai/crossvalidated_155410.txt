This is a great use case for small multiples . You would have a grid of 34 plots, one for each country. Put GDP on the horizontal axis of each plot, and criminal activity on the vertical axis. If you wanted to show trends over time, you could put time on the horiztonal axis, and then have two vertical axes: one for GDP and one for criminal activity. Each plot would then contain two time series. Alternatively, you could forget about country and year entirely. Just plot criminal activity against GDP: this will show you if there is an overall trend across time and space. You could also make a separate scatterplot for each year, since you only have three years. Asking about code specifically is off-topic here, but it's doable in matplotlib: http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/07/matplotlib-and-small-multiples/ http://joelotz.github.io/small-multiples-in-matplotlib.html http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/olgabot/5432378 (about halfway down)
