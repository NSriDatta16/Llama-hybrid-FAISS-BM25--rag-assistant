I can't find a good technical reference for this, but I would call this a point mass (this has also been pointed out in comments). For example, this introduction to Bayesian statistics gives the example: This time, the Bayesian believes that the probability p of an RU-486 baby is uniformly distributed between 0 and one-half, but has a point mass of 0.5 at one-half. That is, she believes there is a 50% chance that no difference exists between standard therapy and RU-486. But if a difference exists, she thinks that RU-486 is better, but she is completely unsure about how much better it would be. Or, Trong et al. say: Hence, the distribution of fitness effects of the mutations is a mixture of the point-mass and the continuous distribution. In physics (since the question was originally asked on Physics SE) a point mass is sometimes referred to as (a multiple of) a Dirac delta function (there is an example/section on "probability theory" in the linked Wikipedia article ...)
