Infragistics as much as I hate their suite of controls, has a fully functional C# formula interpreter runtime evaluation engine that works great with their grid controls. Part of their license allows you access to the source code. I was curious how they built it and found they that they used an open source project called Grammatica as their starting point (very cool).
