XSLT: Creating an Image from base64 content AND linking to it from an img tag in a jtextpane

Im useing this aproach to create an image while in an xsl transformer: XSLT: Convert base64 data into image files My issue is that now i what to create an IMG tag that references the created image. Here is what I've done: TOP 100 75 Im taking the output from above and displaying it in a JTextPane, but the image is always broken. I imagine it's an issue with relative pathing, but i dont know how to get the absolute path from within the xsl. EDIT: Ok, turns out that i cant reference images relative in the img tag because JTextPanes cant handle that. I was able to get this working using the following: MIDDLE 200 150 but i really need it to either be relative or i need to get access to the system defined temp directory. Anybody know how to this?
