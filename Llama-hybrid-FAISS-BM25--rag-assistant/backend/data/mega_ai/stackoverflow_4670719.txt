Although it's not exactly what I wanted, I decided to added the following to certain elements of the page. function ScrollToTop(object) { $('html,body').animate({ scrollTop: $(object).offset().top - 30 }, 1000, 'linear'); } And then on certain elements: onfocus="ScrollToTop(this);" I was hoping to not hard-code the focus events. It would be nice if there were a "scrollingIntoView" event that I could bind to and then run my script. Anyway, my solution is nice and elegant.
