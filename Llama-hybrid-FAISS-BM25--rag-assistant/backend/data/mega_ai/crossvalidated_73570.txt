I think this article will provide answers for your questions 1 and 4: Fabrigar, L. R., Wegener, D. T., MacCallum, R. C., & Strahan, E. J. (1999). Evaluating the use of exploratory factor analysis in psychological research. Psychological Methods , 4, 272â€“299. doi:10.1037//1082-989X.4.3.272 ( PDF ) From page 275: [...] it is important to recognize that the goal of identifying latent constructs (i.e., understanding the structure of correlations among measured variables) is different from that of data reduction. Data reduction involves taking scores on a large set of measured variables and reducing them to scores on a smaller set of composite variables that retain as much information from the original variables as possible. Data reduction does not attempt to model the structure of correlations among the original variables. [...] If the goal is to arrive at a parsimonious representation of the associations among measured variables, EFA can be an appropriate form of analysis. If the goal is data reduction, principal components analysis (PCA) is more appropriate. The author than continues to elaborate on the conceptual differences differences, which will probably help to clarify things.
