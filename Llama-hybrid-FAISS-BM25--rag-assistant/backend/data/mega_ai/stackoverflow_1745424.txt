JAXB suffers from the same basic issues as DOM-based parsing, which is that generally speaking, the entire data data structure is held in memory at the same time. That said, it's generally less memory-hungry than a DOM API (with the possible exception of XOM). Having said that, there are ways of using JAXB to read fragments of large documents in a stream-oriented fashion, if needs be. That's fairly exotic usage, though.
