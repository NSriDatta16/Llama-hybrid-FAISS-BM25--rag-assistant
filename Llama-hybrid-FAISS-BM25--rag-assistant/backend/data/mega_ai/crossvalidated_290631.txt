Training both positive and negative data with naive bayesian classification?

This might not be the best forum for this question so please forgive me. So I was demo'ed a custom naive bayesian classifier that accepted both positive & negative training data. An example: "I am really excited about getting my python tonight" This would be trained as positive on the class "pets", "happy" but negative against "python", "programming" This dramatically increased how quickly a class could be trained accurately. So my question: is this really naive bayesian classification? Is there anything else out there like this? Additional information: The classifier didn't just return a single matching class against input but returned an array of classes and their "scores"
