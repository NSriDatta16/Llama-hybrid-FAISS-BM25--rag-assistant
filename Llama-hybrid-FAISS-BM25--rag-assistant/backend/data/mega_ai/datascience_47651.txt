How to visualise GIST features of an image

I am currently working on a image classification application using deep learning algorithms (either by using GIST features or CNN). I need help in understanding the below queries. I have extracted the GIST features of an image ( Reference Link ). These extracted features will be given as input to deep learning algorithm to classify the images. Is there a way to visualize the extracted features on top of the image? CNN or GIST, Which is better for image classification? Is GIST outdated when compared to CNN? Thank you, KK
