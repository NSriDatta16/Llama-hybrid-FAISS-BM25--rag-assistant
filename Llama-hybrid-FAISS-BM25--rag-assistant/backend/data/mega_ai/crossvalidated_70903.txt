More complicated classifier vs data preprocessing

For example if we have two options to use non-linear classifier like SVM with kernel or use linear classifier like linear SVM with data preprocessing like some non-linear dimensionality reduction which one is better? In other words why we should use a complicated classifier if we can do some data preprocessing (or "projection" if I am not mistaken it's called manifold learning) to make data linearly separable?
