As you don't need to attend the subject when you solve this 'riddle' it's not supposed to be easy I think. Nevertheless I would do something like this (told in a very simplistic way) Build up a Neuronal Network which you give some input (a (e)book, some (e)books) => no google needed this network classifies words (Neural networks are great for 'unsure' classification). I think you may simply know which word belongs to which category because of the occurences in the text. ('fishing' is likely to be mentioned near 'sports'). After some training of the neural network it should "link" you the words to the categories.
