Remove the last "," from the string list without the help of Substring and str.Length - 1 (C#3.0)

Consider the below code snippet string src = "ibm,tcs"; string dest = src.Split(',').Select(i => i + "();,").ToArray().Aggregate((s, i) => s + i); dest = dest.Substring(0, dest.Length - 1); What I am doing is that, the Source string(src here) will have the string list in comma separated way. The final output will be: ibm();,tcs(); As we can make out that, my program is doing so. But I am taking the help of dest.Substring(0, dest.Length - 1); for eliminating the last "," that I am building in the Select Extension method. I don't like this approach of mine. Is there any other beautiful / elegant way of doing so? I am sure that someone will definitely approach in a better way :) Also I will be happy if I get a solution using Lambda & Extension Method. I am using C# 3.0 and dot net framework 3.5 Thanks
