I recommend you using PCA . It finds directions which data is highly distributed in. Using this procedure, the components __ new features __ will be in descending order for the eigenvalues. Each eigenvalue that has greater value than the next eigenvalues, will have much information than them. After using PCA you can use its first three principal components for plotting. Each of the new features is a linear combination of the previous features. Using e.g. first three principal components will have so much information which will be representative of your data. In cases that data is not correlated, the preceding statement may not be always true but in your case that you have so many features, based on experience, you definitely have so many correlated features. For more information take a look at here and here which may help you.
