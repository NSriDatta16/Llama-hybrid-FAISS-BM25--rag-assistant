Look at your message So first thing it relate to permission open(/var/lib/php/session/sess_isu2r2bqudeosqvpoo8a67oj02, O_RDWR) failed: Permission denied (13) in Unknown on line 0 you have to check file permission change mode this /var/lib/php/session/ Second thing it relate to session.save_path Warning: Unknown: Failed to write session data (files). Please verify that the current setting of session.save_path is correct (/var/lib/php/session) in Unknown on line 0 in php.ini [Session] ; Handler used to store/retrieve data. session.save_handler = files ; Argument passed to save_handler. In the case of files, this is the path ; where data files are stored. Note: Windows users have to change this ; variable in order to use PHP's session functions. ; ; As of PHP 4.0.1, you can define the path as: ; ; session.save_path = "N;/path" ; ; where N is an integer. Instead of storing all the session files in ; /path, what this will do is use subdirectories N-levels deep, and ; store the session data in those directories. This is useful if you ; or your OS have problems with lots of files in one directory, and is ; a more efficient layout for servers that handle lots of sessions. ; ; NOTE 1: PHP will not create this directory structure automatically. ; You can use the script in the ext/session dir for that purpose. ; NOTE 2: See the section on garbage collection below if you choose to ; use subdirectories for session storage ; session.save_path = /tmp/
