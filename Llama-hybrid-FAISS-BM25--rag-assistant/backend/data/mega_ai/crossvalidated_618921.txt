ML Modeling Recommendation for Predicting Snake Encounters in Historical Journey Data

I have a dataset consisting of historical journey data where individuals travel from point A to point B. During their journeys, they may encounter varying numbers of animal sightings, including snakes. The dataset includes attributes such as time, attribute_1, attribute_2, attribute_3, attribute_4, and a binary label indicating whether a snake was seen or not. My objective is to create a website that can predict, based on a person's ID and their journey from point X to point Y, whether they are likely to encounter a snake during their next step. I want to choose the most suitable ML modeling approach for this task. Considering the dynamic nature of the data, the need for real-time predictions, and the potential relevance of the previous snake sightings as additional information, I would like recommendations on which ML modeling techniques to explore. Additionally, I have additional attributes (attribute_1, attribute_2, etc.) that could potentially contribute to the prediction accuracy. What ML modeling approaches would be most appropriate for this problem? Are there specific algorithms, architectures, or techniques that would be well-suited to handle this type of sequential prediction task? Can the problem be solved by considering it as a time series classification problem and using the techniques such as LSTM RNN or HMM? I would appreciate any insights, advice, or references to relevant research papers or tutorials that can help me make an informed decision. P.S. The example of the data structure: id time/step attribute_1 attribute_2 attribute_3 attribute_4 label 1 1 b j 10 105 0 1 3 b h 12 45 0 1 10 b g 12 454 1 2 4 y j 4 54 1 2 9 y m 7 65 0 3 1 x l 6 76 0 3 3 x r 99 99 0 3 6 x e 88 8 0 3 9 x w 65 45 0 3 10 x f 44 56 1 3 11 x h 33 45 0 As can be seen each person might encounter a different number of animals, but what we know this number wouldn't be greater than 25. It depends on from and to where he/she travels. Label 0 means he/she sees an animal but it is not a snake, and 1 shows he/she sees a snake in that certain time/step. This prediction is important because in the live system if we predict that the person will see the snake in the next step of his/her journey then we can notify him/her beforehand.
