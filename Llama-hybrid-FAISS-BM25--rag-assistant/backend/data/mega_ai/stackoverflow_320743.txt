Sound disappearing in Flash 9 on non-IE browsers

I'm working on a site ( http://easy2speak.com ) with about 10 flash SWFs on each page. Each of the SWFs are playing back a sound when clicked. Loading the sound, and playing it without any latency works fine, but in Flash player version 9 on all major browsers except IE, the sound suddenly drops out. It usually works for the first 10-20 clicks, then the SWFs will be totally silent until the next machine/browser restart. In Flash player v10 (exactly the same code) it works perfectly. It also works perfectly in Flash player v9 in Internet Explorer. Any ideas ? Would love to hear some brain-storming on how to get around this problem as well, as I start to suspect there is no easy fix I can do in code. By the way, the site has 1000+ sounds in MP3, so any solution can't involve embedding the sounds.
