How to enable scrollbars in Windows Sidebar Gadgets?

I would like to make the entire gadgetContent div of my Sidebar Gadget scrollable if its content overflows its height. I can get a scrollbar to show up. Unfortunately, any time I click+drag this bar, I move the entire gadget. Here's my CSS: div#gadgetContent { overflow: auto; height: 240px; } Is there a way to get the scrollbar's behavior to override the Gadget's click+drag movement? Thanks in advance! edit : I discovered that HTML scrollbars actually do work within Sidebar gadgets. I had some CSS in my g:background element that was preventing scrollbars from being clickable. HTML scrollbars started working the way I expected them to once I fixed the problem.
