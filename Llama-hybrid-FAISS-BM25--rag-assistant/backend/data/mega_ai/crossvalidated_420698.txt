How to perform machine learning on data with many trials on individual subjects

I have an EEG dataset. The data are epoched around an event of interest and are of the form channels x timepoints x trials. There are many of these types of datasets for several subjects. Because the data are high dimensional (many channels and timepoints) I would like to use machine learning. How do I account for the fact that many of the trials come from the same subject? Do I violate machine learning rules if I put some trials from the same subject in the training data and other trials from the same subject in the test data? Is there a minimum amount of subjects I should have to be able to use machine learning?
