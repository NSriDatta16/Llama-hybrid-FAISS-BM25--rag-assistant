BOW approach with Tf-idf weighting seems like a good strategy however you need to improve your feature engineering strategy. I would recommend to include n-grams (bigrams, trigrams etc.), special charecters (exclamations), emoji unicodes etc. 0.35 is a poor estimate than of a random accuracy ( class imbalance and may need to account for that.
