Why decision boundary is of (D-1) dimensions?

I am reading Bishop - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book. In Chapter 4 first page, there is a statement that In this chapter, we consider linear models for classification, by which we mean that the decision surfaces are linear functions of the input vector x and hence are defined by (D âˆ’ 1)-dimensional hyper planes within the D-dimensional input space. If the input vector is of D dimensions then the decision boundary should also be of D dimensions. Why is it D-1 ? For example, in 2-D plane, the line separating the points is also a straight line which is of 2 dimensions. Am I thinking something terribly wrong? Can anyone explain me how is it D-1 dimensions for decision boundary?
