In general, most of the points of Derek's answer apply. I would be definitely think over twice before using XML in the database. Most applications commonly use Relational Databases. However, sometimes, the information in the system is more hierarchical in nature. Storing hierarchy in an RDBMS structure is definitely possible but it takes a lot of manipulation when retrieving it to get it back into its desired structure (things like recursive CTE's in SQL server make this task a bit easier but not necessarily faster) So, if you come across something like having to store a n level folder hierarchy or maybe a organizational hierarchy, both of which are hierarchical in nature, it is sometimes better to store it as XML. Database usually being the common storage mechanism and since it makes it easier to synchronize changes, hence this data is stored as such in DB though it could potentially be stored just as a flat file too. Most Relational databases nowdays hence offer a lot of XML support where you can use T-SQL to query the data / update selected nodes etc. Re: What is XML - for starters look here
