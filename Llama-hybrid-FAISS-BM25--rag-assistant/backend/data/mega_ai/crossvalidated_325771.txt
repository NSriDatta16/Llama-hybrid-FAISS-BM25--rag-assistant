For image classification, VGG is a bit out-dated compared to more recent models such as Inception/Resnet/Densenet. In general, the model zoo here is a good place to start. https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo Another place might be this repository which tracks state-of-the-art results on a large variety of datasets -- a large fraction of which are backed by neural networks, so you could look into the various papers for the architectures: https://github.com/RedditSota/state-of-the-art-result-for-machine-learning-problems
