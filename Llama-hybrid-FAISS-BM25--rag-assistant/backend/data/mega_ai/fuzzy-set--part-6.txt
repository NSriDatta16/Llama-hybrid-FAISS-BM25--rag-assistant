rived from the distance, e.g. after a proposal by Koczy: S = 1 / ( 1 + d ( A , B ) ) {\displaystyle S=1/(1+d(A,B))} if d ( A , B ) {\displaystyle d(A,B)} is finite, 0 {\displaystyle 0} else, or after Williams and Steele: S = exp ⁡ ( − α d ( A , B ) ) {\displaystyle S=\exp(-\alpha {d(A,B)})} if d ( A , B ) {\displaystyle d(A,B)} is finite, 0 {\displaystyle 0} else where α > 0 {\displaystyle \alpha >0} is a steepness parameter and exp ⁡ ( x ) = e x {\displaystyle \exp(x)=e^{x}} . L-fuzzy sets Sometimes, more general variants of the notion of fuzzy set are used, with membership functions taking values in a (fixed or variable) algebra or structure L {\displaystyle L} of a given kind; usually it is required that L {\displaystyle L} be at least a poset or lattice. These are usually called L-fuzzy sets, to distinguish them from those valued over the unit interval. The usual membership functions with values in [0, 1] are then called [0, 1]-valued membership functions. These kinds of generalizations were first considered in 1967 by Joseph Goguen, who was a student of Zadeh. A classical corollary may be indicating truth and membership values by {f, t} instead of {0, 1}. An extension of fuzzy sets has been provided by Atanassov. An intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) A {\displaystyle A} is characterized by two functions: 1. μ A ( x ) {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)} – degree of membership of x 2. ν A ( x ) {\displaystyle \nu _{A}(x)} – degree of non-membership of x with functions μ A , ν A : U → [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle \mu _{A},\nu _{A}:U\to [0,1]} with ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ( x ) + ν A ( x ) ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A}(x)+\nu _{A}(x)\leq 1} . This resembles a situation like some person denoted by x {\displaystyle x} voting for a proposal A {\displaystyle A} : ( μ A ( x ) = 1 , ν A ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)=1,\nu _{A}(x)=0} ), against it: ( μ A ( x ) = 0 , ν A ( x ) = 1 {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)=0,\nu _{A}(x)=1} ), or abstain from voting: ( μ A ( x ) = ν A ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)=\nu _{A}(x)=0} ). After all, we have a percentage of approvals, a percentage of denials, and a percentage of abstentions. For this situation, special "intuitive fuzzy" negators, t- and s-norms can be defined. With D ∗ = { ( α , β ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] 2 : α + β = 1 } {\displaystyle D^{*}=\{(\alpha ,\beta )\in [0,1]^{2}:\alpha +\beta =1\}} and by combining both functions to ( μ A , ν A ) : U → D ∗ {\displaystyle (\mu _{A},\nu _{A}):U\to D^{*}} this situation resembles a special kind of L-fuzzy sets. Once more, this has been expanded by defining picture fuzzy sets (PFS) as follows: A PFS A is characterized by three functions mapping U to [0, 1]: μ A , η A , ν A {\displaystyle \mu _{A},\eta _{A},\nu _{A}} , "degree of positive membership", "degree of neutral membership", and "degree of negative membership" respectively and additional condition ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ( x ) + η A ( x ) + ν A ( x ) ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A}(x)+\eta _{A}(x)+\nu _{A}(x)\leq 1} This expands the voting sample above by an additional possibility of "refusal of voting". With D ∗ = { ( α , β , γ ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] 3 : α + β + γ = 1 } {\displaystyle D^{*}=\{(\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma )\in [0,1]^{3}:\alpha +\beta +\gamma =1\}} and special "picture fuzzy" negators, t- and s-norms this resembles just another type of L-fuzzy sets. Pythagorean fuzzy sets One extension of IFS is what is known as Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Such sets satisfy the constraint μ A ( x ) 2 + ν A ( x ) 2 ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)^{2}+\nu _{A}(x)^{2}\leq 1} , which is reminiscent of the Pythagorean theorem. Pythagorean fuzzy sets can be applicable to real life applications in which the previous condition of μ A ( x ) + ν A ( x ) ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)+\nu _{A}(x)\leq 1} is not valid. However, the less restrictive condition of μ A ( x ) 2 + ν A ( x ) 2 ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)^{2}+\nu _{A}(x)^{2}\leq 1} may be suitable in more domains.
