First, I suggest different tags. It sounds like you're really interested in offloading searching to a server in a cryptographically secure way (such that the server doesn't have access to the plaintext and such that the client need not transfer the entire index). Issues: An attacker being able to figure out which words are in the index (and which are not) could be an issue for you. You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements. An attacker being able to figure out which items in the index occur more frequently could be an issue for you. You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements. An attacker being able to associate words with a document could be an issue for you. You should state whether it is as a part of your requirements. An attacker may be able to subvert the server entirely and observe queries / retrievals. You should state security needs in this circumstance as well. Probably others I haven't thought of. I'm assuming that you're designing your own, but there is probably some prior art, research, etc. that would be smarter than I am below: For the first, I suggest that you should hash the words, combining the plaintext with a secret (not shared with the index server) before hashing, and truncating the hash to the point where it is likely to be non-unique in the index. This costs you hash efficiency, but helps prevent an attacker from using the hash as a plaintext equivalent or experimentally determining the secret For the second and third, you should encrypt any indexed data (such as counts or document+position) and decrypt it on the client. This may cost you latency. For the fourth, you'd want to consider concealing real requests inside groups of unrelated requests, things like that, but you'd want a lot of math to make sure you weren't still vulnerable to statistical analysis. For the fifth, do some web research. I'm confident there will be stuff out there, and this is a pretty specific (and less common) need, so you'll want someone who put more thought into it than I just have.
