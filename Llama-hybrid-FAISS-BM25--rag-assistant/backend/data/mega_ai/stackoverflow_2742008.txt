If you had a quantum computer, you could use Grover's algorithm to search your data in O(N 1/2 ) time and using O(log N) storage space. Otherwise, your question is pretty silly. Binary search or one of its variants (trinary search, for example) is really your best choice. Doing micro-optimizations on a linear search is stupid when you can pick a superior algorithm.
