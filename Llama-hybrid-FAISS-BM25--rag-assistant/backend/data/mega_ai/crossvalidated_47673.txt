The correlation is a bivariate statistic that would involve only x and y and would not have an intercept. None of what you've given is a correlation. But, given that there is an interaction with other variables, the correlation, while mathematically correct, will be misleading. In one of your replies you write: For example, is it correct to say "among all categories c, the average correlation of x with y is b_1", and if so, which b_1 should I use here? The one in model 1, 2, or 3? If you want to make a statement of this type, you can get a weighted average of the correlations (not the regression parameters) in the different categories of c. But I don't think this is a good approach. Given this goal What I'm interested in is a (justified) general statement about the correlation I can make to someone who knows very little statistics. What I would do is present a graph of the variables x and y, with the dots on the scatterplot colored differently for each level of c, and with regression lines (or possibly loess lines) superimposed on top. This wouldn't be a single simple statement, but sometimes there is no good single simple statement.
