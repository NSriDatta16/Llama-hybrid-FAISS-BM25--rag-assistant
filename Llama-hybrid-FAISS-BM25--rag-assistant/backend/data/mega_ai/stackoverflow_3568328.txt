You might want to look at the description page . The short answer is that it runs the program 66 times, then divides the time by 66 to get an average across a large number of runs. The basic idea is that this amortizes things like JVM startup time JIT compiling across a large number of runs so you get an idea of what you could expect from something like a heavily used web service that runs all the time, so things like the JVM startup time and JIT compile time become (almost) irrelevant.
