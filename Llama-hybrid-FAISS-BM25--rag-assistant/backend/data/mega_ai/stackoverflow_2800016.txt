How do you add gestures to a UITableViewController?

I want to implement right-to-left and left-to-right gestures on a view that inherits from UITableViewController. I have the code for the gestures implemented in another view (UIViewController) and it works. It does't seem like touchesBegan is even getting called. Does anyone know know to do this? Thanks
