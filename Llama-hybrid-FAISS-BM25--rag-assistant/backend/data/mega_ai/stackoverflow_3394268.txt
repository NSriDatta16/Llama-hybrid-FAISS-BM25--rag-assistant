It appears this can be done . I'm unable to determine the version of GCC that it was added, but it was sometime before June 2010. Here's an example: #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wuninitialized" foo(a); /* error is given for this one */ #pragma GCC diagnostic push #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized" foo(b); /* no diagnostic for this one */ #pragma GCC diagnostic pop foo(c); /* error is given for this one */ #pragma GCC diagnostic pop foo(d); /* depends on command line options */
