In statistics, it is important to separate elements (or variables) into two groups: Random or Non-random. Random variable has some special characters such as mean, variance. But non-random elements do not have this kind of thing. In you question, effect of the treatment is the unknown constants (parameters), so there is no variance/covariance. If effect of treatment means its estimate, there is no difference between general covariates and the interaction. You can treat the interaction term as another covariate. GLM theory has no special limitation on design matrix. With interaction, your design matrix $X$ is Nx4 matrix. The estimated covariance matrix (4x4) is $var(\hat \beta) = \hat Ïƒ^2(X'X)^{-1}$. Then you can test/estimate anything that can be expressed as $L\beta$, where $L$ is kx4 matrix. This explanation is from classical statistical aspect. For Bayesian, maybe everything is random.
