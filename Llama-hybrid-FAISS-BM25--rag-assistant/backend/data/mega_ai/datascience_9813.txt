Face Recognition using Eigenfaces and SVM

I am new to machine learning. I want to develop a face recognition system using scikit-learn. This is the example given in the tutorials of scikit-learn. I am not getting how the input is being provided to the program. How should I load a particular image and make my program run to predict the label for that?
