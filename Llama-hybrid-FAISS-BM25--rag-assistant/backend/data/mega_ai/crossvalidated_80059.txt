Sort lists using statistics

I want to make a ranking of music genres. I have a list of artists and top genres with a value (1 - 100) which describes how much their music is from that genre. Now I need to organise the genres so the most popular is on top. Bellow I have genres from 4 artists (3 genres per each). We can see that Rock and Metal are both in 3 groups, but when looking at the value it is clear that Rock is more popular than Metal . I was thinking about summing the values from the genres, and order the by the summ, but I think in statistics it must be an algorithm that will give better result when doing the rank. The question is how to order the genres (btw, I'm using PHP). metal (71) industrial (65) rock (36) rock (100) alternative (67) metal (36) metal (100) Melodic Death Metal (72) modern metal (68) alternative rock (100) rock (78) alternative (63)
