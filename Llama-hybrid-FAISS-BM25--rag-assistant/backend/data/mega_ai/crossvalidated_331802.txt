If you have multiple people from each country and believe that people from one country have some similarity to each other (which seems reasonable) then you will violate the assumption of independent error and regular regression is not appropriate. What you propose in your second paragraph is called stratification and it is one reasonable thing to do, but you will get separate results for each country with no statistical analysis of the differences. Another possibility is to use a multilevel model (MLM) . Since your DV is binary, you will need a nonlinear MLM.
