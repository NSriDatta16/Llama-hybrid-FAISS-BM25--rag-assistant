What happens when GLM (in R) is given 2 correlated variables?

I have this data where I chose the feature as - Amount of credit and the variable to be predicted is the Credit Rating (good or bad). I ran the logistic regression and I got an accuracy of around 67%. And my model summary was as follows - Then I created a new (synthetic variable) as RandomAmtofCredit= Amount of credit + rnorm(). These two variables are correlated with value of 1. Here too I get almost the same accuracy; but the model summary is very confusing My question is; how is the prediction same when both the values are almost similar and the seem to be almost cancelling out each other. (0.03540 and -0.03578). And how does the glm function handle these correlations in general?
