That's not a huge query by any stretch of the imagination. How slow is it really? Maybe if views doesn't contain any more information than what you've shown, you should just have a view count be a field of posts. No need for it to be its own separate table unless you're actually storing some information about the views themselves, like user-agent strings or time.
