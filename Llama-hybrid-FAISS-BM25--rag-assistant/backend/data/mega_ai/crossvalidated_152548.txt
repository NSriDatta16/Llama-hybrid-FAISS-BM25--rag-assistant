What should the divisor be in MSE?

The mean squared error for two vectors is calculated using $$mse(x, y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-y_i)^2\text{, with }x, y \in \mathbb{R^n}\text{.}$$ That is straightforward, but I have a hard time figuring out the correct way to apply this formula to machine learning algorithms where you have to deal with multiple samples which would be stored in matrices such as $X, Y \in \mathbb{R^{n\times m}}$. In such a matrix there is a total of $m$ samples and each sample has $n$ features. What would the correct definition of MSE be in this case? Do you divide by $m$ (the number of sample vectors) $$mse(X, Y) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n (x_{ij} - y_{ij})^2\text{,}$$ or do you divide by $n \cdot m$ (the number of scalars in the matrix) $$mse(X, Y) = \frac{1}{m\cdot n} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n (x_{ij} - y_{ij})^2\text{?}$$ I'm sorry if this is a silly question. It may very well be since statistics is not something I deal with regularly.
