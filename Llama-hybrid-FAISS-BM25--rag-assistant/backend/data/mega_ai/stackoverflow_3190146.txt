Is it better to allocate memory in the power of two?

When we use malloc() to allocate memory, should we give the size which is in power of two? Or we just give the exact size that we need? Like //char *ptr= malloc( 200 ); char *ptr= malloc( 256 );//instead of 200 we use 256 If it is better to give size which is in the power of two, what is the reason for that? Why is it better? Thanks Edit The reason of my confusion is following quote from Joel's blog Back to Basics Smart programmers minimize the potential distruption of malloc by always allocating blocks of memory that are powers of 2 in size. You know, 4 bytes, 8 bytes, 16 bytes, 18446744073709551616 bytes, etc. For reasons that should be intuitive to anyone who plays with Lego, this minimizes the amount of weird fragmentation that goes on in the free chain. Although it may seem like this wastes space, it is also easy to see how it never wastes more than 50% of the space. So your program uses no more than twice as much memory as it needs to, which is not that big a deal. Sorry, I should have posted the above quote earlier. My apologies! Most replies, so far, say that allocating memory in the power of two is a bad idea, then in which scenario its better to follow Joel's point about malloc() ? Why did he say that? Is the above quoted suggestion obsolete now? Kindly explain it. Thanks
