Time series intervention analysis is not like this. First, you have to model regular ARIMA model for preintervention period and find the order of appropriate ARIMA model. Then you have to use the order in ARIMAX model (taking whole period, pre+post intervention), including a dummy variable. model1 = forecast::auto.arima(ts_model1, trace = TRUE, seasonal = TRUE, stationary = FALSE, ic = c("aicc", "aic", "bic"), stepwise = TRUE, allowmean = TRUE, allowdrift = TRUE) # ts_model1 is only for preintervention period # Best model: ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,0,0)[12] model2 = TSA::arimax(ts_model2, order = c(1, 1, 1), seasonal = list(order = c(1, 0, 0), period = 12), xreg = ts_model4, method = c("CSS-ML", "ML", "CSS"), kappa = 1e+06, xtransf = dummy, transfer = list(c(1,0))) I hope you understand.
