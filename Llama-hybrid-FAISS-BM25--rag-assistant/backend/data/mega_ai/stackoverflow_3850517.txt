I think you already have a pretty good idea of problems that may arise. Indexing doesn't work real good on those fields, updating and reading individual values requires extra work in your application. Also, you're storing what looks mostly like numbers in a string-type column, so that means some extra storage space (though you'd have to weigh that against a bit of overhead for separate columns). It might turn into a nightmare when the structure of those columns changes. All of that might be manageable effort for you, but it's entirely possible that the dev after you will hate you. :p
