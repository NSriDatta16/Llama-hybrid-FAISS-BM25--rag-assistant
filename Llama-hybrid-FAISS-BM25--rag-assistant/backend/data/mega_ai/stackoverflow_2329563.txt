Your best bet is to use an interface for all of your database access. Then for each database type you want to support to do the implementation of the interface for that database. That is what I've had to do for projects in the past. The problem with many database systems and storage tools is that they aim to solve different problems. You might not even want to store your data in a SQL database but instead store it as files in the App_Data folder of a web application. With an interface method you could do that quite easily. There generally isn't a solution that fits all database and storage solutions well or even a few of them well. If you find one that claims it does I still wouldn't trust it. When you have a problem with one of the databases it's going to be much easier for you to dig through your objects than it will be to go dig through theirs.
