crm ifd username and password

i'd like to know how can get the user name and his password and use it when i set the crmservice connection CrmDiscoveryService disco = new CrmDiscoveryService(); disco.Url = "https://localhost/MSCRMServices/2007/SPLA/CrmDiscoveryService.asmx"; //Retrieve a list of available organizations from the CrmDiscoveryService Web service. RetrieveOrganizationsRequest orgRequest = new RetrieveOrganizationsRequest(); HERE I WANT TO PUT THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD FROM THE SIGNIN PAGE // Substitute an appropriate domain, username, and password here. orgRequest.UserId = domain + "\\" + username; orgRequest.Password = password; RetrieveOrganizationsResponse orgResponse = (RetrieveOrganizationsResponse)disco.Execute(orgRequest); thanks to the helper :)
