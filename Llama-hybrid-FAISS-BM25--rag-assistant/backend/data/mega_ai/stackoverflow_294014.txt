Another good technique is to multiply the values by a constant and store them as integer values. Using integers only can also help speed up calculations. Unless you are in serious need of precision you should really only need to store 5+ values after the decimal point. This Latitude Longitude Data Storage Specification gives a chart that shows precision vs decimal places. # decmal places, example, precision 5 51.22135 ± 0.8 m 6 50.895132 ± 0.08 m 7 would work out to be 8mm, or about 0.314 inches.
