The TFS documentation online covers this. If you are using full SQL Server you can use SQL Server Agent to schedule database backups, otherwise use Windows task scheduler (via one of the SQL command line tools). But you do need to write the SQL script to do the backing up, this is explained in some detail in the documentation linked above. (There is no simple command line because simple installations have different needs to complex ones, e.g. on a large instance backups can take many hours and issues of synchronisation of the backups becomes complex.) Additional [edit 2010-08-24] the next TFS PowerToys have been announced to include backup and recovery tools (targeted for non-large scale TFS setups). See the blog post: " Backing up and Restoring your TFS Server "
