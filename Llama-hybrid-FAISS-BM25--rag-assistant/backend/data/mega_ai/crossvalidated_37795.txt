ROC curve for discrete classifiers like SVM: Why do we still call it a "curve"?, Isn't it just a "point"?

In the discussion : how to generate a roc curve for binary classification , I think that the confusion was that a "binary classifier" (which is any classifier that separates 2 classes) was for Yang what is called a "discrete classifier" (which produces discrete outputs 0/1 like an SVM) and not continuous outputs like ANN or Bayes classifiers ... etc. So, the discussion was about how the ROC is plotted for "binary continuous classifiers", and the answer is that the outputs are sorted by their scores since the outputs are continuous, and a threshold is used to produce each point on the ROC curve. My question is for "binary discrete classifiers", such as SVM, the output values are 0 or 1. So the ROC produces just one point and not a curve. I'm confused as to why we still call it a curve?!! Can we still talk about thresholds? How can one use thresholds in SVM in particular? How can one compute the AUC?, Does cross-validation play any role here?
