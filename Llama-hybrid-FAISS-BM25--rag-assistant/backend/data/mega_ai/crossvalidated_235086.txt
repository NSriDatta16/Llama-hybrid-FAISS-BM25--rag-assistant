For your normal distribution example $(-\infty, \infty)$ will cover the true value $\geq$ 95% of the time. So will $(x-2.326 \sigma, x+1.751\sigma)$, so will many other possible intervals. Whether these are sensible intervals that you would use in practice is another question. That's the issue with the submarine example to me: a lot of the frequentist confidence intervals they show are ones that I hope no sensible frequentist would ever propose. I suppose you might say that they fail to make a point that is relevant in practice by emphasizing intervals that technically are valid 95% confidence intervals, but are otherwise rather idiotic. Something like a minimum length confidence interval based on a sensible model likelihood will give something rather more sensible. These points are sort of totally unrelated to the first point regarding the interpretation of confidence intervals. They will cover the true value 95% of the time, if you repeatedly perform the same experiment and your model is right. However, on each iteration either the true value is covered by this random interval or not, if you consider the interval as a random variable and the true parameter as a fixed quantity. It has always seemed to me that making too much of a distinction between a Bayesian credible interval with (close to) non-informative priors and such a confidence interval is rather irrelevant in practice and claiming that this somehow allows a totally different interpretation often seems a bit like sophistry. However, it starts to make a lot more sense when we are talking about Bayesian credible intervals that include (weakly) informative prior information that is available.
