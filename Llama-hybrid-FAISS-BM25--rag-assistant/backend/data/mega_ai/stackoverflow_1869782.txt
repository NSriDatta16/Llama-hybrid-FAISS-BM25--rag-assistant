wxToolBar behavior on OSX

It seems that wxToolBar is not behaving like native OSX apps does. wxToolbar http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/5683/screenshot20091208at947.png In most native OSX apps, you can drag the window around by dragging the toolbar, where the space is not occupied by buttons. In wxWidgets apps I can only move the window by dragging the title bar. Is there some way to fix that in wx(python)?
