Terrain is created by a myriad different causes over many different time-scales. In order to truly create realistic terrain, you'd have to simulate these. In the "short" term, the hydrosphere determines most of the characteristics. You can probably start with a voxel/particle/heightmap/mesh terrain containing major features (mountain ranges etc.) and treat it as immutable, then post-process it with a plethora of water simulations. You'll need to compute where the rivers and lakes will be, how they erode the base landscape, and where they form deposits. If I had to code this I'd probably start with a 3D voxel world. This would be a gargantuan task and I'm sure there are lots of tricks available for generating specific terrain types that take milliseconds instead of minutes. What kind of terrain are you looking to create? Mountainous? Lowland? Industrialised? Forest? Desert? Archipelago? Long story short: if you want terrain that looks realistic to humans (who tend to be, after all, experts on this kind of thing), you'll have to create it by simulating actual geological processes.
