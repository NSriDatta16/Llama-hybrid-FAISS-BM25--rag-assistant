Which part of Pentaho? The Kettle project has stuff to convert your Cruise Control info and load it into a relational database. That's probably a good module to get working properly, especially if you're almost done figuring it out. I hope you'll share this stuff. I could use it too. The Platform will autoschedule stuff once Kettle has it loading. To make Mondrian really useful you'll need to work out a fact / dimension organization to your test data. That may or may not be worth your trouble at this point. Once you have your data loaded you'll probably be able to get a lot of benefit out of simple SQL queries like this... select * from test where failed='yes' order by testno, date desc and this... select max(date), min(date), testno from test where failed='yes' group by testno order by testno and stuff like that. You might consider creating views in your table server for your favorite queries. There are myriad ways to convert your sql queries into reports, including the pentaho reporting module, BIRT (an eclipse plugin), Crystal Reports, and all kinds of PHP or JSP stuff you could put together.
