Incrementally build your string, one word at a time, using Epaga's method to find the length of your string. Once the length is longer than your rectangle, remove the last word and print. Repeat until you run out of words. It sounds like a bad algorithm, but for each line, it's really O(screenWidth/averageCharacterWidth) => O(1). Still, use a StringBuffer to build your string!
