I got it... Since I was doing everything from inside an admin page, the header was fired up before the wp_redirect() as it was explained in the question. So I ended up making a new function at the top: add_action('admin_init','redirect_to'); function redirect_to() { if ( isset($_REQUEST['action']) && 'adduser' == $_REQUEST['action'] ) { wp_redirect($redirect); die(); } } } That is making sure that the redirect_to() function will be fired up before the header (on admin_init). Maybe not the most elegant solution, but it works perfect.
