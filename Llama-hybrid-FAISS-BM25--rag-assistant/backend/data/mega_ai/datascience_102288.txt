Generate max likelyhood masks in numpy

We have several "in_arrays" like in_1=np.array([0.4,0.7,0.8,0.3]) in_2=np.array([0.9,0.8,0.6,0.4]) I need to create two outputs like out_1=np.array([0,0,1,0]) out_2=np.array([1,1,0,0]) So, the given element of the output array is 1 if the value in the corresponding input array is greater than 0.5 AND the value in this position of this input array is greater than the values of other arrays in this position. What is the right way to do this? Update. This is clearly a data science question. This is needed to run voting between several predicted segmentation masks by several different models to assign the most likely type of object on the picture.
