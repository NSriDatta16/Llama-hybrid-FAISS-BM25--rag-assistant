Goodness of fit by Hosmer-Lemeshow test and ROC Curve for Logistic Regression not accompanying results conclusions

I am trying to perform Logistic regression on the sample data set. After its modeling, I tried to check its goodness of fit using the Hosmer Lemeshow test and found the p-value Please find the used dataset named "Urine Analysis Data" in the link: mytestdata In the Model 1: I cleaned the dataset to remove rows containing NA values, then modeled the dataset and implemented hoslem.test and to draw ROC Curve. In the Model 2: I tried further cleaning of dataset by removing the independent variables that are not of much significance, then modeled the dataset and implemented hoslem.test and to draw ROC Curve. But, the result dint changed. Here is the code: Urinedata I am expecting that if Hosmer lemeshow test is telling the model is not a good fit, then ROC curve should also have reflected the same. I am new to R. Please correct if am wrong somewhere in the above statement conceptually.
