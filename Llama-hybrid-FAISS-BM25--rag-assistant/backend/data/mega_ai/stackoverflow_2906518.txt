Seems like everyone missed another important reason. It's quite easy to write a embedded domain specific language (EDSL) for parsers which look a lot like (E)BNF in normal code. Parser combinators like Parsec are quite easy to write in functional languages using higher-order functions and function composition. Not only easier but very elegantly. Basically you represent the most simplest generic parsers as just functions and you have special operations (typically higher-order functions) which let you compose these primitive parsers into more complicated, more specific parsers for your grammar. This is not the only way to do parer frameworks of-course.
