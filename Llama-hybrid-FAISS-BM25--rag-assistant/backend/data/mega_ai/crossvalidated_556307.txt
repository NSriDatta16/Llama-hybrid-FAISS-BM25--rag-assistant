Artificial Intelligence is the greater area, a field of knowledge. Machine Learning is a sub-field that consists of, for example, several techniques such as supervised and unsupervised methods. In supervised learning, one famous approach is called artificial neural networks. An artificial neural network with a certain set of characteristics is called a deep neural network. It's a bit strange that deep learning became such a buzzword, like machine learning, which indeed makes it a bit confusing. One possible reason for the emergence of such a buzzword is that the feasibility to train deep neural networks allowed the field of machine learning, and even AI in general, to solve many problems that before seemed very hard. Some people today refer to them as low-hanging fruits, but most people agreed they were not trivial at all in the past. So deep learning in a way became this area of knowledge around these types of neural networks which gave origin to a whole ecosystem with a lot of active researchers.
