What is the difference between Statistics and Data Science?

I am not really a newbie in statistics, but I ain't an expert either. I have always been wondering what exactly is the difference between Statistics and Data Science and for that matter, how is a statistician different from a data scientist? My understanding is that these are both interchangeable terms and that there aren't really any notable differences between them.
