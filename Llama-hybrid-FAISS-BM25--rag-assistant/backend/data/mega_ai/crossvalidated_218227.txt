Yes, it probably does mean that the last variable will have a higher impact (I write "probably", as it depends on the magnitude of the the loadings and the standard deviation of the original variables). The way to achieve your requirement of "equal representation for all variables in my final score" is most readily met by standardizing each of the variables (e.g., dividing each by its standard deviation) and then summing them. But, by doing PCA you are implicitly saying that you do not want to have each variable have the same impact, and are instead trying to ensure that each of three dimensions in the underlying dimensional space are equally represented. To add some more complication: a three component solution only explaining 62% of the variance of 8 variables is not a strong fit, so some of your loadings are probably pretty poor, making the whole analysis a but suspect.
