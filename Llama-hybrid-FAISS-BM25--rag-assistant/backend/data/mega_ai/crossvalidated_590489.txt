You can use the market basket analysis , a simple and popular data mining technique that does exactly what you described: groups co-occurring items together. For a more sophisticated solution, you can use cluster analysis. For binary data, there is a rich family of models called latent class analysis that are designed for this purpose. I'm not sure though if it would scale to a large dataset with many columns and rows like yours. You could transform the binary data into embeddings that would reduce its dimensionality and convert it into continuous features that later could be clustered, which makes it a simpler problem. For creating the embeddings, you could use a neural network or take one of the latent matrices created by matrix factorization (an algorithm used usually for recommender systems), where both scale very well to large data. They will create continuous features, so you can cluster them with any algorithm, e.g. $k$ -means.
