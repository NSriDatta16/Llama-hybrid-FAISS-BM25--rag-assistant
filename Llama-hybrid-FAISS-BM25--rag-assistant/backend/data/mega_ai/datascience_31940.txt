How to draw convolutional neural network diagrams?

I have to draw a CNN diagram similar to this: I tried all the tools mentioned in https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/14900 , but there is no easy way to do it. Is there any automated way to do it? Or do I have to do it manually. In addition, is it possible to draw this?: I found http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/LeNet.html , however, in this the input to each layer is assumed to be a perfect square. Thus, I cannot draw above diagram.
