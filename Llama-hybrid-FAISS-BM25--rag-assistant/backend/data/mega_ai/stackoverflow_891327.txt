TreeMap construtor

I'm having some problems with TreeMap constructors. I have a class with 2 TreeMap inside it. A tree sorted by name and another sorted by number.(Client class : String name, int number, ...) private TreeMap nameTree; private TreeMap numberTree; How do I build the constructors for this class? So far I wrote this: public ManagerTreeMap(){ nameTree = new TreeMap (new StringComparator()); numberTree = new TreeMap (new IntegerComparator()); } My major problem is the construtor "TreeMap(Comparator c)". Can i write two comparators? if not what do I have to do? public ManagerTreeMap(Comparator cp){ nameTree = new TreeMap (cp); } public ManagerTreeMap(Comparator cpt){ nameTree = new TreeMap (cpt); }
