I've just hit exactly the same symptoms using ASP.Net 4, MVC 3, the Razor view engine and multiple dynamically generated chart controls on the same page (via multiple partial views). The solution that I arrived at was to explicitly set the Id values of the different chart controls to be sure that they were different. In my case the relevant code fragment (from inside a view) is var chart = new System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting.Chart(); chart.ClientIDMode = ClientIDMode.Static; chart.ID = "Chart" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N"); Your code will presumably differ if you're working with a non-MVC aspx page, but I hope this is sufficient to give you a start. The important thing is to be sure that the control Ids are different for the different chart controls on the same page (hence my rather brutal use of Guids). Take a look at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.control.clientidmode.aspx for alternative control ID generation strategies - my example above is not the only way to go.
