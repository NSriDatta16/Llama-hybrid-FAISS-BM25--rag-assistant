Have to say the question I asked could be easy googled, and I have already investigated it. But I want to contribute to StackOverflow community a solution which is the simplest if you are writing a client validation function for a ASP.NET page. It's known what RequiredFieldValidator also trims spaces of a string to be checked. If you look into the source of ScriptResource.axd file associated with your application, you can find this function RequiredFieldValidatorEvaluateIsValid(val) { return (ValidatorTrim(ValidatorGetValue(val.controltovalidate)) != ValidatorTrim(val.initialvalue)) } and more interesting this function ValidatorTrim(s) { var m = s.match(/^\s*(\S+(\s+\S+)*)\s*$/); return (m == null) ? "" : m[1]; } code fragments. So, you shouldn't rewrite trim function from the scratch, you already have it and can use it.
