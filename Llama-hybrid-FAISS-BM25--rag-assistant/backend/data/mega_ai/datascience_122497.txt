Multiple CSV files input for hugging face table question-answering in Python

I am trying to write a code in HuggingFace Python to input multiple CSV files and feed them to the tokenizer for table question-answering. If I were to input only one CSV file, the code would look like this: from transformers import pipeline import pandas as pd prepare table + question data = {"Actors": ["Brad Pitt", "Leonardo Di Caprio", "George Clooney"], "Number of movies": ["87", "53", "69"]} table = pd.read_csv("csv_file_1.csv") question = "how many movies does Leonardo Di Caprio have?" pipeline model Note: you must to install torch-scatter first. tqa = pipeline(task="table-question-answering", model="google/tapas-large-finetuned-wtq") result print(tqa(table=table, query=query)['cells'][0]) #53 If there were more than just one csv file, how would we define table? I tried loading multiple csv files through load_dataset and store it in variable dataset, then tried: table = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(dataset) OR table = dataset but none of these approached worked
