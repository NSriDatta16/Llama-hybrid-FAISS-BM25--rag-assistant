When comparing two independent samples, you want to rank all the data together. Revising your example: Sample A value rank 20 7.5 20 7.5 20 7.5 20 7.5 25 10 and Sample B value rank 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 What is going on? Sample B's value of 1 is the lowest ordered value from both samples , so it gets a rank of 1. Similarly for Sample B's values of 2â€“5. The mean rank for Sample B is therefore $\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5}=2.5$ . Sample A's values of 20, 20, 20, and 20 occupy the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th ranks together, so they each get the average rank of $\frac{6+7+8+9}{4\text{ rank positions}}=7.5$ . Finally, Sample A's value of 10 is the largest value from both samples so it gets the highest rank 10. The mean rank for Sample A is therefore $\frac{7.5+7.5+7.5+7.5+10}{5}=8$ . Bonus: To be super explicit: No. The mean ranks of two independent samples of the same $\boldsymbol{N}$ will not necessarily have the same mean ranks.
