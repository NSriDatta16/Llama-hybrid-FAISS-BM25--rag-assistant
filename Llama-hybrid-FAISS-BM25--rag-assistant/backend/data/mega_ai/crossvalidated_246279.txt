I have blogged about detecting structural break using the strucchange package in R. It is pretty straight forward - here's the outline: # assuming you have a 'ts' object in R # 1. install package 'strucchange' # 2. Then write down this code: library(strucchange) # store the breakdates bp_ts The time series data used in my blog happens to be an ARIMA(0,1,1) process. If you want to verify that, check my Github repo regarding the same.
