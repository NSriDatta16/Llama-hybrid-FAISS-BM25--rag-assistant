Div that should take up the "rest of the page" expands beyond the page in ie

Okay, this is REALLY starting to bug me... This page works fine in both Chrome and Firefox. www.bloggan.tk But if it's opened in internet-explorer it always expands beyond the page and introduces the scrollbar no matter what the resolution of the browser is. I have NO idea what change in the html it was that cause this... Here's the blogger-template-html-source I'd REALLY appreciate if someone could help me with this. Thanks in advance! Edit: I've "solved" it for IE using javascript, but that's only temporary (i hope). The version without javascript can be seen here , so that you still will be able to know what I'm talking about. Still trying to solve it, and still hoping for someone to help me.
