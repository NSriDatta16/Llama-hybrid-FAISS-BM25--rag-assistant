SQL CLR and .NET 4.0

I know SQL 2008 doesn't support .NET 4.0. I have several assemblies, all compiled for .NET 4.0. I need a SQL trigger to kick off a routine in one of these assemblies. Is there any way (without getting WCF or other forms of inter-process communication involved). to get the SQL CLR to kick off this routine? Maybe I could have a 2.0 targeted assembly that kicks off the 4.0 code somehow? I know that .NET 4.0 allows multiple runtime versions to be hosted in the same process, but I'm not sure how I might leverage this. As a fallback, I could use a COM wrapper to kick off the .NET 4.0 code...but I'd prefer not to.
