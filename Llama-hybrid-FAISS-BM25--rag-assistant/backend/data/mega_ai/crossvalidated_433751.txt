A possibly simpler approach to a full-blown stochastic process would be to use standard time series forecasting tools. Bin your events in an appropriate time granularity, e.g., in hourly buckets, or even in 5-hour buckets. Then use a standard forecasting algorithm, such as exponential smoothing. I very much recommend this open online textbook . Be aware that even the best prediction models may not reach the level of accuracy you would like to see. How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? may be helpful.
