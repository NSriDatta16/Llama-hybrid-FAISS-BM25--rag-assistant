Question regarding irreducibility, recurrency and aperiodicity of a finite Markov chain

I'd like to know if the follow markov chain is irreducible, recurrent and aperiodic. I try to proof it but I'm not sure if I'm right. The transition matrix of my Markov Chain is: Look my attempts: 1-Irreducibility: If a markov chain is irreductible so all states comunicate to each other that's there exists a $n$ such that $P_{ij}^n>0$ and a $m$ such that $P_{ji}^m>0$ for all $i,j$ . (We can have a $n,m$ depending which states we are looking at but I liked to make the notation easier.) I went in R and I've powered $\mathbf{P}$ to 1000. Since all elements are greater than zero so it seems enough to take $n=1000$ for the chain to be irreducible. 2-Recurrency: As that's a finite markov chain so there exist at least one state which is recurrent but by its supposed irreducibility, all states are recurrent. 3-Aperiodicity: I don't have any clue how proof it by its classic definition: If $i$ has period $d$ so $P_{ii}^n=0$ whenever $n$ is not divisible by $d$ and $d$ is the greatest integer with such property.
