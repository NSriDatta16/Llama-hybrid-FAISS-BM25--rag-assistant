Building resultset using collection object

I had an issue in building the resultset using Java. I am storing a collection object which is organized as row wise taken from a resultset object and putting the collection object (which is stored as vector/array list) in cache and trying to retrieve the same collection object. Here I need to build back the resultset again using the collection object. Now my doubt is building the resultset in this way possible or not?
