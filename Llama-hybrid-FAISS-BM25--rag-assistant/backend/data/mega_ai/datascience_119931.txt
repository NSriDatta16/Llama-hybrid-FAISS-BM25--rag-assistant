SBERT Embeddings from Conversations

I have a dataset consisting of text-based conversations between two humans. One conversation has on average 20 turns and can look as follows: Person 1: Do you like cooking? Person 2: Yes. I like cooking very much. I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold. Person 1: Why do you like it? Person 2: I have no idea. I like cooking by myself. I like to taste delicious food. ... With SBERT I can get the embeddings of one turn (e.g., "Hello there, how are you doing?"). Is it also possible to get one embedding with SBERT for several turns or a whole conversation (20 turns)? Are there other models which are capable to do this or are more recent? Afterward, I would like to project the embedding to 2D or 3D space and apply clustering.
