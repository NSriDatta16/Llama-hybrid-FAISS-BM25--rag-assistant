Actually, there is a variant on the Singleton called Multiton or Multiplton or something like that. Rather than having one instance, you have n instances where n is a specific value. I'm not sure if the Gang of Four describe this application in their book, but I learned about it in my Software Engineering 361 class. But if you have an unconstrained number of instances, I don't think there is a name for it.
