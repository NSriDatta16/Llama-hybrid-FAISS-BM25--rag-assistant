Is a dynamic ConfigurationSection possible in a simple manner?

In .NET 1.0, IConfigurationSectionHandler offered a clean, single method interface to implementing a configuration handler. In .NET 2, ConfigurationSection came along, a great lumbering beast of complexity and static type enforcement, waving a banner proclaiming "Unknown evils will happen if you use IConfigurationSectionHandler!". Being the rebel that I am, trying to shoehorn a plugin architecture into a ancient, static framework like .NET 2, I want a dynamic configuration section. Nothing static, just a nice tree of XML nodes or nested key/value pairs. Something that plugins can access without defining fragile serialization code. Like XML was originally intended for, before it became the harbinger of fragile catch-22 web.config horrors and painful boilerplate serialization trees. Is there any way I can just get an XMLElement instance, or XMLReader, please?
