Custom Web Control - ParseChildren & Resource Objects

I hope someone can help me. I have the following custom server control: [ParseChildren(true)] public class MyControl : WebControl, INamingContainer { [PersistenceMode(PersistenceMode.InnerProperty)] public string MyProperty { get;set; } } It works perfectly with the following mark-up: Test String But if I try to localise the property string, I get a parse error: Even if I cast the type, ASP.NET indicates that the property cannot accept controls as children. How should the expression look like if I want to localise it? I can make the property accessible as an attribute of the control's tag, but I prefer the mark-up above, it looks more elegant and clean. Thanks
