No. A TSVM is an extension of the SVM and is used in semi-supervised learning scenarios (that is, not all the data is labelled, as you pointed out, but for both the train and the test set, meaning that an unlabeled instance, once labeled, may be used in refining the model). You can find some technical information at On Transductive Support Vector Machines by Junhui Wang, Xiaotong Shen, and Wei Pan The process you are describing follows the idea of granule computing. From the Wikipedia page : "information granules are collections of entities that usually originate at the numeric level and are arranged together due to their similarity, functional or physical adjacency, indistinguishability, coherency, or the like." Grouping data by similarity is the clustering process you are describing.
