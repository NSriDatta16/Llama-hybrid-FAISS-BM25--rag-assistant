Some TCP implementations also determine the MTU and size their segments to avoid fragmentation as well. Doing so improves reliability under lossy conditions, as any TCP segment that is received can be acknowledged and not retransmitted. Only lost TCP segments are retransmitted. In contrast, if any IP datagram fragment is lost, then no useful information is received.
