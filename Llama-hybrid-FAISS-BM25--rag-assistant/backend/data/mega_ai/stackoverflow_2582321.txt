what does process geometry mean?

from ARM DDI 01001, there is a term: process geometry, does it mean the chip size? Caches and write buffers to improve average system performance are now commonplace in ARMÂ® memory systems. Core clock rates have increased at a faster rate than memory access times over recent years. This factor, and smaller process geometries , the economics of on-chip memory, and system power constraints have encouraged the use of caches to meet growing system demands. thanks.
