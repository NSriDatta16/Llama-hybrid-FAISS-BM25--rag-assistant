Registers are fast because most of the registers are connected directly to most of the functional units. While a program is loading one register, another register is feeding the ALU and yet another register is writing a result from some other functional unit. Registers are made with logic elements such as flip-flops, so that most of the values from most of the registers are all available at the same time, all the time. This is different from a memory where only a selected address is available at any one time and only a very limited number of read ports is available. Typically, it's just one read circuit. However this kind of implementation and interconnection is what uses up the die space on the microprocessor. When that is used up, you start adding memory for additional storage. There have been architectures with extra banks of registers. ( SPARC !)
