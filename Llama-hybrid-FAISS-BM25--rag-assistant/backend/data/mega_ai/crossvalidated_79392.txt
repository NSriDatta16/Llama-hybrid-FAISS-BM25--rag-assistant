I think this is correct. (1|Tree/Organ/Sample) expands to/is equivalent to (1|Tree)+(1|Tree:Organ)+(1|Tree:Organ:Sample) (where : denotes an interaction). The fixed factors Treatment , Organ and Tissue automatically get handled at the correct level. You should probably include Site as a fixed effect (conceptually it's a random effect, but it's not practical to try to estimate among-site variance with only two sites); this will reduce the among-tree variance slightly. You should probably include all the data within a data frame, and pass this explicitly to lmer via a data=my.data.frame argument. You may find the glmm FAQ helpful (it's focused on GLMMs but does have stuff relevant to linear mixed models as well).
