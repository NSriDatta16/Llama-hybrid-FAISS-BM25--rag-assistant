Jquery Drag and Drop problem, jump to a new page

I want to use Jquery to implement a page that contains js from quotemedia.com. After I embed the js into the sortable, when I drag and drop the element that contains the js, it jump to full page display. This happens under Firefox, IE is ok. The running code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/dodoflying/9BkJ5/ Please use firefox to drag and drop element shopping to see the problem. Is is a bug under firefox? How could I solve this problem? Thanks in advance! Don
