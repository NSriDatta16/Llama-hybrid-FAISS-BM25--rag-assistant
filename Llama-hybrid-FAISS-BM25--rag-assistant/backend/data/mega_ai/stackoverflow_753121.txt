Error on defining an array even though its set via a Constant

I know this is really basic, but its got me stumped... In Objective-C I'm trying to write: const int BUF_SIZE = 3; static char buffer[BUF_SIZE+1]; But I get a storage size of buffer isn't constant. How do I make Xcode realise that I'm setting it to a constant, + 1...? Or is this not possible...? Thanks...! Joel
