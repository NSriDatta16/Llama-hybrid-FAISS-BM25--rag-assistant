Add recevied data to existing receive buffer in MPI_SendRecv

I am trying to send data(forces) across 2 processes, using MPI_SendRecv . Usually the data will be over written in the received buffer, I do not want to overwrite the data in the received buffer instead I want to add the data it received. I can do the following. Store the data in the previous time step to a different array and then add it after receiving. But I have huge number of nodes and I do not want to have memory allocated for its storage every time step. (or overwrite the same) My question is there a way to add the received data directly to the buffer and store it in the received memory using MPI? Any help in this direction would be really thankful. I am sure collective communication calls (MPI Reduce)cannot be worked out here. Are there any other commands that can do this?
