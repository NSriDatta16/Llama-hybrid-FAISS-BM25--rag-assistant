I've only just thought of this. Honestly it wasn't in my head when I began asking the question. It may be to protect the developer of a flash file. Assuming someone didn't have the technical know how to decompile a flash file, and its data requests where hard coded. Lifting that flash file of the public webserver and placing on your own web server effectively renders that flash ineffective. If that is the case all requests made by a flash file should use the fully qualified requests. I.e. not relative requests. Dunno if that's what they were thinking or not.
