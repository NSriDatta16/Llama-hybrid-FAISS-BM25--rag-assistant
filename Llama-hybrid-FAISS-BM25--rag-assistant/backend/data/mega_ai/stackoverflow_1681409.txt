It should be pretty easy to transform the results from debugancestor into a yes or a no (but there's definitely no built-in way to do that; write a script already!). Be aware that the answer might be wrong if the branch has more than one branch head, though. (Writing an extension to add a command to do this should also be nigh-trivial, BTW.)
