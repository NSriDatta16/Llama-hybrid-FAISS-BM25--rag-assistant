Sample from Gaussian Process across 2D

This seems like a straightforward questions; my apologies if it is already answered (I have looked). Problem : I would like to sample from a Gaussian Process (GP) prior over X and Y coordinates (e.g. Lat, Lon). I would then like to fit data points on these two dimensions. I would like to use the analytical form as opposed to MCMC and compute it in R. Examples : David Duvenaud's Kernel Cookbook describes the multidimensional product kernel and illustrates a sample from the prior (below). The PDF of his thesis also illustrates data fitted to this kernel. Code : For the 1-dimensional case; in R I am computing a basic squared exponential (aka RBF, Gaussian, etc...) kernel on the index x.star and pulling samples from multivariate normal with mean zero and sigma sigma . (code based on James Keirstead example) require("MASS") require("plyr") require("reshape2") require("ggplot2") set.seed(12345) # a covariance matrix calcSigma I am then using the below form to extract posterior samples with noise: I would like to be able to samples across and X and Y coordinates from a product squared exponential kernel. Thank you for your time.
