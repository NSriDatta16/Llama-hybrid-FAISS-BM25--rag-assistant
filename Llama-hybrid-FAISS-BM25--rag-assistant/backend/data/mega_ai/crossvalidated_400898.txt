stationary vs. non-stationary GARCH process

I estimated a GARCH(1,1) model and the sum of the ARCH paramter alpha and GARCH paramter beta equals 1.7. This points to an undefined unconditional variance and it follows that the conditional variance is a non-stationary and explosive process (Cuthbertson and Nitzsche, 2004). However, Groenendijk et al. (1995) argue that the conditional variance process is still stationary, though not covariance-stationary. Now, I am wondering what is meant by stationary. I assumed that stationarity (strict stationarity) implies covariance-stationarity (weak stationarity). And besides, which implications has a stationary conditional variance as opposed to a non-stationary conditional variance in this context? Any help would be much appreciated!!!
