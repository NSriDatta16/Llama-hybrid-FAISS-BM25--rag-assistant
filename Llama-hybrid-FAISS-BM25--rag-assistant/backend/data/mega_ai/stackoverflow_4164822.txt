I used to met this problem, which is caused by mounted disk: subst R: C:\Source\ Test.cpp: #include "C:\Source\PluginLoader.h" #include "R:\PluginLoader.h" Now if you include guard is #pragma once, the compiler is not smart enough to know that they are actual one file, thus cause the redefinition error. However, I am not sure whether this is your problem, as it depends on: You include from both virtual disk, and physical disk Your include guard is #pragma once, not the macro guard .
