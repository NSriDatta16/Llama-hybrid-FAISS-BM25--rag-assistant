While not knowing what your predictors are, it works out that multi-instrument (and multi-market) models usually perform much better on out-of-bag (out-of-training) data. See the software package called VantagePoint , which uses separate prediction models (neural networks, not too far from SVM) for the 2-day lagged data, 5-day lagged data, and 10-day lagged data - and then determines which time-frame is the most dependable. Most of their models use data/indices from other markets and exchanges. Another issue for stock price prediction is that many of the days or epochs of time you are using are redundant, so you may not need 1700 records or 122 predictors. Thus, you might use PCA on both the days and the 122 predictors to reduce the dimensions (decorrelate/denoise). Jurik Research sells a module known as DDR (decorrelator, dimension reducer) which can perform two-way PCA on time and features for financial data.
