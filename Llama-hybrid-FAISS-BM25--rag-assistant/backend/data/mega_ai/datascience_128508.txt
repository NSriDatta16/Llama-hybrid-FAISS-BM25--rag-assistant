You should not use shuffle for time series data as it will introduce lookahead bias. You can refer to below video as an example of how to do train test split for time series data. Tail should be test set, there are approaches to do cross validation too, but tail should always be test set in each iteration. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV12dGe_Fho
