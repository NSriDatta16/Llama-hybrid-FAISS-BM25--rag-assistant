While the USB protocol is fairly generic, the peripheral devices are really function specific and require some kind of device driver on the host to function properly. While a USB Flash Drive has a micro-controller on it, most USB storage devices follow a common protocol. That is why you don't have to install a different device driver for every drive you plug into windows. I'm pretty sure that the mass storage protocol does not have a "Turn LED on" message :) And while the company that implemented the USB drive might actually have a special command to do that (maybe for debugging), I would doubt it would be published. While I'm no guru on Windows, I believe that in order for you to access the USB stack directly, you would have to write your own device driver and plug load it in the kernel. Can you imagine if a regular application could send the "format everything" command to an arbitrary USB device.
