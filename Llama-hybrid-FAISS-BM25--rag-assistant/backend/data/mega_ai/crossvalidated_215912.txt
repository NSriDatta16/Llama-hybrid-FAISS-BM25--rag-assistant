First look at the plot of your time series data to have an idea about break point. If there seems to be a single structural break (also require literature support), you can test it by using ' Chow breakpoint test ' and if there seems to be multiple structural breaks (also require literature support), you can test the exact breakpoint by using ' Bai-Perron muliple breakpoint test '. In Eviews, the following steps can be followed: Select data - view - graph - basic graph - line & symbol - OK Visualize, if there is any break point. At what time is it present (rough estimate) quick - estimate equation - enter your equation - Ok View - stability diagnostic - Chow breakpoint test (if single break) - enter date (which you've taken from graph) - click ok - interpret the result View - stability diagnostic - multiple breakpoint test (if more than one break) - select method, maximum breaks(which you've taken from graph), trimming % and sig level as per your requirement - click ok - interpret the result
