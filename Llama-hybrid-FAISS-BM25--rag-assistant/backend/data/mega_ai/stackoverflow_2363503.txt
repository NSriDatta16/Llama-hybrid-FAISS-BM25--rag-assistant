I believe you will need to use a B-tree rather than a hash table. Hash tables do not have good locality for secondary storage, so you will lose too much time to disk I/O. Most databases -- relational or not -- implement their indexes as a B-tree, so you are talking about the equivalent of storing an index with no other data attached to it. Will you have multiple processes concurrently updating this data store?
