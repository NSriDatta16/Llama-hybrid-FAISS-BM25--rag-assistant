The algebraic equivalence of two expressions for Cook's distance

I have read several times across different sources now that the definition of Cook's Distance, which is $$D_i=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n(\hat{y}_j-\hat{y}_{j(i)})^2}{ps^2}$$ (where $\hat{y}_j$ is the jth fitted response value, $\hat{y}_{j(i)}$ the jth fitted response value, where the fit does not include observation i, $p$ the number of coefficients in the model, $s^2$ the MSE) is algebraically equivalent to the expression $$\frac{r_i^2}{ps^2}\frac{h_{ii}}{(1-h_{ii})^2}$$ For $r_i$ the ith residual, $h_{ii}$ the ith leverage value. Despite numerous sources stating this (lecture notes from different universities, wikipedia, Matlab's website, etc.), I have not been able to find a single proof of this. I would very much appreciate it if someone could direct me to one such proof. It seems like a completely non-trivial equivalence to me, and I am unsure why it's so difficult to find a proof of this.
