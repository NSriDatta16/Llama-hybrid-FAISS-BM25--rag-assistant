How to get wordpress plugin "Twitter hash" to show on page

I cannot for my life figure out how to get the downloaded plugin Twitter hash (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-hash-tag-widget/) to show on my index.php page. Read about it and this HTML code was given as an example in many places: Site One Name But obviously all it does is a HTML list so it shows nothing of how to connect to the widget I have. I also added the file functions.php with the following lines: and dragged the widget to its place on the wordpress widget page. All help appreciated for a very new wordpress user! //Margareta
