One way to do it is through classification. You need a binary output, which is exactly what classification algorithms can provide. You can construct a data-set out of this time series. Assume you have $n$ values right now. Further assume that you think the value in $n+1$ can be determined based on the $t$ last values between $n$ and $n-t+1$. Like this, you have $n-t+1$ observations (all except the first few in the time-series because there would not be enough lag observations for them) with $t$ binary variables each (all ordered in the same way starting from the then current value towards the lag values). You can construct all sorts of classifiers based on this data-set, compare their performance and choose the best one to predict. $t$ is a parameter to be tuned. This will always be a high risk forecast though. Since you basically want to forecast only one number which can only have two values. Per definition, this is going to be all or nothing. If the costs associated with falsely predicting a 0 are different from the costs of falsely predicting a 1, you can reflect that and bias your algorithm towards predicting more readily the value that would be more expensive to miss.
