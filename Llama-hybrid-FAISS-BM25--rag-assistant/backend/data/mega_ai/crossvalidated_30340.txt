If you want to take a different approach to when the CLT does not apply, you could focus on the method of sampling rather than the distribution being sampled from. This approach could either impress your professor or violate the rules of the assignment (so read the assignment carefully). The CLT mainly applies to an SRS (simple random sample) and some other similar cases. But, what we often skip over in the intro classes (and later classes) is what happens with other sampling schemes. For example consider doing a random-digit-dialing sample for a phone interview where one of the variables we are interested in is household income, since higher income households are also likely to have more phone numbers on average this will be a biased sample (unless you use a weighted mean). So you could demonstrate sampling from a normal population (or other distribution), but with the probability of being in the sample related to the outcome of interest, then show how the unweighted mean and weighted mean behave. You could also look at cluster sampling or stratified sampling or other forms of sampling and show how the parameter estimates behave under a naive approach compared to the proper approach.
