The actionscript3.tmbundle comes with a pretty extensive help. Here is the paragraph on documentation: Documentation is not included with the SDK so has to be installed separately for the documentation command to work. You can download it from this page, or directly as a zip file . Once downloaded please rename the unzipped directory " docs " and place it in your Flex SDK directory. I was about to say that it doesn't support the Flex4 documentation but I noticed the author made some changes related to the documentation 12 hours ago, soâ€¦ maybe you should try with the very latest version of the bundle. I have these shell variables: TM_FLEX_PATH = /Developer/SDKs/flex_sdk_4.1.0.16076 TM_FLEX_BACKGROUND_TERMINAL = true TM_FLEX_USE_FCSH = true
