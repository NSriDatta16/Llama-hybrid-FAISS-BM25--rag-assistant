AUC is area under curve plotted on 1-specificity(x axis) against sensitivity on y axis. So for AUC there is a trade-off between accuracy versus the error you are willing to make. The left corner of the curve where we have the maximum sensitivity and least specificity. So intuitively, if you take the average of accuracy versus error it is most likely to resemble the AUC.
