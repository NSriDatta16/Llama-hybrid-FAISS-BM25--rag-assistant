I think the most important thing is to have useful messages in plain (layman-readable) language. "Do you want to tech the tech tech" is not helpful. Also, make your messages match the style of the rest of the application, and look different from every other box that impedes the user's productivity. This goes against the usual rule of making your application look familiar to the user, but if you want them to read the message, it has to look different. If you can avoid using a modal dialog box, do so. This will make the times that you need to use one seem more important. Always bring focus to the item that needs attention, when appropriate. For example, if you are doing some sort of field validation, give focus to the offending field.
