You should give ropes a try. The site is skimpy on details, but there's a great article here with a better description and some good benchmarks comparing append performance . I haven't actually used the ropes package, haven't had a good enough excuse to. Looks promising, though. Edit: Additional benchmark info I downloaded the PerformanceTest class from the ropes article, and added tests for StringBuilder in addition to StringBuffer . The performance improvement of StringBuilder seems negligible. I downloaded the test code from the ropes article and changed the test to include StringBuilder and StringBuffer . Append plan length: 260 [StringBuilder] Average= 117,146,000 ns Median= 114,717,000ns [StringBuffer] Average= 117,624,400 ns Median= 115,552,000ns [Rope] Average= 484,600 ns Median= 483,000ns Append plan length: 300 [StringBuilder] Average= 178,329,000 ns Median= 178,009,000ns [StringBuffer] Average= 217,147,800 ns Median= 216,819,000ns [Rope] Average= 252,800 ns Median= 253,000ns Append plan length: 500 [StringBuilder] Average= 221,356,200 ns Median= 214,435,000ns [StringBuffer] Average= 227,432,200 ns Median= 219,650,000ns [Rope] Average= 510,000 ns Median= 507,000ns The difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer isn't that great. For the task at hand, Ropes seem like a clear win here.
