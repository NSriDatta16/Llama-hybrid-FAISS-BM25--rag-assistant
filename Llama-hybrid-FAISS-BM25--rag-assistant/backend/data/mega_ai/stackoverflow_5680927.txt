As fun as it was to pull the dividers around and see how that sample behaves, I did not experience any flickering issues. Possible explanations: Processor speed - I run a fast processor, some others may not be able to keep up with the required number of redraws. You may also be working with more complex components that are more difficult to draw than solid colors. Mouse events may be getting dispatched/handled multiple times in the components you are using. I did experience some divider 'twitching' when moving the bars occasionally. The is most likely due to the multiple layout computations necessary to compute the correct widths of each divided box based on percentages, every time a divider moves just a pixel. Edit: Run this and move the dividers to get an idea of how many resizes/redraws are occurring due to using livedragging:. 0 It quickly gets into the hundreds... then thousands...
