Market researcher looking for book recommendation

As a market researcher I am frequently around discussions on multivariate techniques, regressions (linear and logistic), working with survey data, choice based designs, weighting data and occasionally Bayesian analyses. Is anyone aware of a good book or few books that will take me from surface level knowledge deeper into the weeds? My current level of knowledge around statistics is fairly limited, I understand distributions, concepts of regressions, variance, p-values, etc. but would like to see if there are some structured options that explain things clearly/
