You can fit a model and use it to predict the probability of any given instance to be $1$ , conditional on your predictor value. As you write, one possible model is a logistic regression. Note that the effect of increasing the predictor by 50%, or by any other increment, will depend on what you increase the value from . Here is some R code that illustrates this (note the type="response" part in the predict() s that ensure we gat probability predictions): set.seed(1) xx If you can now assume that your instances are independent, you can calculate the expected number of $y=1$ for each predictor value. Or use the binomial distribution to get a handle on the entire distribution of the number of $1$ s for a constant predictor value, or possibly generalizations of the binomial for different probabilities coming from different predictor values .
