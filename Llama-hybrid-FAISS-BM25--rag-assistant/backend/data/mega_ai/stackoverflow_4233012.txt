If you have a look at How to post data in PHP using file_get_contents? you probably get what you need. (I guess you would need to do the same post as when you log in and continue the session from there) Edit (as response to question below) In the first request the client will respond with some cookie after the login. This cookie must you set as a header in the second request. If you get 500 errors it might be that the server is rejecting your request as you do not send sufficient headers to it. It's not uncommon to reject you. Try the following: $opts = array('http' => array('method' => 'Get', 'Header' => "Host: www.someserver.com\r\n". "User-Agent: Mozilla\r\n", 'user_agent' => 'Mozilla')); $context = stream_context_create($opts); $fp = fopen('http://www.someserver.no', 'r', false, $context); fpassthru($fp); fclose($fp); ... what headers that you might need to set will vary from server to server.
