I guess the problem assumes that you'll use the exponential distribution for the waiting time, P(next tram time > t) = 1/(average time) * exp(-t / average time). This is equivalent to saying that tram arrival times follow Poisson process. And then use a memory-less quality of the exponential distribution which is P(next tram time T > a + b | T > a) = P(T > b), i.e. if a tram did not arrive by time a, probability to wait for another b minutes is the same as it was at the beginning. In survival processes exponential distribution is used for a constant hazard - the probability of a tram to arrive at each particular time is the same and does not depend on how much time it was from the last one. In your problem terms, if a student comes at a random time, independent from T, the waiting time distribution will be the same as if a person arrived right after the last tram, and expected to wait the full 7.5 minutes. Intuitively, if the trams come exactly every 7.5mins, a student will on average wait for 7.5/2 minutes, but as they come randomly and there will be times when the waiting time is long, the average waiting time may be quite long - in case of poisson/exponential distribution, the residual waiting time is at par with non-shifted expected time, however Weibull distribution for example will yield different results, you'd need to use jbowman's density approach to find what it is.
