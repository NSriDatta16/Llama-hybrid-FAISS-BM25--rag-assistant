I do not know of a Wilcoxon signed-rank test modification that allows stratification. But I would encourage you to think of this as an estimation problem rather than a hypothesis testing problem. I find it natural to use $U$ -statistics based on all possible relevant pairs of measurements, to estimate the mean absolute discrepency between raters. You can use the bootstrap to get confidence intervals for same. Details are in Chapter 16 of BBR .
