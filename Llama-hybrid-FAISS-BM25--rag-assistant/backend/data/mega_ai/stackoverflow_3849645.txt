C++ isn't a very popular choice for web applications - probably because it's too easy to leave security holes, and development time tends to be a lot slower than for the scripting languages. Dynamically typed scripting languages convert compile-time errors to runtime errors. Detecting those might not be as easy as reading through the compiler output. Scripting languages may be OK for quick-and-dirty simple projects. Beyond a certain level of complexity one needs strongly typed, well-structured languages. Such as C++, or Java. Most scripting languages encourage sloppy programming. As to the "security holes": if you refer to buffer overruns, allocation/deallocation errors, the answer is "STL". And proper training of course :-)
