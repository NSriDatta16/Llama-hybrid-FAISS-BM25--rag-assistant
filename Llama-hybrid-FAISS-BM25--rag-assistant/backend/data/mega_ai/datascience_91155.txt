How to aggregate features to a group level as a feature in machine learning model?

I am building a model to predict some behavior at a household level. I could roll up income or number of cars etc so that I can take everyone into consideration. But how can I roll up something like age? I don't know if it makes sense to add up ages or education. Is there a cleaver way to still use those features at a aggregated level?
