I will here try to answer the "why": You have decided to fit a linear model to your observations using OLS method, and with only one dependent variable you now have the slope, $\hat{\beta}$ , for that variable. Pay attention to the "hat", which means that $\hat{\beta}$ is just the sample estimate of the underlying (unknown) population slope, $\beta$ . From $\hat{\beta}$ you have quantified the linear relationship between the indpendent and the dependent variable in your sample , but you are probably interested in the linear relationship in the underlying population. (1) If the above conditions are met, you suddenly have knowledge about how $\hat{\beta}$ relates to $\beta$ , and you can quantify the uncertainty, usually done through a confidence interval (CI). A standard textbook will tell you how. If the above conditions are not met, the confidence interval calculation is not valid, and hence, your conclusions about the population is not valid. In summary, for a CI to be valid, you need to make sure that the conditions for that specific CI calculation are met. If the conditions are not met, there might be another CI calculation that fits the conditions that your observations actually meet, but maybe not. (2) There are other desirable properties of $\hat{\beta}$ that depends on the method of estimation and whether the various conditions are met. For example, $\hat{\beta}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\beta$ , meaning that the expected value of $\hat{\beta}$ is $\beta$ . It is also consistent and efficient, both desirable properties. To sum up: If none of the conditions are met, you only have a $\hat{\beta}$ but you don't know anything about its uncertainty and how it relates to $\beta$ . If all the conditions are met, you know that $\hat{\beta}$ is an unbiased, consistent and efficient estimator for $\beta$ , and you can quantify the uncertainty by calculating a CI.
