Best way to figure out why didReceiveMemoryWarning is always getting called on a UIViewController

I have a UIViewController and I'm noticing that I've done something to where the didReceiveMemoryWarning method is getting called every time I run it on an actual device. I've run the project with Run > Run With Performance Tool > Object Allocations (and Leaks also). There are no leaks but I have no idea how to read or understand the "Object Allocations" data that is displayed. So ... How do I read this information and what is/are the best ways to figure out (and resolve) why this is happening? Thanks EDIT: I should mention that I also have a number of 3rd party libraries/code that I've included in my project (e.g. Three20, MGTwitterEngine, FTUtils, extThree20JSON and Twitter+OAuth). Could this be causing this??? Or at least contributing to the problem? EDIT #2: Don't know if this helps but I notice that this is happening either everytime that I present a UIImagePickerController modally -OR- after a take a picture using it. * UPDATE * Ran it again with the Object Alloc tool for several minutes and I don't see anymore than 4.75MB being allocated at any given moment. The app was running on a device and typically with 2.5 MB allocated on average. Does this seem problematic to anyone??? Seems like its in an acceptable range insofar as I understand thing.
