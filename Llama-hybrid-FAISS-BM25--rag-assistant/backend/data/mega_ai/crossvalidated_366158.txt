Is the validation_mean_error of a trained neural network a sufficient indicator to choose a specific network over others?

I have trained a few different neural networks for a regression problem and now I am trying to evaluate which one is the best. Is it sufficient to look at the mean validation error of the NN to say that Network A is better than Network B and should therefore be chosen, or do I have to look at other metrics as well to be able to make such a decision?
