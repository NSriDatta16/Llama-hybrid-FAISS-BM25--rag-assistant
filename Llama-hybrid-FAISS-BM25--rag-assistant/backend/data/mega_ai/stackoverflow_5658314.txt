You can set up emulators with different sd card sizes, screen resolution, and os version, but still the variability of handsets is much larger (e.g., different frameworks, carriers locking options). Besides that, there are always those situations you did not think about . A phone running out of battery, or loosing signal, or rotating the screen (how did you test if your app handles that elegantly?) are just some of the situations I am thinking right now. There's also the android market rating issue : if your app goes untested and starts crashing in several phones, then you will be getting very bad ratings that will discourage further downloads (who will pay for an app with one or two stars?). So, in sum, the best option is not only test one, but test several different devices. Can you ask friends/family to install the apk? Update: I forgot the second part of the question. A quick search on google shopping returned me results for $80-120 for a used HTC G1 and $180 for a scratched Droid. You would be able to cover some ground with those two (two major vendors, different screens, ability to install several os versions on each).
