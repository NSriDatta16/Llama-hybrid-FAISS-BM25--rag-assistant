Just use a generic list of MeteoDataPoint whenever you need a list of them. Generics are found in System.Collections.Generic . You can find info on generic lists here . var list = new List (); To add additional methods, I would use extensions. public static class MeteoDataPointExtensions { // not really much point to this extension, but it demonstrates the idea public static double AverageTemp( this IEnumerable items ) { return items.Average( l => l.Temperature ); } } Updated to use IEnumerable instead of list to make it more applicable to different types of collections.
