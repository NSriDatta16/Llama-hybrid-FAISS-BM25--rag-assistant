It's not a general standard practice, but it may be a standard practive within a specific organisation. Using prefixes to specify usage of an identifier is called hungarian notation. It's mostly used to specify data types in script languages without strict typing, but the original intention was just to specify any aspect that was crucial to the use of the identifier. Using prefixes like that can be useful to make sure that classes intended for design doesn't conflict with classes intended for program control. It's however not dependant on who is creating the class, but how the class is used. If a developer creates a script that adds a class to elements to change their appearence, the class is used for design so it should not be prefixed as a program control class name. A class name used for program control would only be used for that, and have no visual style applied to it. As with most programming practices, it's more important that you pick a standard and stick to it, than picking the standard that is absolutely best.
