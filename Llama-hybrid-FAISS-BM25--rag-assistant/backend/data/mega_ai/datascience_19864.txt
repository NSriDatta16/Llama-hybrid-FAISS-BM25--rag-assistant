Try Datacamp It's a fantastic site with video tutorials and an online editor so you don't need to bother messing around installing an IDE and the right packages and getting them all to work, you can just work in your browser! They have lectures from industry leaders and professors, each short course is a nice bitesize chunk of 4 hours estimated including the interactive exercises. The best part is that because each course is only 4 hours long, you can pick and choose which ones are relevant to you, such as diving straight into machine learning if you already have a good python or R background, and finding out how to properly clean and prepare your data, or engineer new features. Good luck!
