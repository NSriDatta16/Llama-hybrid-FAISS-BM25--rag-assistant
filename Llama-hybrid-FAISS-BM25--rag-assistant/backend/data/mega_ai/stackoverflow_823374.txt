Here is the HTML, which should probably be inserted with JS, and the styles should be in an external stylesheet. I'm a modal Then, you could leverage jQuery to display it. $('a.modal').bind('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $('#modal').fadeIn(800); }); This is only a start, you'll want to learn from this and build upon it. For example, the script should check is(':hidden') and show, and if not then fadeOut(800) or similiar.
