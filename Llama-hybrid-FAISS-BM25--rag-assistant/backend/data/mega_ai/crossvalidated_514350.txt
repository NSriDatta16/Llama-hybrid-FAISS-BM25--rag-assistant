As always, begin by drawing a picture. The answer is immediate just by glancing at this figure and requires almost no calculation. I will explain--but the explanation takes much longer than finding the answer! Because $(X,Y)$ has a uniform distribution, the value of the CDF at any height $z=\min(x,y,1-y,1-x,|x-y|,1-|x-y|)$ is proportional to the area of the points not enclosed by the level- $z$ contour. The plot suggests there is a 6-fold symmetry group in play. We can exploit it by choosing a representative of each coset. I have chosen to use the triangle $ABC.$ (This is where $y$ is the smallest of the six values $x,$ $y,$ etc. The other five regions correspond to the places where any given one of those six values is the smallest.) For instance, given any $(x,y)$ in the unit square, If $x \le y$ (a location in the upper left set of contours), then $(y,x)$ is in the lower right half of the unit square and $z(y,x)=z(x,y).$ Given we have arranged that $x \ge y,$ find the smallest value among the nonnegative numbers $y,$ $x-y,$ and $1-x.$ Since their average is $(y+(x-y)+(1-x))/3 = 1/3,$ the smallest must lie between $0$ and $1/3.$ Now: If $y$ is the smallest, do nothing. If $x-y$ is the smallest, replace $(x,y)$ by $(1-y,x-y).$ Otherwise (when $1-x$ is smallest), replace $(x,y)$ by $(1-(x-y), 1-x).$ You can easily verify this preserves the value of $z,$ because (based on step $(1)$ ) the smallest value among $x,$ $y,$ $\ldots,$ $1-|x-y|$ does not change. In the preceding figure, these operations are merely rotating the vertices $(0,0),$ $(1,0),$ and $(1,1)$ among themselves, corresponding to a (generalized) order-three rotation of that triangle (with $A$ as its center). Steps $(1)$ and $(2)$ preserve the value of $z$ and map the unit square in a six-to-one fashion into the triangle $ABC$ (a fundamental domain of the group). Here is a detail of the values of $z$ within this fundamental domain. Since we have arranged to make $y=z,$ they are all horizontal and equally spaced with heights equal to $z:$ Because all contours enclose similar triangular regions (with apex $A$ ) and heights $1/3-z,$ it is now obvious that the relative area above any value $z,$ where $0\le z\le 1/3,$ is proportional to the square of the height $1/3-z.$ Consequently the CDF (which is the complementary probability) must take the form $$F_Z(z) = 1 - C(1/3-z)^2.$$ Since $F_Z(0)=0,$ the only possible value for the normalizing constant is $C=9$ (this is the only calculation needed to solve this problem!) and $$F_Z(z) = 1 - 9(1/3-z)^2.$$ Here is a histogram of the $z$ -values of the pixels used in the two figures, on which I have superimposed a plot of the density $\mathrm{d}/\mathrm{d}z\,F_Z(z) = 18(1/3-z):$ Their agreement is near-perfect.
