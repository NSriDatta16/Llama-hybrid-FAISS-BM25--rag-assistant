Flash tutorial for programmers

I am a programmer with a relatively good background programming in ActionScript using Flash Builder. However, I have been handed a FLA file meant to be opened in Flash CS 4, and I have to add some code to it, but this is the first time I've ever used this software in my life. After I opened the file, I was greeted by a quite unhelpful interface (maybe it's friendly for artists?), and I immediately had questions such as: How can I edit the source code? How do I run the program? How is the source code organized? Where is the entry point of the program? How can I do source control of these files? I've been looking at flash tutorials online, but every tutorial starts with drawing shapes, tweening, the timeline, etc. Honestly, I don't care about any of those things (they've already been done by people at the design team). I already know how to code in ActionScript, so what I need is a tutorial to give me a kickstart in coding -already designed- flash files using Flash (not Flash Builder). Anybody knows of such a tutorial? edit: I have been fighting against flash cs4 all day and I am very very disappointed with it. I thought I was good with technology, but it has been a really long time since I last found a tool so difficult to use and understand.
