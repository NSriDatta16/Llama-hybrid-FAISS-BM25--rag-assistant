I can't really tell you how fast you'll hit the edge cases -- but I can tell you that it's unlike any other development I've ever done. The implementation time required to create a workable solution -- and the ability to rapidly iterate a solution for business sponsors to evaluate are unmatched by any environment I've experienced. The Apex code is based on Java, with platform specific differences. However, some things can't be done through code. The combination of declarative (screen based) and code based implementation required to craft a complete application is hard to wrap your head around at first. Due to the multi-tenant nature of the environment, there are 'governor limits' which prevent resources from being monopolized by a single organization. This restricts your implementation options in things like insert and update triggers. Deploying your application is a very different experience as well. Check out the developer training (Dev 501) available as video podcast on iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=325668840 You'll be able to see exactly what I'm talking about.
