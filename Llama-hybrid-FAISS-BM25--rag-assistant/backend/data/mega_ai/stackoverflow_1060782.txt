I see values from at least a handful of different enumerations in there... My first thought was to approach the problem by splitting the permissions up in logical groups ( RuleGroupPermissions , RulePermissions , LocationPermissions , ...), and then having a class ( WebAgentPermissions ) exposing a property for each permission enum type. Since the permission values seem repetitive, you could probably get away with a single enum in the end: [Flags] public enum Permissions { View = 1, Add = 2, Edit = 4, Delete = 8 } And then have the WebAgentPermissions class expose a property for each area where permissions are to be set; class WebAgentPermissions { public Permissions RuleGroup { get; set; } public Permissions Rule { get; set; } public Permissions Location { get; set; } // and so on... }
