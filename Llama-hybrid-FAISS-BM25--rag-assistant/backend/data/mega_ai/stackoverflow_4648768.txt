I can't imagine why you'd want to do this. It's not uncommon for other browsers to need to pretend to be IE due to brain-dead sites that still insist on blocking anything else, but I've never heard of anyone wanting to do it the other way round. At least not in the last ten years or so. Anyway, as you've already found, it's not as easy to do with IE as it is with other browsers. If you really want to do this, my suggestion would be to go through a proxy, and have that send the spoofed user agent for you. That ought to be relatively easy to write in any language. You can run the proxy on the local machine where the browser is, and it'll all be transparent to both the browser user and the web site (being on the local machine, even the IP address will be correct, which can be a problem for remote proxies) For what it's worth, some anti-virus/anti-malware apps actually do this already, having options to block the user agent and referral data to prevent sites from tracking them. As far as I know, they use pretty much exactly this tecnique (those same local proxies are also used to filter out the malware before it gets to the browser).
