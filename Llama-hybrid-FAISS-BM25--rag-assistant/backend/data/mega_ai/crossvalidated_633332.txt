Identifying states (or clusters) in multivariate mixed-type time series

I have multivariate time series with mixed data types, which includes continuous variables, binary variables, and variables with bimodal distributions. I need to identify distinct states or epochs in this time series. So far I used sliding window to smooth the scaled data and applied k-means clustering (in the picture). But I wonder if there is a more appropriate solution, especially to avoid smoothing. For more context: the data describes behaviour of players in a game. For example, hit or miss (1 or 0) and reaction time (continuous). The goal is to identify distinct states in behaviour that don't switch too often (that wouldn't make sense in my case). The states should ideally capture temporal patterns in the data, like variability of reaction time or stable but low performance vs stable high performance etc. I don't have much experience in machine learning and would really appreciate any advice on how to approach this problem. So far I noticed that there are two important questions: How to meaningfully measure distance between feature vectors, especially if the data is mixed type? How to take into account the temporal aspect ? P.S. I work in python
