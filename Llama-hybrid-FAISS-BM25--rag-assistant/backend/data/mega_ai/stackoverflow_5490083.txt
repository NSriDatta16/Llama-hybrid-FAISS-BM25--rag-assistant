Block until boost::signal is called

Is there an easy way to wait for a boost::signal to be called? I have a signal that is called on every draw cycle in a GUI and I want a different thread to call a function and then wait for the next draw cycle (when the signal is called again so that I know the result of the function has been applied). I think one solution would be to setup a connection with that signal to another function that will throw a custom event and have the original function block until it gets that event. However, that doesn't seem like the most elegant solution. Is there a better way?
