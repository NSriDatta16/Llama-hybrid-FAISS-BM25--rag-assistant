PyMC Robust Linear Regression with Measured Uncertainties

I posted this same question on Stack Overflow. I use least squares regression of data with measured errors in both x and y and use the reduced chi-square (mean square weighted deviation: mswd) as a measure of the fit. However, some of the assumptions for using reduced chi-squared likely are not met and I'd like to move towards an mcmc/bayesian approach using PyMC. I've searched the web but can't exactly seem to find what I'm looking for, most examples assume the data uncertainty is Gaussian, but here I have measured uncertainties in x and y. It seems like I should be able to do this in PyMC2 or PyMC3 with glm. Here's a typical dataset plotted up: And the data to go with it: # Data in Columns, Observations in Rows # Measured values x versus y, # Measured standard deviations sx and sy. x sx y sy 0.3779397 0.001889699 0.5130084 2.748546e-05 0.3659092 0.001829546 0.5129624 2.721838e-05 0.3430834 0.001715417 0.5129023 2.720073e-05 0.4121606 0.002060803 0.5130235 2.755231e-05 0.3075815 0.001537908 0.5128739 2.776967e-05 0.3794471 0.001897236 0.5129950 2.842079e-05 0.1447394 0.000723697 0.5126784 2.816200e-05 I'm looking for any examples and references where people have done this. Thanks in advance.
