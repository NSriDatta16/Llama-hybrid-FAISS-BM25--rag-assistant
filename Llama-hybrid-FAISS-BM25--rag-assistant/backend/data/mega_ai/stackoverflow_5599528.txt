Displaying real time output to wx.TextCtrl

I'm currently in the process of building a wi-fi packet capture utility in Ubuntu using the modules wxPython, Pcapy and impacket. I have created the GUI in wxPython and the capture code referencing the other modules, however combining the two is proving difficult. As idiotic as this sounds, i'm finding it difficult to get the wx.txtctrl to display the captured packets on the GUI, they keep going to the command line instead. Is there anyway of either globally defining the textctrl or a function that allows the code on it to be displayed? If someone could shed any light on the problem it would be much appreciated Many thanks
