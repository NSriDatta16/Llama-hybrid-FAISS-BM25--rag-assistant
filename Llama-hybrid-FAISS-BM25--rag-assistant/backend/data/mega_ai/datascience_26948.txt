Dataset of extremely low-dimensional images for PCA

I am looking for a public data-set of images that differ from each other only slightly, so that after applying PCA they can be reconstructed with a small error from very few PCA coefficients. It can be any type of images, the purpose is only to demonstrate an extreme example of PCA .
