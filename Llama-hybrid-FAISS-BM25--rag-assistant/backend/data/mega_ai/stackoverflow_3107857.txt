Imagine if Facebook was hacked, it didnt encrypt any of the user's passwords. Facebook itself has around 200 millions(?) users What if all of the 200 million passwords were leaked to some evil organization? Many users use same password as their mails or any other sensitive online services such as bank accounting. Facebook wouldn't be safe at all once. Would you register an account there?
