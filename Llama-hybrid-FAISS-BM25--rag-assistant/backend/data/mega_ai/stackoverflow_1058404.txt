InnoDB will handle that for you on some level. All InnoDB tables have some form of primary key which is clustered, and those are typically setup to handle inserts sequentially. If you're prevented from using InnoDB, I believe you'll have to resort to changing source code to adapt how MyISAM works. I'm not particularly familiar with any other "normal" storage engine for MySQL, so I'm not sure if there's another alternative.
