Best way for search word in 150k words dictionnary in a iphone app?

I m developping a simple dictionnary word app in french with 150k words and definitions. i m looking for the best way to do this. First i use a sqlite bdd with 150k words. i use the LIKE command for word search but it is very slow ex : SELECT * FROM words WHERE word LIKE '%avoi%' LIMIT 0,50; for searching word who contain 'avoi' like 'avoir' or 'savoir'. my table have the word column indexes but LIKE doesn't use index so it is very slow (2-5)s on 3GS. After i use fts3 extension off sqlite for use MATCH command ex : SELECT * FROM words WHERE word MATCH 'avoi*' LIMIT 0,50; much better (0,1-0,15s) on 3GS but it s only search for word that begin with 'avoi' word like 'savoir' is not in the result. MATCH command doesn't work with syntax like ' avoi ' Have you any ideas for optimize this text search ? I have a very good exemple of iphone app : Dixel (Robert Disctionnary) who make this kind of search very fast. Any ideas for the method ? thanks for answers.
