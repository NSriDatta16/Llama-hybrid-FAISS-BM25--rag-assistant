I think your question needs a bit of explanation. If you want to take the sums grouped by t.client you can use: SELECT t.client, SUM(t.asset) FROM the-table t GROUP BY t.client Then, if you want to take the average of this sume, just make: SELECT AVG(asset_sums) FROM ( SELECT t.client, SUM(t.asset) AS asset_sums FROM the-table t GROUP BY t.client ) as inner_query You can't however group the outer query, because this will give you results like in the first query. The results from the inner query are already grouped by t.client .
