At some point you need to create your own image (AMI). The reason for doing this is that the changes you will make in an existing AMI will be lost if your instance goes down (which could easily happen as Amazon doesn't guarantee that an instance will stay active indefinitely). Even if you do use EBS for data storage, you will need to do the same mundane tasks configuring the OS every time the instance goes down. You may also want to stop and restart your instance in certain periods or in case of peak traffic start more than one of them. You can read some instructions for creating your image in the documentation . Regarding security you need to be careful not to expose your certification files and keys. If you fail on doing this, then a cracker could use them to start new instances that will be charged for. Thankfully the process is very safe and you should only pay attention in a couple of points: Start from an image you trust. Users are allowed to create public images to be used by everyone and they could either by mistake or in purpose have left a security hole in them that could allow someone to steal your identifiers. Starting from an official Amazon AMI, even if it lacks some of the features you require, is always a wise solution. In the process of creating an image, you will need to upload your certificates in a running instance. Upload them in a location that isn't bundled in the image (/mnt or /tmp). Leaving them in the image is insecure, since you may need to share your image in the future. Even if you are never planning to do so, a cracker could exploit a security fault in the software your using (OS, web server, framework) to gain access in your running instance and steal your credentials. If you are planning to create a public image, make sure that you leave no trace of your keys/identifies in it (in the command history of the shell for example).
