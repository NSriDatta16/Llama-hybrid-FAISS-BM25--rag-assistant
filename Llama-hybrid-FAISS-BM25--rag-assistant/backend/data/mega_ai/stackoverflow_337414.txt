Earley parser generator for Java

I'm looking for an Earley parser generator that is able to generate Java output code, i.e. that generates Java code for the lexer and parser, and allows to include actions (realised as Java code) that are performed for the grammar rules. I looked at two Earley parser generators that generate Java code ( Pep and PEN ) but none of them seems to allow embedding actions into the grammar.
