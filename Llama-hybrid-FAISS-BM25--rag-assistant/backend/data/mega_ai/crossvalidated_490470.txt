How to explain RMSE to business folks and in a simple and easy way

If a model predicting 'days to payment etc.' has an RMSE of 25 days and MAE of 20 days. How to explain RMSE of 25 days easily to them, just like the MAE of 20 days (which is average prediction error) I have looked at various posts, but with no luck. Is there a simple explanation o rmse like the mae to explain to business folks (not an elaborate one). MAE is the average difference in the prediction from the true value. can we explain RMSE as the 'spread of predictions', or is it 'spread in the errors of the predictions'? By spread I mean standard deviations. can someone please clarify, spent hours at this already.
