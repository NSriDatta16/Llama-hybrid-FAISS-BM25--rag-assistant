You can run ssh-add to add your key to your current ssh-agent . This will prompt for your passphrase. Normally, when ssh-agent is running, and you add a key to it, you won't have to unlock your key any more when you connect to hosts that recognise that key. If that isn't what you want, just run ssh-add -d to remove it off your ssh-agent when you're done testing.
