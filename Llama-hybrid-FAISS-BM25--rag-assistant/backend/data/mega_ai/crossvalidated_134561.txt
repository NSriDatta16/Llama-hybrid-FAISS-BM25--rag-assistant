Prediction based on multiple time series - Python

I have 3 predictors and 1 variable that represents ground truth. They all are linked time series. My purpose is with the 3 predictors to try to forecast the ground truth data. For example : list1 = 15,224,32,14,55,67 list2 = 21,331,42,41,31,43 list3 = 43,423,12,65,42,53 ground truth = 55,500,34,12,? ,? I want to predict the ground truth new values depending on past values of list1, list2, list3. I looked this example but actually, I cannot understand how can i fit it for my problem. http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/examples/notebooks/generated/predict.html Any help is appreciated.
