In the absence of Automated tests, CI only verifies that the code under source control is maintained in a compilable state between revisions and that the single-step build works properly. While this is useful, it isn't as useful as the automatic verification that the correctness of the code has been maintained between revisions. With that said, I'd rather have some verification of code between check-ins than none. I'd rather have partial code coverage or an incomplete set of functional tests than nothing. Or worse.
