Perhaps this can be answered in the "reverse" fashion - I.e. when are they the same? Now the IRLS algorithm used in logistic regression provides some insight here. At convergence you can express the model coefficients as: $$\hat {\beta}_{logistic}=\left (X^TWX\right)^{-1} X^TWz$$ where $ W $ is a diagonal weight matrix with ith term $ W_{ii}=n_ip_i (1-p_i) $ and $ z $ is a pseudo response that has ith element $ z_i=x_i^T\hat {\beta}_{logistic} +\frac {y_i -n_ip_i}{n_ip_i (1-p_i)} $. Note that $ var (z_i -x_i^T\hat {\beta})=W_{ii}^{-1} $ which makes logistic regression seem very similar to weighted least squares on a "logit type" of quantity. Note that all the relationships are implicit in logistic regression (eg $z $ depends on $\beta $ which depends on $ z $). So I would suggest that the difference is mostly in using weighted least squares (logistic) vs unweighted least squares (ols on logits). If you weighted the logits $\log (y)-\log (n-y) $ by $ y (1-y/n)$ (where $ y $ is the number of "events" and $ n $ the number of "trials") in the lm () call you would get more similar results.
