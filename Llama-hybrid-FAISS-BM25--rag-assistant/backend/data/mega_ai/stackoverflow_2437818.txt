How to clear wxpython frame content when dragging a panel?

I have 3 panels and I want to make drags on them. The problem is that when I do a drag on one this happens: http://img41.yfrog.com/img41/9043/soundlog.png http://img41.yfrog.com/img41/9043/soundlog.png How can I refresh the frame to happear its color when the panel is no longer there? This is the code that I have to make the drag: def onMouseMove(self, event): (self.pointWidth, self.pointHeight) = event.GetPosition() (self.width, self.height) = self.GetSizeTuple() if (self.pointWidth>100 and self.pointWidth 100 and self.pointWidth and this are the binds for this events: self.Bind(wx.EVT_MOTION, self.onMouseMove) self.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_DOWN, self.onDraggingDown) self.Bind(wx.EVT_LEFT_UP, self.onDraggingUp) With this, if I click on the top of the panel, and move down or up, the panel position changes (I drag the panel) to the position of the mouse.
