While it's discouraged for the ViewModel to call actual methods on the view, there are situations where being able to invoke a view action is beneficial. Most MVVM practitioners advocate a messaging system using the mediator pattern to handle VM to view communication, and if you look at the MVVM frameworks, such as MvvmFoundation , you can often see examples of such messenger systems at-work. For myself, I have found the most common situations where I've needed to do this is with focus operations, as often setting the focus on the correct element with XAML can be a pain to setup, and being able to do something simple like... Messenger.Notify("SetFocusOnElement"); can come in very handy.
