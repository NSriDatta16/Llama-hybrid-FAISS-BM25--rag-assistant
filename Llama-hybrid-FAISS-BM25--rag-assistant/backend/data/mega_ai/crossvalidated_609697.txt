How to sample from a distribution with discrete variables with a known average?

My motivation is to produce carcasses of animals in an ecosystem. The animals have discrete sizes in kg (75, 216, 700, 2500, 5000, 8500, 25000). I also have the estimated percentage each animal contributes to the total ecosystem based on scaling relationships (49.3, 36.8,6,6.7,0.6,0.4,0.2) Finally, I also have the average amount of kg the system should support (1752kg) So I want to have a discrete distribution that uses the first two bits of data to produce a system with 1752kg of animals on average . So it's fine that sometimes it would overshoot or undershoot the average. This answer gets some of the way there but my average value seems to make a difference. I ultimately want to implement this in NetLogo code but I'm familiar with R if people want to illustrate their answers that way.
