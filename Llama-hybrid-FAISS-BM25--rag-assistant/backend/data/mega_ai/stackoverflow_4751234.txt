You cannot use %a for this. It only matches a single octet (locale-dependent but usually only a byte that encodes a letter in ASCII or Latin-1.) To match UTF-8 encoded letters you would need to break them down into ranges of bytes, as in the example here . For example some patterns for UTF-8-encoded Hiragana might include: (\227\129[\129-\191]) (\227\130[\128-\160]) A full list of patterns to match all unicode letters (which would need to include hundreds of subranges) would be unwieldy.
