I've had same problem. And that is soluion I've found on the Web This depends on the compiler that you are actually using. If you're using javac 1.3, this is what Sun does by design. (see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/tools-changes.html for more information, specifically the last paragraph of the first bullet.) Try using an older compiler or using the jikes compiler from IBM. Both javac 1.2.2 and jikes 1.13 will produce output for classes that do compile, even if another file in the fileset doesn't.
