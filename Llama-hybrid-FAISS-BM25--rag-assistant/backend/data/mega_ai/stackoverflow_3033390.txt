I think the biggest problem with your approach is the fact that you have two separate windows, one with the oscillator view, and one with the mixer. If you could change your design so as to display all synthesizer components (or maybe radio frequency components - not sure what you're doing!) in a single window, then your problems will get much simpler. As Joshua said, one approach is to use an invisible overlay window which just shows the link. But if you're really using two separate windows then you can't (as Joshua suggests) order out the overlay window at the end of the drag. If you do that, the link will disappear at the end of the drag. If you want the link to continue to be displayed (think of Interface Builder or - better yet - Quartz Composer) then you need some mechanism to persistently display the link. This is especially true if you want to, at a later point, allow the user to remove the link. I'd strongly suggest building your interface around a single window. Also, consider using Core Animation to display each link as a layer. Dave
