A curious way to organize your data, but this should do it. $opts = array( 'conditions' => array( 'MasterStudentName.last_name' => 'something', //assuming last name is stored in MasterStudentName 'MasterPhone.phone' => '23525222' ) ); $this->MasterStudent->recursive = 1; $data = $this->MasterStudent->find('all', $opts); Recursive is set to 1 so it will pull all the associations.
