One hot encoding at character level with Keras

I am reading Chollet's book on deep learning at the moment and in the NLP chapter he says: Note that Keras has built-in utilities for doing one-hot encoding of text at the word level or character I have looked into Keras metods and I cannot find which function he is referring to. keras.utils.to_categorical does not seem to be applicable directly here, as it requires int inputs. I would like to efficiently encode some text at character level for a small RNN project: what can I use there?
