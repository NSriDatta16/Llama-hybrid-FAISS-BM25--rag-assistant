How would test cron with Magento?

First I need to understand how Magento cron works. I know how cron works on linux, using crontab -e . I know I need to set up Magento's cron.php to run periodically But when I define cron within magento config file, how does they match that they should be run? Because if set my cron.php to run every 15 min ( 0,15,30,45 * * * * ) and I have a Magento cron 10 * * * * for example. How will it match/work? By the way, how could I test that my cron works without waiting a long time?
