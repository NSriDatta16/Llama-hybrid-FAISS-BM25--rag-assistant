How to store and access ajax data in javascript without using global variables?

I may be missing something obvious here, but how could I rewrite this code so that it doesn't need the theVariable to be a global variable ? theVariable = ""; function setValue() /* called on page load */ { /* make ajax call to the server here */ theVariable = "a string of json data waiting to be eval()'d"; } function getValue() { alert(theVariable); } In my actual situation, the setValue function makes an ajax call to the server, receives a json string and the data from that is accessed when you mouseover various parts of the page. I end up using several global variables which works fine, but is messy and I'd like to know if there's a better and more elegant way of doing it ?
