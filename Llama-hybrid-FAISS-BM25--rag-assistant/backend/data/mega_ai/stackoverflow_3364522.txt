If the question is storing the types (especially so you can add new ones) how about a config file in XML, or something database driven? With an app.config you could have: Which would get called in code: //Generate the error somehow: Validation.ErrorType = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["PersonWithoutSurnameValidationError"].Value; //Handle the error [Your string solution here] This way, you get your error types documented somewhere outside your code so they're easier to remember. If, on the other hand, your main question is the storage so you can get the correct type to handle, stick with the enum.
