Based on your description, a simple cross-correlation should do it. You are testing whether a series point in the future correlates with a series in the past which you consider correct. This measurement is given exactly by the cross-correlation between the future series and the past series - The other good thing about cross correlation is you can adjust the length of your series accordingly, which gives a lot of flexibility. Cross correlation itself might not be enough for your system, as it only provides a measure of difference, you can still build a model for the actual "classification" - since your output are binary, anything simple from a threshold detector (i.e. if xcor > value then 1 else 0) to a small neural network should both work fine.
