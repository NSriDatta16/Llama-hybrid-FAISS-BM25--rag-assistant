Since you are keen on developing for iphone. Focus on objective C. Think of it as C with a decent Object Oriented extension. You will learn C and object oriented. And it is apple friendly. Career wise it will be pretty timely resume stuffer to have an Iphone app in your portfolio. On the other hand I recommend you learn how to design programs first. The time you spend will be repayed in your first project. You will be leveraging it from then on. It is really the best route. To learn that.. go here: http://www.htdp.org They have a great free downloadable dev environment and tons of material online. They are the best thing since sliced bread. You can work through their stuff really fast and dont waste time caught up in syntax irrelevance.
