Whats the most elegant way to rearrange an associative array?

Suppose you have an associative array $hash['Fruit'] = 'Apple'; $hash['Name'] = 'Jeff'; $hash['Car'] = 'Ford'; and you cannot change the order in which these variables are created. So Car is always added to the array after Name, etc. What's the prettiest way to add/move Car to the beginning of the associative array instead of the end (default)?
