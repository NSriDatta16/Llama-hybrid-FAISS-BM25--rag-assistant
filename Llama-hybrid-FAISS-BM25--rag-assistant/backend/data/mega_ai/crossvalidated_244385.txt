What can be concluded cross correlation of two time series is high at some lag?

If cross correlation peaks at a very high value at positive lag, it does not imply process in time series A causes process time series B . They can both be caused by an unobserved process C with different propagation rate, for example. Then what can we draw from the fact that cross correlation is high at some lag?
