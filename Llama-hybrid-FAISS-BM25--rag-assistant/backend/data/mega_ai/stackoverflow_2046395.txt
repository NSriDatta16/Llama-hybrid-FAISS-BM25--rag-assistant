sifr throwing 'G.brokenFlashIE' is null or not an object error

We are getting this error occurring randomly throughout the site, but only on one computer that we've noticed so far. We have not gone live with our site (it's in the QA phase) and only one person testing this site seems to be having this issue come up. Here is the error message: User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2) Timestamp: Mon, 11 Jan 2010 15:33:03 UTC Message: 'G.brokenFlashIE' is null or not an object Line: 17 Char: 24003 Code: 0 They're running IE8 on XP/SP3. sifr is on every page in the site, yet this error shows up inconsistently. The person this is happening to says it happens frequently, but randomly. It works fine for every other browser/OS combination we've tried. We are at the end of our testing phase and need to go live very soon. Any help/suggestion/resolution would be greatly appreciated.
