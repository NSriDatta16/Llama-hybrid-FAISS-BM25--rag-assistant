From the description of the Apache Commons Functor page: A functor is a function that can be manipulated as an object, or an object representing a single, generic function. Functors support and encourage a number of powerful programming techniques including: programming in a functional style higher order functions internal iterators reuse and specialization through composition rather than inheritance and overloading generic "callback" or "extension point" APIs generic "filters" or predicate APIs many "behavioral" design patterns, such as Visitor, Strategy, Chain of Responsibility, etc.
