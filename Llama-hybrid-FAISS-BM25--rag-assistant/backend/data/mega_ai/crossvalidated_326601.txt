The displayed dynamics seems stochastic, the first graph especially. A question: why is your objective modeling the time series with deterministic functions? A time series model would be more appropriate. You are correct that the simplest time series models (ARMA / ARIMA) won't fit the data well. Also, the data are heteroskedastic: the variance increases with time. So some transformation of the form $Y(t) = X(t) / t^\alpha$ (or something more clever) might be appropriate. Ideally, you would start with modeling $Y(t)$ using something like ARIMA + deterministic basis functions. One possible choice of the basis is $\{log(t), t^\beta, sin(\omega t) \}$.
