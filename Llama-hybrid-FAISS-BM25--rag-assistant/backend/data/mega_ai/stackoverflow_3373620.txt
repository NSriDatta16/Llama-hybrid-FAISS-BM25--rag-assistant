From any Zend_Controller_Action method you can retrieve the user's remote address as follows: $ip = $this->getRequest()->getServer('REMOTE_ADDR'); If you're not in a Controller, you can use the following assuming the Front Controller was used: $ip = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getRequest()->getServer('REMOTE_ADDR'); And finally - these methods are just wrappers for the SERVER superglobal: $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; Substitute REMOTE_ADDR with HTTP_USER_AGENT to get the user agent.
