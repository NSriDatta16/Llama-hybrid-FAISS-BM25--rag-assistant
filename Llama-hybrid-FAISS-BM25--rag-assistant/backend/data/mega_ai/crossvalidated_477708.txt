How to analyze (compare groups) time series survey data

I'm seeking help in determining the best form of analysis for some time series survey data I've collected. To keep it simple, here's a hypothetical example of the data and desired analysis: Weekly survey (40 weeks, 100 respondents per week) about how much respondents like/dislike apples. Different respondents each week. Overall trend has various curves, with attitudes becoming more positive, then more negative, then more positive again. What I'd like to test: Are there significant trends in the data (i.e., attitudes changing over time)? Are there differences between males/females, in terms of one liking apples more than the other? Are there differences between the trends for males/females? For example, maybe in Week 1 males exhibited a slightly more positive view towards apples than females, but over time that gap grew as males' attitudes became more much positive and females attitudes' became only a bit more positive. Many thanks for any and all assistance!
