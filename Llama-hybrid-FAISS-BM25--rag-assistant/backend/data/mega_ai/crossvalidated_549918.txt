Fisherfaces/Linear Discriminat Analysis - What are those faces supposed to be?

I see a lot of weird blue/gray/green faces when I search for "firsherfaces" at Google. I see faces like this and my question is simple: What are those faces supposed to be? Are they some kind of like "average" images? Why grey color? Here we have blue color. Why does these "ghost" faces mean? Why does they look like that?
