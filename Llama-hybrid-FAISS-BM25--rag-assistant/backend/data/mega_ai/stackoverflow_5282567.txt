Textmate Execute line/selection for Python broken

I've been using textmate for python for a couple of weeks now, everything seems to be working fine apart from the command "Execute line/selection as Python". It does not work at all. Trying to test even print "Hello World" I get Traceback (most recent call last): File "/tmp/temp_textmate.QrxfR3", line 19, in stdout.write(exc) TypeError: argument 1 must be string or read-only character buffer, not list I tried to re-install textmate but still getting the same error. Any idea????? my version of textmate is Version 1.5.10 (1623) thanks, Alberto
