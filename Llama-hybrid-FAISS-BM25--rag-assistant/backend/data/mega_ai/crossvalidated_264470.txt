1) how likely is it that I may completely misclassify the top VarImps in RF model. Is running CIT here absolutely necessary? Unlikely, because you have good results from random forest, unless you biase the probabilities obtained in the predict function. Random forest is an independent model so I don't see any absolute reason to run CIT. 2) what are alternative ways of obtaining conditional variable importance if not through party::varimp()? There are others like: extendedForest and also this set of slides should give you more information. Note Please note that correlated predictors could result in biased variable selection in RF is not entirely true.: Ref: Why is multicollinearity not checked in modern statistics/machine learning
