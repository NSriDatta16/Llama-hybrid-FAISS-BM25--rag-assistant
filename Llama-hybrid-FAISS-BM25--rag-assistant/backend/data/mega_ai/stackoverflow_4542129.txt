How do I get a Method of a nested property?

I have a class Foo that a property of the type Bar. public class Foo { public Bar getBar() { } } public class Bar { public String getName(); } Is there a helper class or method that gets you a java.lang.reflect.Method object of the name property of Bar , using Foo.class and "bar.name"? There is a class called PropertyUtils in Commons BeanUtils, but its getPropertyDescriptor() only works for Object instances, not Class instances. I realize it's not hard at all to implement one, but I'd like to leverage what's already available. Also, the fact that I need a Method object is not a result of bad design(hope not). What I'm working on is pretty much a JavaBeans editor. Thanks!
