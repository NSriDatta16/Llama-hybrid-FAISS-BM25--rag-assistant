I agree that it is much more elegant to use jQuery or other and have unobtrusive js. This way it's all clearly visible, and easily extensible. I just want to mention 1 quick problem that I had with all of this, and it involves generated code (i.e html from frameworks). In my case, Apache Trinidad as part of JSF. When trinidad generates HTML, it included inline javascript calls like onclick='submitForm(..)' I was modifying the existing custom inline calls to use jQuery, for example: which generates html like: Now in the case that the javascript call is inline, if you return false from the method, the rest of the onClick will not execute. However, when using non-obtrusive jQuery, the inline method will not be stopped (not easily anyway). I guess what I'm saying is "be weary of frameworks" :-)
