Is there any serious logic behind the Xcode Organizer bug when screenshot's don't work?

I always try to make screenshots of running apps, with a 70% chance that it won't work. There is a green light showing my connected device. Most of the times I have to connect and disconnect like 10 times until it can make a screenshot. What causes this problem? Must I wait 10 minutes after build? Is there any logic behind this failure?
