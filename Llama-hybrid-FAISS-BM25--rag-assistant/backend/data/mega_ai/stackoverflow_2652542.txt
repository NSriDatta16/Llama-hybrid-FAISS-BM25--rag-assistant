I take it this is a Java agent? Things to check. In the agent properties that the security level is set for what you want to do. Normally file access requires at least level 2. The signature of the agent or the user the agent is set to run as is allowed to run on the server. You can modify the java.policy file to allow access to certain restricted classes. (but you need to know why you are making the change). http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/permissions.html
