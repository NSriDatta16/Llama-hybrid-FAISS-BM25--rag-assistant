Logit Model Interpretation

I understand that R outputs logistic regression coefficients as the log-odds ratio but I have a question about the UCLA tutorial that I'm following. It gives the following output for a logit model using a single dichotomous variable where the outcome variable is being in an honors class: logit(p) = β0 + β1*female Logistic regression Number of obs = 200 LR chi2(1) = 3.10 Prob > chi2 = 0.0781 Log likelihood = -109.80312 Pseudo R2 = 0.0139 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ hon | Coef. Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- female | .5927822 .3414294 1.74 0.083 -.0764072 1.261972 intercept | -1.470852 .2689555 -5.47 0.000 -1.997995 -.9437087 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The log-odds of being in an honors class and being female is .5927 meaning that being female increases the chance of being in an honors class. When they transform this to an odds ratio they use the exp(.5927822) which equals 1.809014 . They say in the tutorial though that the odds for female are about 81% higher than the odds for males. How do they go from 1.809 to 81%?
