This seems a straight-forward problem. You have multiple predictors which you can use in a regression model as independent variables. However, several things complicate matters somewhat: There are multiple observations per day of variables U-Z for different time periods; These time periods are of unequal length, in irregular intervals and the number of periods varies over days; There are multiple outcome variables A, B and C; These are time series data, and as such you may have to model the time dimension so as not to induce bias. The first point does not have to be a problem. A simple solution would be to just use all the variables as different inputs into the regression, where you put in variables U-Z multiple times for different periods of the day. The second point requires more attention. Probably the easiest way is to use some rule to bin some time periods in a fixed number of periods, e.g. morning, afternoon, night. If you want to tackle the third issue depends on whether you want to model the correlations between A, B and C. You can do this with multiple equation models. The fourth point can be addressed with time-series analysis. Combined with the third, you can create a vector autoregressive model (VAR). However I would start with a simple model, just to get a feel for how the model predicts by checking its performance. Since you have lots of data, I would also include interaction terms between the different independent variables. You do not run a high risk of over-fitting the data, but you should still be carefull and use e.g. cross-validation methods afterwards. NB: these points are just a handful of the things I can think of that warrant attention. Since we cannot see what the actual case is about, you have to see for yourself what measures are necessary in this particular case.
