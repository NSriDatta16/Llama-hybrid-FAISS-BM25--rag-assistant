Derivation of the Highest Posterior Probability in Bayesian Model Choice

In Bayesian Essentials , page 40, there's the following formula: I've tried to derive it. $P(M=k|D=\frac{P(D|M=k)P(M=k)}{\sum_jP(D|M=j)P(M=j)}=\frac{\int P(D|\theta,M=k)P(\theta|M=k)\ d\theta \ \ P(M=k)}{\sum_jP(D|M=j)P(M=j)}=\frac{\int l_k(\theta)\pi_k(\theta)\ d\theta \ \ P(M=k)}{\sum_jP(D|M=j)P(M=j)}$ However, I'm stuck at this last step... Any help would be appreciated.
