If I understand what you want to do correctly, you can leverage the ArcGIS Server RESI API to do this. Using the REST API you can request a single image from an ArcGIS Server map service, and specify the bounding box, image size, image file type and numerous other parameters - and you get back a single image of that size, type etc. The map service could be one that you have published on your ArcGIS Server (9.3 or higher). The service can be cached or dynamic. You can also utilize ArcGIS Online services, even to just to get a feel for this. So for example, go to the following URL: http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Street_Map/MapServer And under "Supported Operations" at the bottom of the page, go to Export Map. Enter a size in the "Image Size" text box (for example: 1200,1200) along with any other parameters and click "Export Image". You can get a feel for the acutal URL arguments by looking at the resulting URL for your request. You can get information about the parameters here (for example, for Export operation): http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisserver/10.0/apis/rest/export.html Now you mentioned creating a web service, so to do this programmatically you may be able to just hit the REST API directly. Or perhaps you'll want to create your own service as a wrapper around these REST API calls. Hope this helps and I understood your question correctly.
