It depends on why you are making models. Two main reasons to construct survival models are (1) to make predictions or (2) to model effect sizes of covariates. If you want to use them in a predictive setting in which you want to obtain an expected survival time given a set of covariates, neural networks are likely the best choice because they are universal approximators and make less assumptions than the usual (semi-)parametric models. Another option which is less popular but not less powerful is support vector machines . If you are modelling to quantify effect sizes, neural networks won't be of much use. Both Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models can be used for this goal. Cox PH models are by far the most widely used in clinical settings, in which the hazard ratio gives a measure of effect size for each covariate/interaction. In engineering settings, however, accelerated failure time (AFT) models are the weapon of choice.
