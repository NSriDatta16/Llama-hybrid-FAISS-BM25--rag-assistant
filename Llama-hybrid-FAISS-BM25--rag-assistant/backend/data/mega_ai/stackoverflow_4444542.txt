lets try to fix the users instead of the code :) , i guess that your log out button is like the one here on stackoverflow. its a little text link "logout" some where in the upper right corner. thats perfect for people who use webapps day by day and are aware of the fact that they need to logout before someone comes along a does havoc to thier facebook profile, but less tech savy users wont think of that and walk away. you need to the get the attention of your users to this logout-button and teach them that logging-out is a good thing. try the following give the logout button more visual weight then usally make it bigger, make it a real button instead of a textlink and even change its color to something more alerting (red, orange, ... whatever fits your ci) if they dont loggout, use the session timeout and some javascript the refresh the page after any amount of inactivity, but also set a flag that this user has not logged out after his last visit. that way you can greet him on his next login with a nice confirmation dialog, and tell him once again why logging out is so important and where your logout-button is located.
