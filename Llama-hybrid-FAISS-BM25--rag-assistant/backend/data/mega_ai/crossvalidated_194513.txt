Bartlett's theory here refers to results from this paper On the Theoretical Specification and Sampling Properties of Autocorrelated Time-Series . The main idea here is that if you have $n$ discrete time observations, the effective number of degrees of freedom needs to be less than n since the observations are not independent, given by $n \cdot\text{correction factor}$ For a linear autoregressive model with $s$ lags $$ x_{t+1} = \sum_{l=1}^{s}x_{t-l}\rho_{l} + e_t $$ Suppose $s=1$. The asymptotic correction factor for AR-(1) model is given by $\frac{1-\rho^2}{1+\rho^2}$. Thus instead of an asymptotic variance of $\frac{1}{n}$, we have a larger asymptotic variance of $\frac{1}{n}\frac{1+\rho^2}{1-\rho^2}$ You can similarly find a derivation of Bartlett's formula for asymptotic variance vector of $(\rho_1,\ldots, \rho_s)$ autocorrelation coefficients case in Theorem 7.2.1 in [Brockwell and Davis][2] and for a number of other time-series models as well. For the case of asymptotic variance between two different time-series, $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, a similar formula applies and is nicely discussed in this paper by [Haugh][3]. Even if you do whiten each individual time-series first, the test statistic for the sample cross-correlation still needs to adjust the asymptotic variance estimate.
