How determine database server IP via UDP in Java

I am writing clients in Java that store the data on a database server. So far, the IP and Port of the server has to be specified in the client's settings manually. I have heard, that it is possible to automatically determine the IP of database servers via broadcast / multicast / UDP (I am not familiar with these concepts). Question: Is there a way to retrieve the IP adresses of all available database-servers in the local network? I am working with the h2 database system so far. Bye, Wolfgang
