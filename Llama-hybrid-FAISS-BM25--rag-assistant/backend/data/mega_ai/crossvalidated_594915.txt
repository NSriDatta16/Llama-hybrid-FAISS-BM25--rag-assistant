I'm sure we are going through the same lesson! I had the same question and I found one explaination: [This average is centered at period t-(m+1)/2, which implies that the estimate of the local mean will tend to lag behind the true value of the local mean by about (m+1)/2 periods. Thus, we say the average age of the data in the simple moving average is (m+1)/2 relative to the period for which the forecast is computed: this is the amount of time by which forecasts will tend to lag behind turning points in the data.]from https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411avg.htm
