Predicting the growth of traffic on a web site: regression or time series?

I've got a small website and I'm investing a lot of efforts on it. The traffic is growing but still very low. I've studied engineering but my knowledge of statistics is basic. I have put the last 70 days of data on Google Doc ( link ) and I wish to detect daily seasonality, level shifts, time trends in a logical way while also identifying unusual readings and not have them distort my forecast. What method should I use? I've tried Excel with a linear, logarithmic regression. Are these forecast statistically reliable? What is an alternative for this kind of task? (i.e. other type of regression? time series?)
