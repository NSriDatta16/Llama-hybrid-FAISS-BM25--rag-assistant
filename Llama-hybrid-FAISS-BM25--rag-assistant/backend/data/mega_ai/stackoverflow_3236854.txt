You could use a global counter assuming it is kept in persistent storage. Always keep in mind the system is free to unload and reload activities from device RAM based on pressure from other apps so instance variables of activities are probably not a good choice to house that data. I think the Android way of handling a scenario like yours would be to manage your connection state in a service and use persistent storage to monitor application state.
