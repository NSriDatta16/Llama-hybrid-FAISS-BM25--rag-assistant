The easiest way would be to change the form's constructor to pass in mainDeck. public Form1(Deck mainDeck) { InitializeComponent(); int Val = mainDeck.ReturnCard(10); textBox1.Text = Val.ToString(); } If you needed to refer to it in other parts of your forms code, you could keep a private member variable lying around ... private Deck _mainDeck; public Form1(Deck mainDeck) { InitializeComponent(); _mainDeck = mainDeck; int Val = _mainDeck.ReturnCard(10); textBox1.Text = Val.ToString(); } } private void SomeOtherMethod() { int blah = _mainDeck.Blah(); } And then in your Program.cs file ... Application.Run(new Form1(mainDeck)); Edit: In response to your new error involving the accessibility of the Deck class, it is because your Deck class is not public. Add the public keyword to the class declaration, so: namespace Pcard { public class Deck { // and so on ... Note that it might be cleaner to keep your Deck class in a separate .cs file, such as Deck.cs.
