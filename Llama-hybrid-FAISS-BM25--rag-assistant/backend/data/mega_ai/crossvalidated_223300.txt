Semi-supervised learning refers to machine learning tasks using a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, or to obtain outputs for particular unlabeled inputs. The unlabeled data is used to learn about underlying structure of the inputs, which can improve learning about the relationship between inputs and outputs. Semi-supervised learning involves elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning.
