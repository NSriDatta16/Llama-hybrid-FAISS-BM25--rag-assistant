So you're saying the user has a browser window open, and has access to an XML file from a local server (that I assume their browser can access via http), and you want the browser to act as a kind of tunnel to pass that XML file's contents up to your remote server? And the remote server does not have access to that local XML file? Security issues make this almost impossible to do. (You wouldn't want Yahoo pulling random files off your local network while you browse, right?) It can only be done if you have some control over the way that the local server provides the XML. In this case, you can leverage JSONP to get around the security issues and allow the page in the browser to submit the data to your remote server as an AJAX post.
