Your code looks almost identical to a lot of our business object loading functions. When we suspect DAL performance issues, we take a look at a few things things. How many times are we hopping out to the DB? Is there any way we can connect less often and bring back larger chunks of data via the use of multiple result sets (we use stored procedures.) So, instead of each child object loading its own data, the parent will fetch all data for itself and its children. You can run into fragile SQL (sort orders that need to match, etc) and tricky loops to walk over the DataReaders, but we have found it to be more optimal than multiple DB trips. Fire up a packet sniffer/network monitor to see exactly how much data is being transmitted across the wire. You may be surprised to see how massive some of the result sets are. If they are, then you might think about alternate ways of approaching the issue. Like lazy/defer loading some child data. Make sure that you are using all of the results you are asking for. For example, going from SELECT * FROM (with 30 fields being returned) to simply SELECT Id, Name FROM (if that is all you needed) could make a large difference.
