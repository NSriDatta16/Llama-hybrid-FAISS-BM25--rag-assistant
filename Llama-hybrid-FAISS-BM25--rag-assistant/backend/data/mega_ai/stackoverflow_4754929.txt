Matlab: Easy way of getting the standard basis vectors?

It seems like this should be easy, but I'm no expert and google isn't helping. I would like an elegant way in Matlab of producing the standard ordered basis vectors for an n-dimensional space. For example, behaviour similar to the following: >> [e1, e2] = SOB(2); >> e1 e1 = 1 0 >> e2 e2 = 0 1 I'm hoping for a 1-liner and don't really want to write a function for something so simple. Thanks
