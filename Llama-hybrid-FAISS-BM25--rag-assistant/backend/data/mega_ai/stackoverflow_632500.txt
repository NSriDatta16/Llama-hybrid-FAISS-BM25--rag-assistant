Nathan's answer is part of the answer. The HttpContext.Request.RawUrl allows access to this info but in the Global.asax.cs file instead. This being done in the Application_BeginRequest event. But the trick (and please comment if someone knows a more elegant way to do this) but we inject the Url being used into the remaining route path so it can be picked up in the MapRoute method. So the " http://subdomain.domain.net/url " site would then appear as " http://subdomain.domain.net/subdomain.domain.net/url so it can be picked up in the {site} part of the MapRoute command. This would not be shown to the user but then allows us to make decisions inside the app based on received URL. Does this sound sane? Comments are welcome if this seems a crazy way of doing it in order to absorb the root Url.
