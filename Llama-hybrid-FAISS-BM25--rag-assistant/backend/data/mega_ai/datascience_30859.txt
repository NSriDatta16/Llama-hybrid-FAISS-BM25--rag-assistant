Is there any proven disadvantage of transfer learning for CNNs?

Suppose I know that I want to use a ResNet-101 architecture for my specific problem. There are ReseNet-101 models trained on ImageNet. Is there any disadvantage of using those pre-trained models and just resetting the last (few) layers to match the specific number of classes or should that be the default option? Please don't simply post your gut feeling... I have a gut feeling as well, but I want to know.
