How to set feature engineering for day of a week?

Apologies if this is a very basic question. I'm currently learning data science and was wondering to help validating what I'm trying to do. So I have a model set up to predict event duration by minutes, so I'm trying to do linear regression. However, I noticed that the data for Monday is much higher compared to the rest of the week. I want to do feature engineering on it. Can you suggest the best way to do this? What I was told was to create a feature that basically says when day of week == Monday, set the value to 1, otherwise set value to 0 (zero) for the rest of the week. Is this the right approach?
