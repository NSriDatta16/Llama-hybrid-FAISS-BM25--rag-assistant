Updating view spark.components.List

I am using a List component inside an itemRenderer. The main user interaction involves dragging an item from the List in one renderer and dropping it in another. My problem: When the data object is updated I want the Lists' height to be modified according to the number of objects in the dataprovider(dp), which is passed to the List from the data object. Now I have tried to invalidate the display of the List, refresh its dp and have tried putting this line assets.length > 0 ? assetList.percentHeight = 100 : assetList.height = 10; in other event handlers, such as dragdrop handlers, collection event handlers for the dp etc. I have also tried refreshing the dp for the List component that is using this renderer. The view does eventually get updated but only if I resize the list, or use the scroller or when I begin dragging a new List item but never after the drop. 0 ? assetList.percentHeight = 100 : assetList.height = 10; } ]]>
