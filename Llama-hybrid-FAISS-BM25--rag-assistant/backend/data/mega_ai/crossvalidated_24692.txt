Bootstrap p.value, Wilcoxon rank sum or other test?

Imagine I have a network, and in this network I have $n$ nodes of interest. I calculated the average shortest path (asp) between these nodes. I want to see if they are statistically significantly close to each other. Therefore I select $n$ nodes from the network randomly, and work out the average shortest path length. I repeat this 1000 times, so I have my asp for my nodes of interest a vector of 1000 asps for randomly selected nodes Question: How can I compare the two? Just count how many times the asp of my nodes interest Or should I compare the asp of the nodes of interest with the vector of 1000 random asps using e.g. t.test or Wilcoxon rank sum?
