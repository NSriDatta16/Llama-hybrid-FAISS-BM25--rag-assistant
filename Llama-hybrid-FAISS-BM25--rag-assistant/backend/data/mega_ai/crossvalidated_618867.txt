Let me denote the first time series $\{Y_1\}$ and the second one $\{Y_2\}$ . Interpretation Your interpretation is correct. RMSE of what? You may compare the RMSE of one-step ahead forecasts from the AR(p) model for $\{Y_2\}$ with one of the ARDL(p,p) model for $\{Y_2\}$ for either $p=4$ or $p=5$ . The ARDL(p,p) model corresponds to the equation for $\{Y_2\}$ from the VAR(p) model that includes both $\{Y_1\}$ and $\{Y_2\}$ . I think RMSE of $h$ -step ahead forecast for $h>1$ would also work but may be a less common choice. For more details on the logic of comparing AR and ARDL models in the context of Granger causality, see this .
