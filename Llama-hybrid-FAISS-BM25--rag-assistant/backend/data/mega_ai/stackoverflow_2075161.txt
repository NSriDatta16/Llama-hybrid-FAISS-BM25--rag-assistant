I've done a little work w/ Air and I'll give you a few reasons to consider it: it's portable, the underlying foundation is webkit and flash, so you can create a flash app or a web app and deliver it to the desktop and if you are a web programmer you will know exactly what to do distribution and update of your software is going to be a breeze, Air has done a great job of building out the mechanics/experience of updating an application its super web app platform with strong sandbox protections for the user generally performance is pretty good the jit compiler for flash is impressive, but one thing to be aware of - if your app is on the larger side and you do need to pay attention to memory use.
