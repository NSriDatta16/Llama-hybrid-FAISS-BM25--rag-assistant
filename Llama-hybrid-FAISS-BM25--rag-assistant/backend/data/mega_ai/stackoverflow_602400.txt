The alternatives seem to be: Use a synchronisation object (such as a mutex) on the generator's seed value. This will unfortunately serialise your code on accesses to generator Use thread-local storage in the generator so each thread gets its own seed - this may cause statstical problems for your app If your platform supports a suitable atomic operation, use that on the seed (it probably won't, however) Not a very encouraging list, I know. And to add to it, I have no idea how to implement any of them in FORTRAN!
