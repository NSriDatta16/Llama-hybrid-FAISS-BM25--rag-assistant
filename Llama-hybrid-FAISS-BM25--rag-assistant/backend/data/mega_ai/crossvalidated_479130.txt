What kind of time series problem this is and how to solve it?

Let's say that my dataset looks like this: timestamp (daily), serial_number, device_type, stat1, stat2... statn, failure. One device type can contain many serial numbers. For each serial number stat1-statn have some metrics. Failure column is 0 - no failure or 1 - failed. I have to predict which serial number will fail in the nearby (next 7 days) future. I believe that this is a multivariate time series problem. Can I use SARIMAX (statsmodels) for such time series?
