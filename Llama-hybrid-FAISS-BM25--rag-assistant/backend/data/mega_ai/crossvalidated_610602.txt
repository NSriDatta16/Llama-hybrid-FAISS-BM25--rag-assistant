Sure you can. For example, you can use the independent variant of the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm . Generate $x'$ from the distribution $g$ , Take $$ x_{t+1} = \cases{ x' \quad \text{with probability} \; \min\Big( \frac{f(x') g(x_t)}{f(x_t) g(x')}, \, 1\Big) \\ x_t \quad \text{otherwise} } $$ See Christian P. Robert and George Casella Monte Carlo Statistical Methods , p. 276. Notice however that this would not work if $f$ and $g$ have different domains and would not be very efficient if the two distributions are very different from each other. There may be even more efficient algorithms (see mcmc ) if you wouldn't insist on generating the samples independently from $g$ .
