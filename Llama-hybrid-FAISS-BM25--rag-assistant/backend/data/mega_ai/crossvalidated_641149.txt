How to evaluate the impact of an intervention with no control group?

I launched a campaign where I give certain users 20% off. This was not launched as A/B test. I’m trying to figure out how to evaluate the incremental impact + ROI of the intervention given that it was not launched as an experiment. Some solutions I’ve potentially shortlisted are: Synthetic Control - may not be possible because the synthetic control group may too difficult to construct (correct me if I’m wrong on this) ITS - Interrupted Time Series could be tough because it needs at least 8 periods before and 8 weeks after and I can’t wait 8 weeks for my data to come in to evaluate the impact.
