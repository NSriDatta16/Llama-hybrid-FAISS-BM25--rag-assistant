If your data meets the required assumptions you can perform linear regression and use the model to predict points - see here for an example Testing Hypothesis with Time series and Location Data If the relation between dependent and independent variables is constant in time, you could also pool the data points and build a model which is no longer a time series. Another approach is to use date dummy variables and allow the intercept to change... More complex models such as dynamic regression models, exponential smoothing etc.. may provide better forecasts, but may be more difficult to interpret from an inferential perspective A few useful resources chapter 13 Wooldridge Introductory_Econometrics_A_Modern_Approach Hyndman's new book: https://otexts.org/fpp2/least-squares.html
