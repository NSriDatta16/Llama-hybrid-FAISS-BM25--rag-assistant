Depends on the nature of the question. Adjusting for an observed lag has advantages such as allowing for real-time prediction and estimating more easily interpretable effects. One confusing bit is that a latent variable usually considers 2 or more manifest / endogenous variables. Here s(t-1, i) is the only such variable. However, if s(t-1, i) is measured with error, an instrumental variables model might improve precision by considering s*(t-1,i) as a latent lagged effect. They are really quite similar, in fact the two models are too nearly equivalent to be worth conducting separate analyses. Focus on the scientific question of the model and choose either the logistic regression or SEM as a prespecified analysis.
