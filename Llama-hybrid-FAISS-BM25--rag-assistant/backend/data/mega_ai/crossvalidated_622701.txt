When to use Label encoding

All the articles I read, it is clear that, Label Encoding should be avoided for the ordinal data. But, in one of my ML tutorial video of Artificial Neural Network , the Gender column (having two values, male or female ) is Label Encoded. I wonder this is a bad approach. Can I use label encoding for any column which is having only two possible values without any priority issue (the model can think one of the value is having higher priority)?
