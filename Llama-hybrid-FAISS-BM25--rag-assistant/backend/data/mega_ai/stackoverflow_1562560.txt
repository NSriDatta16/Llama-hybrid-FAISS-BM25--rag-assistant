In my experience it is rarely useful to look at Object[] as it is the underlying type of a lot of types, which means that you'll end up with lots of these on the heap making it harder to identify the correct one. Additionally internal structures such as the interned string table is also stored as an Object[] . If you are trying to figure out why the application uses a lot of memory, try to identify other types that may or may not encapsulate Object[] and find out what roots these. If you provide more information on what you're trying to accomplish I may be able to provide more specific advice. EDIT: Fragmentation isn't necessarily as bad as it may sound and 100 MB free doesn't strike me as an alarming high number. Have you identified if the free blocks are in the generational heap on on the large object heap? What is the output of !eeheap -gc ?
