How long does it take from uploading ftp for it to show http?

Quick question; I replaced a .css file which I was referencing in html/php that has an absolute address of : http:/www.[my silly domain].com/css/div_image_container.css. When I access it directly, it gives me an OLDER version of a file I have uploaded into the ftp structure. However, in my main page, using a relative based directory, eg: "); } It 'magically' uses the correct, updated script. What is this? Is there somewhat of delay between when I upload through ftp and when my page gets served 'correctly'? I am using fatcow, and they use sftp, which shouldn't matter. I am just confused. When I access the file through ftp, it is the correct one. Wait a minute, let me think. FZ has an url copy thing. When I copy a url, it gives something in the form of ftp://[domain name]@ftp.[domain name].com/css/div_image_container.css When I reference things in html without a http://, is it somehow always executing a ftp? But every user on the planet and beyond would need credentials, or at the very least read privileges. Any way it's been 30+ minutes and the http:// address for that css file still contains the wrong code. There is clearly some sort of separation between ftp http, obvious in name, but this is the first time that my assumption that an upload via ftp is reflected, in due time, almost equivalently in 'retrieval' through http has been shaken.
