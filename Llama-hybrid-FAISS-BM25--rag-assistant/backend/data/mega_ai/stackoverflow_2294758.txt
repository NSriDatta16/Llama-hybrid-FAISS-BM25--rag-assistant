Did you try accessing to the internet with Eclipse (for update or XML validation) through manual Active Provider instead of native ? Eclipse shouldn't prompt you for a password at the beginning, and XML validation should work. The bug 82037 was solved a long time ago, and current development settings (like this MOTODEV Studio for Android Installation ) recommend manual settings for proxy. When you are on a network that requires proxy authentication, MOTODEV Studio updates will only occur if the proxy information (including username and password) are manually set for both HTTP and HTTPS connections (in Preferences, under General > Network Connections ). This also affects the download and install of the Android SDK during the installation process. If during installation you are asked if you want to change the connection preferences, do so. Change the active provider to "Manual" and provide host, port, user, and password values for both the HTTP and HTTPS schemes. Just tested it: it does prompt me for my credentials... once. The first time I try to validate an xml file like the one below. But after that, it does not ask me for those credentials again. So basically, Eclipse needs your full internet credentials to be able to validate xml files at any times: proxy, port, username, password. But when you must store the password, then a master password comes in play , and will be asked for at each Eclipse session (once): The information stored in the secure storage (say, a CVS password) is encrypted with a "master" password. The master password is retrieved from a "password provider module". There are three password provider modules included in the SDK: the default UI module in the org.eclipse.equinox.security.ui the Windows-specific module in the org.eclipse.equinox.security.win32.x86 the Mac-specific module in the org.eclipse.equinox.security.macosx
