Unstandardize Logistic Regression Coefficients

Given design matrix X and vector of binary responses y, we can standardize X and fit a logistic regression and obtain "standardized" coefficients. How can I obtain the unstandardized coefficients? I know how to do it for linear regression, but not for logistic regression. The reason I require this is that I am fitting a penalized logistic regression of sorts (my own algorithm, different from usual glmnet etc.).
