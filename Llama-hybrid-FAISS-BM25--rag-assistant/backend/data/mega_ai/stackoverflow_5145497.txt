Open video with html5 from assets

I have an app that has HTML and mp4 files. I play these mp4 video files with the tag in the HTML code. I can do it successfully only when the mp4 files are in the sdcard, but when I add the mp4 files to the assets or rest folder the videos can not play. I read all videos in the assets folder (*.mp4) and copy these files to: /data/data/packaganame/ My code to copy from assets to the "/data/data/packaganame/" folder is: InputStream isVideo = null; isVideo = getApplicationContext().getAssets().open("video.mp4"); File fl = new File("/data/data/packaganame/videoout.mp4"); bufEcrivain = new BufferedOutputStream((new FileOutputStream(fl))); VideoReader = new BufferedInputStream(isVideo); byte[] buff = new byte[32 * 1024]; int len; while( (len = VideoReader.read(buff)) > 0 ){ bufEcrivain.write(buff,0,len); } bufEcrivain.flush(); bufEcrivain.close(); I execute this code for each video, and I don't get any exception. But when I try play the video, I get: "can not play video". My HTML code is correct because it works fine when the tag read from sdcard: My videos and my HTML files are in the same directory. Any ideas please?
