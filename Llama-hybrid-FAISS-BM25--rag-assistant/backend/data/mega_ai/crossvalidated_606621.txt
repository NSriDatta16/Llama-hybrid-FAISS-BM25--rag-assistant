How to generalise the results of cross correlation?

Data: I have 1000 independent time series. Each of these 1000 contains two variables A & B. Goal: My goal is to find out whether there is a statistically significant correlation between A & B for ALL 1000 time series. Problem: I have performed cross-correlation for each of these 1000 time series separately and found out that in some cases A&B are indeed correlated but in some cases, they are not correlated at all. Question: How should I generalise this result and make a statement about all the 1000 entries as a whole? How do I test if the few entries that are correlated are actually significant?
