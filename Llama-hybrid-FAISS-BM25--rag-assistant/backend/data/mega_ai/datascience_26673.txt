Unfortunately, it seems like there is no hlim parameter incorporated into sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest . Calculation of anomaly score is just based on the depth each point settles to and by the average path length. The only way to tune in a bit is by using contamination which calculates the threshold needed to set for anomaly score. To achieve the granularity that was given in the original paper using hlim=6 to detect a cluster of small points, using a lot of estimators may solve the problem (still depends heavily on how you sample data from smaller cluster into a lot of estimators). But if that small cluster of data is very less in number, I don't think this idea works and there is nothing much we can do from the current implementation in sklearn . Hope this helps.
