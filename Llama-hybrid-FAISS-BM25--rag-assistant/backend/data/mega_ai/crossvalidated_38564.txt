If you are familiar with convex optimization, I suspect this can be formalized as a quadratic programming problem (or some other convex problem) and then solved with a QP solver. If this direction interests you, I can elaborate further. Regardless of the method which is used, if the problem is convex (there are a number of ways to check this and I know that unconstrained logistic regression is convex) you are guaranteed that a local minimum will also be a global minimum. I might be mistaken, but it seems to be convex because if the original solution space is convex and the set of positive solutions is also convex (it is a cone), the new problem would be convex since an intersection of convex sets is convex. But this is hand-waving, best to examine it formally.
