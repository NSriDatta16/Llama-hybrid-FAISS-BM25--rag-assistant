handling outliers can be managed by : 1. ignoring them 2. scaling the data reducing the affect of the outliers on your data 3. using a higher level curve fitting algorithm 4. adding more categories and aggregating the data into an average. If the data was not normal distributed, you would apply a feature transformation In such cases, the extreme values could be identified and removed in order to make the distribution more Gaussian. These extreme values are often called outliers Taking the square root and the logarithm of the observation in order to make the distribution normal belongs to a class of transforms called power transforms.
