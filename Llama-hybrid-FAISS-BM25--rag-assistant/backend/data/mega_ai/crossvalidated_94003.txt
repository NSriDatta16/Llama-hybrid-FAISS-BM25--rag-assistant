Does using a kernel function make the data linearly separable? If so, why using soft-margin SVM?

I'm reading about SVM and I learned that we use a kernel function so the data become linearly separable in the high dimensional (vector?) space. But then I also learned that they use the soft-margin idea. But my question is why to use a soft-margin if the data is going to be linearly separable anyway in the high space? Or does that mean that even after mapping with the kernel it doesn't necessarily mean that it will become linearly separable?
