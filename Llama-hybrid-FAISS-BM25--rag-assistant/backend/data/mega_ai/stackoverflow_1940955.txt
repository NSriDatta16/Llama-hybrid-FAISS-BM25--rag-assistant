Get URI fragment (hash) to affect SEO? Get indexed by SEs?

I am building a forum site where the post is retrieved on the same page as the listing via AJAX. When a new post is shown, the URI fragment is changed (ex: .php#1_This-is-the-first-post). Also the title and meta tags are changed. My question is this. I have read that search engines aren't able to use #these-words. So therefore, my entire site won't be able to be indexed (as it will look like one page). What can i do to get around this, or at least make my sub-pages be able to get indexed? NOTE: I have built almost all of the site, so radically changes would be hard. SEO is my weakest geek-skill.
