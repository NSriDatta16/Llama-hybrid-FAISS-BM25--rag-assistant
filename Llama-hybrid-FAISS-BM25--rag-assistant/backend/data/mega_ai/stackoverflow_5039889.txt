Where to put the equality function for a class in a third party library?

I'm using a third party library containing a class which lacks both operator==() and Equals(). I'd like to implement one myself, but I'm not sure how to name it and where to put it. I've tried to add both operators as an extension method, but both failed. I've now written an IsEqualTo() function, but it results in rather confusing client code. Does anyone know a more elegant solution?
