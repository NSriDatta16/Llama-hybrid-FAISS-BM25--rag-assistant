What do these do in php regex?

I found: 1 - $milk = preg_replace( "/(\(\s*)(.+?)(\s*\))/","",$milk); 2 - $milk = ereg_replace( "[^[:space:]A-Za-z0-9&_-]", "", $milk); $milk is a large string about a paragraph say. What do 1 and 2 do to $milk? Also, ereg has been deprecated acording to php manual. Can this be replaced with some other php in the above code?
