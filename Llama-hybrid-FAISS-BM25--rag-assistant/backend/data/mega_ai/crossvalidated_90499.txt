How to include number of not-yet-decayed radioactive atoms in MLE?

Since this question received absolutely zero attention, here's a complete rephrase with the aim of significantly shortening it. I have a potful of $n$ radioactive atoms. I spend $t_\text{max}$ = 1 hour recording the times when I see an atom decay. Then I'm left with $n-k$ atoms in the pot and $k$ measurements of the times: $t_1, \dots, t_k$. As you know, the distribution of these times is exponential, $p(t) = a e^{-a t}$, and I wish to find the decay rate $a$ using maximum likelihood estimation. One way is to restrict the distribution to the interval $[0, t_\text{max}]$ and use $p(t) = a e^{-a t} / (1-e^{-a t_\text{max}})$ for the deriving the MLE. This method doesn't use the information that there were $n-k$ atoms left after $t_\text{max}$ (which in itself would be usable for estimating $a$, where this estimate may be somewhat different from what I get from the MLE). Question: How can I make use of the number of remaining atoms in the fitting procedure, while still using maximum likelihood estimation? My question is in fact general, and could be asked about any distribution defined on $[0, \infty)$, not only the exponential one. The story above was just an example that made it easier to explain the problem concisely.
