Imputing a missing variable based on common variables with another data set

I have 2 data sets: $A$ and $B$. The variables are common to both data sets with the exception of two, which are both missing in A. Let's call those two additional variables: $b_1$ and $b_2$. We can call the other variables $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n\}$. I would like to use $X$ to impute the corresponding $b_2$ variable for $A$, which we can call $a_2^*$. I would then like to use $b_2, a_2^*$ and $X$ to impute the corresponding variable in dataset $A$, which we can call $a_1^*$. Two additional caveats to note: The support of $b_2$ is a limited, discrete set of integers. I would like for $a_2$ to share those characteristics in that $a_2$ also takes on integer values and does not exceed the minimum or maximium of $b_2$. $b_1$ is distributed log-normally in theory, and in practice, is continuous and greater than zero but top-coded. I had two potential solutions but cannot reason through the trade-offs or whether both are wrong altogether. APPROACH I. To get $a_2^*$: regress $b_2$ on $X$ in dataset $B$. Get the fitted values. Predict $a_2^*$ using the $X$ in dataset $A$. Round $a_2^*$ accordingly so that is takes on the appropriate domain. I would then get $a_1^*$ in a similar way: regress $\log(b_1)$ on $b_2$ and $X$ in dataset $B$. Get fitted values. Predict $\log(a_1^*)$ using the $X$ and $a_2^*$ in dataset $A$. APPROACH II. Divide the $X$ into "bins" such that the bins are the same in both data sets. For example, if $X$ is year of birth and country of birth, form thinly divided country-year combinations that overlap in both datasets. This could be: a) dividing the birth year into 5-year ranges for each country; b) divide the countries into regions and combine the regions; c) or, if the data are sufficiently rich, use each cross pair of country and birth year. Estimate the average value within each bin of $b_2$ and round to the nearest integer within the doamin. $a_2^*$ is the average of the $b_2$s corresponding with the $X$ variables in dataset $A$. Repeat the same procedure for $a_1^*$ using $b_1$ and adding $b_2$ to the mix, but no need to round.
