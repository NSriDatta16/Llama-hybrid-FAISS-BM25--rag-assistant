As a concept, the idea is pretty simple. Do the results make sense? Creating a numerical example, or doing it for that matter, isn't trivial. Bayesian hypotheses are combinatoric. While Frequentist methods only have a null and an alternative, Bayesian hypotheses are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. That can lead to many potential models to test. Now imagine that you are testing a physical process, and the dense region of your estimate for some parameter is $9.1 You know that if $\mu_x\approx{9.1}$ , or greater, then the object you are using should tear apart because the tensile strength of the materials wouldn't handle that. Nonetheless, the object you are testing is in good shape. That would imply that this model is wrong. If that is your best model, then all may be wrong, and you need to consider models in addition to the models you have already built. That type of reality check requires a domain expert. If you were testing the object and were not an engineer or materials scientist, then you need to get one and find out what you are doing wrong.
