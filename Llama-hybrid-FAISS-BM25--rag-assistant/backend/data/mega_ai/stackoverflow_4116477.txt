Refactor, Organize Usings commands missing from Visual Studio context menu

In VS 2010, Silverlight, C#. I have multiple .cs files. In some of them the 'Refactor' and 'Organize Usings' (among other items) in the right-click context menu are missing. Why are they missing? How can they be brought back?
