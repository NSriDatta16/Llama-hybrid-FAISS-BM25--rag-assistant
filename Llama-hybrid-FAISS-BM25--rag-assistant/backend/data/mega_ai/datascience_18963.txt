Learning ranking

This is a sort of a follow-up to this newbie question: Suppose I want learn ranking (so, I have a bunch of data points, ranked $1, 2, 3, ...$ Now, one way is to use something like logistic regression with training data pairs of data points, and labels like $(a, b) \to \mathbf{TRUE}.$ The other way is to have single datapoints and labels the actual rank value (like $a\to 1, b\to 17, \dots.$) Both methods have obvious drawbacks: the first that there is a quadratic amount of somewhat redundant data, the second that the rank is somehow not really a real number, and the actual differences of the scoring function between adjacent ranks could be wildly variable. Is there any prevailing wisdom on this?
