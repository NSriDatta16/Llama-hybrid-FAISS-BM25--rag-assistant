appropriate start on a Dentist Application

I have been planning to build a Dentist Application for the use of the Dentist to add patients(with medical profiles...), organize visits, manage balance/fees....etc I know Java, .NET( C#) (some windows forms), and Python. Do you have any suggestions with the language I should maybe start with and the framework and IDE that will make my life easier (and help me finish in a good amount of time). This program will be connected with a database of at least 1000 patients... IDE's I am familiar with : eclipse, Netbeans, and Visual Studio. I want suggestions with reason explanations (why would you favor C# over Java ....compatibility....etc) Thanks,
