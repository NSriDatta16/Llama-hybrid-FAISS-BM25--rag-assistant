We just went through the rather time consuming process of reviewing many (perhaps ten?) issue tracking systems to replace GForge which was getting in our way more than assisting. We considered free and commercial systems. To be frank, I was disappointed with all of the systems we reviewed. There's plenty of room for improvement in this domain. Many of them had poor interfaces ( OnTime , JIRA , Bugzilla ). Generally, our engineers were OK with this, but it's important for our project managers, system integrators and customers to be presented with an interface that is clear and aesthetically pleasing. I was surprised to find that very few supported nested sub-issues. In the software world it is, of course, very common to break down a task (an issue or a new feature) into smaller components and assign them to different people. However, most systems couldn't do that - or couldn't do it well. Some systems were very powerful and configurable but practically required third-party extensions or plugins to make them useful. I really liked the flexibility of JIRA and Trac for example, but we would have had to invest considerable time to configure the systems to make them pretty or more functional. Naturally, they're not the only features we were concerned with, but this post is already getting too long! Of course, your requirements are going to be different to ours - I encourage you to figure out what you require and investigate thoroughly. FogBugz , JIRA and Trac were on our short list and they all had some great features. But in the end they were beaten by a product that - to me - was previously unknown: VisionProject . VisionProject is attractive and strikes a good balance between powerful and easy to use. The only downside we're seeing at the moment is that their new (since v4.0) Ajax-y interface has been a little buggy. However, we've had multiple bugfixes overnight and sometimes within a couple of hours - kudos to their Ã¼ber-responsive development team. We're still putting the system under trial and, although not perfect, it's comparing extremely favourably against all the other contenders.
