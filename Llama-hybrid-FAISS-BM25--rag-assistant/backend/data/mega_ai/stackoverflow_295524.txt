Website image manager with copy/paste? (Flash?)

I'm looking for a web based upload manager, with good support for images. It should be as easy as possible for novice users to "add images to a website". I could use such a thing for two use cases: A CMS for external use, needs proper image support (1-file upload doesn't quite cut it). A Wiki for internal use, to get popular it will need the ability to put in screenshots easily without bothering with "save screenshot to file - upload file - put complicated markup on page to display image". Ideally, the thing I'm looking for shows galleries of uploaded images and allows the user to add/remove/replace images. I know there are probably a lot of server-side PHP scripts that can do things like this, in a pop-up window, or with AJAX, but where they're all lacking is in copy/paste support. Especially for the internal support site, a printscreen + paste would be an ideal solution, but I'm unable to find a package that supports this. I'm guessing this should be possible using Flash; unless there's no way to paste image data into a Flash file. I don't know much about that though. I could probably develop something myself, but I really don't want to have to learn Flash, and I don't have the $$ to pay for the Flash development tools. So tell me, is it even possible to copy/paste bitmap data into a Flash movie? And has someone perhaps already written an elegant image/upload manager that makes use of it?
