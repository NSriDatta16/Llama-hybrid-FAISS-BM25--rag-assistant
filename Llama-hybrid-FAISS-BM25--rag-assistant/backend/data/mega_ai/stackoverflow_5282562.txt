Unless I am missing something in your question, the svmutil.py script in the python subdirectory of the libsvm package offers a n-fold cross validation mode: -v n: n-fold cross validation mode The svm_train.java file in the java subdirectory also offers such an option: +"-v n : n-fold cross validation mode\n" You can have a look at those two files for some sample code.
