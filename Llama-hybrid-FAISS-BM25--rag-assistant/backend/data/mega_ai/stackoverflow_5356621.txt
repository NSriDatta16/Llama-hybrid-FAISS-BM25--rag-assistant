mssql, I need to set a varchar = every field in a row, delineated by a character

I have a table that has 4 rows, the first to ID them, and the other 3 to store data. E.G. ID ROW1 ROW2 ROW3 1 AB EF NG 2 CD GH OU 3 JK 4 LH I have three variables, let's say, @return1, @return2, and @return3, and I want to set them equal to every value in rows 1, 2, and 3, delineating the values by ';'. E.G. [some code here that I'm having trouble figuring out, this is what I need help with Produces this result: @return1 = AB; CD; @return2 = EF; GH; JK; LH; @return3 = NG; OU; Thanks so much for looking! I'm sure there is an easy and elegant way to loop through each row and accomplish this, I'm just having a bit of a time figuring out the right way to do this. If anyone could point me in the right direction about how to do this select, or how to loop through these, that would be excellent!
