Graph DB's Vs Azure Table storage for a Social networking application

I'm starting on some architecture work for a .Net based social networking application to be hosted on Azure cloud. we are going to be using ASP.NET MVC on the front end. i would like to consider the options for storage. considering scalability needs and due to the inter-connected nature of the application, SQL azure has been ruled out. what would be the main considerations in choosing a graph DB such as Sones GraphDB or neo4j which have features specific for a social networking application against using windows azure table storage to achieve the needs. i'm mostly concerned about development time, cost, ability to leverage existing skills like .NET and reliability of the graph DB platforms and ease of setup and administration.
