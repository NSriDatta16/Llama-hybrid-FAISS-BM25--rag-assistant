The GC is only used for reclaiming memory from discarded objects. Discard very little resources and you will get very little, shorter GCs. You might use lots of sockets, file handles, handles from external libs, but how fast do you discard them? A full GC is designed to remove fragmentation. It does this by copying all the memory so it is used continously. This is why its is expensive, so you want to minimise these if latency is important to you. That said, if your full GCs are taking more than 100 ms, you have a serious performance issue. It shouldn't be that high. IMHO, I short you should be able to develop a control system with a latency which is well under 10 ms, 99%+ of the time.
