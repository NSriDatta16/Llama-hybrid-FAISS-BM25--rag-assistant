Fun. Note: standard disclaimers apply. Knowns: #knowns grade_mean So my first thing is to ignore her peers and look at the window she can have. This presumes 1 point per correct question. #libraries library(prevalence) #what percentile is her grade b_test Here is techno-jargon. > b_test x n p method level lower upper 1 266 300 0.8866667 agresti.coull 0.95 0.8454742 0.9180820 2 266 300 0.8866667 exact 0.95 0.8452405 0.9202242 3 266 300 0.8866667 jeffreys 0.95 0.8471174 0.9188020 4 266 300 0.8866667 wald 0.95 0.8507954 0.9225379 5 266 300 0.8866667 wilson 0.95 0.8458006 0.9177555 The result (I prefer Jeffrey's prior) is that her "prevalence" or most likely actual level is about 88.7% of content was mastered. The window for that is between 84.7% and 91.8%. If the number of questions changes then this window changes. Let's compare this to the class. #what percentile is average grade b_test2 With results: > b_test2 x n p method level lower upper 1 242 300 0.8066667 agresti.coull 0.95 0.7580501 0.8475289 2 242 300 0.8066667 exact 0.95 0.7573637 0.8497963 3 242 300 0.8066667 jeffreys 0.95 0.7591588 0.8482913 4 242 300 0.8066667 wald 0.95 0.7619790 0.8513544 5 242 300 0.8066667 wilson 0.95 0.7582162 0.8473627 Which mean their typical mastery is about 80.7% but the actual window ranges from 75.9% to 84.8%. When I see that the lower edge of her window is so close to the upper edge of your daughter's then I think "she is substantially better than average". Given the large number of samples, their grades, and the assumption of a Normal distribution I get this. code + results: > pnorm(q=grade_sample, mean=grade_mean, sd=grade_std) [1] 0.9209904 translation: It thinks she might be in the 92nd percentile. This is only true if it is a normal distribution. That is a big if. Be careful with that.
