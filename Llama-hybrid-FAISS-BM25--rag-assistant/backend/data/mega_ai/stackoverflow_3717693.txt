Shared 'per request' storage for ASP.NET MVC controllers

In a standard ASP.NET webforms project, if I have a several user controls on a page that require the same data I'd tend to have the first user control put the data in the HttpContext.Current.Items collection so it was available for all the others. What's the nearest equivalent to this for a ViewResult on an MVC controller that's used multiple times on the same page? Thanks Edit: Basically the ViewReults here are content areas which appear more than once on a page, so I was looking to query the database once to get a collection of all the content for the page (when the first content area is laoded) rather than a separate query for each content area. Thought it would speed things up. Further info: Just to make it clear, the content controller action is used repeatedly as a 'RenderAction' from within pages that are served by an additional 'main' controller. Consequently I don't think I can use ViewData (or any other property on the controller class itself) as it's not shared between different instantiations of the same controller. I think I'm going to have to fall back on the HttpContext after all using a method such as this one .
