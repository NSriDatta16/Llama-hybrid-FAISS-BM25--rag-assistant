At first people are usually tempted to say: Well, just compute the covariance between the variables. However, this only assesses the linear relation between two variables. For example: If $y = \sin(x)$ then there is a very high relation between x and y but the covariance term will not necessarily give this pair a high value (in comparison to the other possible values) because the relation is not linear. The same reason applies to the model you suggest: Who will ever guarantee that the relation between the target variables and the M-variables will be of the shape you have modelled it? Without knowing more or making more assumptions about the distributions of the variables the only choice you have is to use a measure that attempts to model the non-linear relationships as well. Here are few hints into the general direction: 1) just draw a scatterplot and check by eye whether or not you can find some obvious relations that you could study in detail 2) compute the mutual information ( wikipedia ) of the M-variables and the X/Y-variables 3) For each of the target variables Y, X1, ..., X4 compute a model (random forest, gradient boosting, ...) with that variable as a target variable and then let the model give you the feature importance it thinks is correct.
