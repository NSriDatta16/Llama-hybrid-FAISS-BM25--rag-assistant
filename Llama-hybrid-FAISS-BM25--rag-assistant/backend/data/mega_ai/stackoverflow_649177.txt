How to determine if mouse is moving clockwise or counterclockwise?

I have an MFC appplication where the user have to move the mouse around a circle circonference with a dragging mouvement. I need to retrieve the number of degrees during this mouse drag "rotation" and I need to know if it's clockwise or counterclockwise. At first, to determine the rotation direction, I was comparing x-coordinnate between the current mouse position and the mouse position where the user clicked to initiate the dragging. That works well until the user rotate over 180 degrees. How can I handle the other half of the circle?
