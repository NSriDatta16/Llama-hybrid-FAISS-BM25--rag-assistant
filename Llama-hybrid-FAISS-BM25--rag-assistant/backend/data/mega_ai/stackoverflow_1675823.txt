Your problem is that you are probably not reaching the right element using: var myFlashMovie = document.getElementById('simpleUploader'); Your nested tags have the same id attribute, producing unexpected results. You should use SWFObject (a widely known and used flash embedding library) to embed your flash movie and use the method swfobject.getObjectById() to properly access your tags. To learn more about SWFObject, follow this link: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/ This is a beginners tutorial available from Adobe (for SWFObject): http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/swfobject.html Look for getObjectById() in the API documentation by following this link: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/api
