Windows App (One Click) Vs Web App

We are moveing our old Access VBA / SQL 2005 application to new technologys and have 2 options do we build a Windows Form Application with Microsoft One Click Deploy or a ASP.Net Website? The application is a work force mangement system booking jobs dynamic scheduling gantt chart components. It will be used by 400 + Users over 20 Locations. Can you give me some feedback on these options.
