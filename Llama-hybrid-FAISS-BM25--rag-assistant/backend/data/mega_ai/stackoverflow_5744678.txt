I think Francois has a great answer. I am also new to Xcode and was working through various tutorials using Xcode 3.2.6 and testing on iOS 3.1.3 device. The tutorials were for iOS 4.3, which all start by selecting a "View-based application." When I tested the tutorials they worked in the simulator but not on the device. I assume this is true for SDK 4 but I haven't tried it myself. I first received the error:"...specifies a minimum OS version of 4.3, which is too high to be installed on iPhone." Many other people have addressed this but it is fixed by going to Project>Edit Project Settings, selecting the Build tab, scrolling down to the Deployment section and changing the field "Development Target iOS" to be the same as the iOS on the device. Then the tutorial apps would launch on the phone but only a blank screen would show and I got the error: “SIGABRT” and "NSException" - even when I just tried to launch a simple HelloWorld app. This was caused by the self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController not being supported by iOS 3. To fix it go to the ___Delegate.m file and replace the line "self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController" with Francois' elegant solution: if([self.window respondsToSelector:@selector(rootViewController)]) { self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController; } else { [self.window addSubview :self.viewController.view]; } Now the View-based application template in SDK 3.2 works for iOS 3 and 4.
