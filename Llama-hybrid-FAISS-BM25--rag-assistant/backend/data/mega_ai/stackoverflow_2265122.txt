There's nothing wrong having ID's in the URL. It's done all over the place. For example: Here on Stack Overflow (/questions/ 2264708 /search-...) or Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/ 0735619670 /) Are just two examples and there are more. Embedding ID's into the URL is almost ubiquitous, especially for large sites or large datasets where doing string comparisons on slugs are costly. It will not hurt SEO at all. It might be a little less user friendly because users can't "guess" URL's, but that is a different problem altogether.
