gfortran started with version 4.0. Versions 4.1 and 4.2 are old and missing many features and may have bugs. You may run into additional missing features that are used by your code. I suggest, if at all possible, getting the compiler upgraded to the current stable version, which is 4.5. Supporting all versions of gfortran will lead to many restrictions on your code. It might be better to identify the earliest version that works and add that information to the documentation. For my code, that version is 4.3 since I make extensive use of the ISO C Binding. The gfortran wiki, http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran , has a changelog by version that might help you identify which version you need. The only sure way is to test. If you want to enforce a version requirement, you can test from within Fortran. You could run a small test program as part of the make process and abort if the gfortran version is too early. The following code fragment shows two ways of outputting the gfortran version number from a Fortran program. Name the program with filetype ".F90" so that gfortran will invoke the preprocessor. #ifdef __GFORTRAN__ write (*, '( "gfortran" )' ) write (*, '( I0, ".", I0 )' ) __GNUC__, __GNUC_MINOR__ ! Merged version number: #define GCC_VERSION (__GNUC__ * 10000 + __GNUC_MINOR__ * 100 + __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__) write (*, '( I0 )' ) GCC_VERSION #endif
