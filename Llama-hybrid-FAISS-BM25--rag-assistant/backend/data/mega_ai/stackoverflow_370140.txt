There are tons of controls, silverlight.net is a good place to start. Infragistics and Telerik are making prebuilt controls for Silverlight, other third parties are coming on board as well. I notice most of your examples are audio and video players- I don't think there are any separate controls for that, audio and video playing is baked directly in. Google "silverlight controls" and you should have plenty to try out.
