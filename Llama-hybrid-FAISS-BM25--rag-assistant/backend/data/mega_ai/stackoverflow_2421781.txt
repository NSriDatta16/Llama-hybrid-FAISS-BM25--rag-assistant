You can use #pragma warning as shown on that MSDN page: #pragma warning(disable: 4995) Or, you can turn the warning off for the whole project in the project's properties (right click project -> Properties -> C/C++ -> Advanced -> Disable Specific Warnings). On the command line, you can achieve the same effect using /wd4995 .
