The answer to this question could range from a rather simple imputation of 'extra' values inserted at random to the smaller dataset to much more complex eg http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~jcaiado/Papers/Paper_LSSP0213_Revised.pdf Btw, I'd reclassify this question as 'unequal step size in time series' rather than unequal sample size. Also, this cross-correlation function discussion might be helpful Correlation between two time series
