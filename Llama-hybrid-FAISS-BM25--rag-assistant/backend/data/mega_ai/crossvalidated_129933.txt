How to analyze an inflection point in univariate time series?

I have a univariate time series with 36 data points (monthly data for 3 years). The general trend of this time series is relatively steep decline, but for the most recent one year, it is almost flat and looks even increasing with a close look. So the goal is to confirm statistically that we have an inflection point. What is a good way to test this?
