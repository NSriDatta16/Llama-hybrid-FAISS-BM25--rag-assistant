What you are missing is the key pair that was used to create the development certificate. I've been through this exact scenario and what you need is for your team agent to export his/her private key to send it to you so that you can install it in keychain on your machine. To do so they would need to start up Keychain Access.app, browse the certificates section of the app then they can right click on the private key and export it for you. They can set a password on the exported private key so that it can only be installed by people that have the password. Once that is done they send you the key and you install it into keychain on your development machine. You will then be able to use the certificate(s) they generate with that key.
