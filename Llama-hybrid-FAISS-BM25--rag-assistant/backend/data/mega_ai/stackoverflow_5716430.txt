Dividing binary image into 'blocks' of pixel data

I am using Python and PIL as part of my work on embedding data in binary images and need to analyse groups of pixels to determine appropriate pixels to manipulate in order to embed data. The image needs to be split into equal 'blocks' of pixel data ready for analysis, but I am struggling to come up with an appropriate method of doing this. I have tried techniques using Python and numPy arrays, but without success. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
