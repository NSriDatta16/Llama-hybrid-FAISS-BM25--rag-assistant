This would really depend on what kind of data you are transmitting.. If you have some static HTML elements on the front end that you only need to fill in with values, JSON is the fastest and easiest solution. For this, there are many, many, many client-side JS libraries out there. If this is your requirement, know that with this approach, your HTML already exists, either in the page, or in the client's memory as a template (depending on how you script it) As to the other option, I would suggest you only do that if you have some very.. "sophisticated" or really server-dependent HTML that only the server can generate... or if you are embedding HTML from someplace else that delivers HTML. Speed of generating a response is totally dependent on your server, and the way it is programmed.. Since JSON is smaller, it is usually faster, and there are numerous JSON libraries for all flavors of back-end programming.. I think you should look into some of the more UI-centric JS frameworks out there
