Mac + External drive not recognized as removable storage

I have a external 1TB drive which is not getting recognized by my program as removable storage device. I have in my code the following lines to detect the removable drives attached to the machine. NSArray *removableDrivesPaths = [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] mountedRemovableMedia]; Please can you guys tell me a method to get my external drives get detected as removable storage devices or if there is any other cocoa framework function that i can use to detect my external drives as removable storage devices. Thanks
