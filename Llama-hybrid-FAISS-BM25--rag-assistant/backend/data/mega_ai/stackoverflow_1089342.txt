ELMAH: ASP.NET security

I have an ASP.NET 3.5 application which is using the Visual Studio Development Server. I set ELMAH up, and it is working fine. I set up the AXD "file" and XML files (using XML as the storage medium) to be in a folder under the root: v3/elmah/ Now, I'd like to have it so that when elmah or elmah/elmah.axd (or anything in this directory) is requested, that a username/password dialog is presented. Right now, I have this in the web.config: Which is allowing all authenticated users, I believe. I've tried to disable anonymous access to that directory, but the file is still being served. Is there something I need to change in the Security of the file system? BTW, this is XP SP3. Thanks all!
