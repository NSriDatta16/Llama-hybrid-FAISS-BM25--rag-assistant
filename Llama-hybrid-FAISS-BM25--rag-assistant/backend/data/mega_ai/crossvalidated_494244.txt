Some issues to consider here: First, the number of cases is very small, regardless of whether your sample is representative of the population. That leads to: Second, your CV is necessarily something close to leave-one-out CV (in this case, one per group), which is known to have high variance. See Section 5.1.4 of An Introduction to Statistical Learning . With your approach, you only have a total of 81 models (9*9) among which to average. Third, accuracy is a poor measure of model performance . So try broader approaches for hyperparameter choices, like multiply repeated 5-fold CV (without necessarily limiting yourself to equal numbers of each class) or bootstrapping. During CV or bootstrapping, use a proper scoring rule like log-loss (equivalent to the logistic regression maximum-likelihood deviance criterion) or the Brier score (the classification equivalent of mean-square error) for evaluating performance. You will still be limited by the small number of cases and potential un-representativeness of your sample. But those approaches probably have a better chance of working with your present data set.
