max ( x + y − 1 , 0 ) {\displaystyle x*y=\max(x+y-1,0)} Gödel–Dummett logic is the logic of the minimum t-norm x ∗ y = min ( x , y ) {\displaystyle x*y=\min(x,y)} Product fuzzy logic is the logic of the product t-norm x ∗ y = x ⋅ y {\displaystyle x*y=x\cdot y} Monoidal t-norm logic MTL is the logic of (the class of) all left-continuous t-norms Basic fuzzy logic BL is the logic of (the class of) all continuous t-norms It turns out that many logics of particular t-norms and classes of t-norms are axiomatizable. The completeness theorem of the axiomatic system with respect to the corresponding t-norm semantics on [0, 1] is then called the standard completeness of the logic. Besides the standard real-valued semantics on [0, 1], the logics are sound and complete with respect to general algebraic semantics, formed by suitable classes of prelinear commutative bounded integral residuated lattices. History Some particular t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and investigated long before the family was recognized (even before the notions of fuzzy logic or t-norm emerged): Łukasiewicz logic (the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) was originally defined by Jan Łukasiewicz (1920) as a three-valued logic; it was later generalized to n-valued (for all finite n) as well as infinitely-many-valued variants, both propositional and first-order. Gödel–Dummett logic (the logic of the minimum t-norm) was implicit in Gödel's 1932 proof of infinite-valuedness of intuitionistic logic. Later (1959) it was explicitly studied by Dummett who proved a completeness theorem for the logic. A systematic study of particular t-norm fuzzy logics and their classes began with Hájek's (1998) monograph Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic, which presented the notion of the logic of a continuous t-norm, the logics of the three basic continuous t-norms (Łukasiewicz, Gödel, and product), and the 'basic' fuzzy logic BL of all continuous t-norms (all of them both propositional and first-order). The book also started the investigation of fuzzy logics as non-classical logics with Hilbert-style calculi, algebraic semantics, and metamathematical properties known from other logics (completeness theorems, deduction theorems, complexity, etc.). Since then, a plethora of t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and their metamathematical properties have been investigated. Some of the most important t-norm fuzzy logics were introduced in 2001, by Esteva and Godo (MTL, IMTL, SMTL, NM, WNM), Esteva, Godo, and Montagna (propositional ŁΠ), and Cintula (first-order ŁΠ). Logical language The logical vocabulary of propositional t-norm fuzzy logics standardly comprises the following connectives: Implication → {\displaystyle \rightarrow } (binary). In the context of other than t-norm-based fuzzy logics, the t-norm-based implication is sometimes called residual implication or R-implication, as its standard semantics is the residuum of the t-norm that realizes strong conjunction. Strong conjunction & {\displaystyle \And } (binary). In the context of substructural logics, the sign ⊗ {\displaystyle \otimes } and the names group, intensional, multiplicative, or parallel conjunction are often used for strong conjunction. Weak conjunction ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } (binary), also called lattice conjunction (as it is always realized by the lattice operation of meet in algebraic semantics). In the context of substructural logics, the names additive, extensional, or comparative conjunction are sometimes used for lattice conjunction. In the logic BL and its extensions (though not in t-norm logics in general), weak conjunction is definable in terms of implication and strong conjunction, by A ∧ B ≡ A & ( A → B ) . {\displaystyle A\wedge B\equiv A{\mathbin {\And }}(A\rightarrow B).} The presence of two conjunction connectives is a common feature of contraction-free substructural logics. Bottom ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } (nullary); 0 {\displaystyle 0} or 0 ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {0}}} are common alternative
