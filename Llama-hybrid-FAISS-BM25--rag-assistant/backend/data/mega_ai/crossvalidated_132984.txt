Bias the classification in logistic regression

I want to make my classifier prioritise finding true cases (1) even if that means that a lot of the false cases (0) are also classified as true. Specifically I wish to find the weights to my features that gives at least 97 % of my true cases as true and as a small fraction as possible of my false cases as false. What should I be looking for in a logistic regression setting? Of course I can just adjust the intercept but I assume that there must be some better way?
