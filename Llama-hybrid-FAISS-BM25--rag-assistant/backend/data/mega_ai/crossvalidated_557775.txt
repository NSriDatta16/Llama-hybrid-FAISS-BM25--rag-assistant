In the Bayesian framework the prior is considered known and not something to be recovered. When you turn a prior into a posterior you condition on observed data. You correctly identified that a belief interpretation can be applied to both the prior and the posterior. This prior and posterior belief is in regards to the unknown fixed true $p$ , before and after the data are observed. When you selected $p$ 's from $\text{Uniform}(0.25,0.4)$ and generated "observable" data, this represents a prior predictive distribution. It is not how the actual data generative process operates (because in truth $p$ is an unknown fixed constant), but the prior predictive distribution represents a prediction for a single as-of-yet unobserved $x$ based on not knowing the true $p$ . It is predictive belief. Since the prior predictive distribution does not produce observable data, it is not something that would be used to construct a posterior. If someone handed you a posterior and the observed data you could in principle reverse engineer the prior or something close to it, but the prior is considered known or given.
