It's not possible to keep the state 'automatically'. However, using the navigation framework in SL3 you can achieve some level of statefulness: when you click 'Refresh' the application will restart but will navigate to the same page it was before. Something similar is done in Quince: http://quince.infragistics.com/#/Search/ViewPattern $pattern=Action+Links The part of the URL after # is read by the application and makes it navigate to the same place always. This will not work if there's a lot of data to persist, as you need to keep state in the URL. However, has the nice side effect of enabling deep linking.
