If I host a javascript file on my server that users can embed in their webpages, is it possible to identify the URLS that embedded my file? window.location.href should give you the embedding document's URL. You could send that to your server by, say, loading an image: url = window.location.href; img = document.createElement("img"); img.setAttribute("src", "http://myserver.com/counthit?url="+url); Alternatively, you could catch the HTTP_REFERER header on server side. Always note that both these values can be faked by individual clients. They can't be used for anything security relevant! However, they are fairly reliable for gathering statistical data or for getting an overview of sites that use your hosted script.
