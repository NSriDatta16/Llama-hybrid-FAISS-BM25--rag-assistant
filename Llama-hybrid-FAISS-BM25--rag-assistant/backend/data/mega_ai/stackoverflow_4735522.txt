Magento: template based on attribute set

I want to create different product views based on the attribute set the product belongs to: does Magento provide a way to do this? - UPDATE - Following dan.codes suggestion I've added $update->addHandle('PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTE_SET_ID_'.$product->getAttributeSetId()); to Mage_Catalog_ProductController (I duplicated ProductController.php and put it in local/Mage/Catalog/controllers/). Then I added this to catalog.xml // PRODUCT ID of Book Attribute Set Catalog Product View (Book) just after Catalog Product View (Virtual) I then created catalog/product/view/attribute_set/book.phtml, but it is not displayed in my product view page. - UPDATE MAGENTO 1.5 - I've noticed that the handler update has moved in the last Magento release. $update->addHandle('PRODUCT_TYPE_'.$product->getTypeId()); $update->addHandle('PRODUCT_'.$product->getId()); is in Mage/Catalog/Helper/Product/View.php now. I've tested and it still works great!
