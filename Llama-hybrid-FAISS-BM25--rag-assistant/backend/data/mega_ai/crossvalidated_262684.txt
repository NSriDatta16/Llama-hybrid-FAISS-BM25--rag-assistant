According to this Google group Random Forest of H20 calculates probabilities at each leaf rather than calculating a vote. And the prediction is the average of probabilities instead of average of votes. And according to this benchmark the Random Forest of H20 is more accurate than classical Random Forest (randomForest function in R and Random Forest in scikit-learn in Python).
