Check out reCaptcha - http://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/ , it's really easy to implement. It's not likely that someone is coming in and manually entering these things. It's probably a bot. Not sure if its malicious, not going to attempt to find out. It's someone trying to make money, through ad views, or worse exploiting browser flaws and installing malware, or any other number of things. Either way you want it gone and a CAPTCHA is a great way to do it. Another thing you can do is block the IP address of whoever is posting the stuff, that can help cut it down as well. Of course it's trivial for them to use a proxy, or whatever, but you can never stop this stuff completely. It's basically a war and winning little battles can go a long way. Edit In regards to your idea of analyzing the text, that is a massive task that has been worked on since spam started. You can do research on how email spam is filtered with bayesian analysis and heuristic approaches. You won't want to spend that much time on it though, trust me. If you want to just use something off the shelf, check out akismet - http://akismet.com/ , it kinda rolls up that functionality in an API. It started as a wordpress plugin, and has evolved to a stand alone project that you can throw a comment at, and it will reply with the likelihood of it being spam.
