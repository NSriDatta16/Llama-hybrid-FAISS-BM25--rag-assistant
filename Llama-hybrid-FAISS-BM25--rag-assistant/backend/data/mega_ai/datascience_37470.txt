Can Generative Adversarial Network be run on any embedded / edge device?

I am using DCGAN ( Deep Convolution GAN ) to generate images. However, I want to run it on embedded devices, such as Intel Movidius or Jetson . But, while going through several internet articles, I came to know that embedded devices are only used for inference in case of deep learning. I have a few questions : GAN is basically a generative network. How can it have inference ? Will the inference and training be same thing for GAN ? Can it (GAN) be run on embedded devices , where memory is really an issue?
