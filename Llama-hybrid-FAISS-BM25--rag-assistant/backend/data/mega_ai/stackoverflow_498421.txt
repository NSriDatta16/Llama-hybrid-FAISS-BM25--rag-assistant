This is a common concern I hear from many programmers who come from a C, C++, or other statically typed language where variables are pre-declared. In fact it was one of the biggest concerns we heard when we were persuading programmers at our organization to abandon C for high-level programs and use Python instead. In theory, yes you can add instance variables to an object at any time. Yes it can happen from typos, etc. In practice, it rarely results in a bug. When it does, the bugs are generally not hard to find. As long as your classes are not bloated (1000 lines is pretty huge!) and you have ample unit tests, you should rarely run in to a real problem. In case you do, it's easy to drop to a Python console at almost any time and inspect things as much as you wish.
