Where to set up the range of page for the pagination in Magento?

I know I already did it, it is somewhere in the backend... but can't remember where. I need to limit the number of page displayed by the paginator show 5 pages: [1] - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 > show 10 pages: [1] - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 > Thank you.
