rails: data being deleted on page reload

I have a method in my application helper that is meant to deactivate a task in my database. Application helper: def link_to_destroy_task(task_id) Task.find(task_id).deactivate end Model: def self.deactivate() update_attribute(:active, false) end View: [drag] "com_tasks", :action => "edit", :id => task.id %> For some reason when the page loads it is deleting everything from the list. Not just switching active to false. It is completely wiping it from the database. I am using fixtures, so I reload all the test data, and I can refresh once to see the data again, but the next time I reload it is gone. I have changed the name of the method to 'deactivate' because I think destroy is already taken, but the method is still being run without being clicked. It isn't deleting anymore, but it is deactivating everything.
