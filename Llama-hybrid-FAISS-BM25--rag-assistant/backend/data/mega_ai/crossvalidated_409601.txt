Model with target as feature for benchmark

I was reading this article ( https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-the-popularity-of-instagram-posts-deeb7dc27a8f ) about predicting the popularity of Instagram post using different techniques and one of the steps the author takes is to use a XGBoost model with the target variable as a feature to get a benchmark score. Anyone can explain me what is the point of this approach? Is it to have a guess about the maximum score a model without the target variable could get? Thank you for your answers!
