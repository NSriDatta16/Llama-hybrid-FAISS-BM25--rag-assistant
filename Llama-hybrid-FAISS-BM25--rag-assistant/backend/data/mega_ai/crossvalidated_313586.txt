VAR lag selection tests: Which one do I choose?

When running varselect in R, I usually get a few different models to choose from based on different statistics. I know of: Akaike information criterion (AIC) Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz criterion (SC) Final Prediction Error (FPE) criterion Hannanâ€“Quinn information criterion (HQC) What is the practical difference between these tests and under what circumstances should I prefer one over the other?
