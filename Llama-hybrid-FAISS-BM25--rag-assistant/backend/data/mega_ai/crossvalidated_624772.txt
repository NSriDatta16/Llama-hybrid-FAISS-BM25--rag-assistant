HAC Standard Errors - Number of Lags in an Unbalanced Panel

I am working on a panel dataset with a lot of missing data. Because I have reason to believe that the error terms are autocorrelated, I want to use HAC (Newey West) standard errors. I am unsure how to choose how many lags to include. In a typical time series analysis (i.e. not in a panel), people often suggest setting the number of lags to $T^{\frac14}$ . However, for an unbalanced panel, I am unsure if I should use the longest available time series or the shortest available time series for $T$ . The length of the time series of different entities in my sample varies significantly so that if I use the length of the longest time series for $T$ , the number of lags suggested by $T^{\frac14}$ would be longer than the entire time series I have for some entities. Would this make the model misspecified? A different thing that might affect my choice of the lags to include is that I expect there is a particular autocorrelation structure. I have monthly level data, and once a year, something happens that shakes up the correlation between data points. Thus, an observation from January of a year will have low autocorrelation to an observation from December of the preceding year, but an observation from December will be correlated with all 11 preceding months of the year.
