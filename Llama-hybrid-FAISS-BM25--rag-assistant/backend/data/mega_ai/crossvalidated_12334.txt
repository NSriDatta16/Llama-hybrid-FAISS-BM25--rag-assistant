Does the average increase of a "re-roll" increase with the size of the dice?

I'm having trouble modeling the following scenario: Roll two dice and take the best result. What is the proper way to model the average result from this? I understand intuitively that the average should go up, but I'm having trouble understanding exactly what plays into this increase. Furthermore, is the increase greater or simply proportional in dice of larger size (more sides)? For comparison's sake, consider a normal 6-sided die, and a 12-sided die.
