I would break out each product variant (color, size, features) into its own category and use VAR (Vector Auto Regression) It is a nifty form of time series which takes into consideration the typical time series stuff, but also builds in regressions for each predictor (weighted by lag periods) that computes the influence of each of the predictors on the others and the outcome at future times. It is a useful way of doing multivariate time series forecasting!
