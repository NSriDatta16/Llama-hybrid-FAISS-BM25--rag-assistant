Use jQuery/Javascript to create a list of all elements in a set

I want to use Javascript to loop through a set of elements, and create a list of labels for each one, so if the set of elements were as follows: Title Subheading Paragraph of text... It would give me the following: h1 h2 p Is it possible for jQuery/Javascript to return an element's type as a string, and if so how would I go about it?
