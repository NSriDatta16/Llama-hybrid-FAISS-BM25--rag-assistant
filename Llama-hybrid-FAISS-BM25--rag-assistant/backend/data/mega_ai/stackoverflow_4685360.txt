Ok, adding WAITFOR DELAY's to both SQL commands seems to have resolved the issue. sqlCmd.CommandText = String.Format("WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'; DELETE FROM dbo.EligibilityRecordKeyValue WHERE EligibilityRecord IN " + "(SELECT EligibilityRecord FROM dbo.EligibilityRecord WHERE Organization = '{0}')", map.Organization.Oid); sqlCmd.CommandText = String.Format("WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'; DELETE FROM dbo.EligibilityRecord WHERE Organization = '{0}'", map.Organization.Oid); Anyone know why this happens?
