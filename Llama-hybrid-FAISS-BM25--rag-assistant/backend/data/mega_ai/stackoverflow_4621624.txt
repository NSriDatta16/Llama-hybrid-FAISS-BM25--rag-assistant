There are two obvious possibilities for how the remote server is attaching your code that spring to mind. The first is using JavaScript to instruct the client to go out and get your content, then write it to the appropriate locations. This should be rather obvious when looking at the HTML source code generated by their application. The more likely scenario, in my opinion, is that they use CFHTTP to retrieve the content and inject it directly. CFHTTP mimics a broser call -- it's a standard HTTP 1.1 request. It's not going to contain a reference to the url requested on their server. Unless you can convince them to add identifying information to the request, all you'll be able to tell on your server is that the request came from CF (by examining the remote agent).
