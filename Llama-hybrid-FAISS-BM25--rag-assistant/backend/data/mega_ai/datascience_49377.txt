Looking for a classification (?) algorithm for linearly separable but unlabeled data points

I have a dataset that is linearly separable with two lines - something like that: Now I'am looking for the right kind of algorithm to do what I guess a SVM would do with labeled data - find the margins or decision boundaries for each class (three in this case). I tried spectral clustering and Gaussian mixture, but those don't seem to work. Origin of the data: edges from tracked bounding boxes for cars on a three lane road. Thanks! Edit: K-Means is apparently not really working for this kind of distribution: I also tried out Ismor's suggestion to do some transformation before k-means, which results in: The output here is very sensitive to the setting of the origin for y0, I couldn't get it right...
