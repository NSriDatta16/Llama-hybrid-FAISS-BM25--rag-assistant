You can simply use the sales in the other DMAs as predictor time series. Another related approach to this problem is the synthetic cohort method. Both methods assume that your local advertising campaign does not spill over to the other DMAs that you are using as predictors or potential synthetic cohort donors. Often people will remove nearby geos from the set of predictors or potential synthetic cohort donors to check robustness to this assumption. This also assumes that the national campaign does not vary in intensity too much across the DMAs that don't have the local campaign in the same unit of time.
