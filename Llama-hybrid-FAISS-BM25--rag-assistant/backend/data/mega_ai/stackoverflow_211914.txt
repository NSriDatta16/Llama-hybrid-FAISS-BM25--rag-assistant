Sorry - the answer I offered was based on SQL Server, so the maintenance portion is not appropriate. But file I/O is accomplished at the hardware level and any database adds extra processing steps. The database will impose extra overhead when retrieving the document. When the file is on disk you are only as slow or as fast as the I/O on the server. You certainly should manage your meta in a database, but in the end you want the UNC of the file and point the user to the source and get out of the way. From a maintenance and administration perspective you will limit yourself to a SAN when dealing with MS SQL Server. Solutions like Documentum take a different approach with simple storage on the disk and allows you to implement a storage solution as you see fit. EDIT Let me clarify my statement - with SQL Server you have limited options when you exceed the physical storage capacity of the box. This is in fact one of the big weaknesses of Sharepoint that you are not able to simply attach any type of network storage.
