Mimicking batch file with C# with constraint

I have asked the question Mimic batch file with C# , and got some good answers. But, the problem is that these three commands should be run in the same process. vsperfcmd /start:coverage /output:run.coverage hello vsperfcmd /shutdown So, the Process.Start method Process.Start("vsperfcmd", "/start:coverage /output:run.coverage"); Process.Start("hello"); Process.Start("vsperfcmd", "/shutdown"); shouldn't work, as it runs three processes independently. Is there any other way to run those three commands in the same process? I mean, run one after another.
