Why do we multiply the centered data with eigen vector instead of taking inverse of the eigen vector while performing PCA

The question may sound stupid but I really don't understand the logic behind this. Whenever we do a PCA, we take a covariance matrix on the centered data and do eigen decomposition. In order to project the data to the new eigen basis, in all sources they take a dot product with the eigen vector itself instead of taking an inverse of the eigen vector to project the data to the new eigen basis. *Shouldn't the data be multiplied(dot product) with the inverse of the eigen basis vectors since M = inv(B2) B1, where B2 is the new basis(eigen) and B1 is our basis(standard basis) . Since B1 is a standard basis, M becomes M = inv(B2). Why is inverse not taken when projecting the data to new basis? Please explain
