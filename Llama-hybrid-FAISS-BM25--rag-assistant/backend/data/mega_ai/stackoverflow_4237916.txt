A service Bus helps you enhance your services architecture. Many organizations have what is refereed to as point to point or spaghetti integration. This is not good. A service bus would help you have a single point of integration. e.g. in the image you linked (The Azure Service BUS architecture), by adding the service to the ESB you can unify service authentication using Access Control even if they sit behind a firewall instead of each service being responsible for authenticating itself. Further , even if the address of the service changed you would only have to change it in one place (the ESB) instead of all the applications that reference it. A service bus can do many other things including validating services messages, enhancing them in case they don't meet your requirements, transforming them e.g from plain old XML to SOAP , routing messages, enhancing messages etc.
