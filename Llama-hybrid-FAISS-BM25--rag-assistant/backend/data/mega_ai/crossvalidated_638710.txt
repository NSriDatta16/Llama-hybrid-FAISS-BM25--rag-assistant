Is there a way to obtain the factor scores in AMOS by using the Bartlett method? How? I'm not sure if Bartlett scores can be obtained using AMOS , although they can be obtained using SPSS . You should have access to SPSS , as AMOS is a SPSS module. Bartlett scores, as well as Regression and Anderson-Rubin scores, can be extracted in SPSS by clicking on the "Scores" option. If it is not possible, will the factor scores produced by the different data imputation methods vary significantly among each other? Can you please provide me with some reading materials regarding this topic? Yes, Bartlett scores are very different from other types of factor scores $^1$ . For more information on factor scores in general, I highly recommend reading DiStefano, Zhu, & Mindrila (2019) and this CV post (specifically the answer provided by @ttnphns). If it is not possible, will the factor scores produced by the different data imputation methods vary significantly among each other? Yes, factor scores obtained via imputation methods are different. See Merkle (2011) for more information. $^1$ Briefly, an advantage of Bartlett scores is that they are unbiased. However, this is not always a desired property (e.g., when assigning scores to individuals for diagnostic purposes). References DiStefano, C., Zhu, M., & Mindrila, D. (2019).
