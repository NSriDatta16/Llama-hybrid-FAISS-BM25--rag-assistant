Calculating risk from multinomial logistic regression and competing risks

I’m interested in predicting certain events an entity can experience. With logistic regression I would estimate the risk of a single event using p= exp(ß0 + ß1*x1 + ... + ßk*xk)/(1+exp(ß0 + ß1*x1 + ... + ßk*xk)). Can I still use this formula if I obtain the coefficients using multinomial logistic regression? And if I include all possible events an entity can have, does that automatically take care of competing risks?
