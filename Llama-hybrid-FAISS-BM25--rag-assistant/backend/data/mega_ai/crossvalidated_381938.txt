How is probability y = j|X calculated from an ordinal logistic regression model?

I have an ordinal logistic regression model fitted with lrm from the rms library in R, and am presenting results as prob y = j|X using predict(fit, 'fitted.ind') . library(rms) library(foreign) df = somewhat likely 0.5; y >= very likely 0.12 pred.ind = round(predict(fit, type = "fitted.ind"), 2) head(pred.ind, 1) # predictions for the first subject # y = unlikely 0.5; y = somewhat likely 0.38; y = very likely 0.12 latex(fit, file = "") # see equation below The equation for the example model is below. I understand how to calculate the 'fitted' values ( predict(fit, 'fitted') : e.g., to calculate y >= somewhat likely (0.5, see above) for the first subject in the dataset (gpa = 3.26) I calculate: 1/1 + exp(2.374854 - 0.724819 * 3.26) = 0.5, However, I don't know how to calculate the 'fitted.ind' probabilities. How do I calculate the probability y = j|X? In the predictions for the subject above y = unlikely is the same as y >= somewhat likely, and y = somewhat likely is y >= somewhat likely - very likely, but I don't understand why.
