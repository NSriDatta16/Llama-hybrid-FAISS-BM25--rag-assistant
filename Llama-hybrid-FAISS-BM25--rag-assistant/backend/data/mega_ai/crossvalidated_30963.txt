Extremely large class set for support vector machine (SVM) classification

For a problem where I have tens of thousands of different classes, wouldn't it be very inefficient to use the typical multiclass methods? If I were to do one vs all, wouldn't that mean that I have would have to run through every individual classes before determining if a new set of data belongs to a certain class? That would be computationally very slow. Is there a way to get around this? Should I even use SVM's when it gets to such a size?
