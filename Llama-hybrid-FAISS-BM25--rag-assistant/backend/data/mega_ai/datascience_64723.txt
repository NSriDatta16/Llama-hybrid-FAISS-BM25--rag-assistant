Suppose we make a linear regression model on each of the 10 folds with the same number of features (say 2 for simplification) We will therefore have 10 sets of coefficients with the optimized values ​​of the parameters with each of the metrics (for example R2). In the end what model do we retain? (the best, the average values ​​obtained for each parameter, the model that obtained the average R2?) Ouvrir dans Google Traduction
