How to improve specificity with unbalanced data? (R caret package)

I am working on a classification problem where my outcome variable is either "Approved" or "Denied". The % of approvals in my dataset is roughly 60% and the denials make up roughly 30%. I have tried multiple models (random forest, decision tree, neural network, and gradient boosting machine). The highest specificity that I can achieve is with the random forest of 0.69. I also tried to balance the data within the "train" function of the caret package by down sampling, over sampling, SMOTE, and ROSE. I performed the sampling only within the training dataset using cross validation (10 folds). I am pretty new to machine learning, so any advice is appreciated. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the datasets or any code that I have written, so I am just looking for general suggestions relating to unbalanced datasets.
