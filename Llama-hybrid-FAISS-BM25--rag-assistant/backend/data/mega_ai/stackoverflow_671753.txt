Just an FYI, The release you refer to - 3.0.0-stable0 - is the first milestone release of the 3.0 line. This is the current, in progress version that has not yet been released. The current stable release line is 2.7 (current version: 2.7.3). If you are looking for a stable, mature product, you should base your opinions on 2.7.x, not 3.0. The practice is quite commonplace to have a "bleeding edge" product and a stable release product. It may be the terminology that has misled you. For more information on release naming in use by Terracotta, please have a look at the Buildology page. Regarding version numbers, this is regrettable, but necessary. In order for the product to improve, changes to the network protocol and underlying storage format happen from time to time. When these changes occur, the product is incompatible with prior versions. Rather than promise something that is not possible (backward compatibility) the Terracotta team has chosen instead to prohibit different versions from talking to one another. In the 3.0 line forward, the notion of a Stable Terracotta API has been introduced, which will lay the groundwork for some amount of compatibility between dot releases, e.g. 3.0.0 -> 3.0.1. HTH.
