correcting for small sample sizes

I have been toying with some data relating employment outcomes to choice of college major (which I got from a FiveThirtyEight Git repository). I have included a scatter plot where each point represents a college major, and the x and y axes represent the total number of students with that major and their average unemployment rate respectively. I'm noticing that there is a lot more variation in the majors with smaller numbers of students. Basically, I'm wondering whether that large amount of variation is just a result of having a large number of small sample sizes. Is there a way that I can correct for this? E.g. If one data point shows a z-score of -2, but there are only 400 students with the corresponding major, how can I compare that to a z-score of -1 accounting for 40,000 students? Should I really believe the former has better employment prospects than the latter?
