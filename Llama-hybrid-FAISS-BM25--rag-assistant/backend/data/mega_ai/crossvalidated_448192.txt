What is odd to many veterans of data science is that what is now often called a confusion matrix has been called a classification matrix in the past. Both have the same structure: predicted outcomes in the columns and actual outcomes in the rows. I've always found the term classification matrix to be less confusing than confusion matrix, and I don't see any advantages to using the newer term.
