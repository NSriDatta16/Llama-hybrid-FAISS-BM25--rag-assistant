Machine Learning tries to create systems that can learn from data. As such it can be used in a wide variety of settings, for example to make robots learn to walk or train virtual agents to play video games . Data science concerns itself with the extraction of knowledge from data. In order to do so it uses a bunch of different techniques from different disciplines. Machine learning includes some techniques that can be very useful for a data scientist such as deep learning, decision trees and different clustering algorithms. However, machine learning has more to offer than Data Science uses and Data Science does not solely rely on Machine Learning.
