Is it possible to merge credible intervals from different Bayesian prediction models into a single estimate?

The situation Imagine an archaeological site, 10.0m deep. For my study, I construct an "age-profile" for this site, i.e., I produce a model of age as a function of depth. There are various modelling tools to achieve this (eg., OxCal, Bacon, bchron). As I understand it, these procedures model age and depth using Bayesian analysis and MCMC. I am keenly interested in the age of an item found at a depth of 8.0 m. By using each of the three mentioned modelling-tools, I get 3 three different estimates of age at the exact depth of 8.0m. Along with each estimate, I get a 68% credible interval. But I do not have cause to a-priori prefer one model over another. Question Is there a way to treat this as an ensemble and combine these three different model estimates into a single estimate? I have thought about just calculating the mean along with the standard error of that mean. But it seems to me that I would lose quite a bit of information about the uncertainty of my age chronometer that is stored in the credible intervals this way. Say for example that all three models produced exactly/nearly the same posterior mean estimate, but with varying (and potentially wide) credible intervals. Using the above, I would then get an error of 0 or close to it. Am I wrong to be dissatisfied with this? In a frequentist setting, I would be tempted to just derive standard errors from the confidence intervals and do error propagation. But I am not sure this is possible with credible intervals. Update 1 Looking through the various tools, I have found in-built ways of extracting actual MCMC samples. And for the tools I could not, these are R-functions that I could somewhat easily modify to output what I want. This opens the door for pooling posterior samples and creating combined credible intervals - but I will have to spend some time checking the validity of a procedure like this (so I will not mark this answered just yet).
