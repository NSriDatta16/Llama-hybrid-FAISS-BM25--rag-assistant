In Cooca, NSApp is a global variable representing the shared NSApplication instance. To get the delegate, you can simply use id delegate = [NSApp delegate]; Setting the app delegate is pretty simple. In MainMenu.xib , File's Owner is the shared NSApplication instance. Instantiate your delegate class in MainMenu.xib (create an object and set its type to your delegate class), then drag the File's Owner delegate outlet to that instance.
