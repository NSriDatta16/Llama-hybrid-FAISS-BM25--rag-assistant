Our current project makes heavy use of drag+drop, using GWT and gwt-dnd you can do some very cool stuff. Standards based, and works in IE6, Safari, Firefox, Opera, etc.. The issue of how to transmit a file is a separate one I believe. As for FTP support, I see that as being mostly replaced with HTTP File Upload support. In the case you need more flexibility (progress bar, multiple file selection), then you can make use of flash to do this. You can use Javascript to interact with an invisible flash app which performs the file transfer. YUI's file upload control does this. You can see an example on Flickr's enhanced upload page. We've built a custom version designed for use with GWT apps. Same concept.
