Bayesian inverse modeling with non-identifiable parameters?

If I have a physical model \begin{equation} y = \frac{1}{\beta_0} (\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2) \end{equation} and want to estimate coefficients $\beta_0$ , $\beta_1$ , and $\beta_2$ from given data set $(y, x_1, x_2)$ , with regression I would typically have to combine them into two coefficients $\beta_1/\beta_0$ and $\beta_2/\beta_0$ since that would be what I would be able to solve (contributions from $1/\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ cannot be distinguished from each other individually). However, if I have separate prior distributions for $\beta_0$ , $\beta_1$ , and $\beta_2$ - is it possible to obtain sensible posterior distributions for each of them using MCMC or Laplace's method without combining the variables?
