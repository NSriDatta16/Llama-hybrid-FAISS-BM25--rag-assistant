Storing PDFs in MS Access Database using Forms

I need to store PDF files in an Access database on a shared drive using a form. I figured out how to do this in tables (using the OLE Object field, then just drag-and-drop) but I would like to do this on a Form that has a Save button. Clicking the save button would store the file (not just a link) in the database. Any ideas on how to do this? EDIT: I am using Access 2003, and the DB will be stored on a share drive, so I'm not sure linking to the files will solve the problem.
