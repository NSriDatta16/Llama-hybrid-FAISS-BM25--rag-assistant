Find out what GPU your laptop is, and compare it against this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs . Most likely, CUDA will not be supported. This doesn't necessarily prevent you from doing "GPU programming", however. If the GPU supports fragment and vertex shaders, you can use the fixed pipeline to send data to the card (for example, through texture data) and do your processing in a fragment shader. You will then do a read from the pixel buffer to get the data back into system memory. Though hackish, this approach was quite popular until CUDA and other frameworks like OpenCL were introduced.
