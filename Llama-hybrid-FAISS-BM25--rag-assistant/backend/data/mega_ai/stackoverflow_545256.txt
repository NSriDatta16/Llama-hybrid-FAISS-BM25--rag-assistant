How to drop WIMP for LAMP

Does anyone have an example of something that can not be done on a Windows2000 server using PHP5? UPDATE: Just to clarify, my problem isn't with IIS, or that I'm an "only open source" kinda guy. It's that the hosting is a terrible package across the board. The storage and bandwidth are ridiculous, there's no control panel so in order to do anything, even something as simple as setting up a cron job, requires contacting tech support, who grumbles about having to implement it and also seems to operate on the same timeline as the people on the island in lost. Why not just tell the client I hear you ask! Tried it and failed. The hosting company isn't a hosting company, it's a friend of the client and nothing I say makes a blind bit of difference. I know my client is paying through the teeth for a hunk of crap but they just wont listen. On top of that, I've had to make some minor, but fundamental changes to the code base to adapt to the servers funky set up which means I now have to maintain two code bases. My development version, and the live version. it's doable, but it's wasted effort and on a tight deadline, I have better things to do with my time. The only way I'm going to get my client to "do the right thing" is to come up with something that wont work because of the server. If not, I'll finish the job, upload it, wash my hands of it then never touch it again because it's more hassle than it's worth. I don't want to do that because I like to take pride in my work, but I will not waste my time compensating for a lazy ass server admin who really couldn't care less wether things work or not and I also wont take the blame for them either. This is my last ditch attempt to get help out a client who doesn't want to be helped. Maybe my title was misleading but I didn't want to bore everyone with the details, I just needed an answer and thought WIMP for LAMP would be the quickest way to ask. Moving to another WIMP environment wouldn't bother me, but as you can see, that's not going to happen.
