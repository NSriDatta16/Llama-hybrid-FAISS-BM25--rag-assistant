EDIT : @Ben, forget about the downvotes for no reason on your question, and... BE MY GUEST! :) I never coded with before, it was very fun. At this point, there is no bilinear interpolation. I might rework it and add more bells and whistles. If you want to achieve such an effect in javascript, you'll effectively have to use the tag. The principle consists in precalculating a distortion function in a buffer that is larger than the source image dimension. Have a look at the old Flipcode Art of Demomaking column: Bitmap Distortion . This is a good old gem :) The paragraph about the cache might not be relevant for a based implementation though. There are many Processing resources out there, so it's also a good idea to have a look at Processing.js .
