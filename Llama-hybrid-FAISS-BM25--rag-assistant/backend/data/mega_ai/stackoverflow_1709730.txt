The actual user interface requirements of the user-facing part of your system seem to be pretty minimal (ask question, get answer, branch to "next" question). I don't think there's any "obvious" platform to use. As always, a browser based system makes it easier for geographically scattered users to use a centralized system but will probably cost more in terms of development. The manager-facing part of the application is more interesting and for that I'd probably suggest a desktop application rather than a browser based one. I can see this relying on a lot of drag-and-drop and line-drawing type functionality and that kind of stuff is still easier to do on the desktop, at least in my opinion. Assuming that you can clearly define the kinds of question routing and decision points that a script has, and these decisions are relatively simple, I probably would write your own specification for how a survey is represented. The manager-facing application would create, edit, and save a specification and the user-facing application would read and step through one. Given my personal skill set, I'd probably write both applications in Delphi, develop an XML format to represent the survey specification, and consider either XML or relational storage for the back end depending on what you actually wind up doing with the data.
