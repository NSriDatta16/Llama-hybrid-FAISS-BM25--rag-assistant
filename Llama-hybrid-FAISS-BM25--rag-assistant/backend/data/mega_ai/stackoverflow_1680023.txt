Best storage engine for constantly changing data

I currently have an application that is using 130 MySQL table all with MyISAM storage engine. Every table has multiple queries every second including select/insert/update/delete queries so the data and the indexes are constantly changing. The problem I am facing is that the hard drive is unable to cope, with waiting times up to 6+ seconds for I/O access with so many read/writes being done by MySQL. I was thinking of changing to just 1 table and making it memory based. I've never used a memory table for something with so many queries though, so I am wondering if anyone can give me any feedback on whether it would be the right thing to do?
