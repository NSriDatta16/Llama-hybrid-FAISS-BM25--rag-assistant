Flash AS3 error when importing 3D-tweened movieclip

I've been working on an AS3 application and it's nearing completion. At the same time, one of the designers I work with has been building a movieclip in a separate .fla that acts as an intro animation to the application. The intro uses the 3D motion tweening capabilities of Flash CS4 / Player 10, and runs fine in the .fla in which it was built. The problem is that when I import the movieclip into the main .fla for the application, when I dynamically instantiate the movieclip and add it to the stage, I get a barrage of the following runtime error: ReferenceError: Error #1069: Property null not found on fl.motion.KeyframeBase and there is no default value. at fl.motion::KeyframeBase/getValue() at fl.motion::MotionBase/getValue() at fl.motion::Animator3D/setTime3D() at fl.motion::AnimatorBase/set time() at fl.motion::AnimatorBase$/processCurrentFrame() at fl.motion::AnimatorBase$/parentEnterFrameHandler() I'm guessing just based on the number of errors like this that I receive that there's one per keyframe in the tweening movieclip. I've checked to ensure that the Flash publish settings are identical across the two .fla files, and although the stage sizes differ slightly, I don't think that's the issue here. I've also googled the issue and found nothing but but this lonely thread on kirupa . Any thoughts?
