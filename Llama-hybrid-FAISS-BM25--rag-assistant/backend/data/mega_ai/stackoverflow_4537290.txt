If you want to let users try your application out first before buying release a limited free version. (Limited by features not time) Then also release a paid application. I would recommend 'up selling' your application from the free one. i.e. promote and encourage the upgrade from the free one by saying it has more features, better this, better that.. The LVL then only belongs in the paid version, not the free one.
