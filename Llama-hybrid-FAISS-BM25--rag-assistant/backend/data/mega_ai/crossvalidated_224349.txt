Machine Learning is concerned with prediction, classification, or clustering in a supervised or unsupervised setting. On the other hand, MCMC is simply concerned with evaluating a complex intergral (usually with no closed form) using probabilistic numerical methods. Metropolis sampling is definitely not the most commonly used approach. In fact, this is the only MCMC method not to have any probabilistic component. So ML would not inform anything with MCMC in this case. Importance based sampling does require a probabilistic component. It is more efficient than Metropolis under some basic assumptions. ML methods can be used to estimate this probabilistic component if it dovetails with some assumptions. Examples might be multivariate clustering to estimate a complex high dimensional Gaussian density. I am not familiar with non-parametric approaches to this problem, but that could be an interesting area of development. Nonetheless, ML stands out to me as a distinct step in the process of estimating a high dimensional complex probability model which is subsequently used in a numerical method. I don't see how ML really improves MCMC in this case.
