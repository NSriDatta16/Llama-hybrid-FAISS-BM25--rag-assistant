This is naturally file system specific. but you can be pretty sure that growing a file can be more expensive than writing in a pre-allocated file because growing it involves file system inode allocations while writing to pre-allocated inodes does not. How big this difference actually is depends on the file system, and on the how exactly you are using it. I guess in some cases it can be meaningful. another issue to consider is fragmentation. you will get better read/write performance if your file is on a contiguous block (or several large blocks) on the disk. pre-allocating a file will give you much better chance that it will be less fragmented.
