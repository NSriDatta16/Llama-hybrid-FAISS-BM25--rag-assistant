Instance segmentation performance depending on the number of classes

I have a setting in which I have approximately 10 classes, one of which I would need to put an extra emphasis on. Whilst training a mask-rcnn instance segmentation network (detectron2) I found out that I can do a lot better if I separate this one class and train a completely different network for it and then afterwards combine the predictions. Is this true in general for these networks? It would seem reasonable that the network would perform better with fewer classes to predict, but I couldn't find any good writings about this.
