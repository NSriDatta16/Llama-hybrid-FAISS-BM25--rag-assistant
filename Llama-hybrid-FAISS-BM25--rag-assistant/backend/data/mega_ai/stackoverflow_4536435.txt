Please back up a second. Thread.interrupt only interrupts wait conditions, not computations. There is no Java construct (except the monitoring/debugging agents) for interrupting a computation. So, if you want a long-running computation to be interruptible, you have to write it to carefully check for interrupts every so often. If you want to be able to 'interrupt' from outside the process altogether, you will need to handle signals. That's about the only interpretation I've been able to place on your question about the main thread. This blog post (not mine) has the basic information. From a handler, you could interrupt, for example, the main thread.
