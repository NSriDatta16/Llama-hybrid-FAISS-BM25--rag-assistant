I've worked with both DevExpress and Infragistics and found DevExpress far, far better for several reasons. The controls perform better, seem more stable and the dependency files are much lighter weight for DevExpress. We actually made a project out of getting off of an older (.Net v1.5) solution that used Infragistcs because it was so difficult to maintain due to the required dependency installation.
