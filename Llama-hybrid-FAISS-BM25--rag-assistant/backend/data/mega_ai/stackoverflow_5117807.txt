Hashing means using some function or algorithm to map object data to some representative integer value. This so-called hash code (or simply hash) can then be used as a way to narrow down our search when looking for the item in the map. If need to use an algorithm that is fast for looking up the information that you need then the HashTable is the most suitable algorithm to use, as it is simply generating a hash of your key object and using that to access the target data - it is O(1). The others are O(N) (Linked Lists of size N - you have to iterate through the list one at a time, an average of N/2 times) and O(log N) (Binary Tree - you halve the search space with each iteration - only if the tree is balanced, so this depends on your implementation, an unbalanced tree can have significantly worse performance).
