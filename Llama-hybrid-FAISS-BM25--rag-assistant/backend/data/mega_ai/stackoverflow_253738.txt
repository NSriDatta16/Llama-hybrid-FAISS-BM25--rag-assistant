Reaching 100% code coverage with meaningful tests may not be worth the climb, and, as mentioned before, 100% Code Coverage doesn't necessarily mean that all the possible conditions in the application have been tested. As for testing equals , hashCode and some other contract based interfaces, like Comparable and Serializable , I do include those tests. It is important that the equals/hashCode contract is implemented correctly, likewise with equals/Comparable . See JUnit-Addons , especially EqualsHashCodeTestCase ComparabilityTestCase SerializabilityTestCase
