Sample sizes for various confidence intervals. Wald CI. A standard elementary formula for the sample size necessary for a Wald CI of a binomial success probability $p$ to have margin of error $E$ (half width) is $n = \frac{(z^*)^2p(1-p)}{E^2}.$ For a 95% CI $z^* = 1.96.$ Very roughly, we are considering $p\approx 0.25,$ and $E\approx 0.055.$ Thus $n \approx 240,$ seems reasonable. This is rough speculation, using a style of CI, coverage probabilities of which have been much deprecated over the last quarter century, but it is a place to start. [Computations in R.] 1.96^2*.25*.75/.055^2 [1] 238.1157 Jeffries CI. The Jeffreys style of 95% CI is based on a Bayesian argument, starting with a noninformative prior distribution. It uses quantiles $.025$ and $0.975$ of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(x+.5, n-x+.5),$ where $x$ is the number of successes in $n$ trials. If we contemplate $p \approx 0.17$ and $n \approx 240.$ then we will have $x \approx 41.$ So a typical 95% CI of this style might be $(0.127, 0.222),$ which seems to be of reasonable length and does not include $0.12$ This is rough speculation about a style of interval estimate that has been shown to have reasonably accurate coverage properties. qbeta(c(.025, .975), 41+.5, 240-41+.5) [1] 0.1272991 0.2222488 Inverting a test. A much used binomial test of $H_0: p= p_0$ against $H_a: p \ne p_0$ uses the statistic $Z = \frac{\hat p - p_0}{\sqrt{p_p(1-p_0)/n}},$ where $\hat p = x/n$ and $Z\stackrel{aprx}{\sim}\mathsf{Norm}(0,1).$ At the 5% level, this test rejects $H_0$ for $|Z|\ge 1.96.$ The Wald interval (originally meant for use with large $n)$ roughly inverts the test, but estimates the standard error (denominator of $Z)$ as $\sqrt{\hat p(1-\hat p)/n}.$ The Wilson score interval arises from an exact inversion of the approximate normal test. A CI that 'inverts a test' is an interval of hypothetical values $p_0$ for which the data would not have led to rejection. Power and sample size computations for a binomial tests are available in many statistical software programs (including a library in R). From Minitab, here is a relevant computation of $n=96$ to achieve 80% power for the approximate normal test of $H_0: p = .12$ against $H_a: p > .12$ at the 5% level for the specific alternative $p_a = 21.$ [In my opinion, the description in the Problem is best suited to a one-sided test. For 80% power in a two-sided test with $p_0$ and $p_a$ the same distance apart, the required sample size is $n = 119$ (power curve omitted).] Power and Sample Size Test for One Proportion Testing p = 0.12 (versus > 0.12) α = 0.05 Sample Target Comparison p Size Power Actual Power 0.21 96 0.8 0.803081 0.21 138 0.9 0.900327 Testing p = 0.12 (versus ≠ 0.12) # TWO-sided test α = 0.05 Sample Target Comparison p Size Power Actual Power 0.21 119 0.8 0.801456 0.21 166 0.9 0.900293 Note: Perhaps more later, including exact binomial tests in R.
