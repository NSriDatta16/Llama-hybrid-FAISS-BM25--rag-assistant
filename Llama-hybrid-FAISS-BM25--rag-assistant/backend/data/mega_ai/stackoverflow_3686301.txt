Just make a function for mouseleave and call this function on mouseleave of your li and also for other events. One way to do the trick is to use http://api.jquery.com/event.pageY/ . But this is a little harcoded. Another way is to put the area where you want your mouse to be allowed (where the slide to remain triggered) in a transparent div and call the "mouseleave function"(from the first paragraph of my post) in the mouseleave event of this transparent div.
