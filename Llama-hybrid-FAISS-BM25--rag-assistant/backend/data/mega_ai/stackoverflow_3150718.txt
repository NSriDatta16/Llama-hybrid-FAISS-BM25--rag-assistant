What are my options for document layout in WPF?

Using WPF's FlowDocument, I have run in to a number of situations where I need more control over the layout of the document, from simple things (page headers and footers) to more complex (footnotes, magazine style story flow) to even more complex (literary texts with critical apparatus - one of my actual requirements). However, as far as I can tell, my only options are: A. Use FlowDocument and lose all control over layout. B. Write everything from scratch using TextFormatter. A is not an option for me, and B requires implementing dozens of methods, and more importantly, the loss of the power of FlowDocument and its associated Viewers. My question is: Is there any alternative that will allow me to leverage the power of FlowDocument, which covers 90% of my layout needs, and only write the code necessary to implement the other 10%? EDIT: The reflowable aspect of the FlowDocument is crucial for me. I understand that I am asking for both reflowable content and precise control over layout, which are somewhat contradictory. However, I know that it can be done - I wrote a bare bones implementation using TextFormatter that accomplishes what I want, but I would MUCH rather use FlowDocument with some kind of extension to avoid reimplementing every feature. EDIT 2: It seems that what I am really after is a hook into FlowDocument's internal paginator, so that I can give it instructions for laying out a custom class. Is there any way to do that?
