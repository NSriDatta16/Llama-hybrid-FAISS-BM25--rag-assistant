What time-homogeneous Markov Chain means is basically the Markov Chain at stationary status. This is the default assumption for these functions. The time-inhomogeneous fitting function might not be readily available. Alternatively, what you can do is to set up the sequences step-by-step and using the partial data to fit the Markov Chain model, what you will get will be several transition matrices, each of them is a transition matrix for that step, so you basically have a whole time-course of transition matrices.
