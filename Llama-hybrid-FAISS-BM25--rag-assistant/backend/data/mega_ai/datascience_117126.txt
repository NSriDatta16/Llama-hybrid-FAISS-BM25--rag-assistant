You need to frame your task first. Do you want to predict how much a customer would spend based on his location, referral channel, and some other variable you might have, or do you want to predict your sales for a given region in a given timeframe? That is, step one of your ML project is determining your target variable. Once you define your problem, build a data set. I assume that would be somewhat easy for you as you can export a CSV from Shopify so you'd have some training data. Then, start simple with the modelling phase. If you are a beginner in ML, use "simple" algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, KNN (be aware that not all would be applicable to your problem - take your time to study each one carefully). You'll probably have some categorical variables (region, channel), so some pre-processing steps will need to be done. I'd recommend you to go through the documentation of sklearn , it is beginner friendly but very powerful and valuable. There are a ton of examples for how to use the library. In context of the answer from @etet above, I also think that you'd get more value from an in-depth exploratory analysis. Start off with that, then move on to ML.
