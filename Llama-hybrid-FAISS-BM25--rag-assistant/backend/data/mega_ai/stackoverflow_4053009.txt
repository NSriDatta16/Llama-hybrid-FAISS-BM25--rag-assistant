When you load content with AJAX, the returned content should be only an HTML fragment. If you load a complete HTML document and put it into the page, the resulting HTML code is invalid, as a document can not be inside another document. Different browsers behave a little different on invalid code, but no browser will ever load the css files and apply them only to the loaded content. If you want to load a complete HTML document, then you should use an iframe instead of loading the content using AJAX.
