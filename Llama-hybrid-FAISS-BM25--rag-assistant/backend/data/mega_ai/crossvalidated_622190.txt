As it stands it seems the main issue is that we are running out of memory because we are computing all the pair-wises distances possible. The obvious things here are: use a lower triangular matrix for storage, use float16 or float32 instead of the native float64 , impose sparsity such that we only calculate distances from the $k$ -nearest neighbours found using a ball tree .
