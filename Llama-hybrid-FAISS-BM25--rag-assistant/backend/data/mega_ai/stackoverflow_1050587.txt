I assume those 3rd party DLLs would be used in more that one project of yours. Therefore putting the DLL directly under bin of every project means you end-up having as many DLL copies (in the VCS) as there are projects, which is not elegant. As Andrew H. mentionned, if the DLLs are truly common, they should be put in a common directory that will be refered to by all other projects that need it. The only catch here is being able to distinguish different versions of the same DLL: over time, you may end up with something like: /common/ThirdPartyLibrary.dll (version 1.2) /common/ThirdPartyLibrary.dll (version 1.3) The best way I know (for now) around that is renaming the 3rd party DLL with an explicit version number and refer to that new name in your project, such that your project will always, for sure, refer to the right version. Like: /common/ThirdPartyLibrary_v1.2.dll /common/ThirdPartyLibrary_v1.3.dll
