If you're only concerned about search engines, you could create a robots.txt file containing: User-agent: * Disallow: /news.php This will make sure that search engines don't follow the news.php links. To fix your rewrite rules, you might try adding L to the first RewriteRule to make sure that mod_rewrite doesn't continue: RewriteRule ^news/([0-9]+) /news.php?id=$1 [PT,L] RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^id=([0-9]+) RewriteRule ^news\.php /news/%1? [R=301,L]
