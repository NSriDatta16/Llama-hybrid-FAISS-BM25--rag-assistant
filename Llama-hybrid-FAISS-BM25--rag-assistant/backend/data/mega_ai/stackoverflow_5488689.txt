how to retrieve nested properties in groovy

I'm wondering what is the best way to retrieve nested properties in Groovy, taking a given Object and arbitrary "property" String. I would like to something like this: someGroovyObject.getProperty("property1.property2") I've had a hard time finding an example of others wanting to do this, so maybe I'm not understanding some basic Groovy concept. It seems like there must be some elegant way to do this. As reference, there is a feature in Wicket that is exactly what I'm looking for, called the PropertyResolver: http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.4/org/apache/wicket/util/lang/PropertyResolver.html Any hints would be appreciated!
