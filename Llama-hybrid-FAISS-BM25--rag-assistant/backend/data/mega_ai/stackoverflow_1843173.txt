Zend_Search_Lucene & accents

Is it possible search accented text with Zend_Search_Lucene? I indexed accented text but the search doesn't find it. A roundabout solution can be that I deaccent the text before indexing and also deaccent the query string. But it doesn't seam to be an elegant solution. Any idea?
