How to launch Native App from Web app in iPhone?

I want to access TTS (Text-To-Speech) and STT (Speech-To-Text) functionality of iOS from web app. Since web app dont access ios device functions, is it possible to launch Native app from Web app? e.g. When user wants to access TTS (e.g. Dragon Dictation), web page will launch Native app, take recording and send the recorded text to web app again. Or we can access TTS/STT functionality right from web app?
