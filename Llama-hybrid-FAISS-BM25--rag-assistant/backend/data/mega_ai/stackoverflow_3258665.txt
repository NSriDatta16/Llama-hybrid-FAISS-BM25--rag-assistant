Is there a way to make a Python console application flash in the taskbar in Windows?

Is there a way to make my Python console application's window flash in the Windows taskbar, to get a user's attention? My script will be run exclusively in a relatively homogeneous Windows environment, so I don't care about detecting whether a particular API is present, or whether a solution is cross-platform or not (of course cross-platform is better for future reference... but I don't need it for this application).
