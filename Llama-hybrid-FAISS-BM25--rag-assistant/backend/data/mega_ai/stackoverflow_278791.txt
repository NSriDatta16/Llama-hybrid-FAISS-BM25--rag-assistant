There is, It's called FileSystemWatcher . If you are developing a windows forms application, you can drag-and-drop it from the toolbox. Here's some usage example: private void myForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { var fileWatcher = new System.IO.FileSystemWatcher(); // Monitor changes to PNG files in C:\temp and subdirectories fileWatcher.Path = @"C:\temp"; fileWatcher.IncludeSubdirectories = true; fileWatcher.Filter = @"*.png"; // Attach event handlers to handle each file system events fileWatcher.Changed += fileChanged; fileWatcher.Created += fileCreated; fileWatcher.Renamed += fileRenamed; // Start monitoring! fileWatcher.EnableRaisingEvents = true; } void fileRenamed(object sender, System.IO.FileSystemEventArgs e) { // a file has been renamed! } void fileCreated(object sender, System.IO.FileSystemEventArgs e) { // a file has been created! } void fileChanged(object sender, System.IO.FileSystemEventArgs e) { // a file is modified! } It's in System.IO and System.dll so you should be able to use it in most type of projects.
