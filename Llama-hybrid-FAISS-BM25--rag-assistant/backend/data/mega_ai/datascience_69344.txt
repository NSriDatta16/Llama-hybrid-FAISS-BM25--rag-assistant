Sequence labeling with partially known labels

I am working on a sequence labeling task where, based on experience, many of the labels of a given input sequence can be reliably extracted with a simple rule-based approach. For example, considering the following input sequence: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1] (ground truth labels of input sequence) [1, X, 3, 1, 2, 1, Y] (labels as extracted by the rule-based approach) In the above example, the rule-based system was able to extract all but two labels from the input. That is, only X and Y still need to be determined by a machine learning approach. Are there known ways or algorithms to incorporate the labels extracted by a rule-based system into the machine learning process instead of running a sequence labeling algorithm from scratch? Intuitively, the additional information from the rule-based system should make it "easier" for the machine learning algorithm to fill the remaining slots.
