Different image size for Convolutional Network

As far as I know, different image size is not a problem for convolutional layers, but what bothers me is the fully connected layer we have,after flattening last convolutional layer. Because, If I am not mistaken, the size of the fully connected layer is determined by the size of the last convolutional layer such that each nodes in it will have corresponding node in the fully connected layer. Using image with different image size will have different number of features at its last convolutional layer. So can we feed different sized images to the CNN (This is not a question like "Should I train CNN with different image sizes?", I just want to know if it is possible)
