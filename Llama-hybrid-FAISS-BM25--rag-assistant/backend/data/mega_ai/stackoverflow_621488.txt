The demo definitely needs a few enhancements to make it even a little bit useful (although I am not sure if it would be enough): Allow the dragging to start somewhere that is not a check box. Allow selection by dragging over the labels as well. This problem seems similar to the action of selecting multiple files in a file explorer like Windows Explorer. Maybe it can work like the action of selecting multiple files by dragging a rectangle shape around the items to be selected (select one corner, drag to the other corner)? This has the advantage of being similar to an interface element that people may already be familiar with.
