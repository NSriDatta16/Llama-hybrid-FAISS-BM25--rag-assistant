Two options (aside from SIFR and Cufon as others have noted): Specify a custom font via CSS: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200710/the_resurrection_of_downloadable_web_fonts/ http://www.richinstyle.com/guides/fontface2.html#src Create static images: As you have noted create images for each header using the custom font - this would also present a hurdle to anyone who wants to copy the font. (Of course, they could always trace a font from the graphics containing the font and easily create a TTF from it). The main strike against is this question is the following: "I'd like to be really sure nobody can use the font on their own web sites or download a copy" Really? Without using static images/flash/SIFR/Cufon, a user will need to download a copy of a font to their computer in order to render the font in their web browser. Once you give a copy to the user you can't really expect to control whether they use it on their own web site. Again, it's trivial to copy a font from a static image and create a TTF for the whole world to copy - see sites like http://www.dafont.com/ for examples of famous fonts copied (as an example, the Tranformers font: http://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=transformers )
