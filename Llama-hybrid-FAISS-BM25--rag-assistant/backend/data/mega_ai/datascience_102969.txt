How to deal with data having 0 values in many columns?

I am trying to implement logistic regression but the dataset that I have have many columns with skewed data and most of them have 0 as values. I also the skewness of data for many columns its going above 190. But it's not only for training data, it's the same for testing data too. I tried using log method to remove skewness but because most of the value is 0 it messed up my data. I don't know how to deal with it. I already use standarization, improved only a bit. If someone has any idea please do suggest.
