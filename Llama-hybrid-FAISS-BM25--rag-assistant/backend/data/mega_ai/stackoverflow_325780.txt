There's no official way to do this. The two methods that I could think of are: navigate the view tree to find the existing Back button, and set its text color manually. This is probably not a good idea, as it's fragile, and the button may not even have a configurable textColor property. create your own back button (ie, with your own image), and set its color. This is what we do in a number of places. It's a little more work, but the results are exactly what you want.
