As @Chris noted, indexes are not rebuilt automatically in any SQL Server version. Proper index maintenance is often missing at sites with no dedicated DBA role, and often when databases are simply moved from development into production (along with Transaction Log maintenance). SQL Server 2005+ has the ability to do online index reorganises and offline full rebuilds.
