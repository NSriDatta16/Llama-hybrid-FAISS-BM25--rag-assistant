How can I put double quotes inside a string within an ajax JSON response from php?

I receive a JSON response in an Ajax request from the server. This way it works: { "a" : "1", "b" : "hello 'kitty'" } But I did not succeed in putting double quotes around kitty . When I convert " to \x22 in the Ajax response, it is still interpreted as " by JavaScript and I cannot parse the JSON. Should I also escape the \ and unescape later (which would be possible)? How to do this? Edit: I am not sure if i expressed it well: I want this string inside of "b" after the parse: hello "kitty" If necessary I could also add an additional step after the parse to convert "b", but I guess it is not necessary, there is a more elegant way so this happens automatically? Edit2: The ajax page is generated by php. I tried several things now to create the value of b, all result in JSON parse error on the page: $b = 'hello "kitty"'; // no 1: //$b = str_replace('"',"\x22",$b); // or no 2: // $b = addslashes($b); // or no 3: $b = str_replace('"','\"',$b); echo '{ "a" : "1", "b" : "' . $b . '"}'; Edit3: This solution finally works: $b = 'hello "kitty"'; $b = str_replace('"','\\"',$b); echo '{ "a" : "1", "b" : "' . $b . '"}';
