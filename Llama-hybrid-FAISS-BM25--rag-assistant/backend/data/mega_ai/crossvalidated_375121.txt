ML classifications

I have a doubt in below ML families. If we are predicting: Yes, then we have classification and regression If No, then we have clustering In clustering, we have K-means algo In classification we predict discrete values, so we have logistic regression, KNN, and NN In Regression we predict continuous values, so we have Simple Linear and Multiple Linear regression, also called as causal models Then we have TimeSeries, with Single, Double and Triple exponential models. And ARIMA, SARIMA models ARIMA combines Regression and Simple means(Moving Average). Now my question is, does TimeSeries come under classification or Regression?
