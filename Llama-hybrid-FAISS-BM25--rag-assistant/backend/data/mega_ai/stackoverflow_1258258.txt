This isn't a direct answer to your question, but it might help. It seems to be quite common to add the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor to django. If you search for instructions on how to add TinyMCE to the Django admin, you might be able to adapt the method for WMD. In the book Practical Django Projects, Second Edition , the author embeds TinyMCE in the flatpages admin. You can download the code from a Bitbucket repository , and see how it's done (look at cms/templates/admin/). Alternatively, you could try this guide on the Django website. +1 for the question. I would also like to write flatpages in markdown. However I think the best method for using markdown is to have two fields, say content and content_html , and store the original markdown in content . When the object is saved, convert the markdown to html and store it in content_html . This means you avoid converting to html in the template every time the page is viewed. However I don't know an elegant way to extend contrib.flatpages by 'adding' an extra field.
