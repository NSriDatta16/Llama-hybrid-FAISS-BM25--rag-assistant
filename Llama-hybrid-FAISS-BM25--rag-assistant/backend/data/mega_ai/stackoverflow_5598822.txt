in $.html() $.load() what is the spec?

jQuery does not seem to document how it behaves when using $.html() or $.load() to insert an HTML document fragment into the current DOM: What does it do with tags? They are executed, though. But are nowhere to be found in the DOM. It seems jQuery inserts the script blocks just for a moment into the DOM or evals it. There is no documentation this regard. Do you know any way to tune it, i.e. disable it? This has implications of security in nature!
