I think the usage of file(s) is to take into consideration, according to the API and the language used to read/write them (and hence eventually API restrictions). Fragmentation of the disk, that will tend to decrease with only big files, will penalize data access if you're reading one big file in one shot, whereas several access spaced out time to small files will not be penalized by fragmentation.
