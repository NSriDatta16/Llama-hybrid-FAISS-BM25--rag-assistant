Random Forests and GBT are robust against redundant features, so accuracy is unlikely to be negatively affected. That some features have very low importance is evidence of them being ignored. Because the trees are constructed in a greedy fashion, with randomized starting points different features might end up being ignored. If feature Foo and Bar contain redundant information, then Bar will be ignored if Foo was chosen first - and vica versa.
