The problem is probably that the image data is all of type uint8 , so adding them all up causes a saturation at the value of 255 for the pixel values, giving you a mostly white image which then ends up looking mostly black when you then divide by the number of images. You should convert your images to another data type, like double , then perform your averaging, and then convert back to uint8 : % Load your images: image1 = imread('PIC1.jpg'); image2 = imread('PIC2.jpg'); image3 = imread('PIC3.jpg'); image4 = imread('PIC4.jpg'); % Convert the images to type double and sum them: imageSum = double(image1) + double(image2) + double(image3) + double(image4); % Divide by the number of images and convert back to type uint8: averageImage = uint8(imageSum./4); % Display the averaged image: imshow(averageImage); SIDE NOTE: You should avoid giving your variables the same names as any existing functions, since this could cause problems/confusion. This is why I changed the variable sum to imageSum (there is a built-in function sum ).
