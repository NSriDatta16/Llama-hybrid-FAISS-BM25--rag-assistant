It is possible that these users have an SD card that is corrupt and thus mounted read-only. If possible, you should check with them to see if anything else can write files to it. Given that you have the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission, you should have no trouble making modifications to the SD card (and the permissions of everything in the SD card is world read/write for such apps, so nothing can mess with file permissions to cause them trouble either).
