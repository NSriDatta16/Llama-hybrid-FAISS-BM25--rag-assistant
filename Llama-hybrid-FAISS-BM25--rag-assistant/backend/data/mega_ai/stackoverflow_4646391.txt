Since partial classes (which Entity Framework creates) merge attributes, extended functionality in other partial classes are also excluded if the attribute is class level in the template , it will have to be applied at the method level. The best way that I've found to do this is using T4 (as recommended in @Craig Stuntz's answer ) to: include: using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis; at the top of the file Then apply [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] to getters, setters and Factory methods by searching for: #>get #>set Template_FactoryMethodComment and placing them in the appropriate place. This was made a lot easier using Tangible's T4 editor Extension for VS . This is my first attempt and it seems to work, "your milage may vary", so complete a test run to make sure everything's working as necessary.
