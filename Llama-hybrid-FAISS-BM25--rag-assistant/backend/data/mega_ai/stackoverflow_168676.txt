Recommended books on Desktop Application development using MVC

I'm looking for recommendations on books about MVC on the desktop. If they use Java, that is a bonus. Some background: I'm writing a desktop application in Java. It's an audio application that has a number of views and a central model called a Library with playlists, effects lists and a folder structure to organize them. In this application I'd like to have menus, context-menus and drag and drop support for various user actions. I've been struggling with how to achieve this using MVC. I started with all the logic/controllers in the main class but have started to separate them out into their own classes. Now I need to start using listeners and observers to handle messages between the views and the controller. This led to me creating a number of interfaces and looping through my listeners in several places to fire off various messages. But that loop code keeps getting repeated (not DRY), so I'm assuming that now I should create different types of Event classes, create those events in my views and use a single method within the view to fire it off to the various listeners. Update: Arguabley it shouldn't matter much but I'm using SWT, not Swing.
