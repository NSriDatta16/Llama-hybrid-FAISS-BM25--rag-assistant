A warning is just that. A warning. Sometimes warnings are irrelevant, sometimes they're not. They're used to call your attention to something that the compiler thinks could be a problem, but may not be. In the case of casts, it's always going to give a warning in this case. If you are absolutely certain that a particular cast will be safe, then you should consider adding an annotation like this (I'm not sure of the syntax) just before the line: @SuppressWarnings (value="unchecked")
