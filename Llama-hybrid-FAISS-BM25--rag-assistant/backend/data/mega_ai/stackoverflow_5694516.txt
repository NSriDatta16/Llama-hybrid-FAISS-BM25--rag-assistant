backbone.js - views within views and managing events

What's a good way to organize views? Let's say I have a div that will contain a view from an admin panel perspective of users - there will be a list of users along with options to choose how many to display at a time, sorting options, what page to be on, filters, etc... Would I want an outside view that contained everything except the table and data? And then an inside view that contains the table (along with the data)? And would the pagination have it's own view? And how would the pagination view use the click event to update the user view? I'm just confused on how to organize the views while still being able to have different events trigger other views to render() / collections to fetch() . So a basic hierarchy would look like: - User View - Table - List of Users - Pagination - List of available numbers to click - Filters - Possible filters to apply to the data Yet clicking a filter or number in the pagination should be able to get the collection to fetch() new data and refresh the view;
