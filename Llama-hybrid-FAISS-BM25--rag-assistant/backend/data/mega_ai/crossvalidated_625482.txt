Regarding too much data: if the data generating process (DGP) evolves over time, old data will not be representative of the current DGP. Using this irrelevant data for model selection and estimation will be detrimental to the forecast accuracy. How to know how much is too much? Either you have subject-matter knowledge on changes in the DGP (e.g. you are forecasting the profit of a company and you know the tax code changed at time $t_1$ or a new competitor showed up at time $t_2$ which has affected the profitability since then) or you may try pseudo out-of-sample forecasting by employing shorter and longer training time series and seeing which one works better.
