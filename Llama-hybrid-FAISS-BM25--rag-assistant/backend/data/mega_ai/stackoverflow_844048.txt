When the document is transfered over HTTP, the HTTP header information are the crutial information : [â€¦] conforming user agents must observe the following priorities when determining a document's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest): An HTTP " charset " parameter in a " Content-Type " field. A META declaration with " http-equiv " set to " Content-Type " and a value set for " charset ". The charset attribute set on an element that designates an external resource. So make sure you declare the character encoding in the Content-Type header field and not just inside the document.
