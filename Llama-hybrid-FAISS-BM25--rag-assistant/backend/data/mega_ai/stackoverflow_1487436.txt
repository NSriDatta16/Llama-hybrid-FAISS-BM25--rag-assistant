I'd look at what has the highest priority from management's perspective for an intial prioritizing of upcoming projects. If they are all priority 1 projects, then there are a few other factors that may help my decision: Do I see how valuable the project will be to the organization? Is this the type of thing that really helps with the competitive advantage that we have? Does there seem to be a buildup of projects of a specific size? For example, are lots of little projects being ignored for the few really big ones? If so, I may take some of the little ones that may be seen as quick wins that may help my team look good. Do any of these projects use my strengths? This can be a bit hard to determine but it could help a lot with motivation, at least using the Marcus Buckingham interpretation of a strength. What teams and structures are in place for the other projects? I don't think I'd want to join a project that looks like a massive train wreck about to happen. Is there enough structure so that I won't go off and do my own thing that may hurt the project's chances of success? Do I believe I could handle working with X using methodology Y and technology Z? Those are a few of how I'd look at making the decision, along with talking to my manager as part of this is his job, right?
