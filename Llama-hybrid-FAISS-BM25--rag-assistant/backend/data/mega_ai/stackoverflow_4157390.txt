I don't know how what your data is like or how much automation you need. This won't work if if consists of peaks without clear ridges (but then you probably wouldn't be asking the question.) startPoint = highest point in DEM (or on ridge) curPoint = startPoint; line += curPoint; Loop curPoint = highest point adjacent to curPoint not in line; // (Don't backtrack) line += point; Repeat Curious what the real solution turns out to be. Edited to add: depending on the coarseness of your data set, 'point' can be a single point or a smoothed average of a local region of points.
