How to statistically determine if there was sales lift?

Say my company is about to make some changes that they expect will increase sales and customer acquisition in current markets, what would be the best way statistically to determine if that lift was realized or if sales grew at the current rate? I have two types of data I am looking to do this for, both monthly: Customer acquisition - basically white noise Sales volume - typically follows and upward, linear trend For customer acquisition I was thinking of sticking with something simple like comparing the monthly average post event to the current monthly average with a t-test. For sales volume I am not sure what the best approach would be since there is a trend in the data and I am not just looking for a simple level shift. My initial thought is to find the average monthly increase before and after and use a t-test but I am not sure if there is a better way.
