In computer science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Algorithm: Initialize all agents; while (not maximum iterations nor minimum error ) { foreach(agent in agents) { Calculate function value at agent position; If (value where w,p,g are selected by the practitioner and control the behaviour and efficacy of the PSO method. Third party implementations: RRSI is a C# project to simulate particle swarm optimization on communicating robots. SwarmOps C# and ANSI C codes for several optimization methods, including a few global best PSO variants. Java Based PSO Framework part of the open-source project CIlib (Computational Intelligence Library). PSO visualisation applet randomly generated particle swarm of 12 particles attempts to find the "global maximum" on the landscape.
