In C, if this isn't an address constant, what is it?

What, exactly, is numbers in the following declaration, if it is not an address constant? int main() { int numbers[3] = {1,2,3}; return 0; } Disassembling the program shows that 1, 2, and 3 are dynamically placed on the local stack space, rather than the whole array being treated as a constant. Hence, {1,2,3} does not have static storage duration, so numbers is not an address constant, as per the C99 spec. C99, Section 6.6.9: "An address constant is a null pointer, a pointer to an lvalue designating an object of static storage duration, or a pointer to a function designator..." However, adding the line numbers++ after the declaration causes the following compile error in GCC 4.1.2: error: invalid lvalue in increment So it is constant, but isn't an address constant. Does anybody know the official name of this type of constant in C99 (or similar)?
