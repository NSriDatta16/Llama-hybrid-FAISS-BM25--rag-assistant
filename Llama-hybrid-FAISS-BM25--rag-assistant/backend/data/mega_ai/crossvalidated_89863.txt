Back propagation in Convolutional neural networks

I am trying to understand how CNN works. I want to use them in object recognition task. I thouhgt that CNN is unsupervised networks. My main question is how can I implement the back propagation without using image targets (pre-defined labels), in order to calculate the error function which will affect the weights of the network.
