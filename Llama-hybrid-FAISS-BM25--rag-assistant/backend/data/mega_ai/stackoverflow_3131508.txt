Deny access to login page to authenticated user in ASP.NET

I'm working on an ASP.NET web application. We've got a login page ( index.aspx ), as well as a user's "home page", userhome.aspx . What's the most elegant way to deny a user to display index.aspx when they're logged in? At the moment, index.aspx can still be displayed by explicitly typing it into the browser address bar. I tried the following (in web.config ), but it does not work: I could perform a manual redirection in code behind, but it looks pretty ugly to me. Thanks a lot for any more elegant approach :) Cheers, Matthias
