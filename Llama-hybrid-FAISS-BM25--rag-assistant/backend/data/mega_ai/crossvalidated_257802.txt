How to perform segmentation on multivariate time series?

Given a multivariate time series, which method could be applied to segment it into partitions of stationary signals. To give more context: I am given a set of acceleration signals in XYZ-Direction. Based on these signals, I have to map a segment of the signal to a behaviour. The test-signals are not segmented. So I have to find a way to segment it and apply standard classifier on it.
