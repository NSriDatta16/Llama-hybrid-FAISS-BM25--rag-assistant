The stock Android launcher has left/right paging behavior on the home screen, and it's open source. This is the Workspace class. Pay special attention to the onTouchEvent and onInterceptTouchEvent methods. The utility classes Scroller and VelocityTracker are used together to define the behavior for snapping to a page when the user lets go from a drag. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher2/+/master/src/com/android/launcher2/Workspace.java
