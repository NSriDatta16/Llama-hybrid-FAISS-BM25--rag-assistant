There is no universal "best". It's your choice . For example, complete linkage may be nice, because it means any two instances have at not h bits different at height h. Or you may want average linkage , so that the average number of bits is h. Or you may want minimax linkage , so that there exists one object, where all others are at most h bits different. No mathematical reason to prefer one over the other. They are all reasonable to use.
