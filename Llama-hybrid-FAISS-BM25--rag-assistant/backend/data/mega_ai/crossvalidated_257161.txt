How to test if chart patterns occure systematic or are just random artifacts in a price-time series?

Given a time series with Events (chart patterns), I want to assess whether events (chart patterns) occur systematic or randomly in a time series. My idea is to identify patterns in a given time series simulate multiple new time series identify patterns in the simulated time series compare the results The key question is how to compare the results. The events (chart patterns) have a specific length and can be overlapping (as illustrated in the image). I could easily just use the number of events in the original time series and compare them to the count/number of events in the simulated time series by simulating enough time series to construct a confidence interval. But this would not account for clustering, overlapping and the size of events. The image is an example with orange lines being events of different size/length in time. They are overlapping but do not seem to be clustered. If they would be clustered they might only appear in the beginning and end of the time series. Hence, it is not enough to just compare the count/number of events (patterns) but also if there is clustering (margin between events) or differences in the size of the patterns. I could perform the same test for different statistics (count/number, size, ?what is the best way to check and compare clustering?) but this does not appear to be very elegant to me (it might be the best approach, I do not know). Hence, my question is: How do it test if events (with different size, overlapping, and maybe clustered) occur systematic in a time series or randomly? Are there any similar problems in other disciplines? edit: I edited this question recently. It was a very old question but I tried to make it more comprehensible. Still, I am looking for some answers. The one proposed is one way but I am wondering if someone maybe know established setups to tests cases like this.
