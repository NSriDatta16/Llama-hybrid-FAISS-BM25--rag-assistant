I've been pretty impressed with the work put into an open source game: Star Trek Supremacy ( http://supremacy.codeplex.com/ ). In addition to the author trying to learn new technologies, he is also applying some good programming practices as well - and his code is pleasant to read (e.g. the grab a favorite beverage and a printout kind of pleasant). The author says on the website: I started this project in large part as a learning experience, and as such it has become a sort of testbed for me to try out several new Microsoft .NET-based technologies, including: * WPF * WCF * LINQ (in-memory, DLINQ, and XLINQ) * Parallel Extensions * XNA (for 3D combat system)
