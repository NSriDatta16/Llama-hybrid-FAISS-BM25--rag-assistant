Estimating the parameters of a Beta distribution using the sample average and standard deviation

This is a simple question, but I just want to be sure. Imagine that we have a sample of $n$ data $\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ and that we want to fit them to a Beta distribution. Imagine that we have calculated $\bar{x}$ and $s_{n-1}$ (or simply $s$), where $$ \bar{x}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}}{n} $$ and $$ s= \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n-1}} \text{.} $$ I think that we can estimate the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the Beta distribution by $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$, respectively, where the values of $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ are obtained from the following equations: $$ \bar{x} = \frac{\hat{\alpha}}{\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}} \quad, \quad s^2 = \frac{\hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}}{(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta})^2(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}+1)} \text{.} $$ Am I right?
