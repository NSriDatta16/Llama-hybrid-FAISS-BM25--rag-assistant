Semantics of Windows batch programming redirection

I have a Windows batch script (my.bat) which has the following line: DTBookMonitor.exe 2>&1 > log\cmdProcessLog.txt So, from my understanding, this runs DTBookMonitor, redirects STDERR to STDOUT and then redirects STDOUT to the file log\cmdProcessLog.txt. I then run my.bat. DTBookMonitor runs for a significant amount of time, and when I run my.bat a second time (while it is already running), it immediately exits from the second instance of my.bat. Is this purely because of the redirection to cmdProcessLog?
