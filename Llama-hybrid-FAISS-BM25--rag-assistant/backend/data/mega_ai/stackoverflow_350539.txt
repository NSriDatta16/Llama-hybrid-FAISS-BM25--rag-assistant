Windows CE deletes .NET CF on reset

I'm writing a C# application for a proprietary Windows CE 4.2 device (for which I don't have the specs or pretty much any other information. I've got access to the file system, and that is basically it.) I also can't get support from the original manufacturer. Now, I can install the .NET Compact framework just fine, and everything works for a while. But every once in a while, when the device is reset, it deletes the framework, the GAC, everything related to it. I know it's not just a hard reset jumping back to factory defaults because: It remembers the registry settings (If I try to install again, it says the framework is already installed, and asks if I want to reinstall. So obviously the registry keys are still there) The files are deleted even if I installed the framework onto a removable flash card. (Other files on the storage card are left alone, however) I know there isn't much to go on, but perhaps some Windows CE guru will be able to tell me why this happens, and if there's some sane way to avoid it. I don't know much about Windows CE, so for all I know, it might be perfectly standard behavior. For that matter, any advice on how to troubleshoot this further myself? At the moment, the best solution I can see is to simply reinstall everything at every boot, but that seems a bit clumsy. Edit: After a reset, GACLOG.TXT found in the root of the filesystem contains CGACUTIL: Initializing 12/08/2008 20:43:57.000 CGACUTIL: Initialized 12/08/2008 20:43:57.000 CGACUTIL: Removing Microsoft .NET CF 3.5.GAC 12/08/2008 20:43:57.000 CGACUTIL: Done 12/08/2008 20:43:57.000 CGACUTIL: Exiting 12/08/2008 20:43:57.000 So yeah, it's definitely deleting the GAC. Why though, and how to stop it?
