Turns out it was a problem with Tortoise SVN. I updated to the latest version a few days ago, didn't restart, and continued working. My application allows the user to drag-and-drop files into a listview. It appears that a hook for SVN runs when a drap-and-drop action occurs; since Tortoise wasn't properly installed, this hook failed and gave me the error message. Proving once again, always restart...
