Up until now the best documentation Ive found is the official one on code.google.com/appengine . One JavaEE doc that comes in handy is the HttpServlet Spec , since this is the basic class for responding to http requests on App Engine. For file uploads there is a useful lib at apache commons . Since you are not allowed to manipulate files on the server in gae, all your persistence will need some knowledge of the datastore, jdo and datanucleus enhancer . Additionally to that you might want to consider using a third party framework to be more productive. There are a lot of products for various purposes around. What kind of application will you develop?
