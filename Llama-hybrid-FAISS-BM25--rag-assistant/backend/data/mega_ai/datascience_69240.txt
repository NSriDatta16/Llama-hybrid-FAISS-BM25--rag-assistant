YES. Increasing number of epochs over-fits the CNN model. This happens because of lack of train data or model is too complex with millions of parameters. To handle this situation the options are we need to come-up with a simple model with less number of parameters to learn add more data by augmentation add noise to dense or convolution layers add drop-out layers add l1 or l2 regularizers add early stopping check the model accuracy on validation data early stopping will tell you appropriate epochs without overfitting the model
