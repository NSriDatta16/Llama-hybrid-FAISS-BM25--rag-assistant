What to do with singular fit in mixed-effects model when all random effects are required by theory?

I'm using repeat cross-sectional data to examine growth trajectories in adult BMI by birth year. I've structured the data as a pseudo-panel. The data look something like this: id year birth age bmi 1 1991 42 1949 29 2 1992 50 1952 26 3 2007 60 1947 24 4 2004 25 1979 25 5 2017 34 1973 30 I'm trying to run lme4 models of the form: lmer(bmi ~ 1 + age + (1 + age | birth_year), df) In other words, I'm using the data to examine variation in how the mean level of BMI has developed in a set of cohorts as they age. I've tried to run the model, but I get singular fit. The correlation between the random intercepts and slopes is ~= 1. I've seen advice that I should simplify the model by dropping one or the other of the random effects, but a priori I expect the correlation between the random intercepts and slopes to be very high: successive cohorts are likely to have higher initial BMI (say at age 20) and growth in BMI (e.g. change from age 20 to 64). Throwing one random effect out would stop me being able to study what I want to study. Another bit of advice I've seen is to use brms::brm or rstanarm::stan_lmer instead, but I have quite a big dataset (~ 165k observations, with 65 birth_y groups). I've tried running it, but it doesn't seem to be getting past initialising the model. Does anyone know what I should do, please? Thanks Edit: @RobertLong asked for model output from the correlated and uncorrelated random slope models. I have added weights to the regressions, which I didn't mention in the origin question as I thought this was unecessary complexity.
