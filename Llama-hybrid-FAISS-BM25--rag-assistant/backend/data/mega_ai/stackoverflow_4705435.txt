Passing data from C++ to gnuplot example (using Gnuplot-iostream interface)

I have just come accross Dan Stahlke's gnuplot C++ I/O interface, which saves me from "rolling my own". Unfortunately, there are not too may examples and there ios no real documentation. I have the following data types in my C++ project: struct Data { std::string datestr; // x axis value float f1; // y axis series 1 float f2; // y axis series 2 float f3; // y axis series 3 }; typedef std::vector Dataset; I want to pass a Dataset variable from C++, so that I can plot the data (dates on the X axis, and the 3 numbers plotted as time series on the Y axis). Can anyone show me how to transfer the Dataset variable from C++ to gnuplot (using the Gnuplot-iostream interface) and make a simple plot using the passed in data?
