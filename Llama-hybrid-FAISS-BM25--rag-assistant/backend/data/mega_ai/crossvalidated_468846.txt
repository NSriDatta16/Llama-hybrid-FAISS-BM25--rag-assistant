What are the best metrics to evaluate a multiclass classification model?

I have a multiclass classification problem I have 5 classes and data highly unbalnced class 01: 6 class 02: 100 class 03: 9300 class 04: 200 class 05: 34 I have used K fold cross validation with k=10 and 5 algorithms: - Logistic regression - Linear discriminant analysis - K nearest neighbor - CART - Naive bayes and I had this results Algo: mean of accuracy , Std of accuracy (where std means Standard Deviation = sqrt(Variance)) LR: 0.489479 (0.095705) LDA: 0.901222 (0.001977) KNN: 0.949483 (0.002300) CART: 0.939122 (0.002691) NB: 0.950761 (0.002713) My question is: is accuracy enough to choose the best model between those 4 ? or should I use precision, recall, f1 score, AUC .....
