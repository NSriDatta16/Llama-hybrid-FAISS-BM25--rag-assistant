No it is not - at least not in any official or documented way - unless you change your stored procedure to a TVF. But however there are ways (read) hacks to do it. All of them basically involved a linked server and using OpenQuery - for example see here . Do however note that it is quite fragile as you need to hardcode the name of the server - so it can be problematic if you have multiple sql server instances with different name.
