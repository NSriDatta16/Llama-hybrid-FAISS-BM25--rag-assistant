Looking ahead at seasonality in time series modeling without overfitting

In forecasting the performance of many agents in a time series, there is a strong seasonality component, in addition to non-seasonal features for each agent. How can I capture the overall seasonal trends in my model building process without overfitting? Currently, I'm using a time-series cross validation approach to fitting a Random Forest Regressor or Gradient Boosting Regressor. I have many samples of data, but only a couple years to train on. Normally, I would not want to "look ahead" at future data to avoid overfitting on a time series; however, it seems that this is necessary to extract the seasonality signal and model performance. Edits: I hypothesize that if I extract the overall seasonality signal from agent performance in aggregate , there should be less concern of overfitting to this aggregate seasonality signal. I suspect there's a well-defined methodology for doing this. Example row (simplified for illustration) for an agent. Similar rows would exist for each day of the year for this given agent, and for all 1,000+ agents we're forecasting: agent_id: '1' size: '22.2' country: 'US' type: 'A' date: '2016-12-01' performance_last_15_days: 80 performance_last_30_days: 156 performance_last_45_days: 251 performance_next_45_days (target) : 260 In the example, we are adding various historical rolling windows of past target performance as features for training. Looking at the data in aggregate, a strong seasonal trend is detected across agents. We only have up to 2 years' data for each agent.
