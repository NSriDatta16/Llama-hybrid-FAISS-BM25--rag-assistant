How to decorate a class as untestable for Code Coverage?

Background: Visual Studio 2008, C#, .Net 3.5. I have a number of utility classes that are simply not unit-testable. This is mainly because they interact with resources (e.g. databases, files etc). Is there a way I can decorate these classes so that the Visual Studio Code Coverage engine will ignore them, so not decreasing the code coverage percentage?
