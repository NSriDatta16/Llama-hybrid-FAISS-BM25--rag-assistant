How to debug the entry-point of fork-exec process in GDB?

I have a C linux application (A) that spawns another process (P) when it is started. When I want to debug P I start A as usual and I connect with ddd/gdb to P. Problems appear when I want to debug the entry-point (start of main) of P. If I follow the usual approach when I connect the debugger to P is already to late. The solution I've found was to insert a sleep at the begining of the main of P so I have time to connect with gdb but this is not a very elegant solution. I've also tried using asm("int $3") but it doesn't seems to work. Do you have any idea how I could solve this problem? (preferably without altering the code of A or P)
