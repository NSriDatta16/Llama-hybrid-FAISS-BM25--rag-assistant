You can share cookies between subdomains, provided you set the right parameters in the cookie. By default, they won't be shared, though. Yes, you can get more simultaneous downloads if you store images in different subdomains. However, the other side of the scale is that the user spends more time resolving DNSs, so it's not practical to have, say, 25 subdomains to get 50 simultaneous downloads. Another thing that happens with subdomains is that AJAX requests won't work without some effort (you CAN make them work using document.domain tricks, but it's far from straightforward). Can't help with the SEO part, however, although some people discourage having both yoursite.com and www.yoursite.com working and returning the same content, because it "dilutes your pagerank". Not sure how true that is.
