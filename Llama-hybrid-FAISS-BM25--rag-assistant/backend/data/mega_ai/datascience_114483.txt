It's an interesting but probably difficult problem. Thoughts: Generally I think you will need to scale the numeric features (e.g. between 0 and 1) for most algorithms, otherwise any method relying on distance will fail. Discard any target which has only one example in the training data, possibly even if it has only 2 or 3 instances (?) k-NN makes sense imho (probably with scaled features). Note that predicting will take significant time. You can implement it yourself or use a library . I would probably also try a few simple methods, at least decision tree and SVM.
