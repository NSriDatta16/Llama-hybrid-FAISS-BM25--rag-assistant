frequency selection and decomposition

I am new for time series analysis. I have a dataset with 105216 rows from "2014-01-01 00:00:00" to 2016-12-31 23:45:00. This data is for every 15min. I have converted my data into timeseries using this m2 start = 2014 , 1 end = 2016, 35072 1) I have to forecast for every 15 min. Is the frequency mentioned above is correct. If not how can i modify it 2) when i decompose data data$seasonality provides me list of data(105216 rows) what I have to conclude from it. Does my data has seasonality or not 3) when i decompose data data$trend and random provides NAvalues for 35672 out of 105216 what does it means.
