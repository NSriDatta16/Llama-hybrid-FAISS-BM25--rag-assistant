What are the advantages of using an MVC framework over e.g. Drupal to build a large website?

I am writing a comparison between 3 technology options for building our new website: Wordpress Drupal An MVC framework The boss is sure we should use Wordpress, but the site will be big, with many sections, subsections, pages, and complicated templates. I'm finding it easy to compare WP + Drupal, but not so easy to state the additional advantages (over Drupal) of using an MVC framework. So far I have: Custom data storage, content types, semantics APIs / REST Separation of logic / UI Convention, code structure (Obviously some of the benefits will be different depending on the type of project. In this case it will be a large portal for a museum, with potential for some social stuff for visitors)
