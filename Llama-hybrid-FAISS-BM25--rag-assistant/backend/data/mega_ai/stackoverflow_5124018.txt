As mentioned earlier. This is not a CSS issue, you could however, as trusktr stated, create a cusom javascript scrollbar. Basically you set it up something like this. Actual scrollbar Content here #frame { height: 400px; overflow: hidden; } Then you create a draggable object inside the scrollbar which position changes the relative position of the content inside the frame.
