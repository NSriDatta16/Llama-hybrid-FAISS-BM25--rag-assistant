Suggestions for improvement? Time series of variation in relative frequency of emotion-related words in academic psychology over time

First time plotting and interpreting time series data and I have used a line plot for ease of use. I am aware this is incredibly basic, but any input/ recommendations would be much appreciated (e.g., is anything unclear?). My main concern is whether I have adequately displayed the data and whether I can do anything useful to improve (e.g., moving average)? Additionally, whether I have interpreted this time series data appropriately: "The relative frequency of affect-related tokens (counts per 10,000 tokens in psychology abstracts) increased from 3.51% in 1980 to 4.87% in 2017â€”-an overall relative increase of 39%. The relative frequency of affect-related tokens shows an increase at a rate of approximately 0.037 units per year (over 37 years). Overall, this displays a rapid growth trend in academics' use of emotion-related terms in psychology abstracts over time."
