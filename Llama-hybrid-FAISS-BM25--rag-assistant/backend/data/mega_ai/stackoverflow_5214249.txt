QListView & QStandardItemModel - Prevent duplicates

What is the way to go to prevent duplicates in a QListView which uses QStandardItemModel as its model? Data is added with drag & drop, so I tried to override QStandardItemModel::dropMimeData, which seems kind of odd since I need to override QStandardItemModel::mimeData (and reimplement encodeData/decodeData) as well. This has to be easier!
