Positional embeddings use good old Fourier transformations used in time-series regression models . The denominator controls the period of the sin and cos functions. For example, in time-series data, the denominator could be 7 for the weekly period, or 365.5 for a yearly one. In the embeddings, the denominators are learnable parameters, so the model can learn different periods that work best for the data. Using a time-series example again, it could learn that for specific data weekly and quarterly periods work best, but monthly are unnecessary.
