Eighth order moment

I read Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction by Lee and Verleysen [ Google Books ] and came across the following theorem (p. 8): Let $\mathbf{y}$ be a $D$-dimensional vector $[y_1, \ldots, y_d, \ldots,y_D]'$; all components $y_d$ of the vector are i.i.d. with a finite eighth order moment. Can anyone please explain what the authors mean by "finite eighth order moment"?
