What's wrong with the intuition that kernel measures similarity between observations?

Near the middle of page 16 of Andrew Ng's notes on SVM , he explained an intuitive view of kernel as measuring similarity between observations, but then added the caveat that there are things wrong with this intuition, but nevermind The notes don't really explain what's wrong with this intuition. Does anyone know what he might be referring to?
