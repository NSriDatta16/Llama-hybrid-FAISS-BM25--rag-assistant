You should perform all 100 analyses as a single mixed effects model, with your coefficients of interest random variables themselves. That way you can estimate a distribution for those coefficients including their overall mean, which will give you the sort of interpretation I think you are looking for. Noting that, if as I suspect is the case, you have a time series for each individual, you will also need to correct for autocorrelation of the residuals.
