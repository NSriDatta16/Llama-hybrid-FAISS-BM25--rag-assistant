What is a $\propto$ update in mean-field approximation?

I am trying to understand some notation used in papers about Bayesian variational inference. In some papers that use mean-field approximation to fit a probabilistic model, they describe coordinate ascent algorithms which have updates with the symbol $\propto$ for the closed-form update of some parameters. From what I've seen, it seems these $\propto$ always tend to be $\propto \: exp( . )$ For example these: (Gopalan, Prem K., Laurent Charlin, and David Blei. "Content-based recommendations with poisson factorization." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2014., page 5) (Cemgil, Ali Taylan. "Bayesian inference for nonnegative matrix factorisation models." Computational intelligence and neuroscience 2009 (2009)., page 5) And I'm really wondering what would that $\propto$ translate to in an algorithmic procedure.
