How do I change a drop placeholder depending on the dragged object in jQuery UI Sortable?

I have modules of different sizes, I want the placeholder to be of the same size of the module being dragged, this is what I have figured out so far... $( "#col1, #col2, #col3" ).sortable({ connectWith: ".col", start: function(event, ui) { var type = ui.item.hasClass("double") ? " double": ""; }, placeholder: "module drop" + type }).disableSelection(); My problem is that I'm trying to use var "type" outside the scope of start, but I can't figure any other way of doing this. If anyone wants to play around with the code, I've set up a fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/TfcQq/
