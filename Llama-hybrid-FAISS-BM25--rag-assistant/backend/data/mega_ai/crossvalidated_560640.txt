By now, 5 months later than this question was asked, I did further look into the topic of repeated measurements per individual and thus can now provide an answer. Maybe it is helpful to the one or the other who also comes across a similar question. So with this, let's get to the answer: As I pointed out in the question, my goal was not to create an aggregated response variable, i.e. one observation per animal by calculating a mean across all time points per individual. If we want to keep working with the ~13 individual data points per animal, the covariance structure needs to be taken into account, since observations from one animal are similar than observations across different animals. Not taking into account a covariance structure leads to a so-called pseudo-replication and biases towards too low p-values. How the covariance structure can be taken into account is dependent on the distribution of the observed data. For our example we have two options: Either a mixed linear model in the case of normally distributed residuals or in any other case a generalized mixed linear model. Typically, for an evaluation in R, checking of the residual distribution is done after one of the models are run. The code to perform a mixed linear model looks like this: library(lme4) library(car) GoatMerged$EarStatus EarStatus and Goat_ID need to be cast as.factor . (1|Goat_ID) models the random effect of the individuals as random intercept term, which considers the covariance in the data and allows every individual its own intercept. Though it does not model individual slopes. If a modeling of slopes per individual is necessary, is one of the still open questions. qqnorm(resid()) and qqline(resid()) allow to check the distribution of the residuals. If they are normally distributed the results of the code above can be taken as is. Then applying a mixed linear model is correct. If the residuals are not normally distributed, then other things need to be considered. One option is to check transformations of the data, like log10, sqrt, power, ... If, also of transformed data, the residuals and random effects are not normally distributed, then one needs to switch to a generalized (mixed) linear model. The design of a generalized (mixed) linear model tends to be considerably more complex than designing a mixed linear model. I applied the above described code to my data given in the question and noticed that the residuals are normally distributed with one of the transformations, thus I will not get here into the details of a generalized (mixed) linear model. Mixed linear models consider only observations without missing values. To keep all animals from the dataset in the analysis, one option would be to exclude the days with missing values from the data set. So not a wilcoxon test, but a mixed linear model is the correct approach for repeated measurements per individual as they are present in time series data.
