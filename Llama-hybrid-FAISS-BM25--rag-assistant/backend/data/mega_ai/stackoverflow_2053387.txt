how to create 2d array in python if we know number of rows,and number of columns depends on some condition?

My array maximum dimension could be 2x27,but number of columns could be lower than 27.Number of columns depends on some condition.Is good solution to initialize array 2x27 and then delete unnecessary columns or has more elegant way to do this?
