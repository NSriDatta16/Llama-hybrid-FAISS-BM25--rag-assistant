Derivation of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) decision boundary

I've been reading the Introduction to Statistical Learning and Elements of Statistical Learning by the Stanford professors Hastie and Robert Tibshirani and I've been trying to derive the discriminating function knowing the posterior for LDA, assuming common covariance matrix, p=1 and Gaussian distribution. . If our assumption for normal Gaussian distribution of the likelihood holds we obtain the Bayes Classifier. In the second picture it's mentioned that we take the log of the posterior but detailed steps of the derivation are not provided and I'm not sure how to derive it.
