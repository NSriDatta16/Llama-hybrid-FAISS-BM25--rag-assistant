overflow:hidden is very 'powerful' (I've been using it for several years, and I agree to what David said) but at the same time exposes to a problem. If i.e. inside the container you have some abs elements that you have to drag and drop outside of it, u won't be able to see them outside the container. In this particular case u need to use that 'clearfix' trick ;)
