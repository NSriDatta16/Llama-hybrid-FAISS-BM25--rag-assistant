Android ADB fails to display devices on 2011 Macbook Pro

Just began working on a new 2011 Macbook Pro only to find ADB cannot see any of my devices. This occurs under Eclipse in DDMS and when I run ./adb devices . I have found some discussion of this saying there are intermittent issues in OS X 10.6.6 with problems seeing Android devices but this seems to be different as all of my devices are mountable via USB. I see the exact same behavior running Windows 7 in Virtualbox, Apple support on this issue is non existent as they insist it is Android's problem. The devices I have encountered this problem with include: Sony Xperia mini X10 Motorola Droid HTC Droid Eris Samsung Galaxy Tab Could this be a hardware problem on my new Macbook or am I dealing with something related to OS X? Either way I may have to trade for a Windows laptop :-( **updated March 27 2011 Have now tried a full Bootcamp installation of Windows 7 complete with all the Apple provided drivers - same result resorting to powered USB hub didn't help either The device appears as Android Phone under System Profiler but remains invisible to ADB, mounting works fine.
