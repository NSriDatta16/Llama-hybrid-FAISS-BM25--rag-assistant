Make predictions (classification) with nested? data

The goal of this small project is the predict one week in advance whether this athlete is sustaining an injury (binary classification). The data I have is questionnaire data from 29 athletes, with well-being and training load data. This data is kind of nested, because of the 29 athletes that are in the group. What kind of methods can I use to make predictions? The output of this project should be ONE! model and not a model for every athlete! Thanks in advance! EDIT: The data is a time series if you guys are wondering
