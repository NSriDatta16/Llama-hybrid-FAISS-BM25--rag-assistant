AutoComplete doesn't automatically brute-force the position of your AC container every time it shows, because unless you're doing inline work this is unnecessary. However, now that you've moved your input field inline, you do need to take another step to align the container, either with custom CSS or brute force JS positioning. Here's the brute force approach. After you define your AC instance: oAC.doBeforeExpandContainer = function() { var Dom = YAHOO.util.Dom; Dom.setXY("myContainer", [Dom.getX("myInput"), Dom.getY("myInput") + Dom.get("myInput").offsetHeight] ); return true; } Here's a working example: http://ericmiraglia.com/yui/demos/acalign.php
