This link will at least get you started with some model equations for linear mixed effects models as well as linear models which assume no pooling or complete pooling: http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/303/lec/lec9/multi.pdf . This link is a bit more explicit in terms of how partial pooling works in a linear mixed effects model: http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2017/09/partial-pooling-for-lower-variance-variable-encoding/#more-5245 . This link will give you visual insights into partial pooling compared to no pooling and complete pooling: https://www.r-bloggers.com/plotting-partial-pooling-in-mixed-effects-models/ . These notes (section 20.7) also talk about pooling in a linear mixed effects model context and explain how pooling depends on the size of the group: https://jrnold.github.io/bayesian_notes/multilevel-models.html . These slides talk about the degree of pooling and how to quantify it: https://web.as.uky.edu/statistics/users/pbreheny/701/S13/notes/4-18.pdf . For pooling in a generalized linear mixed effects model, check out this link: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/pooling.html .
