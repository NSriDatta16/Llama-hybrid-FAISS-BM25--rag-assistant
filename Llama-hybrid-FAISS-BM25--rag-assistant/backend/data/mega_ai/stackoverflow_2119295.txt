The session data is stored as a (php) serialized array in a temporary folder. The locations for these are set in the php.ini file. But you can change both the format of the data and the place it is stored (e.g. to a database or shared memory or somewhere else) by writing your own handler. A quick google suggests that several people have written [de]serializers in Java for PHP data. e.g. http://hurring.com/scott/code/java/serialize/ If you have problems with the built-in PHP serialize function - have a google for WDDX (which IIRC comes as standard) and serializes data into XML. You might want to think about how you keep the session data appearing to be active to PHP if you want the agent to continue independently of the web session. C.
