Creating a Non-Databound Report in Winforms

I am using Visual Studio 2008 and all the components that come with it as well as Infragisitics for Winforms. I need to design a label that will print to a label printer. None of the controls are databound and will most likely be set in code eg/ Label.Text = "My Heading"; as there will be minimal information on the label. One piece of information is a barcode so I need the functionality to do that, I assume I can just set the font of the label to barcode and it will do its thing. Can I just add a Crystal Report to a form design it, set the label text properties in code, tell it what printer to print to and then call report.Print(); I've had a quick go and seems not as easy as I thought. Thanks UPDATE: I have added a Crystal Report to the project and use the following code to access labels/text objects on the report. CrystalReport2 d = new CrystalReport2(); CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.TextObject txtReportHeader; txtReportHeader = d.ReportDefinition.ReportObjects["Text1"] as CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.TextObject; txtReportHeader.Text = "TESTING 123";
