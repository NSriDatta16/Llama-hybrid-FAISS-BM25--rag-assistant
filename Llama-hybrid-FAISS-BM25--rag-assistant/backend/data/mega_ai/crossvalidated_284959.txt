Why SVM works better when n≈m or n>m?

n : no. of features m : no. of training examples I was going through the machine learning course of AndrewNg and in one of his lectures he talks about which classifier to use in different scenarios. He mentions that if n>=m or n≈m then support vector machine could be used but not when n is small and m is very large. Why is that?
