page/control lifecycle

I have usercontrol x in a page, within usercontol x is usercontrol z. I need to do something to usercontrol z after an event fires in usercontrol x. I understand this is very generic, but it just lays out a simple premise for my issue. Is there a simple way to get a list of all events that fire in the page lifecycle whether I am subscribed to them or not to find out what events fire between Event A on the page and Event B on control z? I would think that there would be something like this when page tracing is turned on, but I don't see any events listed. I imagine that it would be something that the pipeline could generate, maybe I could use reflection to get a list? I found this topic hard to search against in general, maybe I am using bad keywords... I did find an old project on codeproject.com, but I was hoping that there would be something more elegant available by now. *To clarify, I'm looking to generate a list after a postback of every potential event (subscribed or not), in firing order from init to unload, of all controls on a page. THIS POST: Tracing all events in VB.NET gets me a little bit closer, however these are lists on a per control basis, not in chronological order.
