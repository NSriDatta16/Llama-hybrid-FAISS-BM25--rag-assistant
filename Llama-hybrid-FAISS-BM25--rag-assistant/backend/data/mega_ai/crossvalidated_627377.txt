Sample size calculation in a meta analysis in ecology

I am conducting a meta-analysis in the ecology discipline, such as on the effect of elevated CO2 on soil organic carbon. In my case, treatment and control groups have different sample sizes within the same study. For example, in 5 studies, combined control n is 43 and treatment n is 90. So, what will be the sample size for the overall meta-analysis? In ecology, the sample size of the mean effect size has only been reported if you study the multiple factors (e.g., elevated CO2, N fertilization, etc.) in the same paper. In other words, a forest plot is separately produced without including individual studies.
