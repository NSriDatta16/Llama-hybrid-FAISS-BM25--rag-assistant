If you need to do image processing, but have little time for your project, and since you are a student, your best bet would be to use MATLAB for the image processing related computations (at least). In your University's library there must be quite a few books with plenty of examples about these problems and how to solve them with MATLAB (besides the huge online documentation from Mathworks.com). If you still want to use Java or .NET, it would be easier to use them only for the User Interface, and let the processing engine be in MATLAB. (Just take a look at many toolboxes MATLAB has, e.g. the Image Processing Toolbox , Neural Network Toolbox , Fuzzy Logic Toolbox , etc. )
