Theoretical Justification for Zellner's g Prior

What is the theoretical justification for Zellner's g prior for linear regression? I cannot see how it is possible to justify from a purely Bayesian perspective, in which probabilities are epistemic, and a prior distribution represents prior knowledge. Zellner's g prior for the regression coefficients depends on the matrix of covariates X, and in general there is no reason to expect this to provide any information about the regression coefficients -- especially when the data come from an experiment, and the experimenter chose X.
