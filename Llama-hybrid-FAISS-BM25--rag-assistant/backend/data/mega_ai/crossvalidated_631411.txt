Show that the conditional variance $\{h_t\}$ of a GARCH process is an ARMA($m,p-1$) process

This is question 10.6(c) from Time Series and Forecasting (2nd Edition) by Brockwell and Davis. The parts (a) and (b) of this question can be found here in another SE question. Question : Suppose that $\{Z_t\}$ is a causal stationary GARCH( $p, q$ ) process with $Z_t = \sqrt{h_t}e_t$ , where $\{e_t\} \sim$ IID( $0,1)$ , $\sum_{i=1}^p a_i +\sum_{j=1}^q \beta_q and $$ h_t = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p a_i Z^2_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j h_{t-j}.$$ Define $m = \max(p,q)$ , $a_i = 0$ for $i > p$ and $\beta_j = 0$ for $j > q$ , $U_t = Z^2_t - h_t$ and $V_t = a_1^{-1}U_{t-1}$ , and $a^*_j = \frac{a_{j+1}}{a_1}$ for $j=1,\ldots,p-1$ . For $p\geq1$ ,show that the conditional variance $\{h_t\}$ is an ARMA( $m,p-1$ ) process, where $$h_t = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m (a_i + \beta_i) h_{t-i} + V_t + a^*_1 V_{t-1} + \ldots + a^*_p V_{t-p-1}.$$ [I think there may be a typo in the book, and the AR part should either be of order $p+1$ or $p-1$ , depending on whether the text or displayed maths is correct.] My attempt: We write $U_t$ in terms of $Z_t$ and $h_t$ : $$Z_t^2 = h_t + U_t.$$ Now, we use the defining equation for $h_t$ , and then replace in the above expression: $$ h_t = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p a_i (h_{t-i} + U_{t-i}) + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j h_{t-j}.$$ We can identify $a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p a_i h_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j h_{t-j}$ as the sum $a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m (a_i + \beta_j) h_{t-i}$ . For the term $\sum_{i=1}^p a_i U_{t-i} = \sum_{i=1}^p \frac{a_i}{a_1} a_1 U_{t-i}$ , I cannot see how to get it into the correct form. By replacing $a^*_{i-1} = a_{i}/a_1$ and $a_1 V_t = U_{t-1}$ , I obtain the expression $$\sum_{i=1}^p a^*_{i-1} a_1^2 V_{t-i+1}.$$ This work leads me to believe that the displayed maths in the book had a typo, and the AR part should be of order $p-1$ . I also think that the definition of either $a^*_j$ or $V_t$ may have a typo? If I instead use $V_t = a_1 U_{t-1}$ , I get the answer $$h_t = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^m (a_i + \beta_i) h_{t-i} + V_t + a^*_1 V_{t-1} + \ldots + a^*_{p-1} V_{t-p+1}. $$ Could someone please let me know if I have made a mistake? Thank you for your help!
