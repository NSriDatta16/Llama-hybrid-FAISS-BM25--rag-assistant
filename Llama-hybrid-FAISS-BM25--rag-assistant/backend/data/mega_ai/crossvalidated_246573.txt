How to get a representative sample from a large set of samples

I have a set of gene expression samples which are split in different subgroups. I would like to have a representative sample for each class. Is it correct and biologically significant to take an average (mean or median) sample (i.e. a class centroid)? Is this methodology exposed to bias or is it safe to assume that the centroid of the class may be a good estimate of the expression value inside the class? Are there alternatives?
