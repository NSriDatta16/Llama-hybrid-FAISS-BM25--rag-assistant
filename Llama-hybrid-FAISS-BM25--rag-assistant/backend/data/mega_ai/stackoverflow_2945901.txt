I just had this question too: how to animate a custom editing mode? I didn't really like the solution here, so I decided to think a little bit and found a different solution. I don't know if it's better, but I prefer that one. So I decided to share it here: In the custom cell (inherit from UITableViewCell), just overload the setEditing: - (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animated { [super setEditing:editing animated:animated]; if (animated) { [UIView beginAnimations:@"setEditingAnimation" context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.3]; } if (editing) { /* do your offset and resize here */ } else { /* return to the original here*/ } if (animated) [UIView commitAnimations]; } I don't check if the editing value is the same, but that's just an idea how I did it.
