My forgotten password strategy - Any showstoppers here?

There's a lot of similar questions, but I didn't see this: I'm using users eMails for username - since they are unique yet memorable (not shown). And the send_a_new_random_password for the "retrieval". BUT, that would allow a disgruntled ex to change a users password again and again : ( To get around this (here it comes) I want to have 2 "correct" passwords in the user-record - PASSWORD and newPASSWORD (both hashed with PHPass 0.3) At the next successful login (checking both), I save the used one as PASSWORD, and dump newPASSWORD - Thus rendering the click_this_obscure_URL_to_enable process unnessecary : ) Am I overlooking something ?
