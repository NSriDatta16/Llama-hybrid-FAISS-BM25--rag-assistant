You're correct, when one is given the other can be inferred. This is always the case if the variables are dependent. But, the discussion in the text is about causality. Bayesian networks encode causal relationships. So, the direction of the arrows is the flow of causality in the model. Otherwise, you'd have always arrows in both directions. The word influence in the text tries to emphasise this concept, however I think the example could have been better.
