The actual signature (at least in 1.6) is public final Class getClass() According to the javadocs : The actual result type is Class where |X| is the erasure of the static type of the expression on which getClass is called. For example, no cast is required in this code fragment: Number n = 0; Class c = n.getClass(); If you didn't have a parameterized return value, you'd have to cast even if you had type information available at runtime. So the above example would end up as Class c = n.getClass(); //c now has no type information
