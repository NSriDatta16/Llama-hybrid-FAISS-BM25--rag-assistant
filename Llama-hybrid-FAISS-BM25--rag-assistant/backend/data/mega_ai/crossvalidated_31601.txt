To be somewhat technical here, those ratings aren't actually a Likert scale ; they're just ordinal ratings. Now, having said that, your point is essentially correct. However, I often think too much is made of this issue. One thing to note is that it is typically understood that the average of a number of ordinal items can be approximately interval, and thus, when there are many ratings the mean becomes a more reasonable representation. I have found this answer by @JeromyAnglim to be excellent (really, the question and all attendant answers there are worth reading). For a more theoretical treatment, see here . On a different note, I like Amazon, but I see no reason to expect statistical sophistication from them, especially in terms of basic site design--the point is usability by consumers, not to impress stats professors.
