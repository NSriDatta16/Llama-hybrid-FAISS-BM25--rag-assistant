UIKit: Animating a view while it's being moved by touchesMoved

So, I have a UIView subclass called MovableBlock . It overrides touchesBegan , touchesMoved , touchesEnded and touchesCancelled . The moving about part works just fine. When a MovableBlock is moved to the left side of the screen, it's 130px wide. When it's moved to the right side of the screen, it's 80px wide. I'd like to animate the transition in size, so that as the user is dragging the view around, the MovableBlock smoothy adjusts its size. Right now, I have this: // Handles the start of a touch -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; startLocation = pt; } // Handles the continuation of a touch. -(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint svpt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self.superview]; CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; if (svpt.x startPosition and column are both members of the class. While dragging the MovableBlock around, it doesn't resize (or animate). I can't seem to find any reason why it shouldn't work, though I also can't find examples of doing this, so maybe there's some subtle trick that I'm missing. There is another animation in the touchesEnded method that works just fine, so I know that the animation part of things is working, just not in touchesMoved . Thanks for any help!
