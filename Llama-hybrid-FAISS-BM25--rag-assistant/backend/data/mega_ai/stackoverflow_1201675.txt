Prior to 11.2, if you set JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES to 0, no job scheduled via DBMS_JOB will be executed. That parameter does not affect jobs scheduled via the DBMS_SCHEDULER package. If by "Oracle jobs" you are referring to things like the background job in 10g and later that automatically gathers statistics on objects with missing or stale statistics, those are DBMS_SCHEDULER jobs that would be unaffected by JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES . Starting in 11.2, that changed and JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES began to affect DBMS_SECHEDULER. The default value also changed from 0 to 1000 and it was made a non-basic initialization parameter.
