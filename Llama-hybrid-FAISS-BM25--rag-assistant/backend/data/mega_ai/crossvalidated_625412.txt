Jacobian and proposal ratio of Birth/death step in RJMCMC of Gaussian mixture model

I am asking questions regarding RJMCMC several times in this site. Some of my questions are answered and some are unanswered. It didn't clarify all of my unclear points but I am glad that I have better understanding of RJMCMC. I hope this question also help to improve my understanding regarding RJMCMC. I am studying Richardson and Green (1997) paper ( https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/59/4/731/7083042 ) of RJMCMC of Bayesian mixture model. The acceptance probability is somewhat simple for birth/death case. Merge/split is more complicated. The new parameter w_j*, μ_j*, σ_j* play role as u makes calculation of Jacobian straightforward. However, the calculation of proposal ratio here is not entirely clear for me. For the birth step, we have to create $w_j*$ and $(μ_j*, σ_j*)$ pair and death step, pair of $w_j*, (μ_j*, σ_j*)$ are deleted. I guess proposal probability discussed here, the death proposal probability is $d_{k+1}/(k0+1)$ and birth proposal probability is $b_k*g_{1,k}(w_j*)$ which make sense that death probability is computed from k0 which is number of zero component that is allowed to be deleted. and birth probability depend on the distribution of g_{1,k}(w_j*) which can be correspond to the probability of generating certain point of $w_j*$ However, I am confusing that "proposal ratio" of $(μ_j*, σ_j*)$ pair is not included in this equation. New component of $(μ_j*, σ_j*)$ are also generated with $w_j*$ with the some probability distribution and also deleted when one of w_j* is deleted. However, the "proposal ratio" of generating/deleting $(μ_j*, σ_j*)$ is not computed here because they are just generating and deleted randomly? Could you provide some more intuitive explanation for this?
