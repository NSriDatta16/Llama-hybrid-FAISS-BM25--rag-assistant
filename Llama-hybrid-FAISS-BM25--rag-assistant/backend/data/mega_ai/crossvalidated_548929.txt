Textbook recommendations covering machine learning techniques for causal inference?

Over the past 15 years there has been progress in adapting machine learning methods for causal inference. For example: targeted learning, double machine learning, causal trees. Is there a textbook that covers the current range of techniques? I haven't seen anything on Amazon, perhaps there are texts available on other sites? Or will be published soon?
