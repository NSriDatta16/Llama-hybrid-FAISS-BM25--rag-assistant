Referencing My.Settings across projects?

I've been poking around in some projects written by one of our contractors, and he seems to be storing a lot of settings in the main "app.config" file for the application, using, for example: And then referencing the key value in the "SomeClass" class in "SomeProjectLibrary" using ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get("SomeClass/SomeValue") While this works , I guess, it also pretty much sucks. I was wondering if anyone knew of some more elegant way of creating variables in the "app.config" file, which could then be used across various applications within a Solution? Hopefully I'm just missing something blindingly obvious.
