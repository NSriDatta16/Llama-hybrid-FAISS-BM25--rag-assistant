Decomposing parts of an effect

I am new to data analysis. Apologies if anything below needs more clarity or if this is very simple. I am curious about decomposing the relationship between a y and an x , but I want to know how a set of z variables affects the relationship and the y . A store allows independent vendors to sell their goods outside of the store. Only one vendor is allowed per day and the store rotates through a list of 30 different vendors. The order is pretty random. I have longitudinal data on each vendor's sales ( y ). I have parameters ( x s) about the vendor that I am using to correlate to y . An example is how many individuals operate the vendor's booth. I am interested in how parameters ( z s) outside of the vendor's control affect sales ( y ). An example would be whether the store is having a sale or the day of the week. I am also interested in how the x s (staffing) and z s (store sale or day of week) interact. What regression would allow me to (1) state what percent of vendor sales is explained by staffing , (2) what percent of vendor sales is explained by store sale , (3) what percent of vendor sales is explained by accounting for staffing and store sale , and (4) what percent of vendor sales is explained by staffing and store sale co-occurring. When I turn my attention to another z ( day of week ) do I also include the previous z ( store sale ) or no?
