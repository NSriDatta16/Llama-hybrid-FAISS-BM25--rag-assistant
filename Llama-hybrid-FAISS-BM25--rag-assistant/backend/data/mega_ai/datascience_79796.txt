Welcome to DSSE, Abdul. So, you trying to predict pipe corrosion based on water flow. I assume that the corrosion measurement is taken in different timesteps than the water flow measurements. If you have a fixed timestep for your corrosion measure both sum and average would work just fine, as this would be two features scaled by $\dfrac{1}{n}$ , where $n$ is just the number of timesteps taken by your water flow measurement system in one timestep of your corrosion data measurements. If your corrosion measure has varying timesteps then you should use the sum of the water flow since averaging would cause inconsistency. For example, the average of flow in 100 days could be the same as the average in 10 days, and the corrosion in 100 days would be way bigger. Having two similar inputs that map to two completely different outputs would cause performance issues for a regression algorithm.
