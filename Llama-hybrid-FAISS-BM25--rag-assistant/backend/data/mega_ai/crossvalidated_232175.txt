Gaussian Processes will work very well and you will get a perfect interpolation of the training data as you have a deterministic function. With deep learning you are adding so much complexity to your problem that is not actually needed and, even if it might give you a better RMSE (but this is not sure), you are wasting a lot of computational time/power for an easy task. It would be impossible for you to justify to a reviewer why did you choose deep learning for such a simple task. Stick to Occam's rule... If you fit a single Gaussian Process you will get a very good result. If you fit nested (deep) GPs, you will have to invert covariance matrices in every nested GP, each having a computational complexity of the order $O(N^3)$.
