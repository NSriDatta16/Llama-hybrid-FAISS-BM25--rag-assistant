It looks like your data includes strings and values. I suggest that you start with something simple as Logistic Regression. The strings can be hashed and the real values can be fed in as is. Split your dataset randomly in say 70% training and the remaining 30% for testing. Fit a model on the training data and evaluate the performance on the test data. This will give you a rough estimate of your classifier. The Vowpal Wabbit software package has everything you need to do the classification (and more). The format is simple, the learning is lightning fast - everything you need to experiment.
