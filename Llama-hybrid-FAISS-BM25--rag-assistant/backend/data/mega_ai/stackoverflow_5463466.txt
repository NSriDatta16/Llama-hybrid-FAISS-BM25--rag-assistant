I'm getting about 10-100 slow queries(where each may last about 5-6 seconds). Quote of a comment: Database is properly normalized. The database has many tables, one of them is really huge and has nothing to do with normalization. When im reading this i would say it has to do with your queries.. has nothing to do with your hardware.. Average companies would dream about kind of server you have! If you write bad queries doesn't matter how good your tables are normalized, it will be slow. maybe you got something about this , its almost a similar question with an answer(database is slow and stuff like that). Also thought about archiving some stuff? For example from those 300 million it started with ID 1 so is that ID still get used? if not why not archive it to a other database or table(i would recommend database). I also believe that not every 700k users are logged in every day(if you got respect! but i don't believe that). You also said 'This table contains player specific items' what kind of specific items? Another question, can you post some of your 'slow' queries? You also considered about a caching system from some data? that maybe changed once a month, like gear other game stuff?
