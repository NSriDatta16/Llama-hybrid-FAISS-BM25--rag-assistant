UCB1 is a deterministic algorithm, as at each decision-making point (play of the bandit) it selects the best alternative by a deterministic rule: $$ \text{action} = \arg \min_j \bar{x}_j + \sqrt{2\log(t)/n_j}$$ where $t$ is the iteration count, $n_j$ is the number of times we've already chosen action $j$, and $\bar{x}_j$ is the average reward we've seen from choosing action $j$. There is no randomness in the selection of $\text{action}$ given our state of knowledge $(t, n_j, \bar{x}_j)$ at each decision point, hence the designation of "deterministic". The rewards are random, but that does not make the algorithm itself a stochastic algorithm, although the sample path of actions chosen is random because the results of the bandit play are random. Adversarial or non-adversarial has nothing to do with it. Decision-making algorithms in adversarial games can be either deterministic or stochastic.
