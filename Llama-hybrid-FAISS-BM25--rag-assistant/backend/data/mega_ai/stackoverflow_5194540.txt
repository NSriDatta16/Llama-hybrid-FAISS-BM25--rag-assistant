How do I configure a site in IIS 7 for SSL?

We have an Windows 2008 server with IIS 7 to test sites we develop for our clients. Each site has a binding on a subdomain: clienta.example.com clientb.example.com clientc.example.com (* Using example.com to protect the innocent) For one of these sites we now have to test if it works over https. So I have created a certificate request with *.example.com as the common name. I have received the certificate (issued by PositiveSSL SA) and completed the request. The certificate is now installed in IIS. Now I have added an https binding to the second site with the following settings: type: https IP address: All Unassigned Port: 443 Host name: clientb.example.com SSL certificate: *.example.com Browsing the site over regular http works fine. When I try to browse the site over https I get the following errors (depending on the browser used): Chrome This webpage is not available Error 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED): Unknown error. Firefox Unable to connect Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at clientb.example.com Firebug says Status: Aborted Internet Explorer Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage I have checked Failed Request Tracing, and according to the log the request was completed with status 200. I have run the SSL Diagnostics Tool with the following result: System time: Fri, 04 Mar 2011 14:04:35 GMT Connecting to 192.168.2.95:443 Connected Handshake: 115 bytes sent Handshake: 3877 bytes received Handshake: 326 bytes sent Handshake: 59 bytes received Handshake succeeded Verifying server certificate, it might take a while... Server certificate name: *.example.com Server certificate subject: OU=Domain Control Validated, OU=PositiveSSL Wildcard, CN=*.example.com Server certificate issuer: C=GB, S=Greater Manchester, L=Salford, O=Comodo CA Limited, CN=PositiveSSL CA Server certificate validity: From 2-3-2011 1:00:00 To 2-3-2012 0:59:59 1:00:00 To 2-3-2012 0:59:59 HTTPS request: GET / HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: SSLDiag Accept:*/* HTTPS: 85 bytes of encrypted data sent HTTPS: 533 bytes of encrypted data received Status: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0 Date: Fri, 04 Mar 2011 14:04:35 GMT Connection: close Content-Length: 315 Not Found Not Found HTTP Error 404. The requested resource is not found. HTTPS: server disconnected Final handshake: 37 bytes sent successfully Q: What can I do to make this work?
