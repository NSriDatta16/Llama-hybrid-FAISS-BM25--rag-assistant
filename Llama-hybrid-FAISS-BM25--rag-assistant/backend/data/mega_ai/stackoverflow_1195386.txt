Making business code readable, database enums

Lets say i got a enum table like this: id name desc 0 Normal Normal shipping 1 Fragile Fragile, handle with care and i got some business rule on an order double ShippingPrice(Product p) { if (p.ShippingType == 1) // Fragile return GetFragileShippingPrice(p); else return GetNormalShippingPrice(p); } Maybe not the best example. But the point is, how do you make the "p.ShippingType == 1" part readable. When the next person comes along to maintain this code, he has to find the production database, and query tables for every business rule to understand what they do. I've considerd just creating an enum in code just do duplicate the data in the database, but that don't seem like a good solution either.
