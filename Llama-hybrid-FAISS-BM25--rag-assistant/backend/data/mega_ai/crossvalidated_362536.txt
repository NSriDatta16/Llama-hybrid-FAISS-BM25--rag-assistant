Is it statistically valid to compare error measures for different sized samples?

I have forecasts for different sized samples using a variety of methods like DES (Double Exponential Smoothing), SES, MA and WA (Weighted Average) to test the strength of the forecasting models. The problem is that SES was used on 100 items, DES was used on 130 items, and so on. I have the forecasts for each item for each month in the year 2017, as well as the actual values for the same months. Since ideally the error should be as close to zero as possible for all cases, if the scaled Mean Error for SES is less than DES, is it valid to say that the SES should be ranked higher for forecasting ability than DES?
