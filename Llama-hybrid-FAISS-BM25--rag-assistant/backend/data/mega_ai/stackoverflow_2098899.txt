This seems like what the controller is for. I realize that people want to push logic to models, and for good reason, but let's be pragmatic here: if your system is changing this value automatically, and there is only a single point in your system where someone can change it manually, it does not, in my opinion, introduce all that much complexity to simply enforce the existence of a reason in your controller with something simple like: if params[:object_name][:life_cycle_id] != @object.life_cycle_id && params[:object_name][:life_cycle_change_reason].blank? flash[:error] = "You must enter a reason for changing the life cycle." redirect_to :back and return false # or whatever end
