What is your favorite problem for an introduction to probability?

I like introducing probability by discussing the Boy or Girl or Bertrand paradox. What other (short) problem/game provides a motivating introduction to probability? ( One answer per response, please ) P.S. This is about a gentle introduction to probability, but in my opinion it is relevant for statistics teaching as it allows to further discuss about discrete events, Bayes's theorem, probabilistic/measurable space, etc.
