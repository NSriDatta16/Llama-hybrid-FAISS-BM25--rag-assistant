Using ANN in time series with limited observations

I'm trying to predict weekly market shares over time with a small data set (190 examples and 4 inputs). My questions are the following: Is there a particular technique for small number of observations? (i.e., I heard that you could train a network with white noise to avoid the cross-validation.) Do I have to filter data when i'm working with time series? (i.e., account for seasonal dummies)
