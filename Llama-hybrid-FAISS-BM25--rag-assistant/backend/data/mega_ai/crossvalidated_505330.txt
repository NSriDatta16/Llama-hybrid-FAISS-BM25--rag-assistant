Alright, I will answer my own question since I feel more confident after doing some more research. Is my step by step derivation of quadratic cost function's (Neural Networks) partial derivative with respect to some weights matrix correct? Yes, It is. Though, the notation maybe sloppy. I accumulate a negative sign in front which makes me nervous because I did not see it at other places Sometimes, other derivations online distribute the negative sign and rewrite the final result in such a way that does not start with a negative sign at front. I missed the distribution and that made me feel nervous about me having a negative sign at front. Finally, Neural Networks: The Backward Pass has the same derivation with a little less sloppy notation.
