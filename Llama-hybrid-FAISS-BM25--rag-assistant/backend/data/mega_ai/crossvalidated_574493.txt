Statistical analysis (comparison) of time course experiments

I have data sets that represent multiple measurements over time. The data sets come from biological experiments in which we measure something in N individual cells, with around 250 measurements over a time frame of around one minute. For each of the time points, we have summary statistics (mean, SD, N) that we can plot to create a curve; this curve will thus be the average curve of, say, 30 individual curves from individual cells, and error bars will be either the SD or SEM of those individual curves. Now, we have several such "average" curves that represent, e.g. "treated" versus "non-treated" cells. We need to statistically evaluate whether the curves are significantly different. What I have done so far are multiple t-tests ("one per row") between two curves - this gives me individual p values, one for each time point, which looks like a reasonable start. In principle it tells me from what time point in the measurement the curves are significantly different (if they are at all). Is there a tried-and-true statistical method to get a single p-value to determine whether two such curves are significantly different? Can anyone let me know (in layman's terms) how to do it? edit: For illustration, here is a typical result - we have means, SD and N for every time point, but show only a few SDs here as error bars to not totally obscure the "average" line. What we'd like to have is one value that describes the significance of the difference between two lines, e.g. of the blue and the red ones.
