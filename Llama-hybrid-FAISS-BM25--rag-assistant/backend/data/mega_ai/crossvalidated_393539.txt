Problem with the word 'machine' in the definition of machine learning by Mitchell in the book "Machine Learning"

The definition : A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and performance measure P, if its performance at task T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Here, we talk about what it means for a program to learn rather than a machine, and a program and a machine aren't equivalent so how can we use this as a definition of machine learning when its a definition of program learning.
