What are pros and cons of empirical Bayesian methods?

The empirical Bayesian method is a new concept to me. It raises my interest, because it offers a different philosophical and methodological perspective of statistical analysis. From my limited knowledge, I am not sure if it is useful/powerful, or inferior to alternative methods, and if it is worth learning (and to what degree) compared to learning other useful topics in Bayesian analysis? How do you think about it? What are pros and cons of empirical Bayesian methods?
