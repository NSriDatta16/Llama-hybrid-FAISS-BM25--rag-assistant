The problem of optimizing wave picking from a warehouse is equivalent to the Travelling Salesman problem . That is, you have N-orders waiting to be picked, and you want to find the n best orders to minimize distance travelled and different pick locations visited by a picker. I recently came across this problem. We punted and used an approximation that will work well for the average case, but may sometimes provide sub-optimal results.
