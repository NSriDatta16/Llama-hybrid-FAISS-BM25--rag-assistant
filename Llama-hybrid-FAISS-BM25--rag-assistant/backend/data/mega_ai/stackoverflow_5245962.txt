I am still interested in other approaches but I have come up with a solution of paring my pushpin element with a MapPolyline, this in conjunction with the mouse handling to allow the user to drag the pushpin updates both, it is pretty effective and will do for now. I would still like to hear from anyone else with better suggestions though.
