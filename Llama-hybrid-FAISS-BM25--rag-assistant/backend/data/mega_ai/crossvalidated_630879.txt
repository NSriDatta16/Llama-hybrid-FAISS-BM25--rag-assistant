Interaction terms in linear models assess if group effects differ across measurements. A significant interaction suggests the group's influence on outcomes varies at different times. emmeans calculates adjusted average group means for each measurement, considering other factors in the model. This adjustment can lead to different significance levels compared to the interaction term due to refined standard errors and p-values which are adjusted for multiple testing. This would not appear to be the reason in yhour case since you have used adjust=none . One possibility is that the emmeans function computes standard errors and confidence intervals based on the marginal distribution of the EMMs, which takes into account the uncertainty in the estimation of the fixed effects, as well as the random effects structure of the model. The lmer model, however, tests the interaction terms based on the conditional distribution given the random effects. For research questions on interactions, consider the multiplicative interaction to determine if an effect exists between group and measurement time. The multiplicative interaction coefficients indicate whether there is something to look at, while the EMMs tell you what the effect looks like. If there is a significant interaction, further investigation can be achieved with EMMs to see where those differences lie. But if the interaction is not significant, this often suggests that the main effects of group and measurement time may be sufficient to explain the outcome variable. In practice, researchers often report both the interaction test results and the EMMs to provide a complete picture of the effects.
