Paul Graham wrote an essay on what he learned in developing Hacker News . The emphasis is more on the people/interactions he was trying to attract/create than on the algorithm per se, but still well worth a read. For example, he discusses the different outcomes when stories bubble up from the bottom (HN) versus exploding to the top (Digg) of the front page. (Although from what I've seen of HN, it looks like stories explode to the top there also). He offers this quote: The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases. which in light of the purported algorithm for generating the HN front page: (p - 1) / (t + 2)^1.5 where p = an article's points and t = time from submission of article might be a good starting point.
