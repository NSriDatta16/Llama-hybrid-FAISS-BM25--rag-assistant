I am using a LinqDataSource and I had problems getting my query with a Date Comparison in it to execute without errors. The answer is to use the WhereAddParameters function and add the test value as a strongly typed parameter. See the example below where I am matching a groupid and checking to see if the StopDate in my record is greater that or equal to a Date/Time stamp of now. I am using this code fragment currently and it works like a charm. LinqCampaigns.WhereParameters.Add("StopDate", System.Data.DbType.Date, DateTime.Now.ToString()) LinqCampaigns.Where = "GroupId = " & myGrp & " && " & "StopDate >= @StopDate" Works like a charm....
