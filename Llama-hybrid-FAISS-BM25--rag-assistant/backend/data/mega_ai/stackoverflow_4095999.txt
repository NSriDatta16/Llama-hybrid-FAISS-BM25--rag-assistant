Georg has the best answer, if the string is shifted randomly (I assume by 0..n bits evenly distributed) his strategy of always flipping the first bit will sooner or later succeed. Unfortunately that strategy may take very long time depending on the length of the string. The expected value of the number of bits being set to 1 will be n/2 in average, so the probability that a bit flip will be successful is 0.5, for each bit being set that probability decreases by 1/n. The process could be viewed as a markov chain where the probability for being at state 0xff...ff where all bits are set is calculcated and thus the number of trials in average required to reach that state can be calculated.
