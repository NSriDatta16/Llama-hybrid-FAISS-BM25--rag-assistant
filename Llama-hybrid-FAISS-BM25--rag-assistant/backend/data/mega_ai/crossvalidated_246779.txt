How to interpret effect significance and effect size of Categories in Logistic Regression?

This is a follow up to this question on this site. Let's say I'm doing a Logistic Regression with 2 Independent Variables (IVs). One IV is ordinal and named AGE , and the other is categorical and named SERVICE with 3 categories: A , B and C . Let's say I get the following result: Scenario 1: Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) AGEP 1 1154.18 |z|) (Intercept) 1.1 5.974e-02 -1.748 0458 *** AGE 1.2 1.038e-03 -33.973 Here's how I think one would interpret the results of the SERVICE variable: Being in the category A is a significant predictor of the outcome, with an effect size of 1.1 on the log of the odds ratio. Being in the category B is a significant predictor of the outcome, and is significantly different than being in category A , with an effect size of 1.3 on the log of the odds ratio. Being in the category C is not significantly different than being in category A (in its effect on the outcome). Question 1: Is the above interpretation correct (for the SERVICE variable)? Scenario 2: Let's say I get the following result: Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) AGEP 1 1154.18 |z|) (Intercept) 1.1 5.974e-02 -1.748 0.20458 AGE 1.2 1.038e-03 -33.973 Notice that Intercept is no longer significant. Here's how I think one would interpret the results of the SERVICE variable: Being in the category A is not a significant predictor of the outcome. Being in the category B is a significant predictor of the outcome, with an effect size of 1.3 on the log of the odds ratio. Being in the category C is not a significant predictor of the outcome. Question 2: Is the above interpretation correct (for the SERVICE variable)?
