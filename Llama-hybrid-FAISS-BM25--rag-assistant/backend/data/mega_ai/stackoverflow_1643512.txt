NickFitz is right, DocumentFragment doesn't have the API you expect from Document or Element , in the standard or in browsers (which is a shame; it would be really handy to be able to set a fragment's innerHTML . Even frameworks don't help you here, as they tend to require Nodes be in the document, or otherwise use methods on the context node that don't exist on fragments. You'd probably have to write your own, eg.: function Node_getElementById(node, id) { for (var i= 0; i It would almost certainly be better to keep track of references as you go along than to rely on a na√Øve, poorly-performing function like the above. var frag= document.createDocumentFragment(); var mydiv= document.createElement("div"); mydiv.id= 'myId'; frag.appendChild(mydiv); // keep reference to mydiv
