As Robert Gould said, you can not link together 32 and 64-bit objects or shared libraries; they are simply not link-compatible. Since you only have 32-bit PhysX, you must compile all other code that will be linked into the executable (main.o in your example) in 32-bit mode (by using the -m32 gcc flag), and install 32-bit versions of all other libraries (glut, libGL, libX11, libc, etc.). RedHat makes this easy -- they provide 32 and 64-bit packages for everything, and separate them into /usr/lib32 and /usr/lib64 ... AFAICT, Ubuntu does not: both amd64 and i386 packages contain /usr/lib/libglut.so.3.8.0. You would need to download 32-bit versions of everything, and install them into /usr/lib32 instead of /usr/lib "by hand".
