You have AllowDrop="False" on your stack panel, i dont know if this will stop you dropping on items in that, but i would remove it and see if it makes a difference. Also your drop events are on the tree view item not the tree view, is this the behaviour you want? or do you want to drop on the tree view, in which case your event handlers should be there.
