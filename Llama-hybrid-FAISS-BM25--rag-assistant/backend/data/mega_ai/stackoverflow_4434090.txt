paragraph tag does not enclose block elements

How do I place block elements in the HTML paragraph tag? When I attempt to do that, Firebug's HTML tab shows that the paragraph does not enclose the block element. Furthermore, any CSS applied to the paragraph does not apply to the child block element. This code: foo bar p { line-height: 2em; } Becomes rendered as: foo bar
