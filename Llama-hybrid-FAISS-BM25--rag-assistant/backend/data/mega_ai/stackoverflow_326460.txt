Register Startup Script Control

I am looking to make a web control where I can register client startup scripts inline with my aspx because I hate registering in the codebehind! An example of what I have so far: var form = document.getElementById(" "); Currently, I am overriding the OnPreRender method of the control, rendering the contents of the control to a string and then manually registering that string as a startup script using ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript on the Page . I also override the Render method in order not to render the control. I should also note that I have the ParseChildren attribute set to false and the PersistChildren attribute set to true . All seems to be working well, but my control allows other web controls inside it (such as Button). Apart from being unintuitive, this can result in runtime errors. I would love to be able to clear the controls but this is impossible given the code block. So, is it possible to prevent developers from embedding child controls whilst still allowing code blocks? Also, is this idea any good or is it fundamentally flawed? Lol. Thanks a bunch, Ben
