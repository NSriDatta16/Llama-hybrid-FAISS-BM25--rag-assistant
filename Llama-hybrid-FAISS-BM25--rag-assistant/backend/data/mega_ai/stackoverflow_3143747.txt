startDrag event on Movie Click only drags one layer flash actionscript3

I have a problem with the startDrag function I'm using in AS3. Right now I have a movie clip which is made up of 4 different layers. I export the movie clip, create and object of it, add in an event listener for mouse clicks that calls the startDrag function. However, instead of dragging the entire Movie Clip and all of its parts, it only grabs and drags one layer around, which breaks the different parts of the Movie Clip up. public function HopperMouseDown(event:MouseEvent):void { event.target.startDrag(true); //start dragging tile // mSoundManager.PlayTileUp(); //play tile up sfx } This is my function for the MouseClick event on the MovieClip. I initiate the startDrag event, but here it will not drag the entire Move Clip for some reason it only drags the different pieces inside the clip. Any help is appreciated.
