First you should try and find out what is causing the slowness you are observing. Are you writing to tables? Are your writes within large enough transactions so that you don't save needless temporary results to disk? Can you change writes to go to temporary tables (with pragma temp_store=memory )? Can you live with pragma synchronous=off ? I don't think this functionality is exposed in the Python module, but sqlite has a backup API that sounds like exactly what you are asking for: a way to copy from one database to another (either one of which may be an in-memory database) that works pretty much automatically without any user-visible enumeration of tables. (Maybe APSW exposes this?) Another option is to create a ram disk (if you have sufficient control of the environment) and copy the file there.
