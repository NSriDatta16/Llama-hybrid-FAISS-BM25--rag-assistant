Google Maps API Countries and Regions as Polygons

I've got a question about highlighting areas on Google map. I know how to place polygons on map. It's pretty simple and straghtforward. The problem is I don't have access to such data and I don't know any source of it. From my database I get lat/lon for a specific place and I need to have data about their borders. Do you know any free or paid database that contains such polygons data for all countries/regions in the world? Thanks in advance.
