.NET Shell Control Library

Looking for a good quality .NET Control library that provides shell capabilities such as folder trees, item lists, right click, file context menu, and OLE drag/drop. Update: (I am asking this for someone else) Specifically want to provide the list of "files" which may be from numerous locations (the results of a search). And then have the explorer like behavior with that.
