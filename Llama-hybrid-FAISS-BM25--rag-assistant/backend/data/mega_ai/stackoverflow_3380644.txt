HTML offers authors several mechanisms for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain: unordered information, ordered information and definitions. (from http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#edef-UL ) I think lists are the most important elements in HTML: semantically, there are so many objects that are pure lists. It is also a good practice to use ul or dl to group input fields and labels in form too. Someone will markup form using paragraphs: Full Name: Password: Occupation: Location: And someone will markup it using lists (and this looks very organic in my opinion): Full Name: Some errors/validation warnings --> Password: Some notes about the field above --> Occupation: Location: Forms are lists (lists of fields, grouped data), because they have uniform and repetitive structure: INPUT_1 INPUT_2 ... INPUT_N
