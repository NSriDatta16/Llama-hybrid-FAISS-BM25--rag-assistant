Is brute force conditional probability a good algorithm product recommendations?

I'm creating a recommendations system for an e-commerce web application. I need an algorithm. I've come across conditional probability, which might be what I need. I heard very little about recommendations algorithms built with conditional probability, and I need to hear thoughts if it's any good. This is how the algorithm I was thinking of will go: For every product visited by a customer, let X be the event where customer purchases this product For every other product in the system, let Y be the event where the customer purchases that other product. The probability of a customer purchasing a product is defined by the amount of times the product has appeared in orders, over the amount of total orders. I would calculate P(Y | X), and then sort by highest probability, then take the top. Is this a good algorithm? Does this technically count as machine learning?
