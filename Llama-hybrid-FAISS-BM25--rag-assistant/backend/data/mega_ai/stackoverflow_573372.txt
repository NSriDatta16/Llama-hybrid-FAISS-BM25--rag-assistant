How to get touch event on a CALayer?

I'm new to the iPhone SDK. Right now I'm programming with CALayers which I really like a lot â€“ not as expensive as UIViews, and a lot less code than OpenGL ES sprites. I have this question: is it possible to get a touch event on a CALayer? I understand how to get a touch event on a UIView with -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event but I can't find anywhere about how to get a touch event on a CALayer object, for instance, an orange square floating in 3D space. I refuse to believe I'm the only one who's curious about this. I appreciate any help!
