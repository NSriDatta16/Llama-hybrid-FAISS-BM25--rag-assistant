There are so few permissions problems that aren't annoying... I can only give you advice from a Google search (it appears you're not the only one who's had this problem) that's probably unhelpful, like: try changing the folder permissions to read only via the command line e.g. attrib +R FolderName . look on the Security tab in the Properties window and see what the exact permissions are there, for your logged in user or any of the groups you're in. See if they're set appropriately, and try changing them from there. restart machine I just hope I haven't enraged you more when this advice doesn't work.
