I'm not sure I entirely get what you want to do, but if you want to cluster the patients (and using a clustering algorithm), your biggest problem will be dimensionality curse. To avoid that you should use a dimension reduction algorithm. I particularly like autoencoders especially when I have binary features. You will then start with a large number of binary inputs and ends up with a lower number of continuous input which will allow you to use traditional clustering methods (k means or other)
