Reconstruction error in the PCA context is variability of the data which we are not able to capture in the lower dimensional space. Principle subspace - lower dimensional subspace on which data is projected Reconstruction error as contribution from ignored subspace In PCA Reconstruction error or loss is sum of eigen values of the ignored subspace. Lets say you have 10 Dimensional data, and you are selecting first 4 principal components, what this means is your principle subspace has 4 dimensions and corresponds to 4 largest eigen values and respective vectors, So reconstruction error is sum of 6 eigen values of the ignored subspace, (the smallest 6). Minimizing the reconstruction error means minimizing the contribution of ignored eigenvalues which depends on the distribution of the data and how many components we are selecting. Reconstruction error as average squared distance Ignored subspace is orthogonal complement of principal subspace, so reconstruction error can be seen as average squared distance between the original data points and respective projections onto principal subspace as shared in another answer.
