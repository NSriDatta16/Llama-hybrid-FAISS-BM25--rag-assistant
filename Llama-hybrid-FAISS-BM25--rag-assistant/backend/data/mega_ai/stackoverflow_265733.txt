The global interpreter lock is a big mutex-type lock that protects reference counters from getting hosed. If you are writing pure python code, this all happens behind the scenes, but if you embedding Python into C, then you might have to explicitly take/release the lock. This mechanism is not related to Python being compiled to bytecode. It's not needed for Java. In fact, it's not even needed for Jython (python compiled to jvm). see also this question
