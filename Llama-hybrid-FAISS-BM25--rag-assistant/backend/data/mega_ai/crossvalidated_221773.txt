My understanding is that you should generate individual propensity score models for each data set, then match, then estimate outcomes, then combine the estimates into one. 1) Match() in Matching accepts a user's own propensity score (include it as the X parameter in the call to Match() . matchit() in MatchIt does the same. I also recommend you try propensity score weighting; the package twang allows users to enter their own propensity scores/weights and then assess balance. The twang vignette explains how to do this and estimate a treatment effect. 2) Typically for balance assessment reporting, you assess balance on each dataset individually and then report maximum imbalance for each covariate across the imputed data sets. Do not average your imputed data sets. If across the imputed datasets the maximum imbalance of each covariates is within an acceptable range (e.g., ASMD
