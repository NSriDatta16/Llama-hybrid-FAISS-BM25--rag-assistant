How should I interpret parameters of the SARIMA model in time series analysis?

I am a bit confused as to why the SARIMA model requires four parameters beyond the ARIMA model just to remove the seasonal component from a time series. Obviously $m$ is required to specify the duration of the period. It is less clear how $P$ , $D$ , and $Q$ jointly specify the remainder of the information about seasonality. Does removing seasonality ultimately consist of removing or quieting certain terms from a frequency domain representation of a time series, in the same mathematical vein as removing a target frequency from audio? If so, then how would the four parameters $m$ , $P$ , $D$ , and $Q$ relate to targeting a frequency in the audio engineering application?
