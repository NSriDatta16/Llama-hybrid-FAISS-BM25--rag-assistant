After much playing I've plumped for the following: function redrawElement(e) { if (/MSIE (\d+\.\d+);/.test(navigator.userAgent) && new Number(RegExp.$1) Many of the other ideas nearly worked, but not quite, the padding idea worked once, but caused a nasty jump with the timeout, this does't seem to clause any issues with performance - so why not! :-) Thanks for your help!!
