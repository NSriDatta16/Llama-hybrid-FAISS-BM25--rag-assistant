SQL Server - Automatically Calculate total every day

I need to keep a daily statistic of the count of records in a table. Is there a way to automate counting the records daily and writing the result into another table? Maybe using a SQL Agent Job or something like that? I'm using SQL Server 2008. Thank you! Edit: If I delete today all records from 1/1/2010, the statistic still needs to show that at 1/1/2010 there were 500 records at the end of the day. So solely using GetDate() and summing up doesn't work, as I'd get 0 records with that method for 1/1/2010.
