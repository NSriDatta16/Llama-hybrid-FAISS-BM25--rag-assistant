No, you don't need to understand measure theory and real analysis to do machine learning in data science. However, it'd be hard to for you to read academic papers (eg: kernel methods) if you don't have the knowledge. Unless you want to be a mathematician or wish to pursue a Phd, you really don't need to know too much about the theories. In fact, most of the engineers working in the field I know don't understand statistics at all. They simply use some framework, get some good results, then get paid.
