What data from MATLAB's svmstruct are needed for classification in a different language?

As the title already states Iam wondering what data exactly are needed from the MATLAB svmstruct to be able to classify a new instance outside of MATLAB, e.g. in python or c++. I certainly need: the SupportVectors themselves (for calculating the distance using the kernel function). The kernel function (including parameter[s]) ported / rewritten The bias Now I am uncertain about ScaleData , Alpha and SupportVectorindices ... are they needed? Do I lack some base understanding here?
