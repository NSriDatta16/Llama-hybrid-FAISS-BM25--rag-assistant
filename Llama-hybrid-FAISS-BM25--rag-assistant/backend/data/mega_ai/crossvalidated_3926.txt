How to look at two different (but related) averages within a population

I'm looking at two plant categories (all species fall into one type or the other) at several different types of locations. Within each type of location, I have several samples, so I have an average of each type of plant as it is found in each type of location. Within each type of location, I want to compare the average number of one type to the average number of the other type. The number of one type of plant is not necessarily independent of the other (there is only a certain amount of resources after all). I feel as though there must be a simple test to look at this, but I can't remember what it is. For the difference in average number of ONE type across the different locations, I used an ANOVA; if there were only two locations I could have used a t-test. If I had one population type and one type of plant, and looked at it before and after some manipulation, then I would use a paired/dependent t-test... Any suggestions would be phenomenally helpful. Thanks!
