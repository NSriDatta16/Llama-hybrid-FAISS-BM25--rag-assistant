" and was released on the same day as the announcement. Grok-2 was released six days later, on August 20. On October 28, 2024, Grok received image understanding capabilities. On November 16, 2024, Grok received web search capabilities. On November 23, 2024, Grok received PDF understanding capabilities. On December 6, 2024, Grok was enabled for free users, but with usage limits. On December 9, 2024, Grok received Aurora, a new text-to-image model developed by xAI. Also in December 2024, xAI released standalone Grok web and iOS apps, in addition to its existing availability on X. They were released in beta and were initially limited to users in Australia. The app was made available to users worldwide on January 9, 2025. On January 2, 2025, xAI updated the Grok logo. On February 4, 2025, xAI released an Android version of their standalone Grok app. The release was firstly limited to Australia, Canada, India, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines and later released worldwide. In August 2025, Grok 2 was open-sourced under a "custom [license] with some anti-competitive terms". Grok 3 On February 17, 2025, xAI released its flagship AI model, Grok 3, along with other updates to Grok. Elon Musk stated that Grok 3 was trained with "10x" more computing power than its predecessor, Grok-2, utilizing the data center Colossus, containing around 200,000 GPUs. The model was trained on an expanded dataset that reportedly included legal filings, with xAI claiming it outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o on benchmarks such as AIME for mathematical reasoning and GPQA for PhD-level science problems. xAI also released Grok 3 mini, which offered faster responses at the cost of some accuracy. Additionally, xAI introduced reasoning capabilities similar to reasoning models like OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1, allowing users to access a Think mode to enable reasoning or a Big Brain mode for complex problem-solving, which utilized more computing resources. The 'Big Brain' mode was never made publicly available. xAI claimed that Grok 3 Reasoning surpassed the best version of OpenAI's o3-mini, o3-mini-high, on several popular benchmarks, including a newer mathematics benchmark called AIME 2025. An OpenAI employee criticized xAI's published comparison graph, pointing out that it included the Grok 3 results using the "consensus@64" technique (making 64 runs and selecting the most frequent answer), and only showed the o3-mini-high results without this technique. xAI also introduced DeepSearch, a feature that scanned the internet and X to generate detailed summaries in response to queries, positioning it as a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research. Initially, access to Grok 3 was limited to X's Premium+ and xAI's SuperGrok subscribers, with plans to offer it later via xAI's enterprise API. Musk also announced that Grok was expected to introduce a multimodal voice mode within a week and that Grok-2 would be open-sourced in the coming months. Hours after the announcement, X raised the price of its Premium+ subscription to $40.00 per month, up from $22.00. Grok 3 was made available to free users on February 20, 2025, for a "short time". This access was never disabled, despite being initially described as temporary. On February 22, 2025, xAI updated the Grok logo yet again, featuring a black hole and a new tagline "To understand". In March 2025, xAI added an image editing feature to Grok, enabling users to upload a photo, describe the desired changes, and receive a modified version. Alongside this, xAI released DeeperSearch, an enhanced version of DeepSearch that utilizes extended search and more reasoning. In April 2025, xAI launched an API for Grok 3. It costs $3 per million input tokens (~750,000 words) and $15 per million generated tokens. In May 2025, Grok 3 was announced for Microsoft Azure. In July 2025 Musk announced that Grok had been "significantly improved" and noted that users would "notice a difference". When the chatbot was found to be posting antisemitic
