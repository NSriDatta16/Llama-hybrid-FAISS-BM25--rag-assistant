How to interpret seasonal component of a time series decomposition plot?

I would like to know how to interpret the graph of the seasonal component of the time series decomposition plot. For example, for this chart: What does zero mean on the seasonal component graph? What is the interpretation when the value is below or above zero? I understand that the purpose of the graph is to check for the presence of a seasonal pattern but I would like to understand the meaning of the values.
