I believe you could leverage a t-sql output clause on your update or insert statement and capture that as an ssis variable....or just drop it into a sql table. here is an example...its crappy, but it is an example UPDATE TOP (10) HumanResources.Employee SET VacationHours = VacationHours * 1.25 OUTPUT INSERTED.EmployeeID, DELETED.VacationHours, INSERTED.VacationHours, INSERTED.ModifiedDate INTO @MyTableVar; You could output @@ROWCOUNT anyplace you need it to be. Here is output syntax http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177564.aspx
