This problem might not have anything to do with the Entitlements plist per se. I have two iPod Touches I use to test with. When I went to sync the apps with them, one worked perfectly, but for the other I got the 'entitlements are not valid' error. As it turns out, one device (the one that worked) had the mobile provision file on it, while the other one did not. This was an obvious oversight on my part. However, what threw me was I never explicitly added the provision file to the first device either. Not sure how it got onto that device (I'm still new at this - lol) - in the past I always just dragged it into the Organizer with the device attached, but I didn't do that this time. So the provisioning profile and xcode were all set up perfectly with the correct IDs, etc. but the app still failed to sync. Obviously if the device isn't properly provisioned, you will get the error. Would be nice if the error was more helpful in this case.
