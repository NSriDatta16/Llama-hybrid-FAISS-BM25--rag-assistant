I don't understand what it is you don't understand, if you see what I mean. Your middle paragraph: So, my understanding is that the list starts to generate itself and does repr() on all its elements and they return their values - in this case it should be 's2 | ÅÄÖÖ', then the list presents itself as (ascii, the-stuff-in-the-list) and then when trying to Decode the ascii into unicode this will of course not work -- since one of the elements in the list has returened a u'...' of itself when repr was done on it. explains exactly what is going on - outputting a list isn't the same as printing all its elements, because under the hood all it does is call repr() on each element in the list. Rather than outputting the raw list, you could log a list comprehension which calls unicode on each element, which would fix it.
