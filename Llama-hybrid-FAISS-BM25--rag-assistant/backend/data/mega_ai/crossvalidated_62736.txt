Is the case when response is discrete and ordinal classification?

When predicting the value of a response variable from the value of an explanatory variable, if I am correct, when the response is real-valued, the task is regression, and when the response takes values from a unordered discrete set, the task is classification. When the response takes its value from an ordered discrete set, is the task still classification? For example, let $Y$ be the response variable and $X$ be the explanatory variable. If the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$ is a Poisson distribution, is the task of predicting the value of $Y$ from the value of $X$ still classification? Is Poisson regression used for classification, just as logistic regression for classification? Thanks!
