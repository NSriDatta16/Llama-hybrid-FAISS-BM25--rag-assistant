Random Forest - How to handle overfitting

I have a computer science background but am trying to teach myself data science by solving problems on the internet. I have been working on this problem for the last couple of weeks (approx 900 rows and 10 features). I was initially using logistic regression but now I have switched to random forests. When I run my random forest model on my training data I get really high values for auc (> 99%). However when I run the same model on the test data the results are not so good (Accuracy of approx 77%). This leads me to believe that I am over fitting the training data. What are the best practices regarding preventing over fitting in random forests? I am using r and rstudio as my development environment. I am using the randomForest package and have accepted defaults for all parameters
