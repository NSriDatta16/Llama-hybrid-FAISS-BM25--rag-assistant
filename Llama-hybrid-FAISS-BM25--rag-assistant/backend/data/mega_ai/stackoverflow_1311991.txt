LaTeX: Avoid new paragraph?

I use the \todo command from the \todonotes package. I'd like to layout my source to put \todos separately from the previous paragraph: Some text. \todo{make note} But I don't want \todo to start a new paragraph, or it screws up the spacing of the document. Is there a command to avoid this? If there were a command/package to consume the whitespace up to it, then I could redefine \todo to use it. Edit: Adding a % between everything is obviously very irritating. Anything else?
