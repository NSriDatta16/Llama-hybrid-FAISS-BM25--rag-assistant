The argument of "non-repeatability" is a red herring promoted by those on the extreme Bayesian side. After all, both frequentists and Bayesians start at precisely the same place: a model for potentially observable data given by $P(Y|X, \theta)$ . This model states that the data we see is but one realization of a (potentially infinite) set of possible data sets. So, while the study may not be physically repeatable, it is certainly considered conceptually repeatable, by people in both camps. By the same token, those on the extreme frequentist side will not like my characterization above, because they don't like the "conceptual" part. But when you get right down to it, except in places like casinos, studies are never precisely repeatable in a physical sense (and there is even an argument to be made about casinos), so the requirement of strict physical replicability would render most of statistics moot.
