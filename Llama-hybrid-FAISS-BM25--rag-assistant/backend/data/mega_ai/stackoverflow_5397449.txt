The pixel data in an image file is represented in a format. There are may different methods for organizing pixel data in a file: TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, etc., just to name a few. Need more information about your file before detailed help can be given. All data in a file is made of ones and zeros, just the nature of the computer world. Perhaps if you indicate what you are doing with the image data, more information can be presented. See the following: Wikipedia page on image formats. std::ifstream::open, binary mode. std::ifstream::read std::vector to hold the data. Search Stack Overflow for the keywords "read binary file".
