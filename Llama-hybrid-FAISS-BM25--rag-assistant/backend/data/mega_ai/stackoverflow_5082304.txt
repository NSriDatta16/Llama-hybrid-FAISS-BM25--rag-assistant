Font-face and Wordpress

I'm trying to style a font that is being referenced inline using fancy box on a wordpress blog. Using both chrome and firefox. I've tried this two ways: 1.) Loading the @font-face on the theme's stylesheet, then adding a in html markup on the page itself. I don't want all of the paragraph text on the blog to load with that font, just the divs inline on the fancybox. I know all the sources are correct because I've tried them in html files and they load perfectly. 2.) I've tried loading the @font-face on the page html markup itself. I add a style and place the call in that style at the top of the page. Then I reference the font-family in the same way that works in the normal html page. The fact that it is working on a simple html page makes me think I'm doing something wrong specifically in wordpress. Here is the url to the page: http://elparquenuez.com/sandbox/wordpress/?page_id=4 Click on the first image to load the fancy box.
