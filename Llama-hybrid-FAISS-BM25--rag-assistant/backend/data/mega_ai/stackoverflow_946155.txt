If you look up the HTTP protocol definition, you'll find that: HTTP/1.1 defines the sequence CR LF as the end-of-line marker for all protocol elements except the entity-body (see appendix 19.3 for tolerant applications). The end-of-line marker within an entity-body is defined by its associated media type, as described in section 3.7. But that is not valid for the body. I assume you send the form information with a post request, so I assume the content type text/plain is used, and in that case I think the following applies: 3.7.1 Canonicalization and Text Defaults Internet media types are registered with a canonical form. An entity-body transferred via HTTP messages MUST be represented in the appropriate canonical form prior to its transmission except for "text" types, as defined in the next paragraph. When in canonical form, media subtypes of the "text" type use CRLF as the text line break. HTTP relaxes this requirement and allows the transport of text media with plain CR or LF alone representing a line break when it is done consistently for an entire entity-body. HTTP applications MUST accept CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF as being representative of a line break in text media received via HTTP. That means, it would be okay for a browser to send you UNIX style endlines. (Both paragraphs are from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt )
