I don't think there is too much you can do. First of all, yes, CV_BLUR instead of CV_GAUSSIAN will definitely run faster. When smoothing with Gaussian, the weighted average is calculated with Gaussian weights, but when using CV_BLUR, the all pixels within the radius are given the same weight. This is a simpler operation and so can be done much faster than the Gaussian blur. The fastest way to do a Gaussian blur is to use convolution, which is much more computationally intensive. Also maybe try OpenCV 2.0 if it's not too much trouble. It uses SSE and OpenMP, which both enable parallel processing. It's not a sure thing that it will be faster though.
