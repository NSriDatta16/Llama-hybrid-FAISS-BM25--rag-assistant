Why does border affect the containing block size in CSS?

I understand that the height of a box in CSS is the height of the contents, excluding the margin and padding, but why with this sample, if you uncomment the border: line in the containing div, does the background color of the div extend above the first paragraph while if you have no border it doesn't? #container { background-color: green; /* border: black solid 1px; */ } p { background-color: red; margin-top:50px; margin-bottom: 0px; border: black dotted 3px; } first paragraph second paragraph
