A couple points on this: First, random forests and decisions trees don't naturally output a probability as the response. I'm sure there is some way to set them up to provide this but you'll have to take that into account when tuning your model. Second, you may be aware of this but bear in mind that with a logistic model, the odds ratio for different values of a single variable (ignoring interactions) is constant regardless of values of the other variables. With random forests that will not be the case because the whole thing is built to actually find interactions. So when you express the odds ratio, it would have to be between two unique values of your dependent variable set. (B_Miner's response has some good thoughts about how to get an average odds ratio between values of a single variable, but that would be only an average.) So bottom line is that you should be careful about how you're using the odds ratio here. If what you're after is an odds ratio over values of a single variable, a random forest is a very disadvantageous choice of model structure.
