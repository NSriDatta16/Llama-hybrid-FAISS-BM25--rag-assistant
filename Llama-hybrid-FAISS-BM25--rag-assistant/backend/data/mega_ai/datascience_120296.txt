What are the constants in this formula for polytrophic head?

Polytrophic head can be expressed as H = b1N^2 + b2NQ + b3Q^2 where b1, b2 and b3 are constants, N is the speed of the compressor (rmp), and Q is the volumetric flow rate of natural gas at the compressor inlet (m3/s). I am trying to understand where I get the values for constants in the above formula. I can find columns in a database for the speed of a compressor (N) and the flow rate of natural gas (Q), however how do I come up with the data for b1, b2 and b3? Do I just assign random values within some distribution, regression problem, etc? Thanks. Source: Page Four of https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/15/5720/pdf
