Manually calculating logistic regression coefficient

I am taking this short example from wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression Hours | Pass --------|------- 0.50 | 0 0.75 | 0 1.00 | 0 1.25 | 0 1.50 | 0 1.75 | 0 1.75 | 1 2.00 | 0 2.25 | 1 2.50 | 0 2.75 | 1 3.00 | 0 3.25 | 1 3.50 | 0 4.00 | 1 4.25 | 1 4.50 | 1 4.75 | 1 5.00 | 1 5.50 | 1 I am trying to manually calculate the intercept and coefficient. How does the algorithm calculates the log of odds at each point to fit linear regression? If i try to calculate log of odds, I get into situation where it is log(0) or log(infinity). Can somebody please help here?
