Summarise unlimited sequence using constant storage

Assume we're frequently sampling a particular value and want to keep statistics on the samples. The simplest approach is to store every sample so we can calculate whatever stats we want, but this requires unbounded storage. Using a constant amount of storage, we can keep track of some stats like minimum and maximum values. What else can we track using only constant storage? I am thinking of percentiles, standard deviation, and any other useful statistics. That's the theoretical question. In my actual situation, the samples are simply millisecond timings: profiling information for a long-running application. There will be millions of samples but not much more than a billion or so. So what stats can be kept for the samples using no more than, say, 10 variables?
