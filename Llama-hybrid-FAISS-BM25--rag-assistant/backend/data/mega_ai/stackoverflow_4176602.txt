Figured out one way to do it. All I had to do was add an instance variable in my designers controller: @projects = Project.all But...that's not very DRY. Does anyone have a more elegant 'DRY' solution, so if I want to access other variables in other controllers I can do that easily without having to re-create them in the current controller? Thanks.
