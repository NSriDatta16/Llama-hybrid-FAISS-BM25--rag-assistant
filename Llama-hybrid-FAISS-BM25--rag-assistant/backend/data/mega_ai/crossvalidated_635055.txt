It's pretty clear you should use some form of logistic regression, the real question is which form would be best. You have "happy", "not happy", and "not answered". Three options: 1) Ignore the "not answered" and use the usual logistic regression. 2) Treat "not answered" as intermediate between the other two and use ordinal logistic. 3) Treat "not answered" as fundamentally different and use multinomial logistic. But I might not do any of these! People who answer these forms tend to be either very happy or very unhappy, usually about some specific thing. I would use the forms that way. Try to find out why they were happy or unhappy. I'm guessing that a very long wait time is one cause of unhappiness, but only one. Maybe they got the order completely wrong. Maybe the food was cold. Maybe the waiter was rude. Maybe their seats were uncomfortable. Who knows? Any sort of statistical analysis of your questions might obscure this. However, if you do wind up doing an analysis, I would include a spline of wait time, because I think it's very likely that the relationship is nonlinear. Also, I don't think wait time would be related to "happy" responses. People won't check happy just because they didn't wait (at least, not at most places).
