Conjugate Hyperpriors

I heard it was possible to have a Bayesian model with likelihood, prior and hyperprior that has a posterior of closed form, by choosing a conjugate prior and conjugate hyperprior. But I struggle to imagine how that would work, except for models where likelihood and prior are the same. E.g. when I have a Normal-Normal model, a Normal hyperprior would probably result in a Normal posterior. But how would that work for other distributions? For example, could a Dirichlet prior and Multinomial likelihood be enhanced with a conjugate hyperprior?
