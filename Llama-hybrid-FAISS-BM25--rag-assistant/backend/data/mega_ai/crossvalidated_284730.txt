I think most text books take it for granted the inner-product and consider observations as vectors in a vector space with that inner-product. The notion of Hilbert space, on the other hand, involve completeness (containing the limits of all Cauchy sequences of vectors in the space) which in turn guarantees existence and unicity of projections. I think this is also taken for granted in most treatments of PCA. Simply, multivariate statistics books tend to avoid these details that are not essential for the comprehension of the method nor its succesful application. But I think you are right in what you say if you want to go to that level of detail.
