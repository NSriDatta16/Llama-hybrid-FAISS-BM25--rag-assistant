Understanding the relationship between R0, doubling time, and the epidemic curve

New to infectious disease epidemiology here and am just trying to understand some basics. I've read basic texts on SIR esque compartmental models. However, I'm struggling to understand how to align that theory with the numbers I see on the news every day regarding COVID. Firstly, I'm confused as to how the $R_0$ value relates to the doubling time. Is there a direct mathematical relationship between the two? I see a lot of epidemic curves on the news, which plot the number of new cases over time. For these epidemic curve, in many countries like Germany, you've seen them reduce the number of new cases over time. Here is an example from the Robert Koch Institute: In these cases, if you see an decrease in the number of new cases day over day (but still non-zero new numbers of cases), can the $R_t$ still be $> 1$ ?
