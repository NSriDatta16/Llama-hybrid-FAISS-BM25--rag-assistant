Different ways to manage articles while building the entire system yourself. Hmm, ok, let me give it a try... here's the short version. There are several ways you can "store" your articles (content, data, whatever), and the best way to do so is to use a Database. ( SQL Server , MySQL , SQLCE , SQLite , Oracle , the list goes on ). If you're not sold on the idea of a database, you can use any other type of persistent storage that you like. IE: XML , or even flat " TXT " files. Since you're using ASP.NET you now need to either write your code behind, or some other complied code to access your stored data. You pull it out of the storage and display it on the page/view. Last but not least, I'd like to give you a suggestion (even though it's not part of your original question). As the other answerers have stated, you should look at a pre-built CMS. If nothing else, to see how it's done (not necessarily to use it as is). My philosophy is quite simple, if you want to be productive in your development, don't bother reinventing the wheel just for the sake of it. If someone else has already build and given away exactly what you need, you should at very least give it a look and use what you can. It will save you piles of time and heartache. Your question is not vague enough to be closed, but is vague enough that answering all of the nuances could take several thousand lines.
