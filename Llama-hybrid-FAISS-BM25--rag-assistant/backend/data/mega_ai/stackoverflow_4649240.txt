Unfortunately, it seems like: the BitMap.createBitmap() signature you are using is the correct way to 'subset' a bitmap that same method's contract allows it to either return a view over the same bytes or to copy them If your original bitmap were immutable (isMutable() == false), that would give some encouragement for it to return an object based on the same byte array, rather than copy the same. To get an immutable bitmap, you could try createBitmap(Bitmap) and discard all references to the original (and/or use recycle())?
