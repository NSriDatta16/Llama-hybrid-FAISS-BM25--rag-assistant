How to ensure a member is 4-byte aligned?

In order to use OSAtomicDecrement (mac-specific atomic operation), I need to provide a 4-byte aligned SInt32. Does this kind of cooking work ? Is there another way to deal with alignment issues ? struct SomeClass { SomeClass() { member_ = &storage_ + ((4 - (&storage_ % 4)) % 4); *member_ = 0; } SInt32 *member_; struct { SInt32 a; SInt32 b; } storage_; };
