You can still use logistic regression because your outcome is dichotomous, infected vs not-infected. I would just simply take a dummy variable approach and use no travel as the reference category (i.e. for each of your places you have a variable coded as 1 if they visited that place and coded as 0 if they did not visit that place). As such if you transform your beta coefficients to odds (i.e. exponentiate the log odds) the interpretation of the dummy variable for location A would be the odds ratio of visiting location A over not visiting location A controlling for other places one visited. Also note in this approach multi-collinearity is a concern (e.g. if many of the people who travel to A also travel to B it may bias each of their coefficients).
