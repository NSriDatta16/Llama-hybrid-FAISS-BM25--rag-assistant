An excellent example you will find here . As about designer. When you will rebuild your project, you will(should) see your textBox as a custom component in the Toolbox. Drag and drop that component instead of your ancient textBoxes. If not, you need to find all the references of your MyTextBox1 because you need to change it in at least 2 places: declaration and creation( MyTextBox mtb; and mtb = new MyTextBox(); )
