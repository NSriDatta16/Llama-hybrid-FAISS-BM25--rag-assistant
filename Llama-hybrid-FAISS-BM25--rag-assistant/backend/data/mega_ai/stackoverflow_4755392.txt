Joining 2 tables indirectly through a relationship table

I'm trying to fetch the genres related to a band through a relationship table. Is there any way to utilize JOIN to connect the genres table through the band_genre table? Obviously this is easily achievable using multiple queries, but I'm wondering just how elegant this sort of query can be. Thanks :) # (Bands) Table band_id = 1 band_name = The Roots # (Genres) Table genre_id = 1 genre_type = Hip-hop genre_id = 2 genre_type = Soul # (Band_Genre) Table bg_id = 1 bg_band = 1 bg_genre = 1 bg_id = 2 bg_band = 1 bg_genre = 2
