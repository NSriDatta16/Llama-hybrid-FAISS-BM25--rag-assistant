Clustering groups that have replicated measures: hierarchical clustering on group-average VS regression tree

I measured 2 continous dependent variables (V1 and V2) on 10 occasions (10 replicates) for each of 4 groups. I aim to cluster my groups. i.e. I dont want to cluster replicates, since this could mix groups inside a cluster. I see two options: hierarchical clustering on group-average (V1mean and V2mean) multiple regression tree(MRT) with replicated measures as dependent variable and group as independent variable NB1: I am not interested in the hierarcical structure. Kmeans partitionning on group average would be also OK for me. I guess the MRT solution is more usefull since it give an idea on the significance of the resulting clusters. However, I never saw multiple regression tree used like that. Could you please confirm that I am not wrong. Here is a working exemple with R. Data simulation and visualisation: gp=gl(4,10) V1=rnorm(40,c(rep(1,10),rep(4,10),rep(8,10),rep(7,10)),rep(2,40)) V2=rnorm(40,c(rep(1,10),rep(4,10),rep(8,10),rep(7,10)),rep(2,40)) levels(gp)=paste("g",levels(gp),sep="") df=cbind.data.frame(gp,V1,V2) summary(df) f.se=function(x)sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)) df.m=ddply(df,.(gp),summarize,V1m=mean(V1),V1se=f.se(V1),V2m=mean(V2),V2se=f.se(V2)) ggplot(df,aes(V1,V2,color=gp))+geom_point()+ geom_point(data=df.m,aes(V1m,V2m,color=gp),shape=4)+ geom_errorbarh(data=df.m,aes(V1m,V2m,xmin=V1m-V1se,xmax=V1m+V1se,color=gp),shape=4)+ geom_errorbar(data=df.m,aes(V1m,V2m,ymin=V2m-V2se,ymax=V2m+V2se,color=gp),shape=4) Option 1: hierarchical clustering on group average htree=hclust(dist(apply(df.m[,-1],2,scale),"euclidean")) plot(htree) Option 2: MRT mrt=mvpart(data.matrix(apply(df[,-1],2,scale))~gp,data=df,xv="min") We can see that MRT suggests a difference between gp 1 et 2, which is not obvious as regards the results of hierarchical clustering
