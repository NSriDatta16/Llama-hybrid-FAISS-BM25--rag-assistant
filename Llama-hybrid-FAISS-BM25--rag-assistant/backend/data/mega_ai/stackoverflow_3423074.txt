You could use a subquery in an exists clause: select ssn, name from YourTable a where organisation = 'Finance' and exists ( select * from YourTable b where organisation = 'IT' and a.ssn = b.ssn and a.name <> b.name ) The subquery says there must be a row in IT with the same SSN but a different name.
