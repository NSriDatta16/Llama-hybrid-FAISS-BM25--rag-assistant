Determine recurrent states via First Return Probability

I have the following question. It's about transient and recurrent states in Markov Chains. I know when a state is one or the other, but there is one thing I can't figure out or understand. We have learned that the sum of the First Return Probabilites (FRP) must be = 1 for a state to be recurrent, otherwise it is transient (see Figure 1). In my example below both states should be recurrent, but if I calculate the First Return Probability for state 1 (a time step) I get 0.5. The others are irrelevant because we already had our First Return. So the sum of the FRP = 0.5 so Figure 1: Example:
