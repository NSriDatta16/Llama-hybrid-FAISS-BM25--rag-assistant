imbalanced numeric target variable in machine learning

In the machine learning problem I'm trying to solve, the target variable is numeric.(Integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 25. However, they are highly imbalanced. There are more than 20k of 0s, 1500 of 1s, 600 of 2s, 180 of 3s, 84 of 4s, ...... My question is what is the proper way to deal with this kind of machine learning regression problem? High appreciate if anyone can give me expert advice. Thanks.
