Programmatically defining NSSegmentedCell

I am a little stumped as to how to instruct a programmatically created NSSegmentedControl to use a subclass instance of an NSSegmentedCell . If I want to use a subclasses NSSegmentedCell on an NSSegmentedControl built using IB it would be as simple as doing the following: Drag an NSSegmentedControl into the NSView Click through to the NSSegmentedCell In the inspector assign the class definition to the subclass (e.g. myCustomCell ) Job done. However, when programmatically creating an NSSegmentedControl as in the following simplified example, I don't see how to subclass the cell... -(void)creatSegmentControl { if (!mySegmentControl) mySegmentControl = [[NSSegmentedControl alloc] initWithFrame:NSMakeRect(0,0 400,20)]; [mySegmentControl setSegmentCount:2]; [mySegmentControl setLabel:@"First" forSegment:0]; [mySegmentControl setLabel:@"Second" forSegment:0]; [mySegmentControl setTarget:self]; [mySegmentControl setAction:@selector(segmentClicked:)]; } NSSegmentedControl does not appear to have a method for defining the class to use for it's segment cell instances. As usual, any and all help appreciated. Update Tried implementing [mySegmentControl setCellClass:[myCustomCell class] but that didn't work either. I was thinking that maybe it inherited the ability to set it's cell class like other AppKit controls. :-( This must be possible though... somehow...
