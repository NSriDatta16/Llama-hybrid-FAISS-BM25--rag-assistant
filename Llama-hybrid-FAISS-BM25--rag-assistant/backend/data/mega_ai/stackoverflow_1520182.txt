It really depends how much automated test coverage you have. If you have little or none, you can't make any changes without breaking stuff (If it wasn't already broken to start with). I would recommend that you sensibly refactor things as you make other changes, but don't do a large-scale refactoring on the DB, it will introduce bugs and/or create too much testing work. Some things like missing primary keys are really difficult to work-around, and should be rectified sooner rather than later. Inconsistent table names can basically be tolerated forever.
