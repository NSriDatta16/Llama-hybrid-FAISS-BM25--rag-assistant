Why do one-versus-all multi class SVMs need to be calibrated?

On the wiki page for multi-class support vector machines ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Multiclass_SVM ) it states that "it is important that the output functions be calibrated to produce comparable scores." Why is that so? Why are the scores not directly comparable with each other?
