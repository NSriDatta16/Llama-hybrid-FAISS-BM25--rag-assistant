Classifier performance decreased after feature selection

Im working on stock price direction prediction project and have tried out some models (SVMs and Random Forests). I used Ransom Forests for feature selection and it actually decreased the performance of Random Forests and SVMs. There was a decrease in performance in cross validation and testing both. Does this mean that feature selection won't work at all or a different method of feature selection should be implemented? Please help me understand the intuition behind this and any fix. Thank you.
