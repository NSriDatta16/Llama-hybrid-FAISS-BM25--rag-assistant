How to express Bayesian Network or Markov Random Field using deep learning

Bayesian Nework and Makov random field are instances of general probabilistic graphical model. Is it possible to express Bayesian Network or Markov Random Field using deep learning? or in general to express factor graph using deep learning tools like tensorflow/caffee?
