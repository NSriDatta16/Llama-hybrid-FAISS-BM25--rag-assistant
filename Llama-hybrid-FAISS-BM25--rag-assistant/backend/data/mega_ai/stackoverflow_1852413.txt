To get a really comprehensive answer to this, you'd need to do a great deal of historical reading from the early days of Java. Certainly, the designers could have included a more complicated primitive type system. However, when Java burst onto the broad stage, it was aimed at applets. Code to run in a browser, organizing complex UI, didn't (and doesn't) need to know whether it is running on the infamous MNS-49 (7 7-bit chars per word), or the Honeywell 68000 (4 9-bit chars per word), or a boring modern processor. It's much more important than anyone can code bit arithmetic on an int and know what's going to happen after 32 shifts.
