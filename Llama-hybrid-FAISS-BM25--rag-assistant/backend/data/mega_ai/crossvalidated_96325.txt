Correct approach using t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test?

I want to compare 2 datasets. I have a biological structure A with its atom coordinates which are a few thousands. I also have from these atom coordinates the coordinates over time of about 20 nanoseconds. From this structure A I made about 70 simulations. After the simulation I calculated the distance between atoms within this structure and afterwards the average distance of these 70 simulations for each time step which means that I finally have the average distance of 20 nanoseconds of the structures A. Now I also have a structure B with which I made 80 simulations and performed the same procedure as described above. Finally I want to compare the average distance over time of structure A and structure B. 1) I make a Shapiro-Wilk or Shapiro-Francia test to make sure that the data has a normal distribution 2) If the data is normally distributed I use a t-test, otherwise a Wilcoxon rank sum test Is this a correct approach?
