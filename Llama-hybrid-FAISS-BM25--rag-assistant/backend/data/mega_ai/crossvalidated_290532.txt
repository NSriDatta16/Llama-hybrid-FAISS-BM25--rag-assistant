Statistical test for random machine learning classifier algorithms

Many optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent algorithm, are based on random processes. Assume that I am using one classifier that uses the SGD, What statistical tests are required to validate the results, e.g., the accuracy? Does running the algorithm $n$ times and the find the average of all $n$ accuracies enough? Is there any other standard method that gives a statistical significance for the classification in such scenario?
