Do you mean you have 1 file that is 94KB in size or that your whole library is 94KB in? Regardless, as long as you aren't piling everything into one file and you're organizing your library into different files your file size should remain manageable. If a single PHP file is starting to hit a few hundred KB, you have to think about why that file is getting so big and refactor the code to make sure that everything is logically organized.
