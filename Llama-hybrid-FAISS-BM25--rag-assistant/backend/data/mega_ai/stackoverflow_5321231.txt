drag and rotate an image inside a container

I am able to rotate image clone but it re-position out side the div. is it possible to show that rotate image inside the div. here is the link for jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/T6nn5/5/ but the rotate plugin is not included here, so, the image will not rotate.
