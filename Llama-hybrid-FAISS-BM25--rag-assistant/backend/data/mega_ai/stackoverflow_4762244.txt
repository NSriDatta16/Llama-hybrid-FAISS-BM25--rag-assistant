If I understand you correctly, you need fragmentary matches from field to field (e.g. '123" matches '123-111' and '12345' but not '122234' or '122-345') and you need to avoid all symbols when matching. Is this correct? The psuedocode below is what I would try first: Process all input fields to remove symbols Tokenize the fields to determine fragments to match Perform matches on fragments to data values It sounds like the best way to achieve this would be through ILIKE queries where the percentage signs are are the beginning and the end of the fragment, such as: SELECT * FROM [TABLE_NAME] WHERE address_1 ILIKE '%fragment%' You would have to perform this query multiple times, which could be a performance headache, but I believe that may get you what you want.
