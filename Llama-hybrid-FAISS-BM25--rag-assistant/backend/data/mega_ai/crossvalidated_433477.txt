Bayesian Machine Learning

I started learning about Bayesian Inference, and it's mostly dealing with parameter estimation (i. e. estimating a parameter $\theta$ of a Bernouli Distribution. I'm wondering if there are any textbook for Bayesian Machine Learning (i.e. Given some training data (X, Y), with a feature vector $X$ learn a function $f$ such that $f(X) = Y $ but with a bayesian perspective.
