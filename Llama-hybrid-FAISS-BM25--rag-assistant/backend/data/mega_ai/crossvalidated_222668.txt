Presenting logistic regression tables for non-binary categorical variables (Stata)

For my logistic regression model I have a couple of non-binary categorical predictors (e.g income level and education) with more than three categories. My question now is how to present findings for these variables elegantly; is there any other way than to include the coefficients for each category when using the estout command for example? Otherwise the table would be extremely large. What is the standard procedure here?
