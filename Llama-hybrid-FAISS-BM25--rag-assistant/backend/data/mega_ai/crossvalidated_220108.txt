I guess it's the problem with the data: the background is the same, and the ball is small. As shown in the blog you referenced, one application of autoencoders is image denoising. When you use the denoising autoencoder you actually add noise to the input images on purpose, so from your results it seems that the autoencoder only learns the background and the ball is treated as noise. Maybe we could try the followings to see if we can get better. 1) I don't know if you've subtracted the mean (background) from the image already, if not we can try that so that the data will be almost zero everywhere except the ball. 2) Instead of using fully-connected autoencoders we can try the convolutional autoencoders , which works better with image data and does not really rely on the denoising part. There's example code in that blog for this as well.
