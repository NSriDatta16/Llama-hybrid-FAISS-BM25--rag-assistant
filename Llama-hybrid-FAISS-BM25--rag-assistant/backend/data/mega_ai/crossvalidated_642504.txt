ETS Confidence Intervals in R are several orders of magnitude larger than the time series itself?

I am forecasting a time series with confidence intervals using the ets model in R. Here is the time series: Running the following R code: library("forecast") x produces the following "Lo 95" and "Hi 95" forecast confidence intervals: Regardless of whether ETS is an ideal model in this situation, the confidence interval is absurdly large. Since the time series dips so close to zero, on a hunch I tried first shifting the time series up by twice its mean, producing a forecast on the shifted time series, and then shifting the forecast back down. This produced the following more reasonable result: Given how robust and popular the function is, I doubt there is an error in ets itself. Might this be a weird edge case with this particular time series?
