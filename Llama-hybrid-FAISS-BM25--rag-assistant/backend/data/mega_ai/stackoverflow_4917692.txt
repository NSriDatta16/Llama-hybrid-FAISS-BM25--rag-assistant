Building web pages for mobile devices that allow dragging

I want to provide the mobile user (e.g. iPhone, Android, etc...) of my web page the ability to use a slider (like the jQuery slider, for instance). I cooked up an example . If you use it in Safari on the iPhone, when you try to drag the slider, it thinks you are dragging the entire page, so that does not work. On the Android, the slider just simply doesn't move, though both devices support simply clicking on the slider. So is there a way to build web pages that support dragging, like I want to?
