How to deal with interruption in time series analysis?

I am probing a time series data of transactions. Basically, I want to see the pattern of the number of transactions in each time slice. First of all, I looked at hourly data. However, the opening hour is 9am to 9pm thus no data in another 12 hours in each day. Secondly, I looked at daily data (i.e. by date). No transaction occurred on Sunday and holiday so the data does not contain these date. I read a book saying that: One of the assumption of time-series analysis is data points are taken at equally spaced time steps, with no missing data points. So should I fill the time (in hourly data) or date (in daily data) and interpolate the values (i.e. the number of transactions) to fulfill the assumption?
