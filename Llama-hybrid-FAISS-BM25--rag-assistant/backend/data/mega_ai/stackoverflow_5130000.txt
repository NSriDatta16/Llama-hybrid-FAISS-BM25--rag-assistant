I've written two blog posts about Trac and Kanban (and the new T&K - Redux ) where we just fill a wiki-page with three columns of TracQuery-macros. There's some example source in there. It's dead-simple (no drag and drop) but it works well for us. We use the GridFlow and BatchTicket plugins to quickly edit many tickets. The standard workflow is enough for daily tasks though. The most recent version looks like this: Note that by filtering on the age of the closed tickets column, you can also use this as a continous process, rather than per sprint/iteration/milestone.
