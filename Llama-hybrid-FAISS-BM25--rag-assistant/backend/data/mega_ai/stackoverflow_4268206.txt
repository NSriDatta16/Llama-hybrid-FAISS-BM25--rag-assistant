Not that I can see it, but I imagine a custom control made out of various images. You make a track image that tiles to make up the background, top and bottom cap images to act as the forward/back buttons (with hover and depressed states) and the moveable control is usually three-part, two end-caps on either side of a tileable central area that can be resized to suit. Then you monitor drags on the control area and keep it bound within the track, and clicks (or better mousedown) on the forward/back buttons. There are libraries like jQuery UI Slider that handle this for you if you do not wish to code it yourself.
