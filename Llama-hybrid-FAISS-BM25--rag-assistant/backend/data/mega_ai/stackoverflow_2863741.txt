How to change "area" of a control in DesignMode?

When I drag and drop a TextBox from the toolbox onto a WinForm, I can drag it around on the form as I like. Now I create a new class and inherit it from TextBox. I add a new property called CaptionLabel. When set to a value, I dynamically create a Label control, set its value and finally add the label to the TextBox' parent controlcollection. The result is a "LabeledTextBox". However, when selecting the TextBox, I still only get the TextBox selected... the selection rectangle does not include the Label, created dynamically. How do I extend the rectangle so that it also contains the Label and make the label "know" that it belongs to the TextBox? Or is there a better way to create labeled controls?
