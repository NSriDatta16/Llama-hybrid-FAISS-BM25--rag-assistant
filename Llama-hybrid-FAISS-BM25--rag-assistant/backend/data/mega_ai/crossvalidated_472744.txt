Expectation of sample averages from normal distribution

Let $n\geq 2$ i.i.d. normally distributed variables $s_i\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sigma^2\right)$ , with $i\in\left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ . I draw two samples of $k variables, without replacement. The set corresponding to the first (second) draw is denoted by $\Phi_1$ ( $\Phi_2$ ). What is the expectation of: $$\left| \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i\in\Phi_1} s_i - \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i\in\Phi_2} s_i \right|,$$ where $\left|x\right|$ is the absolute value of $x$ ?
