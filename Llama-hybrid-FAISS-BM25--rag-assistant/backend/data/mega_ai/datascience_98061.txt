Instead of GridSearchCV you should try Optuna. It is much faster than GridSearchCV. But apart from that, coming to your question, there is no best value for a hyperparameter per se! Period! It depends on what kind of data you have. What hyperparameter value works for one dataset might not work for another dataset. Also another point to keep in mind, there are many parameters for a model like Random Forest model. Including all of them with a wide range of values in your gridsearch will take forever. Instead include only those parameters that give the maximum improvement in your results (aka those that matter the most!). Here is a link to a blog that might help you: https://blog.dataiku.com/narrowing-the-search-which-hyperparameters-really-matter Hope it helps!
