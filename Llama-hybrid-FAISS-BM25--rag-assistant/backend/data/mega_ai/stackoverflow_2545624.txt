Implementing an Outlook 2007 style 'Group by box' using WinForms?

In Microsoft Outlook 2007 it is possible to drag items (ie From, Subject) from the Inbox to a 'Group By Box' that appears above the Inbox grid. What is the proper term for that kind of box? Where do I find some examples/samples on how to implement in a Winforms application?
