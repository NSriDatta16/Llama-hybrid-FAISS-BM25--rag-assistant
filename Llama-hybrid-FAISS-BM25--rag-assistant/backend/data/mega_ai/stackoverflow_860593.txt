Porting a Web Application to Desktop Application

I have a web app in production that is used for typical data entry,retrieval, and reporting type functions. For reasons of mobility( field access required ) I have been tasked with porting that Web App to a Desktop App. The structure of the existing app, which I did not design or code, is thus: 3 Individual Projects each with there own DAL and SQL DB named the same. Project 1 is the core app. Project 2 exists on top of Project 1 and add's further functionality but cannot exist on it's own. Project 3 builds on the first 2 projects and is as large as both but again cannot exist on it's own. To get into Project 3 , the web app, you log in to 1 , Select a Person , navigate to 2 , Select an Enrollment , navigate to 3 to then work with a Plan . All three projects share 1 BLL existing in Project 1 . Given all of that, a tight time frame, my relative newness, and the fact that I had nothing to do with any of the original three's creation(3 seperate dev's created the aformentioned 3 projects) what are some suggestions for me. Example, can I reuse the aspx pages, at all? Can they be embedded like WPF? Converted? What type of UI refactoring considerations should I keep in mind? Are there certain changes that will break things, theoretically? Any one else ever had to do something similar? Tips? Thanks! EDIT 1 There was a suggestion of Cassini below and coincidentally there is a post here on SO about it. HERE That post leads me to believe it WOULDN'T work for me as my "App" is actually 3 projects with 3 separate deploys. Correct or am I reading that wrong?
