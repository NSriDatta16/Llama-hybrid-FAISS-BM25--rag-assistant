Some cluster algorithms can use case weights. At least, "average" (also called UPGMA) or "Ward" clustering methods can use weights. If available, you should use those weights to get non biased results. In R, you can specify weights using the member argument of the "hclust" function (in base R). The WeightedCluster library also provides some functions (such as partionning around medoids PAM and clustering quality measure) for clustering weighted data. You can mix different types of variable (i.e. nominal, metric, ...) using the "gower" distance. In R, this distance is available in the "cluster" library using the "daisy" function. daisy(..., metric="gower") You can have more information about this commands by running: ?daisy ?hclust
