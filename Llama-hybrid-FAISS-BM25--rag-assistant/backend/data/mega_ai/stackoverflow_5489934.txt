If you are just storing data, your data mount for /var/lib/mysql should be 5TB SATA drives. If your application is write heavy, your data mount for /var/lib/mysql should be 5TB SAS drives RAID10. If upgrading disks is out of the question, you need to do periodic table defragmentation in one of three(3) ways: ALTER TABLE myinnodbtable ENGINE=InnoDB; OPTIMIZE TABLE myinnodbtable; Customize the defragmentation the table You can perform this defragmentation manually as follows: CREATE TABLE myinnodbtemptable LIKE myinnodbtable; INSERT INTO myinnodbtemptable SELECT * FROM myinnodbtable; ALTER TABLE myinnodbtable RENAME myinnodbtableold; ALTER TABLE myinnodbtemptable RENAME myinnodbtable; DROP TABLE myinnodbtableold; Option 3 does not work if the InnoDB table has constraints because constraints will disappear.
