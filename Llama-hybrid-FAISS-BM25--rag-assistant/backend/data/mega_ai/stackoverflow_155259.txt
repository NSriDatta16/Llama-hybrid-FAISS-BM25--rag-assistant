This is the kind of application we produce at Tideway Systems , and which many large organizations use for just this purpose. You can use the product to discover your estate, and use the modeling capabilities to describe your business apps (which typically consist of more than one piece of software and span servers). It sounds like you qualify to use the free Community Edition of Foundation, which you can use on up to 30 servers - just download it and check it out. Then let us know what you think please! Disclaimer: I run the development group at Tideway . The product is very cool IMO, although I haven't written any of it myself directly :)
