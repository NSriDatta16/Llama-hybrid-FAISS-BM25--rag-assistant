A lot of this depends on the size of the html fragment. Most likely it's small enough that fetching it is going to be relatively quick and storing it in the DB will work and it's not worth the hassle of dealing with out of DB objects. For larger objects it doesn't make sense. Exactly where the cutoff is depends on a lot of things. Sounds to me like the html chunks are pretty small and it's probably best to keep the html in your DB.
