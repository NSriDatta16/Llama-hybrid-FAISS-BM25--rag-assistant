Random forest does handle missing data and there are two distinct ways it does so: 1) Without imputation of missing data, but providing inference. 2) Imputing the data. Imputed data is then used for inference. Both methods are implemented in my R-package randomForestSRC (co-written with Udaya Kogalur). First, it is important to remember that because random forests employs random feature selection, traditional missing data methods used by single trees (CART and the like) do not apply. This point was made in Ishwaran et al. (2008), "Random Survival Forests", Annals of Applied Statistics , 2 , 3 , and nicely articulated by one of the commenters. Method (1) is an "on the fly imputation" (OTFI) method. Prior to splitting a node, missing data for a variable is imputed by randomly drawing values from non-missing in-bag data. The purpose of this imputed data is to make it possible to assign cases to daughter nodes in the event the node is split on a variable with missing data. Imputed data is however not used to calculate the split-statistic which uses non-missing data only. Following a node split, imputed data are reset to missing and the process is repeated until terminal nodes are reached. OTFI preserves the integrity of out-of-bag data and therefore performance values such as variable importance (VIMP) remain unbiased. The OTFI algorithm was described in Ishwaran et al (2008) and implemented in the retired randomSurvivalForest package, and has now been extended to randomForestSRC to apply to all families (i.e. not just survival). Method (2) is implemented using the "impute" function in randomForestSRC. Unsupervised, randomized, and multivariate splitting methods for imputing data are available. For example, multivariate splitting generalizes the highly successful missForest imputation method ( Stekhoven & Bühlmann (2012), "MissForest—non-parametric missing value imputation for mixed-type data", Bioinformatics , 28 , 1 ). Calling the impute function with missing data will return an imputed data frame which can be fit using the primary forest function "rfsrc". A detailed comparison of the different forest missing data algorithms implemented using "impute" was described in a recent paper with Fei Tang "Random forest missing data algorithms", 2017 . I recommend consulting the help files of "rfsrc" and "impute" from randomForestSRC for more details about imputation and OTFI.
