Typically for discrete (and finite) state MDPs, HMMs, or POMDPs, the most useful representation is a set of sparse matrices. Then, the probability distribution of moving can be computed with a matrix-vector computation (and the stochastic Bellman equation can be implemented simply and efficiently). The matrix will be called a stochastic matrix. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix I'd recommend looking at the SciPy library for sparse matrices if you're working in Python. http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html
