I like what Robert Harvey proposed and what Tomas added. I am new to F# too and I would like to comment on the three bullets, which refer prior to ASP.NET + F# by simply asking for a 101 in F#. You will definitely need some theoretical foundation before diving into F#. Erik's 13-episode Lecture, in Channel 9, is the best place to start C9 Lectures: Dr. Erik Meijer - Functional Programming Fundamentals F# isn't the quick and dirty way, nor the quick and reusable way we learned via oop design patterns. I think that you should take some time to embrace some of the basics. Afterwards, a good book like Tomas's (still waiting the hard copy here in Greece... grrrr :P) and writing alongside, some little code to get used with e.g., currying and other aspects, is what you need. My estimation of the learning curve depends in your mathematical background. Even if you haven't got any clue about functional programming, if for example you come from a Computer Science uni you will struggle your way through wisdom pretty soon ;););) And then you will enjoy the F# in Business Line Applications and improve your C# code too!!!!
