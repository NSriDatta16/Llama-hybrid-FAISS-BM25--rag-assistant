A search of my electronic copy of ISLR shows the symbol $\beta$ as appearing on 99 pages. A quick look at the context in which that symbol appears on those pages indicates that all uses of that symbol represent coefficients in linear forms, in contexts of: standard linear regression, logistic regression, penalized regressions, and support vector machines. That is consistent with my experience and with what @Tim notes in another answer: $\beta$ is a common choice for regression coefficients.
