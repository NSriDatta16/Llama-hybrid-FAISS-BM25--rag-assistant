I don't know if this will work, but if the only thing you want to know are the values of specific parameters at the point of error then a kludgy way of getting them would be to define those variables with dummy values globally. This works with loop counters, but I don't know if it works from within NDSolve . Another kludge would be to make t Dynamic and have an evaluated cell with t. A more elegant (and probably the correct) approach would be to use Reap and Sow .
