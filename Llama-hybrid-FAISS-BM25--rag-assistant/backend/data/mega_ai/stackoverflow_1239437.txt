Yes it can be done with Linq to SQL, as bdukes and pcampbell has shown, but it can be done with NHibernate as well. For example you could execute the following query, which would return a list of object[]: var userData = session.CreateQuery( "select u.Username, u.Password from User u").List(); If you want to you could select only some of the fields, but still get back an entity, so that you don't have to mess with object arrays. This can be done with HQL and Critera as well. For example, if the user class has a constructor that takes a username and password: var users = session.CreateQuery( "select new User(u.Username, u.Password) from User u").List ();
