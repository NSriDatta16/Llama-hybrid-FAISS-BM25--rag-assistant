By default all resources are downloaded eagerly; So have you tried this: specify "lazy" on all your other .jars Then maybe the download="progress" one will get preference and be downloaded first. Also try putting the progress one first in the list. Some examples here: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/customizeRIALoadingExperience.html There is also a property jnlp.concurrentDownloads which you could tweak and might have an effect. See http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/riaJnlpProps.html
