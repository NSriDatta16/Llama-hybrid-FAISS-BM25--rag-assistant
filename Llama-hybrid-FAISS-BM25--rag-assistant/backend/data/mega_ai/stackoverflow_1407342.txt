Does LINQ to SQL support POCO?

If I want to work with an object and leverage LINQ to SQL what (if anything) do I need to add to my entity classes to ensure my application can talk to the data store? (keep out any discussion of repository patterns here as I'm just looking for what is required inside my business objects)
