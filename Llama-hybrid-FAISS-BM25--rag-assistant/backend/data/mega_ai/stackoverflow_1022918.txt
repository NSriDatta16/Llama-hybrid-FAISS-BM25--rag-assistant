For the Linux kernel, there are several things the bootloader has to tell the kernel. It includes things like the kernel command line (as several other people already mentioned), where in the memory the initrd has been loaded and its size, if an initrd is being used (the kernel cannot load it by itself; often when using an initrd, the modules needed to acess storage devices are within the initrd, and it can also have to do some quite complex setup before being able to access the storage), and several assorted odds and ends. See Documentation/x86/boot.txt (link to 2.6.30's version) for more detail for the traditional x86 architecture (both 32-bit and 64-bit), including how these variables are passed to the kernel setup code.
