Check if table exists SQL

I have a query as below: INSERT INTO CarnetMaster.GlassLookupCapacitySpecs (ID, CODE, NVIC, RELEASE, DISCON, DRV, TORQUE, KW, BORESTROKE, VINNUMBER, WIDTH, WHEELBASE, SEATS, COMPRATIO, TOWCAP, STEER, TURNCIR, HEIGHT, LENGTH, VWIDTH, KERBWT, PAYLOAD, GCM, GVM) SELECT NEWID(), CODE, NVIC, RELEASE, DISCON, DRV, TORQUE, KW, [BORE-STROKE], [VIN NUMBER], WIDTH, WHEELBASE, SEA, [TS COMPRAT], [IO TOWC], [AP STE], [ER TURNC], [IR HEIG], [HT LENG], [TH VWID], [TH KERB], [WT PAYLO], [AD GCM], GV FROM CVG86_SPE How can I check if table exists, then select from the table CVG86_SPE and Insert? If table do not exists then it should do nothing.
