The real problem here though is I need to set the property of a WebControl with code on the markup page. The only way I've found to do this is put the whole control in a code block. Its not elegant or suggested but when all else fails this will work. But this won't work if you need the control to maintain state. UPDATE: After researching Kev's answer I did find an even better solution. I don't have a code behind (its an MVC page) but you can still reference a control on the page through a code block so my new solution is the following. Note - You have to place the code block first for this to work. Thanks for the inspiration Kev!
