Body Margin:0, Div Width:100% problem in FF and Chrome, fine in IE

I'm starting to pull my hair out of my head... I have the following: body { margin:0 auto; } test This works in IE producing a nice div, 100% width, no H scrollbar... Now in Chrome and FF, it is 1px wider than the window, causing an H scrollbar... Why is that? What SHOULD I be using instead? Thanks a lot! Albert EDIT: I added div { margin: 0; } to the head and removed the width: 100% and it worked, thanks.
