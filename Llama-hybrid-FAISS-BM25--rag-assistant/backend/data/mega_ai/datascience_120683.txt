logistic regression graph - understanding data

I am trying to understand why my data is not showing a full S-curve? Is it because the predictor does not do a good job of predicting fellow = 1, or simply because there are few fellow = 1 that score within the top end on c_ns2 (x-axis variable)? [![enter image description here][2]][2] /// when attempting to extend x-xis to range from 2.5--7: ##### 2 ##### ggplot(graph_df, aes(c_ns2, fellow)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'glm', method.args = list(family = "binomial"), se = FALSE, size = 2, colour = "lightblue") + theme_classic() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, colour = "grey50", linetype = 2, size = 1) + xlim(c(2.5, 7))
