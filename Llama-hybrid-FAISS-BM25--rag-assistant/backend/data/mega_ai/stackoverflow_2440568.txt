Install .NET 4.0 dll to the GAC

I have a visual C# 2010 express install. Built a .NET 4.0 dll that is signed. Now I need to get it into the GAC. Im on 64bit vista. Anyone know if there is a gacutil supporting the 4.0 framework yet? Any other suggestions on getting it into the GAC? I have tried drag and drop into C:\Windows\assembly, whenever I do, it appears to copy; however, it is not copied and does not produce any error message. I cannot create a setup/deployment project as it appears the express editions of visual studios do not have the ability.
