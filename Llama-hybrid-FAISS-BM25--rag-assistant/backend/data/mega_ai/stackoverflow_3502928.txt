Generate valid XML name in Java

Are there any helpers that will transform/escape a string to be a valid XML name ? Example, I have the string max(OfAll) and need to generate some XML like e.g. SomeText That's obviously not a valid name, are there some helper methods that can transform the string to be a valid xml name ? (For comparison, .NET have some methods that the above xml fragment would be: SomeText )
