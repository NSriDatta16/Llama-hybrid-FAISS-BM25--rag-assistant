If you are using container security and have access to the HttpServletRequest, you can perhaps leverage the use of the 'isUserInRole' method on the HttpServletRequest ( http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#isUserInRole%28java.lang.String%29 ) eg: boolean canEditEmail = request.isUserInRole("ROLE_EDIT_EMAIL");
