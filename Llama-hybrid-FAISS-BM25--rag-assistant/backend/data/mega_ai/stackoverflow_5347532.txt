I've been using Vestal Versions , a rails gem/plugin that uses the memento pattern to create a history table, and it saves a diff of attributes in after_save and after_destroy callbacks. It also records when it was changed and increments a version number so you can rollback to a certain version or a version present at a certain date or time. I can then pull up an object like so: @user = User.last @user.versions.last.changes #=> {:name => ['Robert','Bob']} I'm a pretty big fan.
