When using SQL Compact on Windows Mobile, do you store the sdf file on a storage card?

Having had some Sql Compact db corruption issues in the past and gone through the article on these , I got the idea that storing the database sdf file on a storage card significantly increases the risk of data loss due to db corruption. Do you store the sdf file on a storage card? Have you had any issues caused by it? What should I pay attention to when recommending a particular brand or model of an SD card wrt the stability and security for use with SQL Compact?
