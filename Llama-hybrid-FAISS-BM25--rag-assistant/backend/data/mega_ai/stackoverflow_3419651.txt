A huge portion of the decision in data structures will depend on the spatial organization of the data. For example, highly clustered data tends to have different performance charateristics in kd-trees than evenly distributed data. KD-Trees are very good for both of these queries. Octree can be a good option in many cases, as well, and is potentially easier to implement. There are many libraries out there that do this, using various algorithms. Searching for k-nearest neighbor searching will reveal many useful libraries. I've had pretty good luck with ANN in the past, for example.
