Of course, you could store all passwords as plain text in your storage (e.g. database). But it's not recommended. If someone manages to hack your server and gets your data from the database he also got every password. Even just storing a password hashed with common methods like md5 is not quite save in this case. Because there are rainbow-tables (search google for this), to lookup passwords. So I recommend to store salted passwords. I don't know why you ever would store your passwords as plain text. I wouldn't do it :)
