If you want to roll your own certificate authority (suppose for closed in-company infrastructure), you start by (surprise, surprise) creating a self-signed certificate, which will act as a root CA certificate. Then you generate the first child certificate - intermediate CA certificate. Now put the private key of the root certificate to the safe place - most likely you will not need it for years. Intermediate CA certificate is used to issue end-user (or other sub-CA) certificates. If you want your certificates to be recognized by standard browsers and other client software, you need to find a way to get your public root certificate to the list of trusted roots in the OS itself and in those browsers and clients, if they have their own certificate storages. This is a complicated procedure, different for each OS and each browser. It involves repeating audits, compliance to tough procedures etc. Again, if you create certificates for internal company use only, you can make software installer (or just write a custom script or application) that will add your certificate to the trusted root list on each user's computer. This can be done in code almost without problems, but the user will have to (a) run that script or program, and (b) confirm addition of the certificate. For some browsers or other client applications the procedure can be more complicated. The procedure of creating a CA is quite a complex topic. I suggest that you read some books on PKI before you proceed. Here are the great books I'd recommend: Rsa Security's Official Guide to Cryptography PKI: Implementing & Managing E-Security
