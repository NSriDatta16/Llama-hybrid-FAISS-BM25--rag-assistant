There are various criticisms, some of which, in my opinion, are more pertinent than others: Lack of power: When testing $\rho=1$ against $|\rho| Size distortion: as for most tests, the null distribution is only available asymptotically, and the finite-sample distribution is often argued to differ substantially from the asymptotic one, leading to actual rejection rates that differ substantially from the nominal level $\alpha$. General scepticism towards the usefulness of testing point null hypotheses, fairly common among Bayesian statisticians.
