Nintendo DS and Neural Networks

i was wondering if DS`s hardware is capable of running a game that utilizes a feedforward neural network using genetic algorithms. I know that this has to do with the implementation of the homebrew game as well as the nn and the ga, but i am curious... (i know nothing about how the DS`s ARMs are used, etc, etc, etc) Thanks in advance :-)
