Data storage advice needed: Best way to store location + time data?

I have a project in mind that will require the majority of queries to be keyed off of lat/long as well as date + time. Initially, I was thinking of a standard RDBMS where lat, long, and the datetime field are properly indexed. Then, I began thinking of a document based system where the document was essentially a timestamp and each document has lat/long with in it. Each document could have n objects associated with it. I'm looking for advice on what would be the best type of storage engine for this sort of thing is - which of the above idea would be better or if there is something else completely that is the ideal solution. Edit: Looking for an open source/free solution. Unfortunately price is an issue! Thanks
