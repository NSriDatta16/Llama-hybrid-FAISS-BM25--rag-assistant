What you are saying is that you want to calculate conditional probability that a person will seat a seat in a cafe given some set of other variables. This means that you are talking about conditional probability. The most common way of calculating such models is to use logistic regression for predicting binary (true/false) outcomes, or multinomial regression for predicting multiple categories (sit at seat #1 vs sit at seat #2, vs ...).
