Delete a header in PHP

To allow caching a PHP generated file, I want to make sure, that the 'Pragma: no-cache' header is not set. However, how do I delete a possibly already set header? That is, it could be possible, that somewhere in the code someone wrote header('Pragma: no-cache'); and now I want to make sure, the header is not sent. Is it sufficient to do this: header('Pragma:'); or is there something like delete_header() (which would, apparently, be undocumented or well-hidden)?
