If you do a good enough job modeling the important predictor variables, you probably will not need to worry as much about the time series aspects (You should probably still test for serial correlation and adjust for it if needed). Most of the times series style association you will see can easily be modeled by things like day of the week, holiday/vacation indicators, and time since the dvd release or some form of advertising or event that spurs rentals of a particular movie.
