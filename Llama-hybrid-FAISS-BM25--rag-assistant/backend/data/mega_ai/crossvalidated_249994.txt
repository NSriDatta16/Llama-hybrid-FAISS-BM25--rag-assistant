Seeing this question still lacks an answer, I'd like to reiterate, as @Tarantula commented, an accepted method to select assess the number of components retained is through the explained variance. You retain $K$ components given a criterion from the a priori whitening PCA and perform ICA on those components. I don't know of any accepted method to do this kind of assessment with the kurtosis, this question might be unanswerable in it's fully.
