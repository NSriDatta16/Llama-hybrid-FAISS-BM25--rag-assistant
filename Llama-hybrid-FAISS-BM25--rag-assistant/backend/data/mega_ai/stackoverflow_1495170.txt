HTTPCache4j implements a client-side cache that claims to implement the features expected of a HTTP 1.1 client cache. It might be worth checking out despite being a new project. Disk stores do not seem to be implemented using human readable files - they involve serialized copies of HTTP resources, but I might be wrong.
