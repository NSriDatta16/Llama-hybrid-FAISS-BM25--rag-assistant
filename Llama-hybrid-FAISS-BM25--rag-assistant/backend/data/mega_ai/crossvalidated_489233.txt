As a prior distribution on the probability $\theta$ of an item from this supplier being defective, you might use $\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(\alpha_0=1,\beta_0=19),$ with density function $$f(\theta) \propto \theta^{\alpha_0-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta_0-1},$$ where the symbol $\propto$ (read as "proportional to") indicates that we have omitted the norming constant of the density function. This distribution has $E(\theta) = \frac{\alpha_0}{\alpha_0+\beta_0} = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05$ and has $P(\theta and $P(0.0013 In R: pbeta(0.1, 1, 19) [1] 0.8649148 qbeta(c(.025,.975), 1, 19) [1] 0.001331629 0.176466912 As @ChristopHanck has said, there are many beta distributions that would give $E(\theta) = 0.05.$ For example, if you feel more sure about $\theta \approx 0.05,$ then you could choose $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ larger and in about the same ratio. In particular, the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(5,95)$ has $E(\theta) = 0.05,$ but $P(0.02,0.09)\approx 0.95.$ However, that may represent a stronger opinion about $\theta \approx 0.05$ than you really have, based on past experience with the supplier. Also, such a 'highly informative' prior distribution will have a very strong influence on the posterior distribution and the conclusions we may draw from it. qbeta(c(.05,.95), 5,95) [1] 0.02010876 0.09007356 Now suppose you take a random sample of $n = 10$ items from the lot at hand and observe $x = 1$ defective. The resulting binomial likelihood function is $$g(x|\theta) \propto \theta^x(1-\theta)^{n-x} = \theta(1-\theta)^9.$$ Then, according to Bayes' Theorem, the posterior distribution has density $$h(\theta|x) \propto f(\theta) \times g(x|\theta) \propto \theta^{\alpha_0-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta_0-1} \times \theta^x(1-\theta)^{n-x}\\ = \theta^{a_0+x-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta_0 +n-x -1} = \theta^{2-1}(1-\theta)^{28 - 1},$$ which we recognize as the 'kernel' (density without constant) of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(\alpha_n=2,\beta_n=28).$ In this case we have been able to find the the posterior distribution, without having to compute its norming constant, because the beta prior and binomial likelihood are 'conjugate' (mathematically compatible). This particular posterior distribution has posterior mean $E(\theta|x) = \frac{2}{30} = 0.0667$ and a 95% Bayesian posterior interval estimate of $\theta$ is $(0.0085,0.1776).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 2,28) [1] 0.008463962 0.177644295 Notes: (1) If we had used the stronger prior distribution mentioned above, then the posterior distribution would have been very little different from the prior distribution. (2) A frequentist Agresti-Coull 95% confidence interval for $\theta$ based only on one failure in a sample of ten is approximately $(0, 0.429).$
