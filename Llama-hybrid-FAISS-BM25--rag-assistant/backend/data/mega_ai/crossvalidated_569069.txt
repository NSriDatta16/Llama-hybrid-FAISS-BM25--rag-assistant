This is a made up example just for illustration of when you might expect such results. Consider a sample of 200 people, 100 F and 100 M, we are interested in modeling their height. F are on average 160 cm tall, M are on average 180 cm tall. We model the height with their weight, which in this case is similar between F and M, they both weigh 70 kg on average (unrealistic, but just to show why). If we run a model without including sex, so just height ~ weight then we get the following results df=data.frame( "height"=c(rnorm(100,160,3),rnorm(100,180,3)), "weight"=rnorm(200,70,10), "sex"=factor(c(rep("F",100),rep("M",100))) ) mod1=lm(height~weight,data=df) plot(mod1,which=2) hist(mod1$resid,breaks=20,main="") The reason being that a linear model will fit the mean regression line, which happens to be right in the middle of F and M, which is not really useful because we do not even have many people in that height range. This can also be seen from another plot. plot(mod1,which=1) We can fix this by including sex in the model, which will differentiate between these two groups of data. These two groups basically originate from two different distributions, and so we probably should include this into the model, so that it will be able to estimate additional parameters to account for this. Running another model with sex included we get mod2=lm(height~weight+sex,data=df) plot(mod2,which=2) hist(mod2$resid,breaks=20)
