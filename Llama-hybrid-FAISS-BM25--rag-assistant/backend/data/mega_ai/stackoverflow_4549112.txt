Can no longer add registration fields in Magento 1.4.2.0

I have used this tutorial before for adding registration fields to the Magento registration page . It has always worked, but since I have upgraded to Magento 1.4.2.0 it no longer does. The attributes I add no longer show up under the customers information tab in the backend like it did before and are not getting saved. The attributes install into the database fine though. I thought maybe the config.xml part had changed but I checked it against the core customer one and the attributes are sill shown the same way: 1 1 Something must have changed since the last 1.4.2 beta because it worked fine then. If someone has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated and I could finally get some sleep! Thanks in advance!
