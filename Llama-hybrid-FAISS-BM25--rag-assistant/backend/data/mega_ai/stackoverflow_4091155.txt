Using a library framework such as Qt is really the way you want to go. It makes things very simple and still allows you to write code in std c++ to keep most things very fast. If you EVER have intentions of porting the code to a different platform than windows (whether it be Mac, Linux or even Android ... yes its possible), qt is definately the way you're going to want to go. I can get an app up and running... smoothly in a few minutes using Qt but much longer and with more confusion using MFC. Dragging and dropping 'widgets' to form a gui is very easy and possible with Qt's built-in QtDesigner!!! Check it out!!! http://qt.nokia.com/downloads
