I'd be inclined to use a multiple regression model with $D$ as dependent/target variable and the rest as predictors (all $X_i$ and $Y_i$ ). Note that you can use qualitative/categorical variables or continuous variables in this approach. And by including all predictors together in one model instead of doing separate chi-squared tests, you can account for the covariance between the predictors, and also model any interactions between them that you may expect. Alternately, depending on how much data you have, I'd consider using a random forest (again $D$ as dependent/target variable and the rest as predictors). Random forests allow you to model complex interactions and nonlinear responses without specifying them a priori , which is why they may be of use. With this approach too you can include both categorical and continuous variables together. In either case, you can get estimates of how important each predictor is, as well as quantitative descriptions of how they relate to $D$ (although this is easier with multiple regression than with random forests).
