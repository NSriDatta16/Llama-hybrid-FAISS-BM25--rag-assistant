Yes, there are many techniques which produce probabilities of membership. One class of techniques is generative techniques. Instead of estimating membership given data, these estimate probability densities for each class, as well as a probability distribution on classes. For example, a Gaussian mixture model may assume that each class is a Gaussian distribution with some mean and covariance. From such a generative model, you can determine the membership probabilities in each class by a proportion $ p(i) = w_i d_i / \sum_j w_j d_j $ where $w_i$ represents the weight of class $i$ and $d_i$ represents the density of the modeled distribution for class $i$ at the input. Logistic regression and neural networks with a logistic or softmax output also estimate probabilities of membership.
