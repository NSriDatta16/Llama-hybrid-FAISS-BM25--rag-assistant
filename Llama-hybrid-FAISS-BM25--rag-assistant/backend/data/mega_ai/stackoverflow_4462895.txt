SDL was written in C , and the C language doesn't natively support namespaces. Boost is a C++-only library , and took full advantage of C++ namespaces. Boost is a mostly header-only library, so there aren't actual binaries to link most of the time. When there are binaries to link (like Boost.Thread), the headers may take advantage of compiler-specific directives that can command the linker to link to certain libraries (like VC++'s #pragma comment(lib, ...) ). This feature is called "auto link" in the context of Boost. Otherwise, libraries have to be specifically mentioned to the linker.
