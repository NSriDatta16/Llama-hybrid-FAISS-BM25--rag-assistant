How to model volatility spillovers between some financial time series?

I am doing research to study volatility spillover effects between several financial time series $\{x_{1,t}\}, \dots, \{x_{k,t}\}$ (in my case, $k=4$ ). What would be the best model to study the spillover effect of other series on $x_{1,t}$ ? I was thinking of using VAR-GARCH or BEKK-GARCH Model in R. Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.
