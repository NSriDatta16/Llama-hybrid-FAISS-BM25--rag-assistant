Safari extension that spoofs user-agent?

Is it possible to spoof the user agent using a Safari extension? I know that Safari itself is able to spoof using the Develop menu item, but it's too limited for me. As far as I know, Safari extensions use 'start' and 'end' scripts, but both are executed after the document has been loaded, so I can't use those scripts to change the user agent via JavaScript. I'm not too sure about this, only started looking into extensions today, so maybe someone has another idea?
