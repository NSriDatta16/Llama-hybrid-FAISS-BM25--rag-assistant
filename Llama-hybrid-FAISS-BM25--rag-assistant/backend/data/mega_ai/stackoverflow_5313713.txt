How would I go about designing this in a database

At this point I am confused and am just looking for people to bounce this off of and so you guys are it. I am working on a web based inventory program for our organization. At this point I want it to be as generic as possible so I am looking at a structure like this: So what I am looking at is there are item types or categories, each Item type has a set of properties and properties can be shared, each item has an item type which then gives the item properties that can be filled with values, these values then have to relate back to the properties. Does this make sense to anyone else? I am confused to no avail at this point so any thoughts or suggestions or even reading material that would put me in the right general direction would be appreciated.
