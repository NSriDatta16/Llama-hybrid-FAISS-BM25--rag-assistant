This really isn't unusual, SQL handles numbers much better than characters. A bigInt field uses 8 bytes, which fits neatly into a memory page. A char field takes 21 bytes which almost triples the amount of storage to put it in an index.. Another consideration, is either index clustered? The clustered index will perform much faster than a non-clustered index. There are a lot of additional factors to consider, beyond the simple, general statement that numbers will perform better and use less space in the index.
