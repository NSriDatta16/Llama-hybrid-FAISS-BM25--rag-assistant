If you have available a large set of samples from known compilers, I should think this would be an excellent application for machine learning. I believe so-called "supervised learning" is relevant here. Unfortunately I know next to nothing about the topicâ€”only that I have heard some impressive results presented at conferences. You might dig through the proceedings of the Working Conference on Reverse Engineering to see if anyone else is interested in this problem.
