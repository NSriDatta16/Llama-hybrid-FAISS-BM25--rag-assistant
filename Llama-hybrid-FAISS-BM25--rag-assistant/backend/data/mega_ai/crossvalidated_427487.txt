Many ML packages give you an option to specify sample weights out of the box. One of the answers to the CV question that you cited gives an example of how this can be done in R. In Python ecosystem, scikit-learn provides an analogical parameter ( sample_weight ) that you can pass to many different regression models (linear, trees, SVMs, see e.g. here ) while fitting. You can use an arbitrary function to calculate the weights for each sample (in this case, that could be an exponential function of time), and pass it as a Numpy array.
