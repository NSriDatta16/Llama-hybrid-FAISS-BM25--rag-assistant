It sounds like one of a couple possibilities to me: The library itself is setting the lib path via a #pragma comment(lib, ...) directive; search library headers to see if that's the case You have a project for the library included in your solution which your main project is dependent on, and the relative library path is being appended automatically by VC; check the command line property page for the main project to see if that's the case That's what I can think of which could cause the error; hope it helps.
