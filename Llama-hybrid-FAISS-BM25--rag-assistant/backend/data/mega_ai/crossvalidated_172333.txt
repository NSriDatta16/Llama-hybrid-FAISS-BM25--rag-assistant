How to analyse survey data to find customer satisfaction from weighted scores?

I have survey data from multiple customers, where the customers have scored on a scale each question from 1 to 10, to indicate how much they agree with a specific question - 10 being the heights score. I'm looking for the best machine learning approach to analyse customer satisfaction, so that I can identify the determining factor that made the customer satisfied with my service. Through data engineering I can put various categories on the customers, like how much time I have worked with them. Who was on the team for the customer. And many many more. Is this possible, and what would be the best way to go about it? Im totally new to machine learning, and have only played a little with pandas for python. Thank you in advance for you time and help, it is much appreciated.
