Reads performed under SNAPSHOT isolation level read any modified data from the version store. As such they are affected only by writes. Writes behave identically under all isolation levels. Therefore SNAPSHOT reads behave the same way no matter the isolation level of the concurent transactions. READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON makes READ COMMITTED act as SNAPSHOT. In effect, it is SNAPSHOT: the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT was provided as a quick way to port applications to SNAPSHOT w/o code changes. So everything said on the first paragraph applies.
