Performing a GLS cross-sectional regression using R

Is there a function in R that could perform GLS cross-sectional regression for multiple cases all at once? For example, when regressing stock returns over beta for 100 stocks over a 10-year time series for each case. However, the equation should solve all of the 100 regressions and give only one result, a "multiple regression".
