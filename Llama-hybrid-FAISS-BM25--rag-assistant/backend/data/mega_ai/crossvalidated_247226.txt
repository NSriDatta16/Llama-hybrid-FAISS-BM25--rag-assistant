If I understand you correctly, "traditional" means older methods that have the same purpose. And that would be Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression ( invented in 1805 ), which was created in the age before computer. For machine learning, I think basically it's about determination of parameter values, which means that we want to learn from data what not what the VARIABLES are, but their CONSTANT multipliers. And in 1805, an amazing mapping tool to locate and catch those constants, called least squares in $y$ , which can be computed by hands and later became very popular, before the invention of computer.
