Difference between cluster centers and means

The following is the output of the cluster centers I got from a cluster model (kmeans - 6 clusters) 3.371069, 3.920354, 3.629747, 3.700000, 3.988506, 3.740385 However, after segmenting the data into the 6 clusters and taking the average of the data for each of the 6 clusters, I get a different set of numbers than the above. 3.7, 3.6, 3.6, 3.8, 4.2, 3.3 My question is are cluster centers different than means? Why am I getting different values?
