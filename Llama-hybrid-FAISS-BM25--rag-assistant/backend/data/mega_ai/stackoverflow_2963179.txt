It looks like your source path is incorrect. If you set it to com.sem.schema then the com.sem.client won't be on the source path, and therefore your entry point com.sem.client.Sem10 won't be either. Try removing your source path definition, use the default (which is the client subpackage underneath where the Module XML File is stored - so com.sem.client).
