Linux IDE with proper support for STL debugging

I am looking for a Linux IDE with support for STL debugging. the problem is that with Eclipse CDT, if I inspect the vector after the push_back: int main() { vector v; v.push_back("blah"); return 0; } I get something hostile like { , std::allocator >, std::allocator , std::allocator > > >> = {_M_impl = { , std::allocator > >> = { , std::allocator > >> = { }, }, _M_start = 0x1fee040, _M_finish = 0x1fee048, _M_end_of_storage = 0x1fee048}}, } instead of something like vector["blah"] or something similar. is there an alternative IDE/Debugger for linux that provides better STL support?
