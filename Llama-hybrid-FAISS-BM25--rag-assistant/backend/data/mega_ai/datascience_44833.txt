I've run into this issue before and what I've done is I use this as an opportunity to offer a random product to the customer. Literally, make a random selection and have that be a recommendation to the customer. Why do this? Because the fact that you have a customer with a new/unique "profile" makes them a valuable datapoint to learn from. So keep showing them a randomized list of items and see what sticks. Mark these customer records as special in your database and then immediately feed them back into your algorithm for future recommendations. These datapoints as immensely valuable during your reinforcement learning cycles (you are doing reinforcement, aren't you?) and can help your algorithm become smarter over time.
