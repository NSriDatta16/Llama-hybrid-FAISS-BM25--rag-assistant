What is the outcome of a Cox regression in xgboost?

I am creating a model using xgboost . Regarding its parameters , its objective is survival:cox and its eval_metric is cox-nloglik . The output Y ranges from -800 to 800. However, the predicted values are way to large (in range from 10^3 to 10^13). Why is this? What is the outcome of a Cox regression in xgboost ?
