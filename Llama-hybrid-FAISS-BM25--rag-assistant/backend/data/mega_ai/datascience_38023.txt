Machine Learning: Take into account a variable if a condition is met (depending on another variable)

I am working on a set of student data to train some models. I have the gender variable and I can also retrieve data about how many other girls go to this student's class. I would like to take into account in the modelling that if it is a girl, whether there are other girls in her class or not. This variable shouldn't have any interference in the cases where the student is a boy. Any idea how I should treat this?
