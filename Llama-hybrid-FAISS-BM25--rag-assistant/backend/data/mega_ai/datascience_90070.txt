How to tell which class is which with SHAP values in a summary plot?

I ran a random forest classifier to predict pollen color based on various environmental variables. The possible predictions are purple or yellow. I want to run a summary plot in shapely to get an understanding on the importance of those variables. I run the following code: import shap explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(rfc) shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test) shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test) This correctly gives me the following graph: Cool. This gives me a bunch of valuable information. But I don't understand what class 0 and class 1 are. Which is supposed to correspond to purple and which is supposed to correspond to yellow? I know its an unremarkable question for only 2 possibilities, but I plan on doing a classification with 3 classes and I need to know how the classes are assigned.
