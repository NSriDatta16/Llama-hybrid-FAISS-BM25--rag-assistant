If you are able to use Perl, you can do it in one line like this: perl -0777 -pe 's/my first line\nmy second line\nmy third line\nthe fourth\n5th and last\n//g' paragraph_file the explanation is in perlrun : The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode. The value 0777 will cause Perl to slurp files whole because there is no legal byte with that value. Sample input: my first line my second line my third line the fourth 5th and last hey my first line my second line my third line the fourth 5th and last hello my first line Output: $ perl -0777 -pe 's/my first line\nmy second line\nmy third line \nthe fourth\n5th and last\n//g' paragraph_file hey hello my first line
