My approach would be to start adding tests piece by piece. If there is a section you know you're going to have to update in the near future, start getting some good coverage on that section. Then when you need to update/refactor, you have your regression tests. From the sounds of it, it will be a major undertaking to establish a comprehensive test suite, but it will most likely pay off in the end. I would also suggest using one of the various code coverage tools available to see how much your tests are actually covering. Cheers!
