As a data scientist, you don't develop new methods, you apply them. Most data scientist use scikit learn, xgboost, keras, tensorflow, pytorch... Algorithm development falls either in research or software development. If it's in research then you need to come up with new ideas about algorithms. If it's in software development, you implement use cases of research ideas. Sometimes you can mix them both. As a general rule, data scientists solve problems using pre-existing algorithms. They don't need to have experience in high-performing computing or software development. No need to write optimal algorithms.
