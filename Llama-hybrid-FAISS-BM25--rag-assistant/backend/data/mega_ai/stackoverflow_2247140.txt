How can I filter a pcap file by specific protocol using python?

I have some pcap files and I want to filter by protocol, i.e., if I want to filter by HTTP protocol, anything but HTTP packets will remain in the pcap file. There is a tool called openDPI , and it's perfect for what I need, but there is no wrapper for python language. Does anyone knows any python modules that can do what I need? Thanks Edit 1: HTTP filtering was just an example, there is a lot of protocols that I want to filter. Edit 2: I tried Scapy, but I don't figure how to filter correctly. The filter only accepts Berkeley Packet Filter expression, i.e., I can't apply a msn, or HTTP, or another specific filter from upper layer. Can anyone help me?
