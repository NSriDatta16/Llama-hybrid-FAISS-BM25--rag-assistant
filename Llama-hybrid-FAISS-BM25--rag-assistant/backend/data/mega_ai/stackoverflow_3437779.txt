How do I know I have leak in Java?

I'm running my application using the Netbeans profiler and the char type seem very active. I see the generations number reaching all the way up to 180 generations and dropping down to 80 and going back up it seems to average 160 generations. It's hard to tell because it is a custom TCP/IP server app that uses JDBC, Hibernate and connections pools. 1- If the generation numbers goes up and down, can assume that it's ok? Only if it keeps going up and up and never goes down then there a potential problem? 2- The Netbeans generation graph just keeps going up. At the end of my stress test it was at 20000 generations. Is the graph the total over time? I'm confused because when looking at live results, the generations, as mentioned above, go up and down for the char type. 3- By manually invoking the garbage collector from the profiler, the memory seems to drop back down. So I figure that's also ok?
