Using WPF Infragistics Excel export functionality with MVVM

I'm using the Infragistics WPF datagrid and I want to make use of the Excel export functionality that Infragistics provides. The API for the Excel export requires an instance of the grid as a parameter. This isn't very MVVM friendly since I'd prefer to handle the command to export the data in my viewModel which wouldn't know about the instance of the datagrid control in my view. Does anyone know of a more MVVM friendly mechanism to do excel exports (preferable based on the collection the grid is bound to) using the Infragistics libraries?
