How can I measure if there is a significant increase in the mean over iterations?

My apologies if this is a simple question. I'm trying to measure if the average fitness of some variable increases over iterations. Each iteration consists of 10 fitnesses (discrete values), and there are 10 iterations. I've plotted the average fitness against the iteration. How do I show whether the change in the average over time is statistically significant? The averages are all over the place; there's no clear trend by eyeballing the graphs. EDIT: The fitnesses within iterations are independent. A fitness is a number between 1 and 10 assigned to a variable, and is sort of like the variable's rank, except multiple variables may have the same fitness. In each iteration, the variables are given a fitness. These variables and their respective fitnesses are then used to make new variables for the next iteration. The process is repeated, and the experiment is to see if the fitnesses show an upward trend over iterations.
