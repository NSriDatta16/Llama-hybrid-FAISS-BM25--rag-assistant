Gramatically "Meta" comes from greek and means beyond something. "Meta-Feature" means beyond the feature. Normally refers to how the feature was obtained, the uncertainty, error measurements... For example, in atmospheric modeling, for the features "Temperature" you can have a lot of different meta features like, with which tool are you measuring the temperature? what is the error of the tool? in which conditions is the measurement happening? I understand the term meta feature as a generalization of this concept but in Data Science.
