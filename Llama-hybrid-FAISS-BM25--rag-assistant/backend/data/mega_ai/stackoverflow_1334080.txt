String result = String.Join(" ", list.Select(item => item.ToString()).ToArray()); If it's just a collection of type List (and not List ) there could only be 0's instead of NULLs. But to address the hypothetical or more general null problem one could add a Where(item => item != null) , use the conditional operator, or the null coalescing operator. But every "fix" added to the expression will make it less readable and elegant.
