WPF Drag & Drop in RightToLeft Direction

Is there a bug in WPF Drag and Drop when it runs in RTL mode? It seems it does not update the drop object area which it's FlowDirection set to RTL. I currently using WPF 3.5 + SP1 and facing this problem, Additionally, it seems this is inherited in WPF 4.0 and also does not work properly in VS2010. Who can providing a solution or workaroubnd ? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
