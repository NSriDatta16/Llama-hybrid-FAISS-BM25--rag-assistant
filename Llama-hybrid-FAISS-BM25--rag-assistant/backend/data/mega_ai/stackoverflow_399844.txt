Encapsulation is defined by the International Organisation for Standardization's International Standard: "Information technology â€“ Open Distributed Processing," ISO/IEC 10746, 1998. It's defined in terms of more primitive definitions: Entity: Any concrete or abstract thing of interest. Object: A model of an entity. An object is characterised by its behaviour and, dually, by its state. Behaviour (of an object): A collection of actions with a set of constraints on when they may occur. Interface: An abstraction of the behaviour of an object that consists of a subset of the interactions of that object together with a set of constraints on when they may occur. Encapsulation: the property that the information contained in an object is accessible only through interactions at the interfaces supported by the object. The ISO does not define different types of encapsulation. Other posts have mentioned information hiding. The ISO does not define encapsulation explicitly in terms of information hiding, though it does seem implicit, see "Encapsulation theory fundamentals," at http://www.edmundkirwan.com/pub/ Ed.
