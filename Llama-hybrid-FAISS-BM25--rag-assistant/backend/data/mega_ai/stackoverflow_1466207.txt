Safari stores the tables in "AppData\Local\Apple Computer\Safari\Databases". First Databases.db is an sqlite3 database with 2 tables. Origins tracks what site created the database and maximum storage for that database. Databases tracks the specific databases and their folder, common and file name I use sqlite3 command line tool or sometimes SQLite Administrator. Any sqlite3 app will do. Your database will be in a subfolder like http_exeample_com_0\00000000003.db
