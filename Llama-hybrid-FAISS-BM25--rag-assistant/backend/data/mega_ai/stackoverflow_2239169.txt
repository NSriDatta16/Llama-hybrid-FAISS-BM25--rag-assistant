Roman, if you want to do your layout in Java code (ViewGroup descendant), it is possible. The trick is that you have to implement both onMeasure and onLayout methods. The onMeasure gets called first and you need to "measure" the subview (effectively sizing it to the desired value) there. You need to size it again in the onLayout call. If you fail to do this sequence or fail to call setMeasuredDimension() at the end of your onMeasure code, you won't get results. Why is this designed in such complicated and fragile way is beyond me.
