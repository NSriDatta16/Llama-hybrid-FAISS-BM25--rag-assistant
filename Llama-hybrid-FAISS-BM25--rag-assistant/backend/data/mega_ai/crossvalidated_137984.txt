As @whuber pointed out, this is an example of the ecological fallacy. More specifically as to why this might be the case: it is likely because your county level data is more variable than your aggregated data. This make sense, since in general, the sample average of some set of random variables will be less variable than the random variables themselves. (Think about the central limit theorem.) For example, say you have three counties: one is poor and rural, one is rich and rural, one is neither poor nor rich, but urban. You average them together and you'll have something that looks (numerically) middle income and suburban. You've completely ignored the variability among the three counties (not to mention the variability among the people within those counties). Now is the part of the answer that strays from what you have directly asked. I really hope that you have given serious thought to issues of multicolinearity with those 45 independent variables. Reducing that set of independent variables may be a good modelling strategy. Think seriously also about what you want to model as fixed versus a random effect.
