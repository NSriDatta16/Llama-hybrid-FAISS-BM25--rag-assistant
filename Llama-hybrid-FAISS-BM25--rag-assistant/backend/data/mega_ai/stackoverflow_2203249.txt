All right. How about this. It checks whether $mo and $mc are valid dates using is_numeric . Any NULL or false values will be caught by that. I haven't tested it but it should work. I spread it into a huge block of code. In the beginning, when learning the language, this is the best way to make sense out of the code. It is not the most elegant, nor by far the shortest solution. Later, you can shorten it by removing whitespace, or by introducing or and stuff. I'm not 100% sure about the number comparison part, and I don't have the time to check it right now. You'll have to try out whether it works. You need to decide how you want to handle errors and insert the code to where my comments are. A simple echo might already do. // If $mo or $mc are false, show error. // Else, proceed to checking whether $mo is larger // than $mc. if ((!is_numeric($mo)) and (is_numeric($mc))) { // Error: $mo is either NULL, or false, or something else, but not a number. // While $mc IS a number. } elseif ((!is_numeric($mc)) and (is_numeric($mo))) { // Error: $mc is either NULL, or false, or something else, but not a number. // While $mo IS a number. } else { if (($mc
