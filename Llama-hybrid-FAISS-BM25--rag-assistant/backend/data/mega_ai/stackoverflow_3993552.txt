making Transparent, unclickable areas in a userControl/pictureBox

I have a userControl with a picturebox in it. I need the areas of the userControl to be transparent and unclickable on the main form. After some searching Ive come up with this. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa235175(VS.60).aspx but it doesn't seem to work. I have it set up so the usercontrol can be drag-and-dropped. but I dont want transparent areas to be dragable.
