Being able to decrypt the passwords is a bad idea (and there's probably not any way of doing it that would be much better than storing them unencrypted). It sounds like your main problem is being able to use the passwords if you change your storage method. Just do what Linux does, store how you're hashing the password with the password. So for example $1$salt$hash is MD5. That way, if you decide to change how passwords are stored, you can still check against the old passwords (and if someone logs in correctly, you can update their password with the new hash).
