Paper/Idea to get the most attractive chapter in a novel

I face a problem as below: There is a novel app and need to find the most attractive chapter in previous 30 chapters of each novel So that we can limit a user continue unless he make payment I didn't find such paper/idea through google . What I thought is : Set different payment point in different chapter, show to random user and record the CTR . Then we can use it to get payment distribution to set proper payment point . But we don't have many user now, and cost would be large . So I wonder is there any NLP way to detect most attractive chapter ?
