A really nice way to keep your results organized is to use rmarkdown. It interweaves human language and presentation with the r programming language. So at the end you have a presentable document that runs and presents the results of r code along the way. It a combination of markdown and r code so that you both have runnable code and a structure to present the results of your code. Markdown is simple syntax that allows you to build simple webpages (or other kinds of documents) from text. Markdown is to html like latex is to pdf. So rmarkdown just adds the functionality of displaying the results of r code as well in the flow of the document. I usually don't write the final paper in rmarkdown but it is nice starting place for how I want to present the experimental section or if I want to highlight certain results on my webpage.
