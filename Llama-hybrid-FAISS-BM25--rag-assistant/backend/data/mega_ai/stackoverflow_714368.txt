GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs and strong naming

I have a GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs file in the root of my solution, and I have something like the following entry in it to enable strong naming of my output assemblies. #pragma warning disable 1699 [assembly : AssemblyKeyFile("..\\keyfile.snk")] #pragma warning restore 1699 This approach has two drawbacks. Firstly, AssemblyKeyFileAttribute is deprecated, and so to avoid compilation warnings I need the pragma lines you see above. Secondly, I either need to keep all my projects at the same depth relative to the root to use the relative path, or use an absolute path, which dictates a checkout location on other users' machines (and on continuous integration servers/build agents). Does anyone have a better solution than this, other than going through each project setting strong naming in the project file?
