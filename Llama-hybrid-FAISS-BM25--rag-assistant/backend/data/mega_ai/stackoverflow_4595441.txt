you can encode only php files and you have to make sure that the licence file is in the same directory (if compilation is used then also in compilation directory) where compiled files are but be warned that this ruins the debugging of magento and you can't or your clients can't no longer use debuggers in their development cycle. Chances are small that somebody ever will want to purchase your encoded extension as it needs more server setup and knowledge from the user who's buying this and if the user has that knowledge he most likely will choose open-sourced alternatives
