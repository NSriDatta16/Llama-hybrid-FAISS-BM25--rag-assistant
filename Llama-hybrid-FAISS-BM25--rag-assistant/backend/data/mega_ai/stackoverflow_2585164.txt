Flex 4: Component move event

I have a CustomTextInput component based on TextInput (Spark) component. The instance of this class is placed on a popup window ( TitleWindow ). How can I capture the popup move (dragging the title) event inside CustomTextInput implementation? MoveEvent.MOVE event of the CustomTextInput itself doesn't work. Of course, I can't access the parent popup window inside the component implementation, because it's a common component that can be used not only on the popup windows.
