From your comment about creating a classification model, it seems like you need a supervised learning method like generalized partial least squares (this will be most conceptually similar to PCA, but will provide a model that can predict the response, in this case incident TRUE/FALSE). Another option is generalized lasso or elastic net. For PLS, lasso, or elastic net, you can look at standardized coefficients to judge which predictors have a positive or negative contribution to incidents, and which effects are stronger or weaker. You won't get a measure of standard error unfortunately, so you will have to make some judgements about how to interpret and present the results. PCA is useful for identifying relationships and redundancy between your predictor variables, but it is unsupervised, meaning it doesn't consider the response at all.
