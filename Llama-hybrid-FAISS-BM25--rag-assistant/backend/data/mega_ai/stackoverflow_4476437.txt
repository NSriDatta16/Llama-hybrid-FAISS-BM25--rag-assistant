Need a few more details for this.. But are you sure you are using touchesBegan , touchesMoved and touchesEnded from the appropriate view (ie not the view you want to move)? Also make sure the userInteractionEnabled = YES . Try logging the touches from touchesBegan to make sure you are receiving the touches. Or you might want to just check out Apples MoveMe sample code at https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/MoveMe/Introduction/Intro.html where they have solved all those problems for you.
