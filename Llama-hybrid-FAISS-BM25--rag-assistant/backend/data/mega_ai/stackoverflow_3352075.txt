Judging from the "iPhone" and "Android" tags, I guess, you are trying to access the local storage databases on these platforms. They don't use MySQL, but SQLite. How you access them from the mobile browsers is described in the W3C draft documents for the local storage: http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/ for the local storage API or http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-sql.html#sql for the SQL API. It should be roughly the same API on iOS and Android since both of them use the Webkit browser engine.
