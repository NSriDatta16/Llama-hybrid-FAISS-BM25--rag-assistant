word2vec for propernouns

I have trained my word2vec model on a movie dataset with star cast, director name and other similar features/columns in the training data set. The text is not free flowing (it is comma separated). As a result, the SIMILARITY function and SCORE functions donâ€™t produce satisfactory results as embedding generated are not up to the mark Is word2vec the right approach for such a problem with more large number of proper nouns and no free flowing text? If yes, which parameters to tune for training with proper nouns?
