It is perfectly possible to grow a "probability forest". The methodology in Malley et al. (2012) " Probability machines: consistent probability estimation using nonparametric learning machines. " that outlines how this is done and how it compares to standard random forest implementation. In addition, the excellent R package ranger implements this functionality already; just set probability = TRUE when making the function call to ranger .
