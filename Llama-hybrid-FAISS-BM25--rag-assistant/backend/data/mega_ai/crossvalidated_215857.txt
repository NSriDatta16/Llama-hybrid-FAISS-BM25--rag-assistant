What class of function can be modeled via Convolution Neural Networks?

For which phenomenon Convolution Neural Networks work, and for which doesn't and where is a border? If it means some type of convergence then in which sense - pointwise, uniform, in L2 norm. CNN as I understand mean "closure" os such things: Input variables Compoistion OR system cascading OR functional graph, use term which you prefer "Convolution node", which is in fact do discrete convolution with some small kernel (3x3) and do some extra bias. Max pooling operation – take a maximum value of blocks 2x2 "ReLU" block. I don't know why it was called so, but it evaluates value of “ramp” function
