Is continuous integration worth it for small projects?

I've been pushing for continuous integration at my company since I joined 5 months ago, but having seen the type of applications we work on I'm starting to think that it might not be worth the effort of setting up each and every project for continuous integration. If you work in a development department where the average project takes 2-3 weeks and once it's deployed you seldom if ever have to worry about it, is continuous integration worth the hassle of setting it up?
