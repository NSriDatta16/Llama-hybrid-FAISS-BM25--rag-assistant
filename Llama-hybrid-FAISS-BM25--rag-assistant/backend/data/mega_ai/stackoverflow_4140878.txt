If you open safari on your mac, there should be a menu item called "Develop". Under there is an item called user agent in which you can switch your desktop browser to behave like the iPhone mobile safari browser. It'll be easier to troubleshoot and conduct your iPhone compatibility tests there. Depending on what you have installed, some options include: Mobile Safari 4.0.2 - iPhone Mobile Safari 4.0.2 - iPod Touch Mobile Safari 3.2.2 - iPad etc...
