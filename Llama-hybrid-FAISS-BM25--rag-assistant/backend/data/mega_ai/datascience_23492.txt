Data Augmentation for Regression

I want to use deep learning for regression. However, the number of training samples is not large. In image processing, some new samples are generated on the basis of initial data through tasks like rotation to increase the number of data sets. Can I know if there is any algorithm to generate more data based on current samples (data augmentation for regression)?
