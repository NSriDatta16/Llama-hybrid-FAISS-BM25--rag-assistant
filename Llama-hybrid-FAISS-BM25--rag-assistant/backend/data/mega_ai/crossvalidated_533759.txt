Approximate distribution of a complicated function of a random variable

If $X$ is a random variable cdf $F(x)$ such that $F$ is invertible then we have the standard method of finding the pdf of any function of $X$ , say, $\sin(X) $ or $ X^3+1 $ .However,in many situations we have very complicated composite functions of random variables(with known distributions ,however).To take an example ,let $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ be iid random variables following uniform distributions in the interval (0,1).Consider the following random varibales $$ Y=\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}X_i$$ $$ Z= \frac{1}{2}\left\{ 1+X_{n-1}+ \sqrt{\left(1-X_{n-1}\right)^2+4Y} \right\}$$ To the best of my knowledge, it is almost impossible to analytically find the distribution of the $Z$ . However, it is straight-forward to numerically simulate $Z$ .I want to know if there are some methods of finding the approximate distributions of random variables defined like $Z$ . Any references/links/hints/suggestions will be greatly appreciated. I believe the problem is of immense significance in the theory of probability and machine learning and other applied disciplines, but I honestly do not know much about it.
