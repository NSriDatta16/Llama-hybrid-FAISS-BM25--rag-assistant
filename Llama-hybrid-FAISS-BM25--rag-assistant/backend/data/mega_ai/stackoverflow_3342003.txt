Jersey (JSR311-Implementation) & Redirections

Is there a way to redirect the user-agent in a Jersey Resource? In Spring MVC there's the "redirect:"-syntax but I didn't find anything comparable in Jersey's Viewable class. The only method I found working was using HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect() .
