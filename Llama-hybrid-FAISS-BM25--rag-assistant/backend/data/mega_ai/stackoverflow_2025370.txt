In my coding I follow the following rules with regards to JS organisation: Any JS that is not time sensitive and/or runs after the document is loaded gets put into an external js file and included in the head Any JS that needs to run as soon as possible is placed in the DOM where appropriate (eg. if you want some code to run as soon as the necessary elements are loaded place the code directly below the last dependent element) Any external tracking libraries like Nielsen/Google go right at the bottom just before the closing body tag
