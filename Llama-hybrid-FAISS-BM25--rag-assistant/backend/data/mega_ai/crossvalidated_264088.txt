Visualising neural networks like in TensorFlow playground

Is there a tool to visualise neural networks similar to how TensorFlow playground does it? It is a custom tool for beginners, but I was wondering if there's a similar tool. It shows you what effect each neuron has on the model, the weights of each neuron, and you can see the information passing through in a feed-forward neural network.
