Fast Average Square Difference Function

I'm wondering if anyone knows of a fast (i.e. O(N log(N)) ) method of calculating the average square difference function (ASDF) or average magnitude difference function (AMDF) for a periodic signal, or it is even possible. I know that one can use the FFT to calculate the periodic cross correlation. For example, in Matlab code, for i=1:N xc(i)=sum(x1*circshift(x2,i-1)); end is equivalent to the much faster xc=ifft(fft(x1).*conj(fft(x2)); Is there a similar "fast" algorithm for for i=1:N ASDF(i)=sum((x1-circshift(x2,i-1)).^2)/N; end or for i=1:N AMDF(i)=sum(abs(x1-circshift(x2,i-1)))/N; end ?
