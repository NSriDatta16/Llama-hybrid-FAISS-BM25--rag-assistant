How to get the p-value for a binary logistic regression model, not the individual predictors?

I ran a stepwise binary logistic regression model using glm in R. emoteModel % stepAIC(trace = FALSE) It gave me p-value for individual predictors (all of which are numeric in the range [0-100]), as follows: However, I need the p-value of the entire model as well to check significance of the model. Is there any way to obtain it? I tried anova, but it gives me the p-values of individual predictors only. Please help! Would it be appropriate to use the chi square test as follows? If so, then p Update: I created the nullmodel using nullmodel % stepAIC(trace = FALSE) , and then ran anova(emoteModel, nullmodel) . it did not give me the p-value as shown below:
