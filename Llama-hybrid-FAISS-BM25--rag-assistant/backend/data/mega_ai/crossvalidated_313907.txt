There is a lot of literature on nowcasting in general, and GDP in particular. For instance, check GDPNow page on FRB Atlanta's web site, where the model description is given too. Below is their 2017 Q4 GPD forecast. As you know the GDP number release will be some time in 2018, i.e. a few months down the road from the time I'm posting my ansqwer. Nowcasting is used to estimate the low frequency data based on high frequency predictors. For instance, CPI and Unemployment are released monthly, the interest rates are available either real time or at least daily. You could use these as predictors to estimate GDP between its quarterly releases. Nowcasting is different from ordinary time series forecasting in that it has no issue with predicting the predictors. For instance, if you were to predict GDP one year ahead, you'd need values of its predictors one year ahead.
