Scala insert into list at specific locations

This is the problem that I did solve, however being a total imperative Scala noob, I feel I found something totally not elegant. Any ideas of improvement appreciated. val l1 = 4 :: 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: Nil // original list val insert = List(88,99) // list I want to insert on certain places // method that finds all indexes of a particular element in a particular list def indexesOf(element:Any, inList:List[Any]) = { var indexes = List[Int]() for(i I was thinking more elegant solution would be achievable with something like this, but that's just pure speculation. var final:List[Any] = (0 /: indexes) {(final, i) => final ::: ins ::: l1.slice(i, indexes(i))
