Your average mobile device still has a very small screen resolution. A quick google found a number of sites listing this sort of thing, or pointing to lists, the best one I saw was: Cell phone screen resolution by Brand and Model or for a better idea of average: Cell phone screen resolution, sorted by size As for building the mobile version, I'd start with System.Web.Mobile , and work my way on from there - taking in System.Web.Ui.MobileControls , and also their walkthroughs . And can I say "thank you for thinking of us"? As a user of the "mobile" internet, it's always a pain to come across a heavily javascript enabled site (I'm looking at you SO) that doesn't work on my phone (Windows Mobile 6.1, with Opera Mobile 8.5 installed) because of limited (or percived limitations) in the JS support. Just had another thought - with everyone talking about DRY - looking into an MVC framework would be a really good thing to do - then your controllers can all be the same, and just return a modified view based on the browser caps - Scott Hanselmann included a bit about this in his MIX talk , all good stuff. I knew I had more here. Scott also had a podcast ( ASP.Net and the mobile web ) on this, and the Mobile Device Browser Files are on codeplex
