Embedding script with timeout in case server goes down

I am looking for a way to make sure an external script file won't block the viewed page, if the server which serves it is "down" (for example port 80 is blocked for some reason). Currently when I test by taking down the server (Apache) manually, or block that file via server's firewall, I see the browser is trying to load the resource (script in that case), without success for long period of time, until it aborts. Is there a way to get past this issue?
