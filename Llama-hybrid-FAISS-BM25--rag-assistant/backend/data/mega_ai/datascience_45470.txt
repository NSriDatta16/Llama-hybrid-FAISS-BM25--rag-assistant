How to deal with count data in random forest

I am working on a classification model where my target class is a biased class with the class shape as 0 1 20694 101 Most of my features are the count of number of times a certain event was triggered. While exploring these features I found that my target variable is only associated with certain values of features. For example as below 0 1 Feature V1 0 12014 75 1 6490 16 2 1177 6 3 402 2 4 176 2 5 100 6 84 7 61 8 39 9 23 10 26 11 14 As we can see that 1 only occurs when V1 has value of 0 to 4.Thus for any unseen data my model would always predict 0 whenever V1 has value greater than 4. I thought of using bestNormalize package, however the transformations it is suggesting looses correlation when applied to the data. Any suggestion would be of great help. Thanks a lot in advance!! P.S. Happy to share the data if required.
