In IB, start with a View - add all the controls you like to this, and also drag in a table to whatever size you like. Then in the view controller for the view, add an IBOutlet property to hold the UITableView you have drug in, and link it in IB to the View Controller file's owner. Now, you can also make your view controller conform to the UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource protocols, and add the table delegate methods in there (easiest way is to make a new UITableViewController subclass from the template and then drag the methods into your view controller). Don't forget to link the UITableView delegate and datasource references in IB back to the File's Owner.
