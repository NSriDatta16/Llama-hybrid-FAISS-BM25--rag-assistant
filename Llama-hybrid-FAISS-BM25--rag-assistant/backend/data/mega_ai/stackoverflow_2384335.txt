It depends on your team . Personally though, my team likes them, clean, concise and they're not that confusing. I'd argue that padding: 0 0 5px 0; is more confusing than your font example because you need to know it's top, right, bottom, left...with most shorthand you can read no matter the order and still easily see what's happening. I'd wager even the average Word user could see your font example and make out what's happening, and that says a lot for clarity.
