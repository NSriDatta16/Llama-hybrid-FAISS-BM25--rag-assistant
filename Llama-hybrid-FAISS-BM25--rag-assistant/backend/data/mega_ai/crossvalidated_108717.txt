There is no kernel that outperforms all other for all problems, even when the class of problems is reduced to a particular domain. Linear SVM are a popular choice for text classification, because many text classification problems are linearly separable , and because they scale well to large amount of data . Still, you may try the three of them (linear, polygonal and radial basis function) and see which one performs better. The additional advantage of linear SVM is that there is only one parameter to tune (the regularization term). For polygonal and RBF you need to perform grid search (search over combinations of values for the regularization term and the rest of parameters, like the degree of the polynomial, for example).
