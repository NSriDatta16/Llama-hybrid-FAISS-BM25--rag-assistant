See my update as I have solved the problem. I apologize for not being more specific in my original post. The variable returnedData is actually in the success callback (sorry about not specifying.) For clarity, I am using the following with the jQ submit() function (in the click handler for this form submission): var ajaxOptions = { type: 'POST', url: url, dataType: "json", beforeSubmit: checkInput, success: evaluateResponse } e.preventDefault(); $(this).ajaxSubmit(contactOptions); Where the success callback is: function evaluateContactResponse(returnData) { //and so on } (Side-note: I was using the jQ form plugin until these failures occurred but moved to a different implementation since the form plugin failed silently. I may now move this back since the form plugin is so elegant.) The callback "evaluateResponse" is where the parsing takes place, and as I said, now works. Thanks again... you are a smart guy N
