I put your HTML on jsfiddle (you can test it there) and added this JavaScript, using a selector that matches all and elements: $(document).ready(function(event){ $(document).delegate("input, textarea", "keyup", function(event){ if(event.which === 188) { var cleanedValue = $(this).val().replace(",","~"); $(this).val(cleanedValue); } }); }); All commas in the value string are replaced by a tilde if a comma (code 188) was entered. Remember that JavaScript validation is nothing you want to rely on. The commas can easily be send to the server or never get replaced, e.g. in a user agent with JavaScript disabled.
