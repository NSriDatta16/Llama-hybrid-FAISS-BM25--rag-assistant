The other answers here have very good points, but there's one thing I'm missing. A good coder rarely identifies himself as a 'Java developer', a 'Python developer' or any ' developer'. Learning another language (be it a JVM language or not) will make you understand there's a lot more in the world to learn. If you're satisfied with only one language, it usually means you're oblivious to the problems it has, and that there are many tasks that are better suited for other languages. This is why the Pragmatic Programmers encourage every programmer to learn a language a year.
