In term of machine learning/data mining, we called these kind of problems as the classification problem . The easiest approach is to use past data for future prediction, i.e. statistical oriented: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification , in which you can start by using the Naive Bayes classifier (commonly used in spam detection) I would suggest you to read this book (Although written for Python): Programming Collective Intelligence ( http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325 ), they have a good example.
