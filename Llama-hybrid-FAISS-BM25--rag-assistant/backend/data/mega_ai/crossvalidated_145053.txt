Little mess with heteroscedasticity in linear model in R

I have a linear regression model: model Hypothesis about absence of heteroscedasticity is rejected as Breusch-Pagan test gives small p-value: bptest(model)$p.value #BP #1.014577e-06 But when I use robust estimations for parameters of the model: library("sandwich") coeftest(model, vcov. = vcovHC(model)) ... for all parameters the value Pr(>|t|) is reducing. So the coefficients seem to become more significant although robust estimators usualy do vice versa. Would you explain the matter of why this happens? Or robust estimators don't reduce statistical significance of parameters for some special cases? Would you mention these cases? Thank you.
