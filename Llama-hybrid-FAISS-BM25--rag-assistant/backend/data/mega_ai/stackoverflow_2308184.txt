With (!(distinguishedName=*,CN=Users= DC=mydomain,DC=com)), you are trying to use an attribute with DN syntax [Object(DS-DN)], for these LDAP attributes, you cannot use wildcards in LDAP filters. Attribute "distinguishedName": http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675516%28VS.85%29.aspx LDAP Syntax "Object(DS-DN)" http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684431%28VS.85%29.aspx In the second link, you will find the statement about the forbidden wildcard. In general, you could use an LDAP extensible matching rule for excluding some containers from a subtree search, in your case the syntax would be similar to this (!(cn:dn:=Users)) or something like that. The bad thing: AD doesn't support these kind of extensible match either: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223241%28PROT.10%29.aspx Read the first paragraph. So the conclusion is: YOU CANNOT DO THIS WITH ONE SINGLE FILTER IN AN ACTIVE DIRECTORY ENVIRONMENT. Sorry. The only solution appears to be to use a client-side tool. The script here from Microsoft will show you how to exactly what you need (except you want Users, not Computers). http://blogs.technet.com/heyscriptingguy/archive/2004/12/07/how-can-i-return-a-list-of-all-my-computers-except-those-in-a-specified-ou.aspx The other thing you could look at is a virtual directory to act as a proxy to AD, which would allow you to configure filters and permissions without touching AD.
