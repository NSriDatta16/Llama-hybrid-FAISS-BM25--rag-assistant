Most often it depends on the size of your project, but generally I tend to separate the front-end stuff from the backend s.t. it gets reusable. So to that direction your organization is already fine. If you want to go a step further, I'd take a look at layered application architectures. This post here may give you some insight into that and you may find some reusable elements. Personally I don't really like the DB to reside in the "app_data" folder of the UI project (i.e. the ASP.net Web Application project). But for small apps it's fine :)
