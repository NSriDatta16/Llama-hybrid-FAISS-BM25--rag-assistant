Let's take a look at a bootstrap based approach, and compare the results to the CLT based confidence interval. First, I'll define a population distribution which is trimodal, skewed, and heavy tailed (compared to Normal). rmydist The "true" variance, based on this really huge sample from the population, is $\sigma^2 \approx 8.612$ (this matches the exact variance, which can be computed using the Law of Total Variance ). Now we can compute 95% confidence intervals using (i) the bootstrap, (ii) the accelerated bootstrap (iii) accelerated bootstrap on the log-sd scale (see @whuber's comment) and (iv) chi-square approximation for $n=200$ . # Generate data set.seed(12345) n The confidence interval for these four cases comes out to be Method Lower bound Upper bound Bootstrap $6.52$ $9.52$ Accelerated bootstrap $6.74$ $9.76$ Accelerated boot (log-sd) $6.74$ $9.80$ CLT $6.68$ $9.91$ Note that all 3 methods capture the "true value" of $8.612$ here. But one dataset isn't very interesting, so lets perform a simulation study. Simulation study We can repeat the R analysis conducted above one thousand times for each of the four methods. We are interested in (i) empirical coverage (the number of times each method captures the true value) and (ii) the width of the confidence interval. Edit: Thanks to @COOLSerdash, who extended this simulation study to include the methods discussed by Bonett (2016) and O'Neill (2014) (see also @Ben's answer). I have added these methods to the table below for ease of comparison. Method Empirical coverage Interval width (average) Percentile Bootstrap 91.3% 4.22 Accelerated bootstrap 93.0% 4.57 Accelerated boot. (log-sd) 93.0% 4.58 CLT 86.8% 3.44 Bonett (2006) 93.5% 4.64 O'Neill (2014) 91.9% 4.39 It is interesting to note that all of these methods undercover compared to nominal (95%), but the CLT based method is especially over-confident, yielding precise intervals which fail to capture the true value more often that it should.
