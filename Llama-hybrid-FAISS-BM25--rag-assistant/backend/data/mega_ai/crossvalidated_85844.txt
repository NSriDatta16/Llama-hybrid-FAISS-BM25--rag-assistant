Logistic Regression not quite working

I'm playing around with logistic regression (using scikit-learn, which uses liblinear) I created some example data sets, and it often works well. Since I created the data sets, I already know the optimal bounds, and a 100% correct linear classifier is possible. Fairly often (~1 in 10) the predicted bound is off (see figure). It seems obvious to me that moving the bound a fraction higher would be better. What might have gone wrong? Are there parameters I should try changing, or better algorithms to use?
