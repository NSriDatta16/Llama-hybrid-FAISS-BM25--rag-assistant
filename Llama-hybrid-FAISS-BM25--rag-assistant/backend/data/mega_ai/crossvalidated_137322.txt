Deriving the probability function from a logistic regression model

First off, I don't know a lot of stats. That said, I am hoping you can help me derive the function to calculate the fitted probability from the summary of a logistic regression below: My instinct is that the formula would be... $$ P= 1/(1+e^{-z}) $$ Where $z= B_0 + x_1B_1 + x_2B_2 + ... + X_pB_p$ where $B_1 = ln(OR)$ However, the results I am getting from this formula do not seem to be correct. Here's why I think it is wrong or that I am making a mistake: When I model the formula as written in my question above, I am getting an inverse correlation between age and diabetes risk, which is counter intuitive. When I compare the results between the continuous model (Table 4) and the model with discreet variables (Table 3), the results are pretty different. The only variable that seems to matter in the continuous model is fasting blood glucose. I know this is a strong indicator for diabetes, but what's the point of having the other variables if they barely affect the probability. For example, from my model, I get the following results: Example Gender: Male Age: 34 BP: 145/95 BMI: 38.5 Waist Circ: 42 HDL-C: 45 Triglycerides: 100 Fasting glucose: 85 Diabetes History: N I get the following results: (p) = 2.6% in discreet model (table 3) (p) = 23.5% in continuous model (table 4) If I hold all the variables constant and only change the age from 34 to 45, I get the following results: In discreet model, (p) remains the same at 2.6%. This makes sense given that age is categorical. In continuous model, (p) = 18.5% I am surprised that the probability is declining as we increase the age. Based on intuition and knowledge of the progression of diabetes, I would expect the opposite. Am I doing something wrong? The full study I am referencing is: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=486842#ioi70028t4 If anyone could help me derive the probability of diabetes from this study using the continuous variable model, I would be very grateful! Thank you in advance for your help.
