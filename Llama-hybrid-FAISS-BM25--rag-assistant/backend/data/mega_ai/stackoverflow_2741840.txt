Dev-C++ Run Program in Background without GUI

I recently began learning C++ in order to reach people w/o .net. I need to run my program in the background(without any visual indication to the user so no window or cmd). I know there a various methods to do this In C#, but I don't know how to do this in C++ (specifically Dev-C++). Any help is greatly appreciated.
