There is no definitive standard rule for variable names. There are C# compiler requirements for what's allowed and what's not (e.g. can't start with a number), but programming language style rules are generally left up to the programmers / organizations. ReSharper has pre-defined style rules; however, they are merely set up as defaults in a convention over configuration approach and are modifiable. You can take a look at this Wikipedia article to see the history behind Camel Casing .
