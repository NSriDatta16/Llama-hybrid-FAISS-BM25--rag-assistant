Is a neural network consisting of a single softmax classification layer only a linear classifier?

Since the softmax function is a generalization of the logistic function it is continuous and non-linear. So the output of the softmax layer is: softmax( weight_matrix * input_activation) weight_matrix * input_activation is purely linear combination of features. The question is: if the application of the softmax activation still yields in a linear classifier or is the model then capable of representing non-linear functions?
