The simplest and most elegant solution imho would be, like Lizard pointed out, to floor the value and always say "over". You could even make exception for the first-1000 problem and floor anything below that to the next 100 or so, something like... If you absolutely don't want that you could always do a four or five layer if-sandwich, it would be the easiest approach towards the idea you described but maybe not the prettiest. Something like this, if I understood where you were going with it... Hope that helps.
