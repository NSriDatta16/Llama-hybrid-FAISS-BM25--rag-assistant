Anomaly detection using exponential weighted moving average?

I would like to detect anomaly using exponential weighted moving average. I don't have series of data points. All I have is EMA (t-1) and the data point of the current time(t) DP (t) . From these data, I can calculate the new EMA (t) . The EWMA constant will be 0.85 (assuming). Now I have two EMAs={EMA (t-1) ,EMA (t) } and DP (t) . Is it possible to determine whether DP t is anomaly or not? using any logic? For Example: Time(t) DataPoint(t) EMA(t-1) EMA(t) 1 120 0 102 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 300 150 277.5 I don't want to take series of data points into calculation. At any time instance say 10, I want to know whether the data point 300 (in this case) is an anomaly or not. I also have the EMA (9)=150 and EMA(10)=277.5 for calculation (if needed) Is there any logic to calculate this? Update: I thought of the below logic but not sure whether it would work for sure ABS(DP-EMA(new))> 3 *SD {EMA(old),EMA(new)} (or) ABS(DP-EMA(new))> 3 *EMWSD {EMA(old),EMA(new)} DP - Data Point EMA - Exponential Weighted Moving Average [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ctwu.png
