I think that sales forecasting is too big of a topic. Without being specific, you will not get a lot of useful help here. Having said that I'd suggest starting with autoregressive time series models, such as AR(P) or ARIMA(P,1,Q). Sales are usually persistent, i.e. next month sales are similar to this month. They are also often highly seasonal, so you may need to add seasonality to your model. In time series it's often done through multiplicative seasonal time series. If the forecast is short, less than a year, and the firm is not in explosive growth mode, then ARMA(p,q) maybe enough. Sales may depend on external variables, such as commodity prices or marketing spending, you can add them in ARMAX or ARIMAX framework. Be careful with potential endogeneity issues with variables like marketing spend though.
