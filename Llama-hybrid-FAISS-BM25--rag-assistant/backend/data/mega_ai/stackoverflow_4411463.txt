How to manage a Webservice timeout in System.Reactive

I am starting out with System.Reactive and loving the simplicity of it but I have come up against something which seems it must have an elegant solution but I am not creating anything like an elegant solution!! The scenario is that I want to go off to a 3rd party web service to get some information (in a separate thread) and at the same time search locally. Then merge the results UNLESS the webservice times out and I will take only the information from the local results. Therefore I want to introduce a timeout to the Observable section in here: using System; using System.Linq; using System.Threading; namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine("Starting"); var o = Observable.Start(DoSeparateThreadCall); DoCallInThisThread(); o.First(); Console.WriteLine("the End"); Console.ReadLine(); } private static void DoSeparateThreadCall() { Console.WriteLine("Started in separate thread call"); Thread.Sleep(3000); Console.WriteLine("Ended in separate thread call"); } static void DoCallInThisThread() { Console.WriteLine("Started in this thread call"); Thread.Sleep(2000); Console.WriteLine("Ended in this thread call"); } } } Anyone done anything similar? It seems like it must be a reasonably common thing to do, i.e. if the 3rd party call times out do X?
