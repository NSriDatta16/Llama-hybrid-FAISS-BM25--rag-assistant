You can "control" clients a little easier than managers since the only power they really have is to not give the work to you (that solves your incorrect estimates problem pretty quickly). But you just need to point out that it's not the analyst doing the work, it's you . And nobody is better at judging your times than you are. It's a fact of life that people paying for the work (including managers) will focus on the lower figure. Many times I've submitted proper estimates with lower (e.g., $10.000) and upper bounds (e.g., $11,000) and had emails back saying that the clients were quite happy that I'd quoted $10,000 for the work. Then, for some reason, they take umbrage when I bill them $10,500. You have to make it clear up front that estimates are, well, estimates , not guarantees. Otherwise they wouldn't be paying time-and-materials but fixed-price (and the fixed price would be considerably higher to cover the fact that the risk is now yours, not theirs). In addition, you should include all assumptions and risks in any quotes you give. This will both cover you and demonstrate that your estimate is to be taken more seriously than some back-of-an-envelope calculation.
