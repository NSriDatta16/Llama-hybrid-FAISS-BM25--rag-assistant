You can use a hierarchical classification approach to solve this problem. Hierarchical classification is a method of machine learning that classifies data points into a set of predefined categories that have a hierarchical structure. Here's how you do it: Train your level 1 model with N classes. This model will be used to predict the high-level category of a new data point. Train separate models for each of the N classes at level 1. Each of these models will be used to predict the sub-category of a new data point, given that it belongs to the corresponding high-level category. When predicting the class of a new data point, first use the level 1 model to predict the high-level category. Then, use the corresponding level 2 model to predict the sub-category. This approach has several advantages: It allows you to train each model separately, using only the data relevant to that model. This can make the training process more efficient and can also help to balance the training data for each model. It allows you to make predictions at different levels of granularity, depending on your needs. For example, you might only need to predict the high-level category for some data points, but need to predict the sub-category for others. It can potentially improve the accuracy of your predictions, by allowing each model to specialize in a specific part of the classification problem. You can use any type of model for each level, depending on your needs and the nature of your data. Logistic regression could work well, but you might also consider other types of models, such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
