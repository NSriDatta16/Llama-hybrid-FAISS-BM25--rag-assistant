JavaServer Faces 2.x is a major step ahead as compared to JSF 1.x, significantly expanding the standard set of components and component libraries. Facelets (which was designed specifically for JavaServer Faces) was adopted as the official view technology for JSF 2.x. This eliminates the life-cycle conflicts that existed with JSP, forcing workarounds by Java developers. Lot of things which are hardly possible in JSF 1.x can be done more elegantly in JSF 2.x.
