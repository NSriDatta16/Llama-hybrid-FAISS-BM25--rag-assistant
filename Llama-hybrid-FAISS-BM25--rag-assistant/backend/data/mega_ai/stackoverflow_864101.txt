I'm not sure what you mean exactly by "Each line should line up properly with each other." If you mean, each label should be correctly above it's input element, that's relatively easy but does require nesting divs: First Name If you think that's too many layers of divs you've clearly never looked at the source of a blogging engine. :) You can then arrange your field divs any way you wish. If however you mean that divs on different lines should line up then that gets a lot harder unless you fix the widths of the divs. Sometimes that's practical, sometimes it isn't. This is just one thing that tables are better at than "pure" CSS. At the risk of self-promotion here is my perspective on tables vs pure CSS . I take a pragmatic view: if what you're doing is easy to do in pure CSS, do it that way but due to limitations in CSS and differences in browsers there are some effects that you just won't be able to do (or do well) without using tables.
