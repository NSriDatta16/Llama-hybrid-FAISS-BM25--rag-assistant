The data you provided is not enough to fit an arima model since the smaple size may less then number of variables, so let's consider the time series dataset from package tseries in R: # install this package if you need:install.packages('tseries') library(tseries) data(ice.river) To make it easy, p is how many periods a time series' partial correlation will last, we can figure it out quickly by its partial correlation coefficient chart: pacf(prec) It seems it will truncate in the first period, because after that the coefficient value is almost in the range of blue line. So p is 1. And q, is just how many periods a time series' correlation will last. So check the correlation coefficient chart: acf(prec) For the same reason, the q will be considered as 4. As for i, it means the order of the difference in data. Some data may contain time trends and seasonality, we may need to differentiate it first. Now fit a arima model and predict it: model = arima(prec,order=c(1,0,4)) predict(model, 10) We have the next 10 mounths' prediction: $pred Time Series: Start = c(1975, 2) End = c(1975, 11) Frequency = 365 [1] 3.868989 2.656401 2.863538 2.813462 2.502984 2.526123 2.524399 2.524527 [9] 2.524518 2.524518
