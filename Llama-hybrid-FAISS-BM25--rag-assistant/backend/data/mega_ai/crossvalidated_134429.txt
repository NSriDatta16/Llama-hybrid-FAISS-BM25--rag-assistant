Learn the bayes net structure with latent variables while testing (but observed while training)

I want to use Bayesian network for data which has 5 types of variables which are inter-dependent on each other. Out of that, 1 variable is observed only while training but it is unavailable during testing stage. I must say that, the hidden variable at test time (henceforth referred to as H ) has a considerable impact on the output. My question is that can I use any scheme which will work in above scenario. I have read about Bayesian network structure learning algorithms such as MCMC and greedy search. Most of them require fully observed data (which I have during training!). I thought of modelling H as a hidden variable but I am not sure if that's a good / correct idea. Just for additional information: I have an idea about the initial configuration of the structure since I am solving a real-world problem.
