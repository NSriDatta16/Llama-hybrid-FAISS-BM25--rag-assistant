Faster version of lme4 for logistic regression 3-level multilevel model in R with 2 million data points

I'm running a 3-level multilevel model in R with binary outcomes and survival analysis with over 2 million data points. The lme4 package takes 12 hours to run one model or just crashes. The simplest model is: library(lme4) library(lmerTest) model0 I tried adding an optimizer: model0 Which also works very slowly. Can anyone suggest an alternative package?
