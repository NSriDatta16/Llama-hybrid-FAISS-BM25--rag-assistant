Calling the appropriate setStatusBarHidden per iOS version

Today my app approved, but I got emails from users says it crash. I figured out that [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES withAnimation: UIStatusBarAnimationSlide]; Is the problem, Because users have firmware 3.1.x this API is not working and app crash. So I have replace it with if ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] floatValue]>=3.2) [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES withAnimation: UIStatusBarAnimationSlide]; else [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES animated:YES]; My questions... Is what I did the best solution? Why XCODE did not warn me that SetStatusBarHidden withAnimation is not in 3.0 while I set my Traget OS firmware 3.0? Do I have to check on every API to see if it is working with my Target OS? Thank you
