With my multiple tries to get the V1.1 to work I must have broken something in Xcode 4, so I ended up re-creating the whole project and just putting all my code back in (which allowed me to re-organsie it and put it into a new repo as well). Now using the 1.0.5 version of Three20 (and just wrote a TTNavigationController myself which does the simple job I am looking for now) it all seems to work again on both the iPhone as in the simulator.
