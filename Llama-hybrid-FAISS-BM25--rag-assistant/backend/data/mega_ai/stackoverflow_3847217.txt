mail-merge HTML from a database into MS Word

project: Using VB.NET to build a winforms database interface and work-automation app. I am using this editor for the users to enter their text in the database interface environment that will both load/save/show them what they are working on in the form and also mail-merge into a Word document waiting for the content. I can do the first step and it works well, but how do I get MS Word to recognize HTML as formatting instead of just merging in tags and text all as text? The tool has two relevant properties: one to get just the text (no markup, i.e. no HTML) and one to get the full markup with HTML. Both of these are in text format (which I use for easy storage in the Database). ideas/directions I can think of: 1) use the clipboard. I can copy/paste the content straight from the editor window to Word and it works great! But loading from a database is significantly different, even when using the clipboard programatically. (maybe I don't understand how to use the clipboard tools) 2) maybe there is a library or class/function in Word that can understand the HTML as "mergable" content? thanks! :-Dan
