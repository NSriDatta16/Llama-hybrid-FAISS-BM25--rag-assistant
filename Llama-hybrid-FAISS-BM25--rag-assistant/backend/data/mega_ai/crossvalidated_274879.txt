How to calculate the mean and CI for a percentage

I have some data that is percent reduction, i.e., -%, from a study and I want to be able to summarize the average percent reduction from my n = 20 samples, and to also provide a confidence interval. I thought one way to do this would be to use the usual way people proceed, i.e., $$(\bar p-z_{\alpha/2}\times\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\,\bar p+z_{\alpha/2}\times\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$$ where $\bar p$ is the average of the percent reductions and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the percent reduction. However, I am hesitant to calculate the confidence interval this way because doesn't this only work when the data is normally distributed? I know that my data isn't because it is restricted to the values $[-100,0]$ and so not the whole real line. Is there an alternative way to calculate the interval for the average? Or is the above way fine?
