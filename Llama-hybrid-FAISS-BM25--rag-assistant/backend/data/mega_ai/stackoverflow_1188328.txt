What is the point of instance storage on EC2?

I'm building some AMIs from one of the basic ones on EC2. One of the instance types is running Tomcat and contains a lot of Lucene indexes; another instance will be running MySQL and have correspondingly large data requirements with it. I'm trying to define the best way to include those in the AMIs that I'm authoring. If I mount /mnt/lucene and /mnt/mysql , those don't get included in the AMI generated. So it seems to me like the preferred way to deal with those is to have an EBS for each one, take snapshots and spin up instances which have their own EBS based on the most recent snapshots. Is that the best way to proceed? What is the point of instance storage? It seems like it will only work as a temporary storage area - what am I missing? Presumably there is a reason Amazon offer up to 800GB of storage on standard large instances...
