How to access the first property of a Javascript object?

Is there an elegant way to access the first property of an object... where you don't know the name of your properties without using a loop like for .. in or jQuery's $.each For example, I need to access foo1 object without knowing the name of foo1: var example = { foo1: { /* stuff1 */}, foo2: { /* stuff2 */}, foo3: { /* stuff3 */} };
