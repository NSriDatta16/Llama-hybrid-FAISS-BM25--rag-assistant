grep -v "//" file | grep WORD This will also exclude any lines with "//" after WORD, such as: WORD // This line here A better approach with GNU Grep would be: grep -v '^[[:space:]]*//' file | grep 'WORD' ...which would first filter out any lines beginning with zero-or-more spaces and a comment string. Trying to put these two conditions into a single regular expression is probably not more elegant.
