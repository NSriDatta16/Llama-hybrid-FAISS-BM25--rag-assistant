How do I translate logistic regression output into logged OR (and SE) for meta-analysis?

I'm attempting to conduct a meta-analysis using (logged) odds ratios, I'm using the Generic Inverse variance method (Review Manager) as some of my studies only report odds ratios and CIs (not raw data). One study reports the results of logistic regression (only), from my (limited) understanding, Î² is essentially the logged OR of the bi-variate association, but I'm slightly confused as the standard error reported seems very small (especially in a uneven sample with a rare event for the outcome) and so it appears to be disproportionately weighted in the final analysis. Does anyone know whether the SE in the regression output is the same as the SE I need for the meta-analysis? Or am I missing something vital?! Any help greatly appreciated :)
