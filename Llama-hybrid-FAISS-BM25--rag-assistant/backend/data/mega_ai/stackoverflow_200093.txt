UTF usage in C++ code

What is the difference between UTF and UCS. What are the best ways to represent not European character sets (using UTF) in C++ strings. I would like to know your recommendations for: Internal representation inside the code For string manipulation at run-time For using the string for display purposes. Best storage representation ( i.e. In file) Best on wire transport format (Transfer between application that may be on different architectures and have a different standard locale)
