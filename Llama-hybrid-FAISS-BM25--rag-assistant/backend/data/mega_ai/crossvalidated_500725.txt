The differences between bar charts and histograms are as follows: bart charts represent categorical data (e.g. hair colour, countries, etc.) or discrete data (e.g. number of siblings in a family). The height (for a vertical chart) or width (for a horizontal chart) of each bar represents the frequency/count/sum/average of values in the corresponding category. There is usually a space between adjacent bars. Because the data are categorical, there is no natural ordering of the bars. histograms represent continuous data (e.g. time, distance, etc.); you first have to bin the data (which requires to arbitrarily decide on a bin width - different widths will produce different histograms for the same data) and the height/width of each bar represents the count of values in the corresponding bin. Adjacent bars usually touch each other. As data are numerical, they are naturally ordered (usually from lowest to highest). It follows that for bar charts you need two types of data: the categories (e.g. countries) and the data points (e.g. population in each country) whereas the histograms only require the data points (e.g. racing times) which you bin, and then count. The difference between discrete and continuous data is not always clear-cut, and therefore which of these two charts should be used can be a matter of judgement. Imagine for instance that you would like to represent the distribution of children from the age of 1 to 4 in a given country: you can draw a bar chart where each bar represents an age (1, 2, 3 and 4) and the height of the bar represents the count of children of each age. Now imagine that you wish to create a chart for all ages, from 1 to 120. Then drawing one bar per year could become impractical and you may want to bin the years into age groups (e.g. 1 to 10, 11 to 20, etc.) and count the occurrences of people in each group; in this case you would use a histogram. To use your example, if each bar represents the number of chocolate bars eaten in a day (one bar for each of the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), you create a bar chart. If, on the other hand, you bin the data (e.g. you create a group for 1 to 2 chocolate bars, and another one for 3 to 5 chocolate bars), you then create a histogram. It only becomes grouped data if the bins represent more than a single integer in this case? Yes.
