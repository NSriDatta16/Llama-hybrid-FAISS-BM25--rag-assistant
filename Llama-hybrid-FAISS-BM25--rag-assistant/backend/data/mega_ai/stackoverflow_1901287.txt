Take a look at Oracle's paper on writing injection proof pl/sql . The DBMS_ASSERT built-in package should help you test your SQL for appropriateness. Even with those tests, I'd be extremely reluctant to give people an open text window for building their queries especially on the public net or in a large organization where you don't know everybody. There are very creative people just looking for opportunities like that.
