installing magento without control panel

I want to install Magento on a fresh install of CentOS 5.5 without any control panel to help. So, AFAIK, I just need to install LAMP, right? Apache: yum install httpd MySQL: yum install mysql mysql-server mysql-php PHP: yum install php (possibly other modules too that magento might need) Those are the only three things I need to install, right? However, PHP is outdated if I install from the base repo, so I need to install a newer PHP and perhaps newer MySQL. Is there anything I'm missing here? I'm not an expert on configuring MySQL from the command line, so should I install PHPMyAdmin? Thanks.
