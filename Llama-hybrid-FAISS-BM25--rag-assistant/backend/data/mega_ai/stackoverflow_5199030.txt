Which country are you in? With some adaption of the RBS WorldPay module you can use RBS FuturePay which is geared around repeat payments. I only had to use the module to take two 50-50 payments, however, the FuturePay technical support was brilliant and the Phoenix WorldPay module is not bad either (as starting points go). Getting it to integrate into Magento's Recurring Payments profile is not something I needed to get to work, however, you could put some other form for people to cancel an order.
