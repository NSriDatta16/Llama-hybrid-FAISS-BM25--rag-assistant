As others have pointed out, embedding WARs inside WARs is not an option. However, I may have a workaround for you. Most Web containers I'm familiar with have a "test deployment / auto deploy" mode / capability, where they will automatically deploy an application if the WAR is copied into the right directory. Your portal application could certainly allow uploading WARs, and it could store the uploaded bytes in a given directory under a given file name. Your Web container could do the rest. You could then link to the new application from your portal, or whatever. All this is relatively easy to do. However, be advised that this is a horrible idea if there is any security concern whatsoever. You are essentially allowing your users to execute arbitrary code on your server. Unless you completely trust all potential users to be both non-malicious and perfectly competent (think infinite loops), you are asking for a lot of trouble here.
