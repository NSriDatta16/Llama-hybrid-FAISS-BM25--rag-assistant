Difference between sequential and one-batch Bayesian update

I learnt that sequential Bayesian update and one batch (all at once)update will give the same result if the observations are i.i.d. I tried to test this theory using my model which contains 4 parameters (2 of them are highly correlated). Here is how I implement it: I divide 500 observations into 10 sets of 50data for sequential update Define the prior distributions of the parameters. (assume all follows N(ai, bi)) observe one set of 50 data, the conditional posterior samples of each parameter are obtained by Gibbs sampling obtain the mean and std from the posterior samples and fit into normal distribution as new priors for the next set of data repeat steps 2-4 10 times I found that the results between sequential and batch differ a lot. Can anyone please suggest to me what causes the difference?
