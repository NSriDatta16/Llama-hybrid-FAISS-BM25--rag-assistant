Regexp for Tokenizing English Text

What would be the best regular expression for tokenizing an English text? By an English token, I mean an atom consisting of maximum number of characters that can be meaningfully used for NLP purposes. An analogy is a "token" in any programming language (e.g. in C, '{', '[', 'hello', '&', etc. can be tokens). There is one restriction: Though English punctuation characters can be "meaningful", let's ignore them for the sake of simplicity when they do not appear in the middle of \w+. So, "Hello, world." yields 'hello' and 'world'; similarly, "You are good-looking." may yield either [you, are, good-looking] or [you, are, good, looking].
