significant difference between two ARIMA models on full- and cut-time series

I have a financial time-series, its length equal to $n=252$ points. I have built an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. I'm going to predict the future points of time-series. To determine the order of the ARIMA model the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was applied. In my case the model is ARIMA(2, 1, 0) . I would like to reduce the length of time-series n as much as possible and build an ARIMA model again. In this case I have a) the full (original) time-series, length $n$ and b) the reduced time-series, length $n-k$, here $k$ is the number of ommited points from the start of the time series. Question. What is a rule can I use to estimate the acceptable length, $n_{new}=n-k$? More generally: How to measure if there is a significant difference between the ARIMA($p_1, d_1, q_1$) model and a ARIMA($p_2, d_2, q_2$) model? Edit after Richard Hardy's comment. Now I want to shorten the series as much as possible in academic interest (?may be for bootstrapping on time-series). With practical application in future. I guess the difference between ARIMA models should be based on some stastical test while paraetrs $p_1=p_2, d_1=d_2, q_1=q_2$ are fixed.
