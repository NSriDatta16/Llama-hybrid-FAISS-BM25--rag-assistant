About the Randomized Dependence Coefficient

In the paper The Randomized Dependence Coefficient , authors introduce a novel dependence coefficient which seem to be quite generic and powerful compared to what is present in the literature. It is the only measure, to my knowledge, that is non-linear can work with vectors marginal invariant (leveraging use of the copula transform) Renyi's properties compliant values in $[0,1]$ quite fast and easy to implement. The paper is well written, motivations are explained, and justifications for convergence/consistency/approximations are given using theorems. Yet, I encounter difficulties using it (even when running the authors' code). The resulting dependence coefficient is not stable at all on my tests with respect to the two parameters it depends on $k$, the number of non-linear projections of the copula $s$, the variance for drawing i.i.d. projection coefficients in $\mathcal{N}(0,sI)$. For example, this quite "shocking" results: Input: X = rnorm(10001,mean=0,sd=1) Y = rnorm(10001,mean=0,sd=1) Authors' code: rdc Run 1: Pearson's product-moment correlation 95 percent confidence interval: -0.01728740 0.02191057 cor 0.00231247 k = 100 s = 0.2 rdc(X,Y,k,s) "RDC" 0.06432993 Run 2: Pearson's product-moment correlation 95 percent confidence interval: -0.02590941 0.01328721 cor -0.006313525 k = 100 s = 0.2 rdc(X,Y,k,s) "RDC" 0.9933134 So, is there a proper way to set the $k$, $s$ parameters to stabilize the results (without introducing a strong bias)? From the paper, it is not clear to me. Does anyone have experience with this coefficient and is willing to share?
