How do we generate the ROC curve for Linear Discriminant Analysis method

I know the method to generate the ROC curve for other methods such as naive Bayes where the tuning parameter is the threshold like also in logistic regression. If we want to generate the ROC curve for linear discriminant analysis method used in binary classification what is the tuning parameter here?
