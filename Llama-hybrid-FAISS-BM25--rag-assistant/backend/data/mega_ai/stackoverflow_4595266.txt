IonCube with magento Modules

Is anyone got to tried out the ionCube with magento modules before distributing it. Unfortunately i couldnot ended up well, so i am looking for someone who can solve this. I did these one by one. made simple module to say Hello world. So i have a set of folders into app in the namespace of Mymodule and module name called Helloworld , So the as you guess the respected files are goes into local , etc/modules frontend/design/default . And the file types are here .php,.phtml, .xml,.csv(locale file), its all working well without encoding it with ioncube in magento 1.4.2 Now i installed the latest trail version of ioncube in windows 7 and made a new project, added the Mymodule project into the project and followed everything well with the instructions. Ommited .xml,.csv files from encoding and only encoded the .php,.phtml files. Now when i place the newly encoded module into the mage root i got fatl error of missing class files because magento not able to load the encoded file. My hosting provider told that they have upgraded version of ionCube. I couldnot find out where am making mistake or what am missing here. I want to have a module which is encoded with the ioncube. Thats the goal. Did anybody tried this. And to be specific am getting these sort of errors when i change the encoding version from php 5.5 to 5 in ioncube encoder. Fatal error: * The encoded file test/app/code/local/Mymodule/Helloworld/Model/Observer.php has expired. in Unknown on line 0 * Thanks Ela
