I know I'm not providing an answer to this question but wanted to provide an alternative path that I am myself trying to solve this same problem and that I have not seen anybody else suggest here. In my case, I want to calculate several probabilities related my random walker not reaching two absorbing states: one above the starting point and one below it. I also would like to have an equation that would give me these probabilities based on the standard deviation and the positions of the absorbing states. I have a general idea of what the values of my standard deviation can be and the places where the absorbing states can be, so I'm setting limits (a lower and upper value for standard deviation and positions of absorbing states) and then running multiple simulations within those values (it takes a very long time to run). With the results from those simulations I'm training a neural network to map the input variables (position of absorbing states and standard deviation) to the probabilities of never touching the absorbing states. In my case, I have set fixed the number of steps into the future, so I basically have only 3 variables as input and the probability as output. Let's see how this turns out.
