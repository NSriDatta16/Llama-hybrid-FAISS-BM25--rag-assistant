According to HTTP protocol specification, the fragment part is ignored. However, browsers do support redirects with hash. If you generate hashes automatically, you may pass the id as the request parameter: http://127.0.0.1/somecontroller/someaction/id/12345/#12345 and then: $this->getRequest()->getParam('id') But this will hot handle the case with the hash only, e.g. when user enters the URL manually.
