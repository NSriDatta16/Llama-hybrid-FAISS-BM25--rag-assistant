How to store IPv6-compatible address in a relational database

How do I do that? Right now, IPv6 will not be used, but I need to design the application to make it IPv6-ready. It is necessary to store IP addresses and CIDR blocks (also BGP NLRI, but this is another story) in a MySQL database. I've alway used an INT for IPv4 + a TINYINT for masklen, but IPv6 is 128 bit. What approach will be best for that? 2xBIGINT ? CHAR(16) for binary storage? CHAR(39) for text storage? 8xSMALLINT in a dedicated table? What would you recommend?
