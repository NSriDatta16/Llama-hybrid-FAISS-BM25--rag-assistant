Yes. sessionStorage stores much more information than cookies can, and it is easier to access as well. By storing data you need to access again locally, you avoid (or minimize) ajax calls, and in turn server and database loads. This will result in faster page loads (as you will not need to wait for the server to provide the data), and bandwidth (as you have minimized communication with the server).
