Can univariate linear regression be used to identify useful variables for a subsequent multiple logistic regression?

Does the $R^2$ (or some other statistic) from a univariate linear regression tell me anything about how it would work in a logistic model? What if I normalized the data to mean zero? I'm doing multiple logistic regression, and I'm wondering if I created a ton of univariate linear regressions, if I can use the $R^2$ as an indicator of variables that are worth trying or not. Perhaps even adding a brute force search of interesting interactions or adding polynomials, etc.
