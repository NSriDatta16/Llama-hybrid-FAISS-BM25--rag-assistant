Qt - In QGraphicsScene how to put a picture dynamically

Hai, I am trying to create a chess board. Here I want to do a operation like when ever a coin is clicked and dragged, at that time that picture should be copied and be placed in that old position. I don't know in which function I have to do it. When I made it on mouse pressed, then tyhe copy is coming above the original(layer wise). So somebody please help me
