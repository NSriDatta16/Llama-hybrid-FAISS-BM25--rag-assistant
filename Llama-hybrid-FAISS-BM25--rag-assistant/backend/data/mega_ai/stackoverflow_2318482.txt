Methode Call twice inside LINQ Query

In our application we have a little query that looks like this: var selectedAgents = from agent in listAgents where (this.collectionVehicles.GetVehicleByAgent(agent)).IsActive || (this.collectionVehicles.GetVehicleByAgent(agent)).IsSoldSinceCurrentSession select agent; This works fine but the method GetVehicleByAgent is called two times and this is maybe not necessary. Before LINQ we had a foreach-loop and did like this: Vehicle parentVehicle = collectionVehicles.GetVehicleByAgent(agent); if (parentVehicle.IsActive || parentVehicle.IsSoldSinceCurrentSession) { selectedAgents.Add(agent); } As you can see GetVehicleByAgent returns a Vehicle object and that can easiely compared more than once. So I am looking for a way the retieve the Vehicle inside the LINQ query and keep it. I don't want to call GetVehicleByAgent twice.
