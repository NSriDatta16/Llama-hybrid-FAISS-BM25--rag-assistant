java/swing: Shape questions: serializing and combining

I have two questions about java.awt.Shape . Suppose I have two Shape s, shape1 and shape2 . How can I serialize them in some way so I can save the information to a file and later recreate it on another computer? ( Shape is not Serializable but it does have the getPathIterator() method which seems like you could get the information out but it would be kind of a drag + I'm not sure how to reconstruct a Shape object afterwards.) How can I combine them into a new Shape so that they form a joint boundary? (e.g. if shape1 is a large square and shape2 is a small circle inside the square, I want the combined shape to be a large square with a small circular hole)
