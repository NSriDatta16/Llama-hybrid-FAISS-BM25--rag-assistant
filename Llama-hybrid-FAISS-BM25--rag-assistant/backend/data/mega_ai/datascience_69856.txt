Bayesian machine learning is the general approach for modeling uncertainty in predictions. A trained Bayesian machine learning model will yield a distribution of predicted target values from that distribution a probability (aka, confidence) in those values can be calculated. Then that probability can thresholded for prediction or no prediction. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin P. Murphy covers a variety of Bayesian machine learning techniques.
