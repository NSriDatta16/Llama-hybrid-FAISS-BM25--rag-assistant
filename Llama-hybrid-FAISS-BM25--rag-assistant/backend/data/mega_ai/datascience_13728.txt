Generally for words which are not found in the vocabulary, a zero vector is assigned to them. Some other hacks which I could think of are : Try different morphologies of the word (ex. morphology of goes will give go and you can get vector of go to initialize goes). Try finding similar word from wordnet. If you are able to find embedding of similar word from wordnet, initialize original word's embedding with this word's embedding.
