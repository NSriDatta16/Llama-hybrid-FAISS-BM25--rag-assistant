Variable importance for PCA transformed dataset having highly correlated (or same) variables (dependent and independent)

My setup: 1. X is my dataset of [m*n] shape. 2. VARIABLES = list of n variables in X 3. X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X,100) # X_pca is PCA Transformed dataset with 100 PCs 4. FOR EACH VAR in VARIABLES: res = random_forest.fit(X_pca,VAR) # apply random forest having X_pca as independent and VAR as dependent I am aware that PCA is a way to deal with highly correlated variables (features), so there is no need to remove them. Now my question is if we calculate variable_importance from this setup, will it be consistent, Given, VAR variable was part of X while calculating transformed dataset of 100 PCs?
