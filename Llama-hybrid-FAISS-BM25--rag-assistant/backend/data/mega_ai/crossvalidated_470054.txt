When you say 'overlapping' you are focusing on the PCA 2D plot, which is not the original data, but a data projection on reduced feature space. If logistic regression can achieve 100% accuracy, it means the data is linear separable in original space (with 40 features). It also means the problem is an 'easy' classification problem. This is why most models performs well. The problem is you are using the wrong way to look at the data. Because we can only easily see data in 2D, you use PCA and check data in 2D and got the conclusion that data is overlapping. But the truth is data is very separable in original feature space.
