Consider the following code: int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } This code could fail to implement some necessary functionality (i.e. not meet an end-user requirements): "100% coverage" doesn't necessarily test/detect functionality which ought to be implemented but which isn't. This code could work for some but not all input data ranges (e.g. when a and b are both very large).
