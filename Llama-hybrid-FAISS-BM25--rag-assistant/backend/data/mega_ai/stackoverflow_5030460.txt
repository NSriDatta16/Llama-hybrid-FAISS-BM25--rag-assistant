How do I access a named Control within my ItemPanelTemplate from the code-behind?

I am trying to access a Canvas object within an ItemsPanelTemplate so I can add items directly to it in the code-behind. Here is my XAML: How can I access "MyMapCanvas" in the code-behind to add items to it? I have tried the following: Canvas canvas = (Canvas)MyMap.ItemsPanel.LoadContent(); and ContentPresenter cp = (ContentPresenter)(VisualTreeHelper.GetChild(MyMap, 0)); ItemsPanelTemplate ipt = MyMap.ItemsPanel; Canvas canvas = ipt.FindName("MyMapCanvas", cp) as Canvas; Thanks in advance.
