Simulating possibly correlated processes of different orders of integration

Given historical data on 6 macroeconomic time series, I am trying to build a model for the purposes of forecasting and simulating. A plot of the (standardised) series is below. A natural choice for such a model is a VAR. I fit a VAR in differences, and it produced reasonable forecasts/simulations for some time series and completely crazy ones for others. I decided to run auto_arima as a sanity check on the individual series and obtained the following "best" models for my 6 time series: ARIMA(2,2,3) ARIMA(0,2,1) ARIMA(2,1,3) + intercept ARIMA(0,1,0) + intercept ARIMA(0,1,0) + intercept ARIMA(1,2,4) It turns out I was too hasty in fitting a VAR in differences: my time series have different orders of integration, and some moreover include moving average components. Q. How would you proceed in this situation? My idea is as follows. Since VARMA models aren't straightforward to estimate , I stick with the individual ARIMA models, but n order to ensure that consistent simulations, I draw samples from a multivariate normal with covariance matrix equal to the covariance matrix of the residuals from the six ARIMA models. Q. Is this a reasonable strategy? How could I do better? Where could it go wrong?
