If you have many classes, then shared library. Make sure to use only abstract classes and no code in public headers (templates are OK). Provide factories (or plain functions) to instantiate the objects. If that sounds like too much coding for you then, well, modern version control makes it rather painless to simply re-use the files in several projects, living in the same repository. P.S. Another factor to consider is how many people work on the project. Shared library is an extra responsibility. If you have a person to take care of it, then it might be worth doing simply from organizational point of view.
