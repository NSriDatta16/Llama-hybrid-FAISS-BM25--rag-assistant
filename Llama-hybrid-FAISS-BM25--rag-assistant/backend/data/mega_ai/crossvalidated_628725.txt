Common way to forecast multivariate time series where components are restricted by an inequality?

Let's say we have a multivariate time series that we would like to forecast future values of: $Z_t = (X_t, Y_t)$ where $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are real-valued time series and constrained by the inequality $X_t for all $t$ . If we believe that our multivariate time series, $Z_t$ , can be modeled by a VAR/VECM process (potentially nonlinear), what is the common way to impose this constraint? Would we just want to do something in our model like attempting to forecast $X_t$ without constraint and attempting to forecast $Y_t - X_t$ with the constraint that it must be greater than $0$ so that way, when we do have constraints, they're static? Or is there a way to do this without constructing a different series to forecast?
