I don't think there's an API to do what you want. setAppCacheMaxSize limits the cache size for the HTML5 application cache API -- the offline storage that HTML 5 apps can use while running in your WebView -- but it sounds like you want to limit the cache used for loading pages. images, etc. As a workaround you could call WebView.clearCache periodically, although that really limits the effectiveness of the cache. If you want to try and keep some recent pages around, you could look into getting them from CacheManager before clearing the cache and then restoring them afterwards.
