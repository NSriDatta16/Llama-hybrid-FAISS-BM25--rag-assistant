Symbian panics when deleting dynamic array

I am trying to allocate a char array of size 1000. This array is passed to a function where it should be filled with the data that has been received from the TCP Socket. The problem occurs then when I try to delete[] buffer: Here I get as a result a User Panic 42. Unfortunately, I do not really see what is going wrong in this simple code fragement... int main { unsigned char *buffer = new unsigned char[1000]; Recv(&buffer); delete[] buffer; return (0); } void Recv(unsigned char **buffer) { TRequestStatus iStatus; TSockXfrLength len; TBuf8 buff; iSocket.RecvOneOrMore( buff, 0, iStatus, len ); User::WaitForRequest(iStatus); *buffer = ( unsigned char* )buff.Ptr(); } Thanks for any useful hints!
