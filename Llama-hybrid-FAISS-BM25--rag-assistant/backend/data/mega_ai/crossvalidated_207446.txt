Kernel Regression with Multiple Predictors

I know Kernel regression is a type of local regression, i.e., we consider nearby points/observations to predict the value at a particular point. In other words, we see which of the already existing predictors of other observations are near (distance wise) to the current predictor value, then take the mean value of there response values as the predicted value of current observation. This make sense, but I want to know - how kernel regression is done with multiple predictors. How are weights assigned? Do we find the average distance of various predictors of a particular observation from the predictors of current observation?
