How to identify decent C++ developers in an informal gathering

I am going to an annual Free software/Open Source convention. This event is very community oriented and the hallway meetings are very informal. Since the company I currently work for is looking for C++ developers (in a Linux environment), I printed on a T-shirt the words "We are recruiting C++ developers" in large letters. Hopefully someone will come up to me, introduce him/her self and tell me he/she is a C++ developer and is looking for a job. What should I ask to gauge their C++ knowledge? I need a question that can be answered standing in a crowded hallway and with a pastry in hand. An example might be: Why does a destructor need to be virtual? Or perhaps some more open question such as: What is your least favorite C++ feature? Clarification: This question will not replace an interview, it just suppose to give an idea if it will be worthwhile to invite a candidate to an interview. Moreover, we already have a very capable person working full time on trying to fill these positions. Since for my own selfish reasons I want to attend this conference (it is a fun event), I thought it might be an interesting experiment to try and tap this unusual concentration of geeks. If this experiment is going to work, I also wish to have not just a random list of name, but a list of names with some indication of suitability. I will report here, the results from this experiment, after the conference. Conclusion: The conference is over. Here is what I learned from this little experiment: It was fun. In general people got it. Most of the comments I got was that it is a nice idea. It was an easy way of sparking a hallway discussion with interesting people. C++ developers are not as introverted as one might suspect. My evidence is far from conclusive, but about half dozen C++ developers approached me. I shouldn't be worried about a particular question. A discussion with a potential candidate in this environment tend to naturally fall into a known pattern, of me describing what we are doing, and thus the natural question to ask the candidate is what he/she as done. It is hard to gauge the candidate qualifications in this environment. At the end I handed my calling card to every candidate that I met. Since not all of them are actually available right now, I suspect that it will be easy to sort the people that will actually follow up the lead I handed. Perhaps I could have be better organized, but I feel that the informal nature of the conversation, and the fact that I handed a calling card, but didn't wrote down their details, meshed well with the conference's ambiance. To conclude: If you are looking for a candidate, and you suspect you will come across your target audience in an informal event, I recommend spending $15 on printing a simple message on a T-shirt. If nothing else it will get you a laugh. Meta: This question was never intended to raise any controversy. It seems however, that recruiting is a contentious subject, every answer here was voted down at least once. Even this question was flagd to be closed by some people. If you feel I wasted your time I am truly sorry.
