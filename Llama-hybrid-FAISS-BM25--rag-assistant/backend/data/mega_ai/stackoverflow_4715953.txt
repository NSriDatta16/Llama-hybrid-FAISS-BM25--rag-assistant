How to force control to fire leave event in winforms using c#?

I am pasting text in textbox1.text and I need textbox1 should fire its leave event by itself. For now I am using this following code. but i will appreciate if anyone can suggest me an elegant or better way:- private void event() { textbox1.Text = SearchedText; textbox1.Focus(); textbox2.Focus(); } First I am pasting text, then setting up Focus on the control, then set up focus again on second control. It is firing leave event of textbox1, but any thing better?
