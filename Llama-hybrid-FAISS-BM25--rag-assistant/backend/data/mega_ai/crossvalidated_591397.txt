R: Logistic Regression Error - Algorithm did not converge + High P Values, how to fix?

I am building a logistic regression with Churn as the dependent variable. I cleaned my data and transformed the categorical data to factors. This is the description of the data after updating the categorical data: Data Summary click HERE I then attempted to fit the model to the data but received the error messages "algorithm did not converge" and "fitted probabilities 0 or 1 occurred." See below image: model summary click HERE I am a newbie to R so am open to feedback. Is there a command/function I can run (in R) to fix this? Are there categorical variables I should not have classified as factors? Please help! Thank you!
