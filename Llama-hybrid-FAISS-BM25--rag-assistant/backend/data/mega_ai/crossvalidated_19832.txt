With the lrm command using rcs() you are constructing a cubic spline which is then used in the logistic regression. However, no penalty is applied to the coefficients of the cubic spline, unlike in gam, where a penalty for "roughness" is applied and the appropriate magnitude of the penalty is estimated using generalized cross-validation. lrm and ols from the Design package do have options for penalized estimation, though. Also note that gam has options for other types of smooth functions than just cubic splines. Whether or not lrm with rcs is a "generalized additive model" depends, I suppose, on whether one thinks that not having a roughness penalty when fitting a spline takes you out of the spline-based gam framework or not.
