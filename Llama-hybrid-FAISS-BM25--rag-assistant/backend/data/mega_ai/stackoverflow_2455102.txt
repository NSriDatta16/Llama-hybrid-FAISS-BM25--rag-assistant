Writing a file to sdcard

I'm trying to write a file from an Http post reply to a file on the sdcard . Everything works fine until the byte array of data is retrieved. I've tried setting WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in the manifest and tried many different combinations of tutorials I found on the net. All I could find was using the openFileOutput("",MODE_WORLD_READABLE) method, of the activity but how my app writes file is by using a thread. Specifically, a thread is invoked from another thread when a file has to be written, so giving an activity object didn't work even though I tried it. The app has come a long way and I cannot change how the app is currently written. Please, someone help me? CODE : File file = new File(bgdmanip.savLocation); FileOutputStream filecon = null; filecon = new FileOutputStream(file); byte[] myByte; myByte = Base64Coder.decode(seReply); bos.write(myByte); filecon.write(myByte); myvals = x * 11024; bgdmanip.savLocation holds the whole files path. seReply is a string reply from HttpPost response. The second set of code is looped with reference to x . The file is created but remains 0 bytes.
