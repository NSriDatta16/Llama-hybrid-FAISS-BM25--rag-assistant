Embedding fonts retroactively which were not embedded in the original PDF does increase the file size, not decrease it. However, there may still be a chance to reduce the overall file size by reducing the resolution of embedded images... depends on your preferences and needs. You can try with variations of the following commandline. It will embed all fonts (even the "Base 14" ones), but embed required glyphs only (a "subset" of the original font), and also compress the fonts: gs \ -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 \ -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen \ -dCompressFonts=true \ -dSubsetFonts=true \ -dNOPAUSE \ -dBATCH \ -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \ -sOutputFile=output.pdf \ -c " > setdistillerparams" \ -f input.pdf
