Increased probability of event during period of time

In game of FIFA there are packs by opening which a user receives soccer player cards. The higher the rating of a player card the rarer it drops depending on some kind of random number generator. Since there is a marketplace for users to buy and sell cards it is logical to suppose that this RNG is somehow shared. Some user get absolute gem from a dozen packs and for some it can take a hundred or more. Based on my experience on average it may take opening dozens of packs to find a decent card. Also there are some special types of cards - in form - which are even more rare since they only drop during a period of a single week. The next week new different in form cards are released. Any given pack may contain both regular and in form cards. In form cards are released every week the same day at the same time. Suppose that this event creates an increase in amount of opened packs for a short period of lets say few hours. Does the chance of getting a rarer card (not necessarily special) change during said period?
