Normally when glyphs don't display properly in a UI, it's because you're using a font that doesn't have that glyph, not because there is a problem with the unicode support in any toolkit you're using. Very, VERY few fonts have all glyphs - you need to make sure you choose a font that has coverage in the code points you care about.
