Prediction using historic data

I am looking for advice/guidance/recommendations on possible methods that could be used to estimate future events based on previous recorded data. I have an engineering background but relatively new to stats so have started with a few bits I found online. I have the time taken to complete a task, occurring within the last three years, and would like to use this to inform the likely future time to complete the task with some confidence bands. So far: I have used a mixture of excel and R to analyse the data, calculate the IQR and remove any outliers from the analysis (+- 1.5*IQR) and then used fitdistrplus package to fit different distribution functions to the remaining data with fitdist . These include exponential, lognorm, normal, weibull, gamma and uniform; I then choose the distribution with minimum aic value as the optimum fit to that set of data. I then use the distribution parameters of the fit to produce a CDF curve and use a `rand' function in excel to choose a position on the curve and use the corresponding "hours" output. I would also like to include some kind of confidence interval but unsure how. I have tried the bootstrap method on the whole dataset to incorporate the outliers as well. I then chose 200 repeats and found the mean for each repeat and the average of those 200 averages as well as the stdev. I then calculate an upper and lower confidence interval with PERCENTILE.EXC(X3:X203,0.975) and use a norm.dist function in excel to produce the CDF plot and generate values as before. Any thoughts on the validity of these methods appreciated. A typical data set is inserted below. 5.5 12.5 6.25 5 13.5 10 9.25 11 3 6 4 3.5 9.25 8.75 9.75 5.5 8.75 5.75 6.25 1.75 9 4.25 6.25 3.5 8.25 17.75 11.25 4.25 9.75 10.5 7 3 4 5.75 6.5 9 6.75 8 4.75 1.75 4.5 8.25 3.5 7.75 10 6.25 6 7.75 11.5 7.5 9.75 4.25 8.75 9 6.75 7.25 4.75 7 3 0.5 5.5 5.5 3.5 3.25 5.5 5.5 5.5 11.5 7.5 4.5 8.25 8.5 8.5 6 7.25 9.25 2.75 5.25 8.75 1.5 6.5 9.5 3.75 5 3 8.5 5 5.5 7 6.5 4.75 6.75 4 7.25 2 14.5 9.5 8.25 5.5 8 10.25 10.25 7.25 11 6.75 7.75 5.25 4 1.75 8 10.5 9.25 8.75 5 5.25 10.25 10.25 3.75 9.75 4.5 6.25 12 7.5 6.5 9.75 4.25 5.75 9.75 7 3.75 4.5 8.25 4 12.5 1.5 40 39 19.5 53.25 44 19 228.75 21.5 40.5 63 20 18.25 24 20.25 19.5 22 52.25 22.5 20.5 39.25
