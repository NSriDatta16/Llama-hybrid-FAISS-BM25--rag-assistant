How to build an HTML5 game

I'm tasked with building an educational game for 6 - 10 year-old children using HTML5 for a non-profit organization. I've used HTML5/CSS3/jQuery to build a new site but have no experience building games. This project will have to be completed in about 2 months. A few questions for the experts here: Is this doable in 2 months? Do I need to be fulltime on this for the two months to complete it? Having never done a game, I'm not sure about what will be involved. Is there an HTML5/JS game engine out there that will make this easier? Any other thoughts you have on this will be appreciated. Thanks. UPDATE: We'd like to have this game work well on iPhone/iPad via Safari; in other words, to have it detect hand gestures.
