Making a piece of text non-breaking?

say I have a piece of text like this Hello I am some text Hello I am some text Hello I am some text Hello I am some text I do not wish to be broken on new lines Consider the above paragraph. I want for the bolded part to not be broken across a new line if possible. As in, I want it to break if it would require a scrollbar or something, but not break if it is possible to insert a page-break before or after that piece of text so that it can fit on one line. How is this possible? I have tried things like page-break-inside and such, but it doesn't seem to do anything in firefox.
