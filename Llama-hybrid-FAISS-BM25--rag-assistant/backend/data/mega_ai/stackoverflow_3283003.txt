Instead of trying to store anything on the desktop; do it on the user's storage directory. You can get the userDirectory using the userDirectory attribute of the File class. A second approach would be to store your file in the Application's directory with the applicationStorageDirectory attribute. Using either of these two approaches is what I would consider a best practice. Trying to store elsewhere is not something I'd recommend, as @eruciform stated there may be sandbox issues that prevent you from accessing those other directories.
