There's an extensive literature on this area in spatial ecology; but it comes down to what kind of assumptions you're willing to make. A very common method for estimating spatial distributions based on abundance data is a maximum entropy approach, take a look at the software and publications There's a variety of other algorithms designed for this purpose as well (using methods such as neural nets), mostly falling into the class of machine learning methods where you are simply testing how well a black box can reproduce the data (i.e. in cross-validation between a training set and test set) rather than estimating underlying models. Consequently it is difficult to say anything about the statistical appropriateness of the approaches outside of the datasets on which they have been tested.
