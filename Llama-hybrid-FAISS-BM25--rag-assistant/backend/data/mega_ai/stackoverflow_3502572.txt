I am long time user of commercial IncrediBuild. Happy with it so far. What I like most it its sandbox implementation - no need to install anything on agent machines, both source and tool-chain synchronization is handled transparently for you. When we started to use it few years ago, there were no other tools for C++ Windows development for distributed builds. I did not look for any such tool recently, therefore there might be some competition for it already. One important "competion" is ability of Visual Studio since 2008 to use multiple cores for builds - this is "free" as long as you already own Visual Studio.
