Can you insert a form onto a page using jQuery's $.load() function?

I have a page where there's a drag and drop table where the order of the rows determines the value of a subtotal. However, it's more complicated than just addition and I would rather not duplicate the logic in JavaScript to update the values. A simple solution would be to reload the whole page using Ajax and then replace the table from the page fetched via Ajax. Perhaps it's not the most elegant solution but I thought it'd be a quick way to get the job done that would be acceptable for now. You can do that with jQuery like this: $('#element-around-table').load(document.location.href + ' #table-id'); However, my "simple" solution turned out to not be so simple because the table also contains a tag which is not being displayed in Firefox (Safari works). When I inspect the page using Firebug, I see the form, but it and its elements grayed out. Searching on the web, I found a rather confused post by a guy who says FF3 and IE strip tags from innerHTML calls. I'm probably going to move on to do this some other way, but for my future reference, I'd like to know: is this the case?
