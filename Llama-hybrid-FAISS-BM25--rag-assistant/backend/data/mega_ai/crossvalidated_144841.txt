Compute component scores from principal$loadings directly in R

I am using a polychoric correlation matrix to run PCA, so I cannot obtain the scores directly from the function. I am currently manually plugging in the numbers from the principal$loadings matrix to calculate the factor scores, like this: RC1 RC2 Q1 0.323 0.808 Q2 -0.306 0.867 Q3 ...... ....... RC1 I think that there should be a better way to perform this calculation. Is there any way that will allow me to compute this easier?
