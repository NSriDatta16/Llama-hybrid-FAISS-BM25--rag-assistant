From the MVC team: Unfortunately, the code was actually exploiting a bug that was fixed, where the container of an expression for ModelMetadata purposes was inadvertently set to the declaring type instead of the containing type. This bug had to be fixed because of the needs of virtual properties and validation/model metadata. Having interface-based models is not something we encourage (nor, given the limitations imposed by the bug fix, can realistically support). Switching to abstract base classes would fix the issue.
