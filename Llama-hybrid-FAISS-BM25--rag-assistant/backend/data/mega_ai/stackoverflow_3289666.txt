Available Django apps listing?

I'm learning django and I love the ease of plugging in a 3rd party app (like django-registration). Is there a site listing available 3rd party Django apps? I know I can search google code, github or bitbucket, but is there a more organized, django-specific resource out there? Maybe with reviews or ratings?
