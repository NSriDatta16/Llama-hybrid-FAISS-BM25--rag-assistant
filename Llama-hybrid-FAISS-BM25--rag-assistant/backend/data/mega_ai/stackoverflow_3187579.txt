The answer depends on the nature of your project. If this is an in-house system with a single instance, it's reasonable to save yourself some development time and manually update the database with new tables as you update the software. In that case, you wouldn't worry about having your software add tables. If you supply this software to customers or even remote sites within your organization and the installation and upgrading happens "in the field" then it's reasonable that each new version of your software should upgrade the database by itself. You don't necessarily want to do this checking before each SQL command and not necessarily on each run of the software. You can store a "data structure version number" somewhere in the database and check that number on startup, only applying structural updates if the number is below the current release.
