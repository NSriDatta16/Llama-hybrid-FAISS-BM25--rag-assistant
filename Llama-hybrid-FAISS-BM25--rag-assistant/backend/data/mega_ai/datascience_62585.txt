Making Sense of this Error Message

I am using a book and a video to learn how to use KNN method to classify movies according to their genres.This is my code: import numpy as np import pandas as pd r_cols = ['user_id', 'movie_id', 'rating'] ratings = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/dell/Downloads/DataScience/DataScience-Python3/ml-100k/u.data', sep='\t', engine='python', names=r_cols, usecols=range(3)) # The file is u.data from MovieLens print(ratings.head()) movieProperties = ratings.groupby('movie_id').agg({'rating': [np.size, np.mean]}) print(movieProperties.head()) movieNumRatings = pd.DataFrame(movieProperties['rating']['size']) movieNormalizedNumRatings = movieNumRatings.apply(lambda x: (x - np.min(x)) / (np.max(x) - np.min(x))) print(movieNormalizedNumRatings.head()) movieDict = {} with open('C:/Users/dell/Downloads/DataScience/DataScience-Python3/ml-100k/u.item') as f: # The file is u.item from MovieLens temp = '' for line in f: fields = line.rstrip('\n').split('|') movieID = int(fields[0]) name = fields[1] genres = fields[5:25] genres = map(int, genres) movieDict[movieID] = (name, genres, movieNormalizedNumRatings.loc[movieID].get('size'), movieProperties.loc[movieID].rating.get('mean')) print(movieDict[1]) from scipy import spatial def ComputeDistance(a, b): genresA = a[1] genresB = b[1] genreDistance = spatial.distance.cosine(genresA, genresB) popularityA = a[2] popularityB = b[2] popularityDistance = abs(popularityA - popularityB) return genreDistance + popularityDistance # Everything seems fine up to this point. But the problem seems to be the next line of code. print(ComputeDistance(movieDict[2], movieDict[4])) Note : This code can be found here: https://hendra-herviawan.github.io/Movie-Recommendation-based-on-KNN-K-Nearest-Neighbors.html Note : This code can also be found on pg 245-250, chp7, Hands-On Data Science and Python Machine Learning by Frank Kane. I have an e-copy and I can send it on request. Note : I don't know how to share the csv files here. I will appreciate it if somebody can tell me how I can do that here.
