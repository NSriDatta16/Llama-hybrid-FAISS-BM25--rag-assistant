A few non-PIL-specific suggestions to consider: Scans of printed or written material will have lots of high-contrast sharp edges; something like a median filter (to reduce noise) followed by some kind of simple edge detection might do a good job of discriminating real content from blank pages. Testing fragments at a time is useful not only because it might increase your accuracy, but because it might help you to give up early on many pages. Presumably most of your scans are not blank, so you should begin with a simple-minded check that usually identifies non-blank pages as non-blank; only if it says the page might be blank do you need to look more closely. In case either the illumination or the page itself is nonuniform, you might want to begin by doing something like image = image-filter(image) where filter does a very broad smoothing of some kind. That will reduce the need to identify the dominant shades, as well as coping when the dominant shade isn't quite uniform across the page.
