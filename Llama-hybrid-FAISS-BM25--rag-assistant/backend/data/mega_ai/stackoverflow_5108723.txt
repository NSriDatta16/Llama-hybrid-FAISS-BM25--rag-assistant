Eclipse ContentAssist suddenly very, very slow

Possible Duplicate: Eclipse Android SDK slow Content Assist performance For reasons not worth discussing here, I rely heavily on ContentAssist in my Android development under Eclipse. When I first starting using it last summer, I had Ganymede running on an old, slow XP system and ContentAssist would effectively lock everything up for 10-20 seconds or more when I was referencing an object with a large inheritance hierarchy and many methods (e.g., types of Android Views, Context, etc.). To make life easier I upgraded my PC to a new quad-core system with 8Gb memory running Windows 7 Pro, and Eclipse then ran like lightning; problem solved, or so I thought. The other day, everything suddenly seemed to have slowed down again, to the point where ContentAssist is again hanging up for several seconds at a time when I reference complex objects. The only recent changes that I have made have been to upgrade my development environment to the latest Android SDK and toolset, plus installing Eclipse Helios. So is it the Helios upgrade that did it? I upgraded a few weeks ago, but I just noticed this recently when I started doing a bunch of new development work. What would I have to do to go back to Ganymede if I can't figure this out?
