T-Sne is a reduction technique that maintains the small scale structure (i.e. what is particularly close to what) of the space, which makes it very good at visualizing data separability. This means that T-Sne is particularly useful for early visualization geared at understanding the degree of data separability. Other techniques (PCA for example) leave data in lower dimensional representations projected on top of each other as dimensions disappear, which makes it very difficult to make any clear statement about separability in the higher dimensional space. So for example, if you get a T-Sne graph with lots of overlapping data, odds are high that your classifier will perform badly, no matter what you do. Conversely, if you see clearly separated data in the T-Sne graph, then the underlying, high-dimensional data contains sufficient variability to build a good classifier.
