As @IrishStat states, it is important to model whole time series and not to try artificially subset these. Time series do exhibit linear and non-linear structures and time dependencies. Whe have modeled hourly time series by transfer function methods which are also called ARIMAX methods. Our software is not so advanced as Autobox (IBM SPSS Modeler), but sometimes it gives almost same results. Here is also a link to the study with hourly time series of district heating system which was modeled via Matlabs ARX-model (same as transfer function model). http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:461661/FULLTEXT01.pdf
