When to log transform a time series before fitting an ARIMA model

I have previously used forecast pro to forecast univariate time series, but am switching my workflow over to R. The forecast package for R contains a lot of useful functions, but one thing it doesn't do is any kind of data transformation before running auto.arima(). In some cases forecast pro decides to log transform data before doing forecasts, but I haven't yet figured out why. So my question is: when should I log-transform my time series before trying ARIMA methods on it? /edit: after reading your answers, I'm going to use something like this, where x is my time series: library(lmtest) if ((gqtest(x~1)$p.value Does this make sense?
