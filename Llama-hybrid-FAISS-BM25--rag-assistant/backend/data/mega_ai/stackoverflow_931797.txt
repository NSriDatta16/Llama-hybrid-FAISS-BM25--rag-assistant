Some details: Indy10 is afaik already in D2005, though versions D2005 and D2006 allow to select which one to install. .... which doesn't matter, in any case always install the latest and greatest to get the newest fixes. Indy10 is better internally, but because they split it in several modules, beginners often have problems manually compiling it. Roughly the way of working of the Indy devels is thrust on the users, something that I think was unnecessary in retrospect since all packages must be updated as a whole in practice. Indy10 is portable. The indy9 Kylix support was not much more than an hack. Both work with FPC/Lazarus, but Indy9 only on win32. Indy10 also on Unix, OS X, win64 and wince. On lazarus, the Indy10 port is generally better. Last time I did significant work with it, the Indy10 examples were inferior to the indy9 ones. Indy10 got mired in the .NET morass, and is significantly less zero copy than indy9. This became worse over Indy10's lifetime. Some of the original goals of Indy10 (like fiber support for very high connection counts) were not realized. The need for fibers would need to be reevaluated anyway with the gigantic increase in (average) available memory though, and I also don't know how Microsoft sees fibers nowadays.
