Calculating the power of an experiment

I'm working through a question in Gelman - Regression and Other Stories and I find myself getting confused with the following question; 'Power, type M error, and type S error: Consider the experiment shown in Figure 16.1 where the true effect could not realistically be more than 2 percentage points and it is estimated with a standard error of 8.1 percentage points. (a) Assuming the estimate is unbiased and normally distributed and the true effect size is 2 percentage points, use simulation to answer the following questions: What is the power of this study? If only “statistically significant” results are reported, what is the average type M error and what is the type S error rate?' I understand the question says to use simulation but I would like to understand it analytically first. My calculation is as follows: I choose n = 1000 somewhat arbitrarily as the questions advises using simulation Declare statistical significance with values +- 2 SDs from 0. Therefore the probability of a T2 error given mu = 2 = Pr( X B = pnorm(55,0,1) is approximately 1 ---> Power = 1-B approx 0. Is the power of this experiment really 0%?
