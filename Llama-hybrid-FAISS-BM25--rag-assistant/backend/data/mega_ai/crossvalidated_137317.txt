Semi-supervised learning methods may well be the way to go, but I don't know it. A clustering approach to guiding doctors towards more useful cases to label (as @user1615070 suggests) also has some merits. Let me suggest a different strategy. In logistic regression, unlike linear regression, much of the information exists within a narrower range of your predictor variables. Consider this contrived plot: Note that the probability of 'success' goes from $.2$ at $x = -.73$ to $.8$ at $x = .73$, a range of less than $1.5$ on $x$. It is within this range that you have the least information about the status of the true label for $y$. With this idea in mind, I would use an iterative approach to gathering more labeled data: Fit a logistic regression model to the labeled data you have. Determine where the probable status of $y$ is unclear. Sample unlabeled cases in the region where you are likely to gain the most information and have your experts label them manually. Rinse and repeat as necessary. Using this strategy, you should be able to converge on a reasonable model efficiently. Note that this method assumes you already have some labeled cases with decent coverage of the predictor space. From your description, I gather this is true. However, if it isn't, you need a step 0 to precede the above. If you have no idea from prior research where the probability shifts from undiseased to diseased, you would want to sample on a grid to get an initial sense of the target location.
