Another reason to use AS3 is because it makes displaying and interacting with things onscreen easier to code. Some major improvements in AS3: Let's say you have a MovieClip mcOuter that contains another MovieClip, mcInner . AS3 makes it easy for mcOuter to receive a mouseover event when you mouse over mcInner . AS3 uses closures, which means that event handling functions (e.g. for mouse over) work right without resorting to Delegate. Generally, the functions and classes are much better organized in AS3 than in AS2.
