LMM (nested data) -> Heteroscedasticity

I want to apply the lmer function to test some fixed factors (treatment, body size of females, body size of males) and some random effects (females, males, location of male, location of female) on the Response variable (egg volume). Females and female sizes seem to have a significant effect on the egg volume. However, when I plotted egg volume ~ sire length, I recognized heteroscedasticity which was confirmed by a Breusch-Pagan test. As I'm new in stats and even newer to R: how do I deal with this issue? What does that mean / imply for my model? my data sample is quit big (around 3000 eggs). Thanks for any help! Rebekka
