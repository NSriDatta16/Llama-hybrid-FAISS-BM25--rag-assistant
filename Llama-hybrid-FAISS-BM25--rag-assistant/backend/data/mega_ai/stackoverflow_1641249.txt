As others have already said, what you want is: .main.yellow { color:green; } However, let me quickly explain why your first attempt didn't work. The + keyword refers to a following element, i.e. the element after. Your example would have matched the following HTML... Hello World ...and styled the second paragraph ( .yellow ) green. So " .main + .yellow " means "select a .yellow that is immediately after a .main ".
