ok, so I know (for example) that $X_t = 2X_{t-1} + e_t$ for iid $e_t$ is stationary. As far as I know the process that you mentioned is not [weakly]stationary (for stationarity the coefficient must be in $(-1,1)$ interval). Let start with expectation, Let $E(e_t)=0$ that is very common in time series literature. Also assume that the process starts at a non-zero point. \begin{align} E(X_t)&=2E(X_{t-1})+0\\ &=2(2E(X_{t-2})+0)+0\\ &=\ldots\\ &=2^kE(X_{t-k})\\ &=\vdots \end{align} that is not converging at all. That mean that this process is increasing and then process is not trend stationary. if you assume that the process starts from zero. then you can find variances with the same procedure as above to see it is not stationary (level stationary). Edit: For clarification, the above example can be rewritten as: $X_t = \frac{1}{2} X_{t+1} + u_t$, with $u_t$ some new white noise process. Now we can write down the infinite MA representation of this process, that is, $X_t = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{2})^{j+1} u_{t+j}$. Your edit looks convincing. But notice that an standard assumption on time series is that error in future is independent of current time series values. Statistically speaking $Cov(e_t,x_s)=0$ for all $t>s$. Your last equation violates this assumption. On the other hand, that clearly makes the life difficult because there is no record of future to test stationarity and even time series.
