Silverlight drag n drop element hides when outside of ListBox

I implemented a drag and drop of an image from a Grid to another Grid using built-in MouseDragElementBehavior class. Then I needed to use a bit more complex layout for the source items so used ListBox and ItemTemplate instead. The problem is now when dragging an item from the ListBox it is only visible when above the ListBox. How do I make it always visible and following mouse cursor anywhere while being dragged?
