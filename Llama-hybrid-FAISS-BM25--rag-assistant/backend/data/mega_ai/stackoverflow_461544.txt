Remote debugging of a Java application launched as a Windows service

My Java application is started from within a native program through java.dll. This native program is launched as a service on Windows. The following options have been added to the JVM args for remote debugging: -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n In this configuration, it is impossible to connect from e.g. my Eclipse workspace. If the program is launched from the command-line, i.e. not as a service, I can connect to port 8787. How can I allow remote debugging connections to this service?
