X/Html Validator in PHP

First thing: I know that there is interface to W3C validator: http://pear.php.net/package/Services_W3C_HTMLValidator/ But I don't know if I can install it on cheap hosting server. I don't think so. I need validator for my seo tools within my Content Managment System so it must be pretty much portable. I would love to use W3C but only if it would be portable. I can also use Curl for this but it won't be elegant solution. The best one I found so far is: http://phosphorusandlime.blogspot.com/2007/09/php-html-validator-class.html Is there any validator comparable to W3C but portable (only PHP that does not depend on custom packages)?
