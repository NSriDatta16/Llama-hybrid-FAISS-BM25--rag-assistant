The blue dots tend to have higher FEV and lower BMI (on average). So when you aggregate both groups together you have a longer thinner ellipse lying roughly from north west to south east across your plot than you have for either of the separate groups. In extreme cases you can have relationships within groups of different sign from the overall one but I do not think that is what you have here.
