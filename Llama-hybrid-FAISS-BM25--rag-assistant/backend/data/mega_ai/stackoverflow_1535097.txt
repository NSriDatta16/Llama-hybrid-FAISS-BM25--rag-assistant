You should be able to just take the average of the two points: Dim point1 as New Point(5, 2) Dim point2 as New Point(25, 32) Dim middlepoint as New Point((point1.X + point2.X)/2, (point1.Y + point2.Y)/2) If you're trying to move from one point to a second, you'll probably want something more like: Public Function MoveBetweenPoints(Point point1, Point point2, Double percentage) As Point Dim x as Double Dim y as Double x = point1.X * (1.0-percentage) + point2.X * percentage y = point1.Y * (1.0-percentage) + point2.Y * percentage Return New Point(x,y) End Function This would let you move from point1 to point2, by specifying the percentage to move (from 0-1)
