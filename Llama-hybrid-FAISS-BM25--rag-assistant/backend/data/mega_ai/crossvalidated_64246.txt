Mathematical background for neural networks

Not sure if this is appropriate for this site, but I'm beginning my MSE in computer science (BS in applied mathematics) and want to get a strong background in machine learning (I'm most likely going to pursue a PhD). One of my sub-interests is neural networks. What is a good mathematical background for ANNs? Like in other areas of machine learning, I assume linear algebra is important, but what other areas of mathematics are important? I plan to read Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction or Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition . Does anyone have any input or alternative recommendations?
