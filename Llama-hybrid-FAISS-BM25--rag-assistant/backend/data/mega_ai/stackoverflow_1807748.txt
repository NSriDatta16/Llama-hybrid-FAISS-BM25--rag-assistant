That doesn't make much sense. Why do you do a case on column1 but completely ignore that value afterwards? Did you just copy and (w)paste that into your query? Anyways, this is what I would expect to work in any of the ordinary RDBMS': case when colum2 like ...then 3 else 0 end as abc However, the only thing I know of mySQL is that it usually does everything different than your average Joe RDMS would do them.
