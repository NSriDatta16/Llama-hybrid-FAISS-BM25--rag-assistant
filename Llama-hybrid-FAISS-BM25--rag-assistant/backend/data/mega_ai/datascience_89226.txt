What is a sliding-window convolutional neural network?

In the abstract of "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation", the authors mention a sliding-window convolutional neural network. I've found several other articles mentioning this but no clean definition of it. How is it different from regular convolutional networks/what does the term mean?
