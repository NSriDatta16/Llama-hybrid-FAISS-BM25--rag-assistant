Re: Logistic Regression

I am working on a dataset that has a dependent variable that is binary, but it contains 98% of 0's and 2% of 1's. I am trying to use Logistic regression to predict purchase of a product. But because of the huge number of 0's, the model is not predicting well and getting a large number of false positive result. Kindly suggest how can I approach this.
