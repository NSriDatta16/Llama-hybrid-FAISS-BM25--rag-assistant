Beta regression shows a weird plot

I am trying to model the relationship between my response 'crop coverage [%]' ~ weed coverage [%] + Soil Moisture [%] using R. Since I am dealing with proportions, I chose to do a beta regression. Since I had some values which were equal to 1, I substracted like 0.0001 from them, so they would meet the criteria for beta distributions. Then I proceeded to fit a model with the betareg() function and plotted the result with ggplot(). The plot looks pretty weird to me. Did I do something wrong? My data: df The code for fitting the model betareg(crop_coverage ~ soil_moisture + weed_coverage, data = df) -> model_a The code for the plot ggplot(df, aes(x = soil_moisture, y = crop_coverage)) + geom_point(size = 2, shape = 21)+ geom_line(aes(y = predict(model_a, df)), color = "blue")+ theme_bw()+ ylab("Crop coverage [%]")+ xlab("Soil Moisture [%]") The plot looks like this and seems pretty weird to me. This doesnt look like a line from a beta regression because its not smooth.. Did I miss something? Any help is really appreciated! :) cheers!
