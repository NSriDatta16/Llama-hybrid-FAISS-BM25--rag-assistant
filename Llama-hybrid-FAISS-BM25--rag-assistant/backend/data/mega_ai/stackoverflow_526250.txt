Embed Flash Object by bypassing rules?

i want to embed a youtube video to a profile page, but the social system does not allow embedding flash objects now i wonder if theres a possibility to bypass this rule, the first thing i was thinking of was embedding an iframe to a page that links the object. sadly the social network also disallows iframes. do you have any idea? Thanks in advance
