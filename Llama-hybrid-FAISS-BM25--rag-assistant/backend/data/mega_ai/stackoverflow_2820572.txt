The deprecated tag essentially does that but is no longer part of the XHTML spec. It should still work though in all current browsers. Here's another idea, a hack/parlor trick, you could put the code in a textarea like so: test Putting angle brackets and code like this inside a text area is invalid HTML and will cause undefined behavior in different browsers. In Internet Explorer the HTML is interpreted, whereas Mozilla, Chrome and Safari leave it uninterpreted. If you want it to be non-editable and look different then you could easily style it using CSS. The only issue would be that browsers will add that little drag handle in the bottom-right corner to resize the box. Or alternatively, try using an input tag instead. The right way to inject code into your textarea is to use server side language like this PHP for example: test '; ?> Then it bypasses the html interpreter and puts uninterpreted text into the textarea consistently across all browsers. Other than that, the only way is really to escape the code yourself if static HTML or using server-side methods such as .NET's HtmlEncode() if using such technology.
