Average count of overlap between random samples

If I randomly sample n numbers from 1..m , x times, what would be the average count of numbers that overlap in every sample? Example: Variables: n = 4 , m = 12 , x = 3 Samples: 4 8 1 11 , 5 4 12 1 , 1 3 7 4 Numbers that overlap in every sample: 2 (1 and 4) I think I have a general intuition on how you might do this for x = 2 . My thought is that you want to find the probabilities for all possible counts, 0..n , and then you could use those probabilities to do a weighted average of the counts? And to do those probabilities, you'd do something like 1 / choose(count, m) , except for count = 0 which is 1-(1/choose(n,m)) ? It's been a while since I took stats so I wouldn't be surprised if that intuition is wrong though. But even if it is right, I'm still not sure how you would go about doing it for x > 2 /generalizing for all x . From comments: What is the probability a particular number, e.g. $1$ , appears in the first sample? It would be $n/m$ , so for my example, $30\%$ probability that $1$ appears in the first sample What is the probability it appears in all $x$ samples? I think it would be $(n/m)^x$ What is the expected number of numbers that appear in all $x$ samples? I can understand that I should now have the information needed to answer this, but I think this is beyond my current capabilities.
