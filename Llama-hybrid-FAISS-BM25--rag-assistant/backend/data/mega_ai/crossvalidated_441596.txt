Imagine you have 20 time series of abundance of some species of fish coming from 20 different sites and you are interested in uncovering their shared common trends. In this example, Z would denote the collection of 20 time series - the observed data. Y would denote the shared common trends - these trends are not directly observable (they are considered hidden), but they can be estimated from the observed data. Each observed time series of abundance is a 'concoction' of these long-term trends plus some noise - for some time series of abundance, one trend is dominant, for other time series of abundance, two or more trends can be at play simultaneously, etc. You can formulate a dynamic factor analysis model for estimating the underlying common trends and determining how they combine to produce each time series of abundance (see https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa-labs/sec-dfa.html ). This model will include: An "observation model" (think of it as a "data model") which will describe the connection between the observed time series of abundance and the unobservable underlying common trends; A "process model" which will detail how each common trend evolves over time and whether or not these trends are correlated with each other over time. The two models are qualitatively different - in particular, in the "observation model", the response variables are observed; in the "process model", the response variables are unobserved (and unobservable). Most importantly, the two models include different sets of unknown parameters which must be estimated from the observed time series abundance data. The parameters for the "observation model" are the so-called "data model parameters", while the parameters for the "process model" are the so-called "process model parameters". This example illustrates that the process is something that happens behind the scenes and cannot be directly observed. However, whatever happens behind the scenes conspires to affect what data we observe.
