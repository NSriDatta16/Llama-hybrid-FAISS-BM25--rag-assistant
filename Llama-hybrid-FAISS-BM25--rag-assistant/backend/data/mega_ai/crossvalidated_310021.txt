How to make classification model perform better?

I have (imbalanced class) classification problem on my hand. Major class proportion being 92.7%. I have tried with most of the training data manipulation techniques, such as Oversampling, under-sampling (both with SMOTE as well). And I have tried with almost all the classifiers available at my disposal. E.g.: Logistic, SVM, KNN, NN etc. The Steps I am following: 1) Feature creation 2) Data cleaning and processing (outlier detection and removal of outliers/replacing them by mean , standardization, splitting data in train and test format) 3) doing the undersampling/oversampling on train data 4) apply the model on train data 5) and testing the model on test data I am not getting precision for minor class not more than 10% and my target is to get at least 60%. Am I doing anything fundamentally wrong here? p.s. I have tried with ensemble techniques as well EDIT : It is an attrition model and sample size = 250k. Fields are not known to me, that is anonymous data.
