organ duality, suggesting that x\ be thought of as a unary operation f, defined by f(y) = x\y, that has a De Morgan dual ¬f(¬y), analogous to ∀xφ(x) = ¬∃x¬φ(x). Denoting this dual operation as x▷, we define x▷z as ¬(x\¬z). Similarly we define another operation z◁y as ¬(¬z/y). By analogy with x\ as the residual operation associated with the operation x•, we refer to x▷ as the conjugate operation, or simply conjugate, of x•. Likewise ◁y is the conjugate of •y. Unlike residuals, conjugacy is an equivalence relation between operations: if f is the conjugate of g then g is also the conjugate of f, i.e. the conjugate of the conjugate of f is f. Another advantage of conjugacy is that it becomes unnecessary to speak of right and left conjugates, that distinction now being inherited from the difference between x• and •x, which have as their respective conjugates x▷ and ◁x. (But this advantage accrues also to residuals when x\ is taken to be the residual operation to x•.) All this yields (along with the Boolean algebra and monoid axioms) the following equivalent axiomatization of a residuated Boolean algebra. y # x▷z ⇔ x•y # z ⇔ x # z◁y With this signature it remains the case that this axiomatization can be expressed as finitely many equations. Converse In Examples 2 and 3 it can be shown that x▷I = I◁x. In Example 2 both sides equal the converse x˘ of x, while in Example 3, both sides are I when x contains the empty word and 0 otherwise. In the former case x˘ = x. This is impossible for the latter because x▷I retains hardly any information about x. Hence in Example 2 we can substitute x˘ for x in x▷I = x˘ = I◁x and cancel (soundly) to give x˘▷I = x = I◁x˘. x˘˘ = x can be proved from these two equations. Tarski's notion of a relation algebra can be defined as a residuated Boolean algebra having an operation x˘ satisfying these two equations. The cancellation step in the above is not possible for Example 3, which therefore is not a relation algebra, x˘ being uniquely determined as x▷I. Consequences of this axiomatization of converse include x˘˘ = x, ¬(x˘) = (¬x)˘, (x ∨ y)˘ = x˘ ∨ y˘, and (x•y)˘ = y˘•x˘.
