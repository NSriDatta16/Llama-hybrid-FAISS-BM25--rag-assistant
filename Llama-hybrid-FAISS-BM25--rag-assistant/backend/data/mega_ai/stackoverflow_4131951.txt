Is your database indexed correctly? Lookups on indexed columns should be pretty fast - 12k rows is not a great deal for any relational DB. Another thing I could suggest is to load the database table data, into an in memory table. I've done this in MySQL long time back : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/memory-storage-engine.html . This will help specially if the data does not change very frequently - so a one time load up of the data into a in memory table will be quick. After that, all queries should be executed on this in memory table and these are amazingly fast.
