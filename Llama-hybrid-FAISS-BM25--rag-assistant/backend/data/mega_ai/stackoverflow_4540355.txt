Problem is not the background. The problem is the position relative you're giving to the block level elements without defining their width... The h2 elements like (Ship To:) and (Phone) and all the paragraph elements. You need to give these elements a specific width and it will work fine Try giving these elements a background-color: yellow; to see how the flow inside the document ( for your debugging purpose ) and you will see what I mean
