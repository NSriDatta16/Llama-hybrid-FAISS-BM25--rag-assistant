How can I build AutoEncoder for a-one-class unsupervised classification model?

I am studying AutoEncoder to learn how to build a-one-class classification model which is unsupervised learning and I am wondering how to build a-one-class classification model using AutoEncoder. After having done my researches and I got some questions in mind: Does AutoEncoder need backpropagations? Does AutoEncoder require the same weights as in the encoder and decoder parts? If I want to detect outlier ones, do I only train the model with non-outlier ones? After having trained an AutoEncoder, how can I test it as a-one-class classification model?
