Oracle: how to run a stored procedure "later"

We have a system that allows users interfacing data into the database to set up various rules that are used to alter data before it is merged in to the main table. For example, an order might have a rule that sets up what delivery company to use based on a customer's address. This is originally intended to operate only on the data being loaded in, so it's limited to functions that you can call from a select statement. An important point to note is that the data is not in the destination table yet. Now, I have a project that requires an update to another table (fine - I can use an autonomous_transaction pragma for that). However, there are some functions I need to run that require the data to be inserted before they run (i.e. they are aggregating data). So, I really want to just queue up running my procedure till some time later (it's not time dependent). How do I do that in Oracle? The wealth of documentation is rather overwhelming when I just want to do something simple.
