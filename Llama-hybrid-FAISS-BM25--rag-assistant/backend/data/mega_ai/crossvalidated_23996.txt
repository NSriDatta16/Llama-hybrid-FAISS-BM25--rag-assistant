(Sorry for submitting this as an answer instead of a comment, but I can't comment quite yet!) If you can share any more information about the data I think it would help a lot in advising a solution. What leads to there being multiple observations when "ideally" there should only be one? Is it a sensor (or data collection device) malfunctioning or some kind of human error? Do you have any thoughts on why there is so much variation over what I am imaging to be a relatively small period of time? How long are the time intervals? If we are talking 1 measurement per hour and you happen to be getting two measurements in the hour, aside from me wondering why it is happening, you could also ask what time in the hour it is occuring (one at the start of the hour and one at the end of the hour, etc)? A potential solution if this is the case might be to take smaller time increments until you no longer have this problem, but that likely opens the door to a host of autocorrelation problems. Does it lead to any periods with no observations (like the observation from period 1 just got shifted to period 2 and the observation from period 2 is still there)? Then you might just redefine period 1 and 2, though that might not work, depending on what exactly you are trying to do. Essentially any information you can give to flesh out what exactly the problem is will really influence what advice I (or likely someone else with more real time series experience) will be able to offer you.
