ARIMA modeling white noise probabilities vs. residual autocorrelation/PACF

I have moderate understanding of statistics and time series analysis. I trying to forecast a weekly time series with lots of outliers and trend shifts. After correcting all of the outliers, I'm left with the following residual panel. The final model is (0,1,0)X(0,1,1)52 + Outlier Correction . In looking at the acf/pacf I see no pattern. However when I look at the white noise probabilities, I see that there is significant autocorrelation left at lag 4. so I modify the above model to (4,1,0)X(0,1,1)52+Outlier Correction . Please note that it is not AR(4) but instead AR(0,0,0,1) model. I get the diagnostic plots as shown below. I no longer have any significant autocorrelation left in white noise probablities. Below are my questions: Do we really need to be concerned about white noise probabilities or is it suffice to look in to ACF and PACF of residuals and ensure that there is no pattern left?. Does the white noise probabilities matter if the goal is prediction/forecast ? There is not much difference between the forecasted values in two models.
