From your question, it looks like you are searching for a tool which would tell you whether one outlier is "pulling the effect". This is what your 4th plot standardized residuals vs. leverage addresses. If you use the check_model function of performance package ( see example here ) you will have a yes/no answer to your question. The DHARMa package would also give you a simple yes/no answer so as to whether your model assumptions are met (overdispersion and/or heterogeneous variances between treatment levels) with the plot(simulateResiduals) function. Also, as said above, you cannot directly compare 2 models fitted to a different number of observations.
