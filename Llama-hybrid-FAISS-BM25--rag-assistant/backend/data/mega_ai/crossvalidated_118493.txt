In this paper by Seawright (2009) several approaches how to analyze pseudo-panel data are disscussed, including: Cohort averaging ( Deaton 1985 ; Verbeek & Nijman 1992 ) Two-Stage Auxiliary Instrumental Variables (2SAIV) ( Franklin 1989 ) Multiple imputation ( Gelman/King/Liu 1999 ) Matching ( Rubin 2006 ) Three of the approaches are assesed against a true panel "gold standard" and a pure cross-sectional estimation. The author reaches the conclusion that pseudo-panel matching performs best under the specified conditions due to its robustness against parametric misspecification.
