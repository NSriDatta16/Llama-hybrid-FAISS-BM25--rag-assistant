Peter's response highlights the main issues with missing values. If you are looking for a thorough non-technical discussion, could I point you towards the chapter in Gelman and Hill (pdf). I assume you are working from survey data, in which case you could have quite a few variables with which you can perform imputation. If you are doing your analysis in R, you may want to check out random forest missing values imputation, or rfImpute in the randomForest package. This approach has the advantage that it deals well with both categorical and continuous data, and the underlying model is quite flexible. In a paper last year (it's not a great paper!) I give a little description of how it works (see section 4 of this paper ). All the best
