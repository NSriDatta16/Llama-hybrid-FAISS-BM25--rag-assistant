It does make sense. Setting $\epsilon \leftarrow 0$ makes the SVM equivalent to Mean Absolute Deviation regression, plus the $\ell_2$ penalization. Optimizing the mean-squared error corresponds to optimizing for a Gaussian likelihood, while optimizing for mean absolute deviation corresponds to optimizing for a Laplace distribution. See Why squared residuals instead of absolute residuals in OLS estimation?
