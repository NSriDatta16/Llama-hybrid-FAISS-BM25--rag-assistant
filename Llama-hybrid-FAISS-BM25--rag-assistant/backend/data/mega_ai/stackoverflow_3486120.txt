Sounds like its an issue with either the new TLF TextFields in CS5 or a matter of embedding your fonts. Try doing the following: 1) Select your TextField in flash and go to the text properties. In there right underneath where you set the texts instance name, should be a drop down menu showing TLF Text. Select Classic Text from the drop-down instead. 2) Where you select your font family, there should be a button called Embed. Click it and select all the characters of that font family you want to embed. If all else fails, just create a new TextField in CS5 and replace the old one with it. Flash can act a bit weird at times.
