c# wpf richtextbox run mouseup

Hey, I have a richtextbox. To add content I do this Paragraph p = new Paragraph(); Run r; r = new Run("[" + user + "]: "); b = System.Windows.Media.Brushes.Black; if (user.Equals(Program.LClient.strUserName)) b = Brushes.Blue; r.Foreground = b; r.ToolTip = DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString() + " " + DateTime.Now.ToLongDateString() + "\nClick to whisper"; r.Cursor = Cursors.Hand; r.Background = Brushes.White; r.MouseEnter += delegate(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { r.Background = new RadialGradientBrush(Colors.DarkGray, Colors.WhiteSmoke); }; r.MouseLeave += delegate(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { r.Background = Brushes.White; }; r.PreviewMouseUp += delegate(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { tbMess.Text = "/w " + user + " "; tbMess.Focus(); }; p.Inlines.Add(new Bold(r)); rtbChat.Document.Blocks.Add(p); Everything works except I can register ANY mouseup/down events. Mouse enter and leave work fine, just for some reason can't get any buttonevents. Also, i don't have any mouse events registered to the RichTextBox. Also, read this before giving alternative ways to do this. I'm not interested in looking for a new way to do this. I know I could keep an array of the locations of all the different elements that I want to keep track of, but I'm not interested in doing that. I found no documentation saying that the mouseup/down events arn't available for a run, so there has to be a way. Thanks in advance for the help.
