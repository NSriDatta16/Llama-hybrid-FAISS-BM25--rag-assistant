What causes the differences between a driver on disk and a driver mapped to memory?

Hey, Today I tried to do a binary diffing of NDIS.sys, and I noticed something weird. I took a function, and began to diff it. The first 30 bytes were the same on the disk(using IDA) and on memory(using WinDbg). Then, something have changed. I saw something like "jmp _ imp _XXXXX". the JMP bytes were the same, but the address was different. My question is - what makes the difference? I think it has something to do with relocations. Altough the jump is to address in the same module, it's a long jump, which makes it relative to the module base address. If relocation occured, it needs to relocate this address too, altough its on the same module. Am I right or totally wrong? :-) Thanks.
