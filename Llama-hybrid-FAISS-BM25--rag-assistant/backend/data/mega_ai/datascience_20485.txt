How can i build a machine learning model to identify a specific word?

I am trying to build a model that can be used to identify the word sales whenever a group of text are passed through the model. Should I use Azure or Python for this? I have done the text preprocessing and extracted the n-gram features in Azure, what should I do next and which model should I use?
