It is not recognized because you are implementing mouseDragged inside of an addMouseListener . mouseDragged is triggered by a MouseMotionListener and mousePressed is triggered by a MouseListener . Therefore you need to implement both MouseListener and MouseMotionListener and add the right listener accordingly. public class MyClass extends JPanel implements MouseListener, MouseMotionListener { public MyClass() { // whatever code you need, then add the listeners this.addMouseListener(this); this.addMouseMotionListener(this); } public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { ... } public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { ... } }
