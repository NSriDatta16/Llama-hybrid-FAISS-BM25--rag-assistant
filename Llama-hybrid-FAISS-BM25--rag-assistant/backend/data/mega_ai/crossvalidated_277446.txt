Classification using Convolutional neural networks for very high dimensional data

I have time series signals that are VERY high dimensional (14000 data points), the number of samples is around 1000 samples. I want to use the Convolution neural networks to classify the time series signals into two classes. The input to the cnn is (1000*14000). Is it possible to perform such a classification task especially if the dimension of the input is much much higher than the number of samples that I have?? PLEASE ADVICE
