jquery load to download the content first

this is a strange case, I have a jquery script that works with load() and a PHP script with a gif loader until this script is retrieved FADING IN , this jquery is launched on click The problem is that the jquery script is kinda useless for its real intent because this php script I call returns something like where 1.jpg (file name) is retrieved by the PHP page called in ajax from a db related to the id of the image passed through load() so, when the html text fades in the image will still need to be loaded from the resizer.php thus it will appear normally How can I organized this to fade In once everything is downloaded? I can't call the resizer.php directly because it outputs a JPEG header
