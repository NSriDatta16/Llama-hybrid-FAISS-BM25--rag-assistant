How do I bind the result of DataTable.Select() to a ListBox control?

I have the following code: ListBox.DataSource = DataSet.Tables("table_name").Select("some_criteria = match") ListBox.DisplayMember = "name" The DataTable.Select() method returns an array of System.Data.DataRow objects. No matter what I specify in the ListBox.DisplayMember property, all I see is the ListBox with the correct number of items all showing as System.Data.DataRow instead of the value I want which is in the "name" column! Is it possible to bind to the resulting array from DataTable.Select() , instead of looping through it and adding each one to the ListBox ? (I've no problem with looping, but doesn't seem an elegant ending!)
