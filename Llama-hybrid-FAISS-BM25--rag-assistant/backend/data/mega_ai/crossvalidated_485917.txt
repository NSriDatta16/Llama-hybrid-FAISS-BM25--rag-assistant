Validity with repeated measures

I have some data that was collected with 2 different devices on a sample of 50 subjects. It was also collected for 50 days in a row. One of the devices is considered "the gold standard" method of assessment, so I want to use that to evaluate the validity of the data from the other device. Should I randomly select a single date and use its data for the validation or look at the validity of every single day and average it? Or is there another way that I don't know of? I'm not sure about collapsing the data across days since that would inflate the sample (n=50 vs n=2500)
