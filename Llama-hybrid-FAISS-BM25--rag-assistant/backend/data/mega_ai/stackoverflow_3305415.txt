md5 isn't very well suited to this purpose. Read this article to learn the hows and whys, but the short version is that you should use bcrypt instead. A quick Google shows that PHPass claims to support bcrypt . UPDATE: As @Dragontamer5788 points out in the comments, scrypt is even better than bcrypt from a theoretical perspective. The author is good at crypto, but be aware that it's had less review and less real-world exposure than bcrypt at this point. I'd probably still choose it, but it's not as cut-and-dried as bcrypt over md5 .
