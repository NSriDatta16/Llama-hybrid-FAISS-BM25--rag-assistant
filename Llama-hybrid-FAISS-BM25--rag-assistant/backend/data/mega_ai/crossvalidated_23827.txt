Invertibility of AR(p) model

Notation: $\dot{Z}_t = Z_t - E(Z_t)$, so that it is centered at 0. $a_t$ stands for the residual and we assume the $a_t$ are independent and normally distributed with mean 0 and constant standard deviation $\sigma_a^2$. And, when I say stationarity, I mean weak stationarity and not strict stationarity. In my time series class, we have been given that an MA(q) model is of the form $$\dot{Z}_t = \theta_q(B) a_t$$ where $$\theta_q(B) = 1 - \theta_1 B - \theta_2 B^2 - \cdots - \theta_q B^q.$$ We were told MA(q) is always stationary and it is invertible when all of the roots of $\theta_q(B)$ are outside the unit circle. For an AR(p) model, we were told it is of the form $$\phi_p(B) \dot{Z}_t = a_t$$ where $$\phi_p(B) = 1 - \phi_1 B - \phi_2 B^2 - \cdots - \phi_p B^p.$$ We were told this model is stationary when all of the roots of $\phi_p(B)$ are outside the unit circle, but I don't remember hearing anything about when these are invertible. If I use the parallels from the MA(q) model, I might say the AR(p) model is always invertible. Is that correct? Thanks
