Yes, we have found this process to have worked very well and used specflow to deliver this approach fairly easy. We have over 2000+ scenarios implemented in our domain layer alone and we have also used this approach for testing our controllers in our UI layer too(another 2000+ tests). It's a good idea if working on a large project to put some thought into how to organise the steps before you start as you will quickly start to collect a large amount of steps and finding a step can become a bit of a challenge. The biggest issue we had was having multiple people on a team writing scenarios, they would often write the same step but with a slightly different wording resulting in the same step being added twice.
