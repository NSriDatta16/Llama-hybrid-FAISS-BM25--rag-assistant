The best way to solve the Root Cause is to not make it a GET but a POST Request. There is AFAIK no set limits on the length of a QueryString, so the real limit is all over the place. I know that 4000 is a limit on some web servers (can't remember if it was IIS or Apache and if it could be changed), but it is very possible that some browsers have much smaller limits. The fact that you don't get a user-agent could emphasize that it's a mobile browser, crawler or other application rather than a real browser. POST requests are a bit more complex to do, but they can carry much bigger "payloads" and can be configured on the server side.
