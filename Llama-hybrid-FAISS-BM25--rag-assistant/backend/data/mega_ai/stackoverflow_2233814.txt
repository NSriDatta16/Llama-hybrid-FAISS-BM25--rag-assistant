What happens when you send that request? Presumably it succeeds, because the cmp:NumberType part of refers not to the name of the element but to the name of the type in the above-referenced WSDL. It is a complex type, otherwise it would be something like xsd:int . So, as I say, your code should still work, especially if you imported that WSDL as a WebReference into your Visual Studio project.
