Can posterior become tractable if we know p(x)?

In the VAE framework where x is an input data (a vector) and z is a vector of continuous latent variables, the posterior p(z|x) is intractable because p(x) is intractable, so we approximate it using an approximate posterior q(z|x) . But, what happens if we know p(x) ? e.g., if p(x) = N(mu, covariance mtx) is known, does this make the posterior tractable? If yes, does this also apply even if the covariance mtx has off-diagonal terms (i.e., elements in the vector x are correlated) - or does it not matter?
