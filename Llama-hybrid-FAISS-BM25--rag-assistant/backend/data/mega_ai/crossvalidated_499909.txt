How should I interpret these ACF / PACF plots for a time series?

I am trying to determine the most appropriate degree of difference to start building an arima model for this dataset. I already know that I need a first difference, but there is a seasonal component, and I am not exactly sure where to go from here. I've tried several potential options but I am just not very confident when interpreting these plots. I will include the raw time series plot / acf / pacf plots as well as the first differenced time series / acf / pacf plots. Any help would be fantastic!!
