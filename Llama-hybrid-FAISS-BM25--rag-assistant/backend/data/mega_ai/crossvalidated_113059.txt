The answer is fairly straightforward in this case, but it is rather unhelpfully hidden in the SPSS output, and it requires that you understand something about how the parameters are estimated and tested 'under the hood'. Because the low sensitivity group has no deaths, there are problems with the way the parameters are estimated (by attempting to maximize the likelihood). You can see this in the comment below the Iteration History box: b. At least one coefficient is tending to infinity after 3 iterations This means that the algorithm's best estimate of the true parameter is infinite, which makes the algorithm crash, and it causes problems with the Wald test of the estimate. It does not cause these problems with a score test of the estimate. That is why in the Omnibus test of model coefficients box, under "Overall (score)" you see a p-value of .024 , which matches the log rank test in the analysis above. That is a perfectly valid p-value in your case and you should use it / the KM test (which is a score test). (Note also that you see the same thing in your second analysis. In fact, the second predictor Gender never even ends up being entered into the model.) Maximum likelihood estimation, and score, Wald and likelihood ratio tests of ML estimates are very technical topics. If you are new to statistics, I wouldn't suggest you pursue them. However, the following do exist for future readers: MLE in layman terms Wald test for logistic regression Why do my p-values differ between logistic regression output, chi-squared test, and the confidence interval for the OR?
