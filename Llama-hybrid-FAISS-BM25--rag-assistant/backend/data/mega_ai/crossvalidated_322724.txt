Inconsistent varimax rotated scores from robust PCA output

This great answer shows how to compute varimax-rotated loadings and scores from PCA results using princomp. I am conducting a robust PCA analysis using the pcaHubert function from the rrcov package. While I can rotate the loadings without any issues, when I try to reproduce the rotated scores using the second and third methods from the linked answer above, I get slightly different results between the two methods. I am not sure why, but guess it must be something related to differences the robust/ROBPCA output or algorithm? Can someone explain what is causing this, how to fix it, and/or if one of these methods is "more' correct in the case of robust PCA? irisX print(scores1[1:2,]) [,1] [,2] [1,] 1.024056 -0.8049907 [2,] 1.365848 0.3179221 > print(scores2[1:2,]) [,1] [,2] [1,] 1.093374 -0.8408940 [2,] 1.433536 0.3005973 Clearly I'm missing something, maybe quite basic, but can't fathom what is is?
