My deep learning model works with Stratified K-Fold, but not in predicting future time events

I have a project at work where I'm supposed to predict a specific location given cell phone signal parameters. I developed a deep learning model that uses convolutional neural network on time-ordered parameters of the data. I initially performed a stratified K-folds testing of the data, to which I got 86% accuracy. I was then asked to do testing where I tested on all data except for the past 2 days, then test on the recent 2 days of data. My accuracy has now plummeted to 2%. Would anyone know why this is? My guess is there are some imbalance of bins that were not present in the stratified K-folds.
