Pointers to user profile frameworks in Java

I'm looking for pointers to something that I may be overlooking (or maybe something that Jivebot hasn't yet written for me). What I want is a pre-rolled Java framework for managing user accounts that takes care of most of the common tasks associated with such. For instance, Jfacets is a good approach to automagic view controlling, but you still have to roll the view code. I wonder if there's a framework that has pre-rolled components for inputting/storing common user profile information, sessioning, and possibly things like inter-account communication, connecting to common social APIs, exposing an API, etc. (basically some/all of the common tasks that a user profile-based app would want). It can be quick and dirty, this is a prototype app at the moment. I do know that user profiles are a very app-specific arena, and that I may just have to build something up, just thought I'd check first. In the absence of a pre-rolled solution, I like what I see in Woko after an initial glance ( http://woko.wiki.sourceforge.net/ ). The preconfigured stack includes Hibernate, Spring, Compass, JFacets, Stripes, and Maven and an API framework. I may just need to build the prototype up leveraging this as much as possible. Thanks
