glmm with proportion data and high overdispersion

I have data of time budget behaviors in form of relative frequencies (Nr specific behavior/nr of total behavior observed). The best would be to perform a multinomial analysis, but it seems too hard to interpret results for me. So I am going with GLMM (which is not simple but I try to!). I decided for a binomial distribution with the rate of foraging (for example, then I will use other behaviors as responses) as response (numerical variable) and other 4 factorial variables as fixed factors, Id as random. My first model is then like this mod1 if I calculate overdispersion then I got 2547.6/720 =3.5 which is high, right? So now..how do I proceed? I saw that I cannot use negative binomial or beta; I also saw to ad a random term for each observation: this point, which I do not fully understand, is not working in the model, with problems of convergence. This is how my data look like $ ID.OBS : int NA 1947 1943 1945 1954 1959 63 64 1956 1960 ... $ FAMILY : Factor w/ 12 levels "ALTE","ATOLIMPO",..: 1 1 1 1 1 9 9 9 9 $ id : Factor w/ 67 levels "N","b",..: 54 58 51 57 25 17 19 26 $ NSCAN : int 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 ... $ DAYCONT : int 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 72 ... $ PERIOD : Factor w/ 3 levels "A","B","C": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ DAY : Factor w/ 3 levels "D","E","F": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ SEX : Factor w/ 2 levels "F","M": 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 ... $ AGE : Factor w/ 3 levels "0","1","2+": 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 ... $ STATUS : Factor w/ 3 levels "DOMINANTE","GIOVANE",..: 3 3 3 1 2 2 2 2 $ ZONA : Factor w/ 2 levels "ALTA","BASSA": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ rate.for : num 0.2 0.5 0.5 0.4 0 ... $ rate.play : num 0.6 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ... $ rate.gree : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.groo : num 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.fight : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.look : num 0 0 0 0.6 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.l.burrow : num 0.2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.move : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.hay : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.scream : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.dig : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ rate.mark : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Actually my rate of foraging behavior (nr of foraging event/total behavior) appears like this in the plot I also was thinking to use only the number of foraging event instead of rate. In this case foraging would be a counts and I could use Poisson distribution; anyway the overdispersion remain high. Thanks to any help!
