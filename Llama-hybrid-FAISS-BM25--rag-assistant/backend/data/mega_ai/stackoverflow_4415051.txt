What data structure would be suitable for solving this problem?

I have an xml which contains some keywords. The format of the xml this: The number of keywords in the xml is variable and can be anything (number can be in thousands). I have a text file which has two columns. Column one contains keywords and second columns has a value for the keyword. The size of each textfile is around 50MB. Based on the keywords in xml, I need to find the corresponding values from text file. I can easily parse the text file and get the values. Now here is my problem: I have 10 textfiles, I need to find the values for the keywords mentioned in xml from all those 10 textfile and see if values for keywords from all the 10 textfiles are same or not. I need to display the results like this: Name: 3 different values found in 10 textfile, City: abcdef Email: johnsmith@example.com Whichever keywords have same value in all files should display that value otherwise, display how many different values (number) exist for that particular keyword. What is the most elegant way to solve this problem in C#? What is the best datastructure suited for such problems?
