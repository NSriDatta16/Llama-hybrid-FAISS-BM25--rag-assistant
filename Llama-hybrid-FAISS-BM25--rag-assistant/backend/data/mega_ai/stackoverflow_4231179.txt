What is a fixed point integer?

In http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview-aggregate it says: rating . required. fixed point integer [1.0-5.0], with optional alternate worst (default:1.0) and/or best (default:5.0), also fixed point integers, and explicit average. What is a fixed point integer? Maybe that means integer? Why is 1.0 or 2.5 or 5.0 also called a "fixed point integer"? Because integer has no decimal part.
