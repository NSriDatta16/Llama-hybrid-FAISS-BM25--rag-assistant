Font Embedding in Flexbuilder Vs. CS4

I have an all-AS3 Flex project in which I embed fonts. I'm trying to run this project from CS4. However, for some reason the text isn't showing up at all. The code in the Flex AS3 looks like this: [Embed(source='C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/ArialBD.TTF', fontWeight = 'bold', fontName='ArialBold', unicodeRange='U+0020-U+0020,U+0021-...')] //a bunch of other unicode public static var _VerdanaFontBold:Class; [Embed(source='C:/WINDOWS/Fonts/Arial.TTF', fontWeight = 'regular', fontName='Arial', unicodeRange='U+0020-U+0020...')] //a bunch of other unicode public static var _VerdanaFont:Class; And in constructor of the extended textfield in which my text appears I have: Font.registerFont(_VerdanaFontBold); Font.registerFont(_VerdanaFont); I found this article on embedding metadata with Flash, but I couldn't get that to work either (I tried systemFont="Arial" as well as suggested in the comments at the bottom of that article). So I tried commenting out the above lines and doing it another way. In CS4, I understand that I'm supposed to create a blank textfield in design mode in the FLA file. I then can select fonts to embed in the properties panel. I selected verdana (upper and lower case, punctuation, number, etc). But again when I run the app in CS4, the textfield is blank. The fact that I'm embedding the font in a blank textfield, and not the one that's called by the document class I've set, shouldn't matter, right? -- the font should just be embedded in the swf and available for use. But it's blank. Anyone have any ideas?
