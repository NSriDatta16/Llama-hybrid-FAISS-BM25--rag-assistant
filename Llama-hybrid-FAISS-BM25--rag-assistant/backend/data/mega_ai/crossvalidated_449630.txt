Hidden Markov Model with response and independent variable

I need to fit a HMM for a machine/process that links some input variable to an output variable. When plotting the values, it is clear that there is a time series pattern. This repeating pattern is driven by the inputs, but also the hidden process inside the machine linking Input and Output. This hidden process has states. So now I want to fit a HMM with Output as the response and Input as the independent variable. I'm new to HMM and I did some reading. I understand that one can fit a HMM for a dataset with observations. But in my case, I don't only have observations (the outputs) but also inputs that drive the outputs. So I have an independent variable. How can I fit this HMM in R?
