This is not quite a dup - for C++ see and upvote the accepted answer here by @Zunino. Basic code below but to see the full glorious elegance of the answer you are going to have to click on it. #include #include #include #include #include int main() { using namespace std; string sentence = "Something in the way she moves..."; istringstream iss(sentence); copy(istream_iterator (iss), istream_iterator (), ostream_iterator (cout, "\n")); } This hinges on the fact that by default, istream_iterator treats whitespace as its separator. The resulting tokens are written to cout on separate lines (per separator specified in constructor overload for ostream_iterator ).
