Pointer ) Select Choose items Click on Browse and select the .dll It will automatically select all controls imported from that .dll Just drag & drop the control your TextBoxControl to your form. Important: Those controls will be added to the specified tab under ToolBox. Eg: If you are under Containers , then those controls will be added to that Tab. You could create a new tab to store those controls (if you have more than one or two), or just add it to Common Controls . If you drag & drop a control to your form, you will see that the dll is referenced in your project.
