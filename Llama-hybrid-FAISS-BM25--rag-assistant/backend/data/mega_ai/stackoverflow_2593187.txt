Div that appears behind other. How to avoid that behaivor?

I'm using JQuery for this. The problem is that, when I drag an object from the side bar, the DIV that I'm dragging appears behind the main area, thus it looks really bad. I took a screenshot of the problem: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pckKo.png The div I'm dragging has this CSS: .reporte_arrastrado{ width: 150px; height: 60px; background-color: silver; background-image: url(chart.png); background-position: left center; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding: 10px 0 10px 26px; position:relative; } And, the one that represents the main area has this CSS: #tabs{ position:relative; } That's it... I've read some answers here, and people always suggest to set the position property to relative. But, it does not work for me. Thanks for reading.
