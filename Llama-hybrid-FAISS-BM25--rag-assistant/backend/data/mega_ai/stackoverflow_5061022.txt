php arrays create parenthood array

I have two arrays: Parents: Array ( [0] => Levi Self [2] => Portraits [3] => Abstract ) Children: Array ( [0] => Portraits [1] => Abstract [2] => Megan [3] => Locks ) And I'm trying to build an array that looks like this: Array ( [Levi Self] => Array ( [0] => Portraits [1] => Abstract ) [Portraits] => Array ( [0] => Megan ) [Abstract] => Array ( [0] => Locks ) ) I am getting the hierarchy from the database table that looks like this: Array ( [0] => Array ( [title] => Portraits [parent] => Levi Self ) [1] => Array ( [title] => Abstract [parent] => Levi Self ) [2] => Array ( [title] => Megan [parent] => Portraits ) [3] => Array ( [title] => Locks [parent] => Abstract ) ) Am I trying something that is impossible? Thanks, Levi Self
