Linear regresion for multiple time series

I have some data with this shape: Key Date Value key1 1/1/22 0,10 key1 2/1/22 0,12 key1 3/1/22 0,11 key1 ... key2 1/1/22 1,30 key2 2/1/22 2,01 key2 3/1/22 1,71 key2 ... key3 ... SO basically, multiple timeseries (identified by Key) in only one pandas array. Is there a way with some Python library to do a linear regresion and obtain something like: Key Slope Intercept Error key1 ... key2 ... key3 ... I know I can do it series by series, but my question is really, do I have to get the list of all unique keys, and then loop on all the possible keys, and for each, extract the [Date] and [Value] arrays for that particular serie, compute the slope/intercept/error... and iteratively create the resulting table, key by key? Or is there some library that can work with multiple series in one array and understand it is several series?
