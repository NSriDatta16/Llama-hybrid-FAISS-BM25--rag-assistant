Item sampling techniques to reduce processing time for questionnaire

I have a well-crafted draft of a questionnaire, containing 240 items. The average processing time is 20 secs per item, so the entire questionnaire would take around 1 hour 20 min to complete. I want to reduce the estimated processing time down to 30 minutes, to avoid fatigue among participants. Moreover, the questionnaire should be measuring relativity stable aspects of 24 personality facets , which I in turn expect to assemble into 6 factors . I want to find a sampling technique, that allows me to correlate all 240 items without having to give all items to every participant. This data will be used to eject items from the questionnaire, that correlate weakly. Ideally, the gathered data would be suited for factor analysis. In short: How do I decide what items to give to which participant, to end up with a dataset where all items can be pairwise correlated, with only presenting ~ 90 items to each participant? (And how many participants would I require in such a case?)
