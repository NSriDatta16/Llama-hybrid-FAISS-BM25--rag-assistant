To increase accuracy near the boundaries of the parameter space, a common approach is to make a variable transformation $\theta = f(\phi)$, where $f$ maps $[-1,1]$ into $[-\infty,\infty]$, compute the posterior mean of $\theta$, then transform this estimate back to $\phi$. This is equivalent to using Bayesian decision theory where the loss function emphasizes errors near the boundary of the original parameter space.
