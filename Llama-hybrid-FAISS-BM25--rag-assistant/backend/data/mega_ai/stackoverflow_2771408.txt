OpenGL ES 2.0 Rendering with a Texture

The iPhone SDK has an example of using ES 2.0 with a set of (Vertex & Fragment) GLSL shaders to render a varying colored box. Is there an example out there on how to render a simple texture using this API? I basically want to take a quad, and draw a texture onto it. The old ES 1.1 API's don't work at all anymore, so I'm needing a bit of help getting started. Most shader references talk mainly about advanced shading topics, but I'm really unsure about how to tell the shader to use the bound texture, and how to reference the UV's.
