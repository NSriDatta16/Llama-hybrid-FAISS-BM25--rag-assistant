Yes you can, but there are more accurate ways of determining convexity in multivariable twice-differentiable functions by examining second partial derivatives in the Hessian matrix . Yes, it is still a linear model because it maintains linearity in the parameters (so nothing changes): $y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 f_1(x_1) + \theta_2 f_2(x_2) + ...+ \theta_nf_n(x_n)$ Yes, it is still linear model (as already described in 1 and 2). Andrew Ng's take on linear regression is a nonparametric approach whose purpose is to describe some basic concepts of machine learning. If you're interested in understanding the subject in more depth, you probably should look into parametric regression where the focus falls on the underlying probabilistic assumptions rather the optimisation problem. These two views of the same topic reflect, in my opinion, the fundamental differences between machine learning and classical statistical modelling .
