You won't be able to login from https://login.salesforce.com that's only for production. You're correct to use the sandbox instance https://test.salesforce.com (or https://cs1.salesforce.com , https://cs2.salesforce.com , etc.) I'm sure you figured out email@domain.com is your regular username, but the "sandbox" part is the actual name of your sandbox. So if you named your sandbox as "sbx" you would login as joe@example.com.sbx If that doesn't work, go to your production organization where you can login. Navigate to Setup -> Data Management -> Sandbox and then click the Login button next to the sandbox you wish you login to.
