EDIT: what about something simple along these lines: DocumentFragment.prototype.getElementById = function(id) { for(n in this.childNodes){ if(id == n.id){ return n; } } return null; } Why not just use jQuery or the selection API in whatever other lib youre using? AFAIK all the major libs support selection on fragments. If you wan tto skip a larger lib like jQ/Prototype/Dojo/etc.. then you could jsut use Sizzle - its the selector engine that powers jQ and Dojo and its offered as a standalone. If thats out of the question as well then i suppose you could dive in to the Sizzle source and see whats going on. All in all though it seems like alot of effort to avoid a few 100k with the added probaility that the code you come up with is going to be slower runtime wise than all the work pulled into Sizzle or another open source library. http://sizzlejs.com/ Oh also... i think (guessing) jQ's trick is that elements are not out of the DOM. I could be wrong but i think when you do something like: $(' '); Its actually in the DOM document its just not part of the body/head nodes. Could be totally wrong about that though, its just a guess. So you got me curious haha. I took a look at sizzle.. than answer is - its not using DOM methods. It seems using an algorithm that compares the various DOMNode properties mapped to types of selectors - unless im missing something... which is entirely possible :-) However as noted below in comments it seems Sizzle DOES NOT work on DocumentFragments... So back to square one :-)
