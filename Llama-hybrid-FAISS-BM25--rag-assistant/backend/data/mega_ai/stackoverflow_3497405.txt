Create sortables at runtime?

How do we handle connect draggable items that should be connected to sortables when the sortables are created at run time? For example: I create instances of the above sortable ul when the user clicks a button: function onBtnClick1() { var element = $(" "); element.appendTo("#body"); $(".sortable").sortable(); // make it sortable? } Later on the user can generate items to drag and drop into any of the sortables: function onBtnClick2() { var element = $(" Hi there "); element.draggable(); element.draggable("option", "connectToSortable", '.sortable'); } it isn't working though - I basically want to make the draggables above droppable into any ul that has the class type "sortable". What's the right way to do it? Thanks
