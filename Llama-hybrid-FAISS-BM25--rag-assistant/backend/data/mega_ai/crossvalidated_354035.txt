How to Compare the Data Distribution of 2 datasets?

I'm having trouble to understand how to compare 2 sets of data by their distribution . For Example, how can I understand that column X100 has the same distribution as column Y1? Also, is there a way to express the distribution comparison of all columns to all columns? I'm a machine learning developer using python , and this is a part of a classification problem I'm working on. Would appreciate any help.. tnx :)
