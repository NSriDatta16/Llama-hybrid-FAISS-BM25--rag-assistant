You want to set the revert: invalid option on the draggable object which will caused it to snap back if it is dropped onto anything not marked as droppable, so try: $("#35").draggable({revert: "invalid"})); $("myArticle").droppable( "option", "disabled", true ); $("#36").droppable( "option", "disabled", false ); This means you'd be able to drag 35 onto 36 but not onto myarticle. Below is the full page html: $().ready(function() { $("#35").draggable({revert: "invalid"}); $("#36").droppable({disabled: false }); }); drop me here This renders 2 coloured blocks (the divs). You can drag the yellow one (id 35) and drop it only in the square labelled "drop me here". If you wanted to drop it anywhere else, you'd have to decorate that area with droppable Hope this helps
