I tried to configure a proxy with the VM arguments -Dhttp.proxyHost= -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 and now it works. Ah, I didn't realize that xml.xsd is in fact the one referenced as http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd or something like that. That should teach us to always show some XML and XSD fragments as well. ;-) So, am I correct to assume that 1.) to fix the Java 5 issue, you still needed to include Xerces and set the system property, and that 2.) you did not have xml.xsd available locally? Before you found your solution, did you happen to try using getResource rather than getResourceAsStream , to see if the exception would then have showed you some more details? If you actually did have xml.xsd available (so: if getResource did in fact yield a URL) then I wonder what Xerces was trying to fetch from the internet then. Or maybe you did not add that schema to the list prior to adding your own schemas? The order is important: dependencies must be added first. For whoever gets tot his question using the search: maybe using a custom EntityResolver could have indicated the source of the problem as well (if only writing something to the log and just returning null to tell Xerces to use the default behavior).
