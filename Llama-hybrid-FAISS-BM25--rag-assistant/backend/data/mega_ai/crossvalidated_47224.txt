Applying log-transformation when comparing two populations

I have a survey data containing two samples drawing from two populations (or the same population but at different time series). Based on these two samples, I would like to estimate the total and its confidence intervals for each population. Since my sample distributions are highly skewed and both sample sizes are small. The recommended method is to first apply log-transform to the original data and compute CI in the log domain. However, since log-transform is nonlinear, i noticed that in the original domain sum(sample_1)>sum(sample_2), while in the log domain sum(log(sample_1)) is smaller than sum(log(sample_2)). Can someone help me with this situation? Shall I still use the data in log domain. If the purpose of the study is to compare the total, or even further to use the data in prediction, using the original and log domain would give different results? Thanks!
