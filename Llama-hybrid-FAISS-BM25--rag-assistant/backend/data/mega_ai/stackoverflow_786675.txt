The process of developing Unicode included the Han Unification. This is because a lot of the Japanese characters are derived from, or the same as, Chinese characters; similarly with Korean. There are some characters (katakana and hiragana - see chapter 12 of the Unicode standard v5.1.0) commonly used in Japanese that would indicate that the text was Japanese rather than Chinese, but I believe it would be a statistical test rather than definitive. Check out the O'Reilly book on CJKV Information Processing (CJKV is short for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese; I have the CJK predecessor lurking somewhere). There's also the O'Reilly book on Unicode Explained which may be some help, though probably not for this question (I don't recall a discussion of how to identify Japanese and Chinese text).
