Killing processes in Erlang by PIDs

I am implementing a chat server in Erlang . According to my design, each client has a corresponding agent process on the server node that handles the messages. I am writing the PIDs of the agents into database so that I can exchange messages between them. Is it safe when I kill the PIDs? For example, after my server restarts, the PIDs are still in the database (but the processes will die), will there be chances that the PIDs in the database clash with some other (newly created) important processes? If so I cannot simply kill the agent when the client is not responding. So far, I have not observed it, but it would be nice to know for sure.
