Confused about Function Approximation for Q Learning

I am not sure that I understood Funtion approximation for Q Learning. So basicall with FA we don't use tables anymore? Each state is now represented with features, and we multiply those features with weights to get a Q value. So the weights are what we are trying to optimize with various functions. I saw examples with linear funtions but not with other functions. My first question is, how do we chose features? Do we have to hard code them, or is htere a way to generate features? Is Q learning with Neural Networks function appriximation? Thank you, sorry if those questions may seem trivial.
