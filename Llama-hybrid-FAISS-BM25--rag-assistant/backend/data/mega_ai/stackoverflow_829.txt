I'm guessing that because you want to set it for all users, that you're on some kind of shared computer, which is probably running under a domain? HERE BE DRAGONS Let's say Joe and Jane regularly log onto the computer, then they will each have 'registries'. You'll then install your app, and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things to set items under HKCU for them. THEN, bob will come along and log on (he, and 500 other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this). He's never used this computer before, so he has no registry. The first time he logs in, windows creates him one, but he won't have your setting. Your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly, and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated. The correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app, which can write them to the registry if it doesn't find them. It's general good practice that your app should never depend on the registry, and should create things as needed, for any registry entry, not just HKCU, anyway
