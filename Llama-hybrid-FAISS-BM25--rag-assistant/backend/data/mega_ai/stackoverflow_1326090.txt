I'm surprised that 60k lines of code take 2 minutes to compile. I have an application that is 500,000 lines of code, and it only takes about a minute and a half. Make sure you are not doing full rebuilds each time, and make sure you are not cleaning the solution between builds. A normal build should perform an incremental build, only recompiling code that has changed since the last build (along with anything affected by that change.) Perhaps some other factors might include heavy use of large resources (images?), broad-sweeping changes in the lowest level libraries (i.e. those used by everything else), etc. Generally speaking, on a relatively modern machine, compiling 60,000 lines of C# code should take less than a minute on average, unless you are rebuilding the entire solution.
