HTML5 includes support for embedding data in attributes which is backwards compatible. Here's an example: John says: Hello, how are you? Useragents will perhaps implement the .dataset idea into javascript, which would easily let you pull out the data bits seperately, but for now just changing your classes to include data- is good enough. This will validate as HTML5. To me this is far better than that metadata jquery idea - that just seems dumb to me. See here for more info.
