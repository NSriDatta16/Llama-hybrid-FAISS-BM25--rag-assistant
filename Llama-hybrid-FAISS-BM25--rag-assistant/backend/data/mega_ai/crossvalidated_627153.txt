Hypothesis testing in moderation analysis after Propensity Score Matching

I would like to perform a moderation analysis after Propensity Score Matching with a binary outcome model. I estimate a logistic regression outcome model (following this vignette). I am wondering, whether the hypothesis test I perform (hypothesis = "pairwise") to compare the subgroup ATTs is the correct specification when using a logistic regression model and Risk Ratios. match_data_exact Term Contrast male Estimate Pr(\>|z|) 2.5 % 97.5 %. treatment ln(mean(1) / mean(0)) 1 0.786 0.0641 0.609 1.014. treatment ln(mean(1) / mean(0)) 0 0.729 0.0120 0.569 0.933. Columns: term, contrast, male, estimate, p.value, conf.low, conf.high Term Estimate Pr(\>|z|) 2.5 % 97.5 %. 1 - 0 1.08 0.623 0.798 1.46. Columns: term, estimate, p.value, conf.low, conf.high
