That would seem to be the idea, but obviously it's still perfectly possible to inherit from the classes if you want (even if they were in a separate module, you can do type(Event()) to get a reference. It presumably is just intended to make people think before subclassing them. It's not a common pattern in Python. There are very few things that we specifically discourage inheriting from.
