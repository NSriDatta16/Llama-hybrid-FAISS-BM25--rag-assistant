Seti@Home kind of frameworks

Are there any client-server frameworks similar to SETI available ? I have such client-server model, where volunteers sign up as client (agent or node, call it whatever) and give their idle computing resources. So I will need to write a framework to distribute and track the work-units (or jobs) given to agents. Is there any such FW available which i could go for. Then I save time to write the job processing logic etc. Further, I hope the framework will also support the OS compatibility issues, agent binaries updates etc. Pl. give any other suggestions in general on such distributed computing project you think I should investigate.
