The interrupted time series, being a regression model which adjusts for time as a covariate, is amenable to use of robust sandwich-based standard errors. The sandwich is documented in more detail elsewhere on this site and in software, but basically it uses the residuals themselves to form a heteroscedasticity-consistent estimator of the variance of regression parameters.
