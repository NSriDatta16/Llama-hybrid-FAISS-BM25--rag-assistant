How to deal with temporary storage of uploaded files

In my django application I have a multi step registration, with few conditional parameters. Because of this I figured out to store data from forms in session. Unfortunatelly sessions serialize data using pickle, which doesn't support file serialization and causes PicklingError: Can't pickle : attribute lookup cStringIO.StringO failed . How to get around this problem ? Should I send image as a variable to all following views, or send it as a GET parameter or do it in some other way ? I'm not sure if any sample code is needed since problems seems pretty clear.
