Likert scale questionnaire and logistic regression

I have three independent variables , and one moderating variable. I'm studying the affect of these variables on the decision to adopt electronic commerce. I have a questionnaire, based on this questionnaire which is on a 7-point likert scale (from totally disagree which is coded 1 to totally agree which is coded 7). I have gathered data on on my three independent variables. Now I want to analyze the model. Question is should I calculate mean for every IVs and then do the logistic regression?
