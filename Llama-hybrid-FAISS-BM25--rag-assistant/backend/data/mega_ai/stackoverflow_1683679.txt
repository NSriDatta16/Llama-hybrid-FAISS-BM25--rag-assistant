In ASP.NET how can I dynamically add a formatting tag?

I have the following on an ASP.NET page: My Text Sometimes in code I need to be able to dynamically add a STRONG tag around the hyperlink so that it looks like this: My Text Is there some elegant way to do this in code? I know I could get it done using Literals but I just wondered if there was some special method that I didn't know about that allowed you to insert tags like that. Thanks, Corey
