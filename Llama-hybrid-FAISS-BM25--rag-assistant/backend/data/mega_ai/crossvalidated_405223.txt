Logistic regression model is ignoring most of my conditons

So I have a logistic regression model in R with 2 variables, year (integer-10 values) and faculty (factor with 2 levels). For some of my year/faculty conditions, the number of successes were the same as the total number of cases (i.e proportion = 1.0). So when I produce my model is it ignoring these cases, and the model is significantly under predicting. How can I fix this?
