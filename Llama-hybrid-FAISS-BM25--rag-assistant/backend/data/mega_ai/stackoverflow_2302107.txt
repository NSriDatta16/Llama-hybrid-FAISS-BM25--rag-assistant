tfoot is a valid HTML element, though rarely used. It is supported by all browsers. Here's a related compatibility table . See 11.2.3 Row groups: the THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY elements in the w3c spec. Important point from the spec: TFOOT must appear before TBODY within a TABLE definition so that user agents can render the foot before receiving all of the (potentially numerous) rows of data.
