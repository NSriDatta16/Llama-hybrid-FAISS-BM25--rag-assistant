When it comes to hyperparameter tuning, automatic tuners such as keras tuner is the way to go. Specially consider using Bayesian optimization, since it can relatively outperform the other methods such as Grid and Radnom search. PS: Be sure to set the initial random points of the Bayesian Optimizer very high (at least 30, even higher if you have a really big hyperspace) to ensure that Bayesian Optimizer has enough prior data to build the surrogate model.
