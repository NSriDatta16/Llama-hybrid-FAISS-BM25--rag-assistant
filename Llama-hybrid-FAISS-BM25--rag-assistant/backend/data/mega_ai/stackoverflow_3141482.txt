Short answer : There's no simple way to do it. Long answer An entity framework model is described using 3 sub-languages - SSDL, CSDL and MSL. At the conceptual level ( CSDL ) - the property element 's type would be the place to this. A property element's type can be either one of the predefined EDMSimpleType values, or a ComplexType, which is a collection of ComplexType and EDMSimpleType elements. The CSDL level is not the place to do this. The mapping level ( MSL ) just matches storage elements and conceptual elements. There's no place here to do this. We're left with the storage level ( SSDL ). SSDL property element 's type is not strictly defined in MSDN, and in any case it might be possible to override the provider layer to give different functionality for existing types. But, it's not trivial and not recommended. Conclusion : There's no practical way to add new scalar types (other than a straight forward collection of simple types, i.e. ComplexType).
