How to predict how the time series behaves in the future?

I was wondering how a statistician estimates how a time series continues. Namely, which is more accurate way to estimate the series? Draw a line between start and end points of the time series data and use the value that the line shows from the future estimate. Use more sophisticated methods like ARIMA models. What are pros and cons between those two methods?
