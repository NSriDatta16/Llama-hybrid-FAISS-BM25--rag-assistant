Inside the try you could use: Office_Cp = (OfficeCPS)Page.LoadControl(@"/_controltemplates/OfficeCP/OfficeCP.ascx"); this.Controls.Add(Office_Cp); Office_Cp.prodDataList = SelectedList; If this doesn't work pay careful attention to how you are handling the ASP.NET lifecycle . Also note it would be better practice to hide prodDataList behind a property or method.
