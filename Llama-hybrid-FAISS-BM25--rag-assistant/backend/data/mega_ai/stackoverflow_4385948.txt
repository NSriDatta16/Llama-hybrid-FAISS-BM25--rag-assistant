How to avoid issues when embedding a TForm in another TForm?

I often embed a TForm descendant into another TForm descendant like this: var Form1: TForm1; Form2: TForm2; begin Form2.Parent := Form1; Form2.BorderStyle := bsNone; Form2.Align := alClient; Form2.Show; end; Usually this works just fine, but sometimes the controls in Form2 are not aligned properly. Is there a general workaround for this sort of problem? Does anybody know what is causing this "misalignment"? I know that I could use TFrame for this kind of job, but I have a lot of library code that I would have to rewrite and I do not see any reason why the TForm in TForm approach should not work? Edit: I have identified the component TcxListView as the culprit here, I have submitted a bug report to the component vendor (DevExpress): http://www.devexpress.com/issue=B194161 Edit 2: The developers at DevExpress have analyzed the problem and said that it is actually a defect in the TGridPanel component by Embarcadero: http://qc.embarcadero.com/wc/qcmain.aspx?d=90324
