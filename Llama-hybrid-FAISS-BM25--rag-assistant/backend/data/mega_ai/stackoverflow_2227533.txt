Given that it's a simple REST API (for example, see http://support.recurly.com/faqs/api/accounts ), I'd just replicate the ruby library in Java, it should be simple enough, could get you some karma on recurly guys if you can/will share it back and will avoid any integration or compatibility problems that might arise using an external daemon or jruby or thrift (the more components you add to your code, the more fragile it gets.) Not necessarily the quickest but the safest route IMO. See here for what to use to implement the library if you deem it necessary.
