There are scenarios , though I will grant that many of them are a bit esoteric, where the bootstrap is not consistent. For instance: parameters involving ranks , or when a parameter is at the boundary of a space . The bootstrap can be tricky, or inefficient to implement with non-iid data. For instance, with clustered data, one is forced to resample the highest-level of clustering. To get efficient estimates of confidence intervals, under the hood of many bootstrap estimators is something that looks like a classical estimator, for instance the studentized bootstrap. Of note, one can't just naively take the 2.5% and 97.5% percentile of the bootstrapped statistic in the resampled data and expect good coverage.
