JQuery Sortable Accordion moving to top with code

I am building a sortable accordion with jquery which works perfectly fine but I want it so when someone clicks on on of the items in the accordion and it opens up that it is automatically moved to the top of the list without the person having to drag it to the top. Is that possible to code?
