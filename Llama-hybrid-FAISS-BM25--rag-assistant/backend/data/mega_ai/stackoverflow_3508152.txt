I've written this answer before: How to flick through a deck of cards? The summary: Once hitTest:withEvent: returns a non-nil value, it's over (by default); that view "owns" the touch (see UITouch.view). Only that view gets touchesBegan/Moved/Ended/Cancelled:withEvent: callbacks. The touches are being grabbed by AFItemView, so AFOpenFlowView never gets touch events. It may be easier to add the necessary touch-handling to AFOpenFlowView instead. Alternatively, you can implement touch-forwarding in AFOpenFlowView. It's a bit tricky to get right.
