Confusion related to bayesian spatial scan statistics

I was reading this paper related to bayesian spatial scan statistics. http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips18/NIPS2005_0513.pdf . It's said that when we use bayesian spatial scan statistics, we don't need to use the randomization testing or significance testing of the found potential cluster. Why is it so? I didn't get it. Any insights on this?
