Is it a thumb rule that the number of rows should be more than the square of the number of features. And also does number of features depend on the number of unique classes you have No. Can we do feature selection once we do sparse term removal. You can, but depending on your choice of classification algorithm might not be necessary. Support vector machines, for example, don't need feature selection and are very good for text classification. Which one gives good result dimension reduction or feature selection. PCA is a good first choice for dimensionality reduction.
