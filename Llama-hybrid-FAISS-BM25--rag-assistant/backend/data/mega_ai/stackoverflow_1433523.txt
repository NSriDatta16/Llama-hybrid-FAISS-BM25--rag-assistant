Interfacing R to Java

Is rjava the only way to connect R to Java? I am asking because there is a disclaimer at the end of the web page: This interface uses Java reflection API to find the correct method so it is much slower and may not be right (works for simple examples but may not for more complex ones). For now its use is discouraged in programs as it may change in the future. This is slightly concerning. How do you address this issue? I know that Rweka has a self-contained interface, so I may look into that package, but maybe many R users have already gone through the pains.
