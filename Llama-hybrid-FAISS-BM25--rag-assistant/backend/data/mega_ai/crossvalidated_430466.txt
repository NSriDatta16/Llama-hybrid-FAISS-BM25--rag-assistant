Can I exponentiate the log-Bayes factor to get the Bayes factor?

Simple question here. I'm using Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis and I can get a log-Bayes Factor with the Laplace approximation. However, I'm wondering whether I can just exponentiate this value and get the "normal" Bayes factor? Thanks for any help! Cheers, Pedro
