I feel like some good things may come from Perl 6 (e.g. parrot), but I'm not counting on ever doing anything with the language. In the bioinformatics development group where I work, we're encouraging use of Python for new development where Perl would have been the language of choice in the past. Python appears to provide a better path forward for us.
