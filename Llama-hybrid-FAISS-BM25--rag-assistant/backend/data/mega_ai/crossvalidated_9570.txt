A very similar example is used in the tutorial of PyMC. If you assume that the daily amount of requests was constant until some point in time (maybe exactly Christmas) and after that it was constant again, all you need to do is substitute the numbers in the example: http://pymc.googlecode.com/svn/doc/tutorial.html As this is the Bayesian approach you won't (easily) get p values. However, the size of the step down and its credible interval (this is a Bayesian interval, similar to a confidence interval) may be equally useful.
