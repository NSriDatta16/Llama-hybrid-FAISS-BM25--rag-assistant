If your time series appears to be stationary and highly periodic, it should be worthwhile to analyse its characteristics in the frequency domain. Even if your purpose is not prediction, this post on time-series-analysis-and-order-prediction-r may get you started on how to use neural networks for signal decomposition in the frequency domain, using the most flexible software. For non-stationary time series, search more on wavelets after checking out this post on Wavelet Spectrogram Non-Stationary Financial Time Series analysis using R .
