The resource requests and other DevTools/WebInspector related data is collecting by InspectorController and it's agents. (it just C++ code) After that all the data is pushing into WebInspector as JS calls of WebInspector object's methods. As you probably know all the DevTools/WebInspector's GUI is an html page and a lot of JavaScript. You can try to investigate the internal world of Inspector by Inspector itself. start Chrome with flag --process-per-tab; open Inspector window in undocked mode; press Ctrl-Shift-I in Inspector window. All the traffic between Inspector and inspected page are passing via two functions: from Inspector to inspected page - sendMessageToBackend from inspected page to Inspector - devtools$$dispatch You can track the latest changes for WebInspector in WebKit via this link .
