Firstly you should probably be creating models of classes/segments of users (unsupervised clustering). Otherwise it is difficult to predict what a given user will do. (More on that further below.) Nextly, I think "deviation from recent transactions" is also fundamentally flawed. Most likely there are time patterns (time of day, days of the week, working hours, holidays and so on). To understand how to conceptualise time as useful features, see this excellent answer on Machine learning - features engineering from date/time data And similarly there are amount patterns, partly having to do with practical reasons (eg by withdrawing 38, one can receive 20, 10, 5 and 1 denominations, although this is not possible in some markets, like the USA). Modelling the user is more complicated. You will likely not have enough data on each user, but you can build some user models. (Too few, then the system will make similar predictions for all users, without nuance - eg > $400 always detected as fraud. Too many and there will be sparsity, overfitting, and generally the same problems as having no profile models at all, ie one model per actual user - eg fraud incorrectly detected at every time a given user goes to a new ATM.) This is basically unsupervised clustering. (Search for user profile categorisation, user models, user model clustering) Much depends on the data available to you. Perhaps you can be more specific about the scale and scope. In any case, I wish you luck - banks/Visa do this very poorly right now.
