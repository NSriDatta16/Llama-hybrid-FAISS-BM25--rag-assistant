To train a CNN model with dataset images be it in hundreds or thousands, you need a good processing capacity or infrastructure on your system. With normal configuration say 4 GB RAM, you can go ahead and train the model with hundreds of images and it works fine and you can validate and test your data as well. Alternately, you can also try Google colaboratory for your CNN model algorithm by connecting it to hosted runtime, as it assigns 12GB RAM to individual user.
