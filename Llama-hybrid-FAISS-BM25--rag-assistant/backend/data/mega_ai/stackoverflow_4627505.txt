So, the CSV solution was not very ideal for me because I needed to format the data. What I ended up doing was changing the first line of the above code to this: System.Text.Encoding enc = Encoding.UTF8; byte[] data = enc.GetBytes(excelData); UTF8 was the ONLY byte encoding that would correctly display my HTML tables in Excel 2007 with one caveat - for some reason even though it was now using UTF-8 it was not correctly displaying special characters. The fix for this was to add this before beginning my HTML tables in the ExcelData text I was exporting: I'm not sure why it required the same encoding in 2 different spots to get everything working correctly. There are probably much better ways to go about exporting to Excel than HTML tables but this is a quick and easy solution for a problem that doesn't require anything elegant. Hopefully, this can help some others as well.
