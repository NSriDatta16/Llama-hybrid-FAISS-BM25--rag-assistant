The problem with the inheritance argument is that you'll either have a gigantic god class or a hierarchy so deep, it'll make your head spin. On top of that, you'll end up with methods on a class you don't need or don't make any sense. I see a lot of "no multiple inheritance" and while that's true, it probably won't phase your team because you can have multiple levels of inheritance to get what they'd want. An IDisposable implementation comes to mind. Your team would put a Dispose method on the Object class and let it propagate through the system whether or not it made sense for an object or not.
