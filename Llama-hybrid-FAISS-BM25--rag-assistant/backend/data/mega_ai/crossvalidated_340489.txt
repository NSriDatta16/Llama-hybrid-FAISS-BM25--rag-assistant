interpretation of deviance in logistic model

In logistic regression model for binary data, If the residual deviance(2*(likelihood of saturated model-likelihood of my model)) is 56.728 with df=117, what can I say about the lack of fit of the model? I don't know whether the deviance should be small, or similar to the degree of freedom when the model fits well.
