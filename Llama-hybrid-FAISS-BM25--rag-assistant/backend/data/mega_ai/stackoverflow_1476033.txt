It does not work because you do not implements the interface properly. The siganture of your method n scala must be: def bar[T](c:Class[T]):T You can fix the behaviour for String only if you want ton implements Foo. Third try, according to our discussion: def bar[T](c:Class[T]):T = { // Some stuff val o:Any = myUntypedFunction(env) c.cast(o) } According to the context the myUntypedFunction will create an object, and then you use the class parameter to cast your result and obtain a T object. Once again: this behavior is the same in java and in scala.
