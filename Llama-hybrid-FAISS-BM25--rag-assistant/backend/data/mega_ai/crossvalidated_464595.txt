Bayesian prior that two parameters are identical/similar, but no information on their values?

Given two coins with respective biases $\mu_a$ and $\mu_b$ , suppose that we have no information on their biases, but we believe that the two biases are identical or similar. Is there a standard/natural Bayesian way to encode this belief? One possible approach I can think of is to do this hierarchically, something like: $\mu_z\sim Uniform(0,1)$ $\sigma\sim \ldots$ $\mu_a \sim TruncatedNormal(mu=\mu_z, \sigma, range=[0,1])$ $\mu_b \sim TruncatedNormal(mu=\mu_z, \sigma, range=[0,1])$ Ideally, it would be great to have something that yields an estimator for e.g. $\mu_a$ that is a weighted combination of the MLE for $\mu_a$ and the MLE for the overall $\frac{\#heads}{\#flips}$ of the two coins together, something like: $\hat{\mu}_{a} = \frac{\#heads_a + \sigma \cdot \frac{\#heads_a + \#heads_b}{\#flips_a + \#flips_b}}{\#flips_a + \pi}$ where $\sigma$ is a prior parameter that captures the strength of our belief that the two coins' biases are similar. But is there a standard Bayesian approach here, or some distributions that are typically used?
