Is this Bayesian?

I can't tell if I'm calculating this properly, I don't think it's a Bayesian question but I'm new to it so I'm not too sure. I have a sample of 30 people. Out of the 30, 90% do not use heroin (so 10% do). Those who do heroin, do it two days a week. If I were to as someone randomly whether they do heroin, what would be the probability that that person did it the day before? This is what I did. So (30*.1)=3 people do it. The chance of those 1 of those people doing heroin during the week is (2/7) so for all 3 people it'd be (6/7). But after that I'm stumped. Could someone help clarify this for me?
