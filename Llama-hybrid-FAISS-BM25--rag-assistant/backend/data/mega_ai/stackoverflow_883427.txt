You set the DataSource (or even the DataContext) of the grid to your Observable Collection. I'm not familiar with that data grid, but most grids have options to either expose all public properties of the type in the Observable Collection as columns, or you explicitly set a column layout in XAML and one of the properties of the column definition is the property of the the object to use for the column data. e.g. with Infragistics Data Grid Name is where you set the property on the object to use.
