share memory between dll in the same process

I have a class named CMemCfg which is a singleton, the CMemCfg class has a lot of data members which storage configuration data . If I put CMemCfg in server.exe, then other dlls should uesd callback function to visit function(get data from data members) in CMemCfg . So I want to put the CMemCfg class(also a singleton) in a dll, but that will cause another problem, every function of CMemCfg should have an export function which lead to duplication of code. Should I just export CMemCfg(singleton) class? Is there another solution to share memory between dll in the same process? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
