How often do you update the gems on an unreleased project?

I've got several side projects that are either still in dev or live for friends and family. The exception ( modulecounts.com ) is pretty trivial. At work, in a larger organization, it seems like we always make rules against updating gems too often. It becomes a story that's scheduled for a particular sprint. It has to be coordinated with Ops to make sure they'll be ready to update the production environment, etc. All that coordination overhead is gone when I'm the only dev, but there's still risk in updating gems. Maybe those new versions won't work quite right. So... is it better to do it all the time? Start each dev session with "gem update" and go from there? Or should I wait until I'm about to go live and do one big update, hoping that any time lost on the back end is made up for by not having lost time in little increments throughout development? What do you do? What's the happy medium?
