Solaris: Mounting a file system on an application's handlers

When mounting an NFS filesystem, all data handling goes through the nfs client. How can I write my own handlers to use something other than NFS? An alternative would be a localhost NFS server but that seams awfully inefficient Edit Example of what should happen Normally with a filesystem you get: app reads/writes filesystem, Solaris sees where it is mounted and if it is disk then it reads/writes the disk. If it is software mirror it reads and writes to the mirror software. If it it is NFS it reads and writes to a remote NFS server. I want it to read and write to a custom storage software instead of any of the above mentioned options. Our storage software is for storing files that applications use, it is geared towards large or frequently replaced chunks of data that are not stored in a database. It also includes certain flexibility specific to our company. Old/existing applications don't know about our new software. All they know to do is read/write a directory. We could tell Solaris that the directory was hosted on NFS and then the NFS server translates and connects to the storage software. We would prefer to tell Solaris about our new program which Solaris has never heard of and then teach Solaris how to talk to our program.
