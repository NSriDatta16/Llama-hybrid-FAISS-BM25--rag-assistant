Exploring if headcount in servicedesk does have an impact on resolution time - multiple linear regression?

I would like to check with you if my issue can be solved by statistics and multiple linear regression? I have data from servicedesk about issues reported in last 2 years. I got a task to prepare a tool to do what-if forecast - management wants to know if they change headcount resolution time will also change. My idea is to do regression with various variables - from the data I have I decided that following things could have an impact on average time to resolve: how many people resolved incidents in certain period of time (I don't have any HR data, I can only base on issue data I have) how many incidents were closed how many people issue tickets in time how many new tickets come in time My plan was to check if there is a correlation between those variables and if yes calculate a reggresion function and then create a tool in PowerBi that can allow to management to insert a field with e.g. number of employees that is 20% higher that curretn and check if average time is shorter and if they want to hire additiona people. Is this approach a good one? Should I pay attention to something? Have you heard about similar example/case study that I could read to try to use in my case?
