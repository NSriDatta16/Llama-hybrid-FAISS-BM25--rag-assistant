As with all probability theory , conditional probability has nothing to do with Bayesian vs frequentist statistics. Even Bayes' theorem is not “Bayesian”, but is a general theorem about probability, e.g. it can be used to correct probabilities for the base rate , without any priors, or subjective Bayesian interpretation for probability . If you ask "what is the probability of getting the job of database engineer given that you are a female?", or "what is the probability that you have HIV given that the Western blot test was positive?", then you ask about conditional probabilities. Logistic regression models conditional probability, etc. See also Is there any *mathematical* basis for the Bayesian vs frequentist debate? and Bayesian vs frequentist Interpretations of Probability
