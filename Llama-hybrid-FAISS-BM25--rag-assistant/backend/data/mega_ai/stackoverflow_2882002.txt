Is there a way to organize a icon collection to allow for easy searching?

Is there any way of organizing a icon collection so that it easier to find needed icons? For example: the program needs a save icon there are 5 icons collections on your HD that have a save icon and there are 5 more collections that don't have a save icon (but you don't know that) do you browse through each icon collection? run a search (assumes files are named consistently)? Would it be ideal to have some sort of organized directory (printable?)? UPDATE My process so far: Use XXCopy to merge all icon folders into one folder. Syntax = xxcopy "C:\Documents and Settings\jm\My Documents\Icons" "C:\Documents and Settings\jm\My Documents\All_Icons" /s /sr Use Contact Sheets to add all files from the super folder and then export out contact sheets for all the images. This should sort them alphabetically. Print and put in a binder -> now to find the actual file all you need to do is browse the binder, find the filename, and then search via Windows for the actual folder location.
