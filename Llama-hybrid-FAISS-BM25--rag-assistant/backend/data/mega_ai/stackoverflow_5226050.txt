Can I include jQuery and AJAX in the same file? Would this conflict?

Can I include jQuery and AJAX in the same file? Would this conflict? I am attempting to include jQuery with a Magento GO template, but when I upload and include jQuery in the template, the drop down menus/etc. stop working. The links all still work fine, but the dropdown menus, and other similar functionality stop working... I believe this may be because Magento includes AJAX in the hosted solution on their end..?
