Off the shelf, the various software offerings from SSI may do what you want. If I wanted to enforce the constraint, and I didn't have too much data, then I'd switch into a BUGS / JAGS MCMC framework for modelling. I'd use the LSAT example in book 2 of the worked examples (contained in the JAGS distribution or as a separate download from the BUGS people) as the code for standard '3 parameter' IRT model. Then I'd add a line imposing the parameter constraint as described on p.35 of the current JAGS manual. I'd then curl up with a good book, since convergence on such models tends to take ages. Or I might not bother. Standard errors for such parameters tend to be pretty tiny for a respectable number of subjects, so the ordering constraint may not make any difference to your estimation certainty. And if your parameters end up sitting on top of one another, they're probably trying to tell you your prior is wrong.
