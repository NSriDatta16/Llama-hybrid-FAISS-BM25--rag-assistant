Well.. You haven't given us very much information, but there are two things you need to do to connect and query to a database. For phpbb, you may want to read the documentation they have presented: http://wiki.phpbb.com/Database_Abstraction_Layer Here is a general overview of how you'd execute a query: include($phpbb_root_path . 'includes/db/mysql.' . $phpEx); $db = new dbal_mysql(); // we're using bertie and bertiezilla as our example user credentials. You need to fill in your own ;D $db->sql_connect('localhost', 'bertie', 'bertiezilla', 'phpbb', '', false, false); $sql = "INSERT INTO (rest of sql statement)"; $result = $db->sql_query($sql);
