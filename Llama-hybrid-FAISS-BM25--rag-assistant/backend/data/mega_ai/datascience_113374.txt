**tokens when tokens is a dictionary

Trying to understand the code from https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/measuring-text-similarity-using-bert/ I am looking at understanding the syntax on these two lines: token['input_ids'] = torch.stack(token['input_ids']) token['attention_mask'] = torch.stack(token['attention_mask']) output = model(**token) output.keys() What does **tokens do? I can't seem to print it, or debug its value. I get a Syntax Error exception I am familiar with the role of **arg in function calls, where it changes an expression like (a=1, b=2) to a dictionary like {'a':1, 'b':2} , but what does it do when the expression is already a dictionary? Or am I misunderstanding something here?
