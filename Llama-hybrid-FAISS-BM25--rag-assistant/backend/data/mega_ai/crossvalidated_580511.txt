Binary classification optimized on the top 1000 samples

I am creating a binary classification model for marketing purposes: which customers are more likely to buy the product, whom should be contacted by the sales. I don't need a model that is good on the entire test dataset, I only need one that works very good on the top 1000 samples because that is the limitation of the sales agents. I used cost-sensitive (the data is imbalanced) Xgboost model with ndcg@1000 eval_metric. But it only has an effect on the number of trees. Do you know any method or model type that can be used to optimize on the top samples? Top 1000 meaning: I take the prediction scores and sort them according to the given scores. Top 1000 samples are the samples with the 1000 highest scores. Bonus question: Now I'm facing a problem, where out of 40.000 customers ony 5-8 are interested in the product. Do you think some anomaly detection model could be used here? The problem is that these customers don't vary that much to pick any outlier. Thank you in advance!
