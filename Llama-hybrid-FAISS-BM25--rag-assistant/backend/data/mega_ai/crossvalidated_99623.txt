I think that there are objective and subjective probabilities. The objective probabilities are associated with physical phenomena such as radioactive decay , which is a stochastic process that has nothing to do with your presence at all. Whether you know about the decay or not, the decay process goes at its own pace, and has been going on before humans even existed. The rate of decay is related to the probabilities, objective ones. The concept probability of life elsewhere in the universe could also be cast as the objective probability. For instance, we figured out how life originates, and we know enough about this Universe to figure out what is the probability that given this Universe life has originated in it. However, this particular concept is not cast this way, because we don't know nearly enough about origination of life and this Universe. Hence, our statements regarding this probability are based on our limited knowledge, and on what we know about the limits of our knowledge, thus we're talking about subjective probabilities. Subjectively, I may think that it's 50/50, and there is no way to prove or disprove me. The confusion is from that Bayes theorem . It works fine with objective probabilities, and it is the basis of the treatment of subjective probabilities too. That's why Bayesian people often don't understand the objective probabilities, they think all probabilities are subjective; they like to talk about "beliefs", for example. UPDATE: Monty Hall problem is an excellent example of subjective probabilities, and the power of Bayesian approach. You don't know where the money bag is, but it is certainly behind one of the three doors. So, when we attach a probability of 1/3 in the beginning, it is simply a statement about the state of our knowledge with regards to a money bag, and not about the actual location of the money bag. So, when you learn how Bayesian approach works on these problems, you tend to get carried away and start thinking that everything's relative to our knowledge. This is not the case with a real world. For instance, consider a wave function $\Psi(x,t)$ in quantum mechanics. The probability that a particle is in $x$ at time $t$ is $P=|\Psi(x,t)|^2$. This is not that we do not know where the particle is exactly, and that at some point we'll figure it out. No, this is an objective probability, that's how Nature works: it throws the dice.
