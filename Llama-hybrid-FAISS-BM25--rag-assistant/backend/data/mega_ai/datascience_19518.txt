Backtracking the updater source code, it looks like "extra nodes" are calculated this way: At each boosting stage, looking at the gradient boost tree, Extra Nodes = (the total number of nodes) - (the number of start roots) - (the number of deleted nodes) At each boosting stage, there might be different starting roots (sub trees) and different deleted (so far) nodes. The extra nodes can provide some intuition into how much your processing tree is utilized. updater_prune.cc tree_model.h xgboost "train" api
