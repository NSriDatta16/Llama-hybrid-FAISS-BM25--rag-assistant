How I can make Markov chain model by training data?

I have to produce Markov chain model by training given data. Data is available at website http://www.ll.mit.edu/ideval/data/ . I am trying to make Markov chain model given in IEEE paper Nong Ye, Senior Member, IEEE, Yebin Zhang, and Connie M. Borror '*Robustness of the Markov-Chain Model for Cyber-Attack Detection'*pp. 116-123 . Markov Chain model considers 1-step transition probabilities. Markov chain model depends on Transition probability matrix. So how I can form Markov Chain model?
