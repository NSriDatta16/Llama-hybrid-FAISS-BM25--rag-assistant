How should I represent validity of a population prediction?

I am looking to report on the validity of a predictive non-linear population model for which I only have the output prediction p(t) and the time for which the prediction applies t Now, over the time period t predicted by the model, I have the actual measurement m(t) With the series p1, p2, p3, ... pN how should I appropriately represent correlation to the measurement m1, m1, m3, ... mN ? My initial approach was to obtain the percent difference between the estimate and the observation ( (pN - mN)/mN and then obtain the average variation of this set. This seemed naive to me. I don't know if there's a more "generally accepted" method for population estimates. The model predicts what the value will be over time. During that same time we make actual measurements of the values so that, after the period, we can compare the prediction to the measurement. I'm looking for how I should represent the "quality" of the predictive model.
