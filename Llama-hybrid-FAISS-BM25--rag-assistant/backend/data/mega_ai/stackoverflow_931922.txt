Unified Customer and Admin Accounts in Magento

Is there anyway to pass a customer session to the admin side and vice versa? For example... what if I want to unify some customer and admin accounts (for some very special users =) Usecase: Redirect a user from the customer dashboard to the admin dashboard via a link. Assume username and password are already synced. I've been experimenting with this, by creating an admin session in the customer controller (pulling code from adminhtml/Controller/Action.php and adminhtml/controllers/IndexController.php). Then I reroute the request to the adminhtml controller. The singleton admin/session that I create and populate with data doesn't seem to persist once the request is routed... any ideas?
