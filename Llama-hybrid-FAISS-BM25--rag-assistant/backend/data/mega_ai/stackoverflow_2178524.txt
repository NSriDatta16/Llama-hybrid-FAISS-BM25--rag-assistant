ASP.NET MVC : Update member's LastSeen

I want to know rough time when a member was last seen in the system. I remember login for 2 weeks. So actual "ValidateUser" on MembershipProvider can be executed quite infrequently. For now I just call DB.UpdateMembershipLastSeenTime() every time from RequireAuthorizationAttribute , i.e. on every authentication-requiring action. Any recommendations/critique? Framework: ASP.NET MVC 2.0 RC, IIS 7.0 (integrated mode), custom membership provider with storage in MS SQL 2008.
