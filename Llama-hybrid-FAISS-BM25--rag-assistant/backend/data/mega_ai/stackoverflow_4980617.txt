Line feeds in Eclipse layout XML

When the new project wizard creates a skeleton layout, the XML is nicely formatted with linefeeds for easy review. But when I use the graphical layout form of the layout editor and drag an object into the layout, the resulting XML is all on one line. How can I get the Eclipse graphical layout editor to insert linefeeds? I know I can do it manually, but that gets old real fast. I have tried all the reasonable options in Windows > Preferences > XML > Editor.
