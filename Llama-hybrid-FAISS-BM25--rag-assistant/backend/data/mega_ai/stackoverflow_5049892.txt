Group by Date - Datetime Problem

Guys, I really need your help on this one. I have a list of articles using smarty I want to organize by date, Date1 ArticleA Date2 ArticleB ArticleC The problem I am having is that on Date2 (or if there are more than 1 articles posted on the same day) the entire Date2 shows up again...i.e Date1 ArticleA Date2 ArticleB ArticleC Date2 ArticleB ArticleC What I THINK the problem is, is that the Date2 is a datetime for when the article was posted, so the reason its repeating each time is because the time values are different. I need to find a way to remove the time value from datetime or somehow manipulate it to show just the date. Here is my code SQL $sql = 'select ' . TABLE_ADS . ('' . '.*' . $mlang_vars . ', ') . TABLE_ADS . '.id as adid, ' . TABLE_ADS_PICTURES . '.picture, ' . TABLE_ADS_PICTURES . '.`id` as `picture_id`, date_format(' . TABLE_ADS . ('' . '.`date_added`,\'' . $date_format . '\') as date_nice, date_format(') . TABLE_ADS . ('' . '.`date_expires`,\'' . $date_format . '\') as date_expires_nice, (') . TABLE_ADS . ('' . '.date_expires PHP {foreach from=$listings_array name="date_nice" item=k}{$k.date_nice} {foreach from=$listings_array name="listing" item=v} {if $k.date_nice==$v.date_nice} {include file="short_listing.html"} {/if} {/foreach} {/foreach}
