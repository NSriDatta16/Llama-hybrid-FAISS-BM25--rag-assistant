The 8 MB: you're talking about file (or flash storage) size? I expect operational memory requirements of browsers to be more significant than the code base.... but I don't see this in your question. Since you're referring to Qtwebkit do you have other Qt libraries active in your product? Depends a lot on your needs; how about compatibility ,CSS, screen size, performance? Free software or licensed? Which license conditions (i.e. GPL or definitely not). Can you be more specific? A browser which is well performing and standards compliant will easily cost 16+ MByte. I found Opera, specifically opera devices very interesting; it is very standards compiant, customizable and performant, however it's memory use is also in the 16-32 MByte region.
