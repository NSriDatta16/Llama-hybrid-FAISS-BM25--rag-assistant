What's the confidence interval in a population given an inaccurate classifier?

I've built a machine learning model on some training data to classify first names as male or female. The accuracy on the training data is x% . With the known accuracy, I then predict on a new dataset of n samples, and the model predicts that m names are male. How can I calculate the confidence interval for the number of male names in the dataset? E.g. 600 of the names in a dataset of a 1000 names were predicted as male. The true answer, with 95% confidence, lies within the interval 575-625 male names in the dataset .
