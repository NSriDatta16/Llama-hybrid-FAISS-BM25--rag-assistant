Unit testing .Net CF apps on Windows Mobile 6.5.3 in Visual Studio 2008

Did anyone get that to work? I mean, unit testing .Net CF apps on Windows Mobile 6.5.3 in Visual Studio 2008. It works great for a WM 6 Pro target, but not for a WM 6.5.3 target. I get this error: The test adapter ('Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.TestTypes.Unit.UnitTestAdapter, Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.Tips.UnitTest.Adapter, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a') required to execute this test could not be loaded. Check that the test adapter is installed properly. Not enough storage is available to process this command. Yes, I can read the error text, but I don't understand the failed run. Any clues?
