In the sketch presented in that article, the bolded sentence is not really true. (There's an excerpt from Jordan Ellenberg's book here that covers similar ground as the Slate article, and that still includes the sketch as of this writing.) In that sketch, the long side of the 'triangle of acceptibility' goes from about (1/3,1) to (1,1/3). So the mean niceness of the handsomest men (those with handsomeness=1) in the triangle would be approximately 2/3, whereas the average niceness of all men is of course 1/2. But if you modify the sketch so that the long side of the triangle goes from (0,1) to (1,0), like this: then the acceptable-and-very-handsome men will be the quadrilateral shown in the figure. And so their average niceness will be approximately 1/2. And if you really restrict yourself to the handsomest men (those with handsomeness=1, and equivalent to the case where the quadrilateral becomes infinitely thin), their average niceness is exactly 1/2, the same as the average niceness of all men. And drawing the sketch this way still provides an effective illustration of Berkson's fallacy, because it still retains the negative correlation between niceness and handsomeness within the population of acceptable men. Maybe the author had an earlier version of the sketch that looked more like my sketch, and neglected to update that one line of the text after they updated the sketch? (This last is pure speculation on my part...)
