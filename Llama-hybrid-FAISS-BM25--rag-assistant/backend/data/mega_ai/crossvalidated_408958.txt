Introduction to Variational Bayesian methods?

I am interested in learning about Variational Bayesian methods . I understand the general idea, explained in Wiki, where the aim is to approximate a posterior using a more tractable distribution, in order to provide an analytical approximation. However, it is not clear to me how to proceed with new models since the examples typically rely on very simple cases but, for general or more complex models, it is not clear how should one proceed. Are there any general references where I can learn how to approximate the posterior associated to general regression models (say with random effects, heavy tailed distributions, splines) that are not necessarily linear or normal?
