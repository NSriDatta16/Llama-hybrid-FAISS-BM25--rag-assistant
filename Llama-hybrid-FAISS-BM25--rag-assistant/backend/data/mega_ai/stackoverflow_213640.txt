I've run into the same problem, bzlm, and come to the same conclusion. There's simply no good way to get non-nullable fields with DB-assigned default values working with Linq To Sql. The work around I've gone with is to add a SetDefaults() method very similar to the one Robert Paulson linked to on CodeProject and call it in the default constructor of my table entity base class. It works well for me, because 95% of the time, I'm setting a 0, empty string, or getdate().
