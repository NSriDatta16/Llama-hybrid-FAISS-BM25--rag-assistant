How do you select variables in a regression model?

The traditional approach to variable selection is to find variables that contribute the most to predicting a new response. Recently I learned of an alternative to this. In modeling variables that determine the effect of a treatment--as for example in a clinical trial of a pharmaceutical--the variable is said to be qualitatively interacting with treatment if, leaving other things fixed, a change in that variable can create a change in which treatment is most effective. These variables are not always strong predictors of the effect but may be important for a physician when deciding on treatment for individual patients. In her PhD thesis Lacey Gunter developed a method for selecting these qualitatively interacting variables that could be missed by algorithms that base selection on prediction. Recently I have worked with her on extending these methods to other models including logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard regression models. I have two questions: What do you think about the value of these new methods? In the case of the traditional methods what approach do you prefer? Criteria such as AIC, BIC, Mallows Cp, F tests for entering or dropping variables in stepwise, forward and backward... The first paper on this came out in Gunter, L., Zhu, J and Murphy, S. A. (2009). Variable selection for qualitative interactions . Statistical Methodology doi:10, 1016/j.stamet.2009.05.003. The next paper appeared in Gunter,L., Zhu, J. and Murphy, S. A. (2011). Variable selection of qualitative interactions in personalized medicine while controlling the familywise error rate . Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics 21, 1063-1078. The next one appeared in a special issue on variable selection Gunter, L., Chernick, M. R. and Sun, J. (2011). A simple method for variable selection in regression with respect to treatment selection . Pakistan Journal of Statistics and Operations Research 7: 363-380. You can find the papers at the journal websites. You may have to purchase the article. I might have the pdf files for these articles. Lacey and I have just completed a monograph on this topic which will be published as a SpringerBrief later this year.
