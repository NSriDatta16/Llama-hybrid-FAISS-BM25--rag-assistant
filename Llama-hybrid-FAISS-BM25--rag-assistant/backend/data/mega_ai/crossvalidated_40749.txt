Synthetic time series generation

I have a linear model (with seasonal dummy variables) that produces monthly forecasts. I'm using R together with the 'forecast' package: require(forecast) model = tslm(waterflow ~ rainfall + season, data = model.df, lambda = lambda) forec = forecast(model, newdata = rainfall.df, lambda = lambda) I did a cross-validation and it looks great. Now, what i need is to generate weekly data points from these month forecasts - in other words, i need to generate a synthetic time-series that have monthly means equal to the forecasts above. So my function would look like: generate.data = function(monthly.means, start.date, end.date) { #code here } I'm not sure how to do this (interpolation?), so any help is welcome. Thanks!
