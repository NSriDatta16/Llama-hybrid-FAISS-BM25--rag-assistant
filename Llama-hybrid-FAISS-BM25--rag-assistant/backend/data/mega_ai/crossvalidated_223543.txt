How long do word vectors typically need to be?

I was wondering how long word vectors typically are. I was working on an RNN language translator and I was using word vectors of size 128 to model english and german words. I seemed to get good results after a day of training. Do you think I need to use shorter or longer vectors? I did a google search and I can not find any rule of thumb for vector length.
