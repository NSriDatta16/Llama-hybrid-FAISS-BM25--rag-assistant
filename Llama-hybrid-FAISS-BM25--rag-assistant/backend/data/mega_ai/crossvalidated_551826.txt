This is a correct description of the (symmetric) Metropolis-[RosenbluthÂ²]-Hastings algorithm, but the motivation is not: (i) ignoring the normalising constant $Z_p$ is common to a lot of simulation techniques , like accept-reject methods. The normalising constant is useful when computing the cdf and using the inverse cdf technique, but otherwise, it rarely matters. The reasons for using MCMC methods are rather that the (e.g., posterior) distributions to be simulated are complex, high-dimension, non-standard distributions. (ii) the posterior must be available analytically in the sense that $$p(\theta)p(x|\theta)$$ must be computable for the observed value $x$ and an arbitrary $\theta$ , up to a constant (in $\theta$ ). Otherwise, the random variable $\theta$ must be completed by an auxiliary variable to augment $p(\theta|x)$ into a joint distribution $q(\theta,z|x)$ that can be computed or simulated (as in data augmentation ).
