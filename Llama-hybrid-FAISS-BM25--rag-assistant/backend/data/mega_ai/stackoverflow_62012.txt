Apache Fall Back When PHP Fails

I was wondering if anybody knew of a method to configure apache to fall back to returning a static HTML page, should it (Apache) be able to determine that PHP has died? This would provide the developer with a elegant solution to displaying an error page and not (worst case scenario) the source code of the PHP page that should have been executed. Thanks.
