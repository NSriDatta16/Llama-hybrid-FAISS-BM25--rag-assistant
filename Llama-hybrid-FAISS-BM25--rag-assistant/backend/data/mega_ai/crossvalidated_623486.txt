If I am understanding you correctly, you have some data associated with each hour of the day, and you have trained 24 different random forests (one for each hour) to predict whether or not you "should" undertake a certain action during that hour. You are currently using a decision rule of "go with whichever forest had the most trees in agreement". I think that this entire approach is really flawed and you should go back to square one. There is no reason that "percentage of trees voting together" in one model should be comparable to another. Even with just one model, this percentage of trees voting together doesn't correspond to a probability of obtaining the correct class. All of the trees could be just slightly to one side of the decision boundary and you would have 100% of trees predicting 1 on one side and 0% of trees predicting 1 on the other side. If you have hourly data and you want to decide which one hour to take a certain action you should design your prediction system to take all of the data and return one of the 24 classes. Your model will need to directly compare predictor variables across each of the 24 classes to make a decision.
