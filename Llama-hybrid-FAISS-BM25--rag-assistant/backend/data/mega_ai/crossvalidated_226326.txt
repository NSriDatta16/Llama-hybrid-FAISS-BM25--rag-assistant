Proportion / Percentage Regression Analysis methods

I am attempting to help a colleague with data analysis and I'm a bit swamped as to what is appropriate. We are trying create a formula to explain why children in various provinces have stunted growth and we predict it is due to Vitamin A deficiency and damage from Diarrhea events (Simplified of course). I have proportional data for nine provinces on: the percentage of stunted children the percent that have received Vitamin A recently the percent that have recently had diarrhea. Example such as: Province 1 ---- 14.5% Stunted-----75.4% Vitamin A intake -----14% Diarrhea Since the data is not normal and also inherently bounded by 0 and 100%, I assume I should not be using linear regression. This website suggests using a probit or two-limit tobit model, but I've found suggestions to use GLMM, ancovas, or logistic regression. I use normally use SPSS but can use R, JMP if needed. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
