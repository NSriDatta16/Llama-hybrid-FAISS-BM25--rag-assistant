Residuals in double seasonal exponential smoothing

I have a time series with muliple seasonal cycles, which are 24 and 168 hours for my case. I would like to use Double Seasonal Exponential Smoothing method to forecast, which was published by James W. Taylor ( http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mast0315/ ). The link for his article is here When I check Taylor's paper and all other papers in the literature, I saw that AR(1) adjustment has been implemented to the residuals. Is it a coincidence to make AR(1) correction to residuals of all the time series, that have been used in these papers? I am using "forecast" package in R by Rob Hyndman, http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/forecast.pdf Firstly, I run the code without using an AR(1) model for the errors. data Below, you can see the ACF and PACF graphs of the residuals. As you can see there are some serious non-zera autocorrelation. I can not do AR(1) correction as papers suggest because PACF does not show it.I do not know what to do. I am sorry if it's a silly question however I am so new to time series. Would you please care to explain what to do next step-by-step and elaborately. Thanks in advance
