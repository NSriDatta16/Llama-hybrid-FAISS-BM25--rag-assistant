I would like to comment on two issues here. First, we may ask "how many" components should keep instead of "what components". This because PCA is doing a linear transformation of the original feature space. So after transformation, we do not have the original components and we can only select how many to keep, or what to keep in terms of first, second principle component... Second, I guess you goal is trying to build a classification model using CNN. But note that, PCA is a "unsupervised method", which means it is just trying to keep as much information as possible to the data, with out considering the label. In other words, it is possible we you only select 1 component but get excellent classification results and keeping all components will still not able to do classification well. Detailed discussion can be found here: How to decide between PCA and logistic regression?
