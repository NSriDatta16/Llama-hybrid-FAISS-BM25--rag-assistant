How to analyse a non-inferiority trial using GEE in R?

I'm trying to analyse a non-inferiority trial in R. Since there are correlated observations and a population averaged interpretation seems fine, I want to use GEE. To illustrate my problem, I will use the muscatine data that is embedded in the gee package in R. The research question can be as follows, I want to investigate if the male participants in the muscatine data have a non-inferior obesity level compared to the females (so equivalent to testing if 'males' is a new, non-inferior drug compared to the standard drug 'females') The outcome 'obese' and variable 'gender' are both binary, age and occasion are controlled for and continuous (not important tho) The problem at hand: I know how to perform a GEE in R, but how can I get p-values corresponding to a non-inferiority trial with non inferiority margin equal to $0.01$ ? (So this is equivalent to testing $H_0:β_1 ≤- 0.01$ vs $H_a:β_1 > -0.01$ , where $β_1$ is the log-odds ratio of course). I can only find online that GEE tests 2-sided hypotheses with $β_1 = 0$ . I used the following code: library(gee) data(muscatine) data2 $obese obese == 'yes', 0, 1) x This gives me the following output concerning the coefficients: Coefficients: Estimate Naive S.E. Naive z Robust S.E. Robust z (Intercept) 1.7846 0.1152 15.49 0.1116 16.00 genderF -0.1521 0.0620 -2.45 0.0626 -2.43 age -0.0296 0.0113 -2.63 0.0110 -2.68 occasion -0.0377 0.0298 -1.27 0.0310 -1.22 REMARK: I posted this already on Stack Overflow, but they suggested to move it here and someone indicated my alternative hypothesis is wrong, but I can't find the reason for that.
