Alternatives to keeping large lists in memory (python)

If I have a list(or array, dictionary....) in python that could exceed the available memory address space, (32 bit python) what are the options and there relative speeds? (other than not making a list that large) The list could exceed the memory but I have no way of knowing before hand. Once it starts exceeding 75% I would like to no longer keep the list in memory (or the new items anyway), is there a way to convert to a file based approach mid-stream? What are the best (speed in and out) file storage options? Just need to store a simple list of numbers. no need to random Nth element access, just append/pop type operations.
