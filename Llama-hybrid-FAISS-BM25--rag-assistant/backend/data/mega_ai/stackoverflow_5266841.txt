I prefer to bind the user-agent instead of the IP for reasons stated above. Binding the user-agent makes it a little more difficult to replay the cookie. SSL is great to prevent "Man-in-the-middle attack" but it's not a magic "secures it all" solution. If your website is vulnerable to XSS, the cookies are not safe (and by extension, the session id). Also: watch out for session fixation.
