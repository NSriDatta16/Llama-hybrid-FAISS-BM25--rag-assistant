Magento View 'Company Name' Instead Of First/Last Name

Can Magento view/manage our customers by their business name in addition to their contact names to find them easily? It is being used for B2B, so when emails go out they are pulling the customerâ€™s name, instead of the company name which is more appropriate. Is this a global setting? thanks in advance.
