There's a bit of confusion in the way that the results are stated, so we'll start by clarifying those. (Apologies, I engaged earlier without reading your question closely enough.) Define the $p$ value to be $p(x) = \inf_{x \in \mathcal{R}_\alpha} \alpha$ for some observed data $x$ . Throughout we will use the notation that $t=T(x)$ is the observed statistic. Choose a rejection region $\mathcal{R}_\alpha = \{X : |T(X)| > c_\alpha\}$ so that $\sup_{\theta_0 \in \Theta_0} \mathbb{P}_{\theta_0} \left[X \in \mathcal{R}_\alpha\right] = \alpha$ . (Note, this precludes some discrete data distributions, we ignore that complication.) Whenever the rejection cutoff $c_\alpha$ is a decreasing function of $\alpha$ , the $p$ value $p(x) = \sup_{\theta_0 \in \Theta_0} \mathbb{P}_{\theta_0} \left[ |T(X)| > |t| \right]$ . This follows almost immediately from the definitions. The $p$ value by definition equals $$p(x) = \inf_{\alpha: \, |t| > c_\alpha} \sup_{\theta_0 \in \Theta_0} \mathbb{P}_{\theta_0} \left[ |T(X)| > c_\alpha \right].$$ By the premise, the infimum is achieved at the upper bound $c_\alpha = |t|$ so that the result follows. As a corollary, note that the premise holds when $\Theta_0 = \{\theta_0\}$ is a singleton and $T(X)$ is symmetric around zero under $\theta_0$ . Drawing a picture makes this very clear. Choose a rejection region $\mathcal{R}_\alpha = \{X : T(X) c_{2,\alpha}\}$ so that $\sup_{\theta_0 \in \Theta_0} \mathbb{P}_{\theta_0} \left[X \in \mathcal{R}_\alpha\right] = \alpha$ . Further assume that the cutoffs are chosen so that $\sup_\alpha c_{1, \alpha} = \inf_\alpha c_{2,\alpha}$ , making each observed test statistic $T(x)$ satisfy either exactly one of $t or $t > c_{2,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$ . Whenever the cutoff $c_{1,\alpha}$ (respectively $c_{2,\alpha}$ ) is an increasing (respectively decreasing) function of $\alpha$ , the $p$ value equals $$\min\{\sup_{\theta_0 \in \Theta_0} \mathbb{P}_{\theta_0} [T(X) \tilde{c}_2], \sup_{\theta_0 \in \Theta_0} \mathbb{P}_{\theta_0} [T(X) t]\},$$ where $\tilde{c}_1$ corresponds with $c_{\alpha, 2} = t$ , and likewise $\tilde{c}_2$ corresponds with $c_{\alpha, 1} = t$ . This can be routinely worked out using the same arguments as for (3). I encourage you to try the calculation. As a corollary, when $\Theta_0$ is a singleton, $\mathcal{R}_\alpha$ is chosen to be equitailed, and the rejection cutoffs are monotonic, the expression for the $p$ value simplifies to $$\min\{2\mathbb{P}_{\theta_0} [T(X) t]\}.$$
