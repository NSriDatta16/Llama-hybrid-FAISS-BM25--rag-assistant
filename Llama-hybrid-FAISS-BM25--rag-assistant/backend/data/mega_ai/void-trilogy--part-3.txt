r everything. Using Dark Fortress technology, she sets up a barrier around the Sol system which leaves ANA and the deterrence fleet trapped inside. It is this technology which she has equipped the ships travelling to the Void with, the ability to create a forcefield which the Warrior Raiel cannot penetrate. Technology The Commonwealth uses a number of advanced technologies. In the early days of the Commonwealth, humans used static and permanently opened wormholes to travel from planet to planet. However, after the events of the Starflyer War (detailed in the Commonwealth Saga), the CST corporation's monopoly on space travel was ended. With the advent of wormholes that could wrap around ships, the Commonwealth saw a shift from wormholes to spaceships. Another development in the Commonwealth is the gaiafield. Developed by Ozzie Issac in AD 3000, the gaiafield is based on Silfen technology; when Ozzie was named a friend of the Silfen during the Starflyer war, he was given a pendant. In later years Ozzie broke open the pendant and discovered Quantum fields; replicating the quantum properties; he thus created the gaiafield. The gaiafield effectively allows individuals to feel the emotions of others. Ozzie developed the gaiafield with the hope that it would end conflict and division within the Commonwealth and encourage tolerance between sentient life in the Galaxy. In AD 2833, the ANA was deployed—effectively a virtual universe that people could download their consciousness into. Individuals retained their memories, and thus their individuality, within the ANA. They also had their own virtual universe in which they could create and modify as they saw fit. The ANA eventually became the government of Earth and the Commonwealth, housing factions such as the Conservatives, the Accelerators, the Darwinists, the Moderates, and the Separatists. With over 50 million people by AD 3400. The ANA is a semi post physical entity—not a machine, the ANA consists of the molecular matter in the Quantum fields around earth. Alternative lifestyles amidst the Commonwealth allow for endless combinations of technology Enrichments. The Advancer movement provides DNA modifications, of which 80% of the Humans in the Commonwealth have, either through choice or by birth. These 'Enrichments' provide in-vision iconography, communication, and passive environment scanning routines. Further uses of Biononics grant Enrichments for combat weaponry, shielding, physical enhancements and emotional and physiological dampening. The Higher movement, a social / economical / political ideology as well as a technology tree moving inexorably toward a 2nd life in ANA, used Biononics to keep their physical bodies in their healthy mid-20s until the time they 'Move Inward'; a personal journey to the outer worlds or to the ANA universe.
