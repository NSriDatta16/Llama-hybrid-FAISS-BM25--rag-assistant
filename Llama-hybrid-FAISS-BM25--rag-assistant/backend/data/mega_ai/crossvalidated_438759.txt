Can logistic regression output a non linear curve?

I have a doubt regarding logistic regression.I know that it separates the data into 2 parts.Is it possible that it leads to a curve as shown in the example of underfitting and overfitting What i know is that adding more layers(Neural networks) of logistic regression can cause these curves .My question is can a standalone Logistic Regression without any layer lead these types of non linear curves. And if NO,how can we define the case of overfitting and underfitting in that scenario visually.
