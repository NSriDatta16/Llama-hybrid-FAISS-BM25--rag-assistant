Syntax for using mr.ripley for benchmarking

I have a Plone 3.3.5 site that I'm migrating to plone.app.blob for BLOB storage. I'm looking to measure the difference in performance and resource usage by replaying requests to the site, pre-migration and post-migration. I found that mr.ripley comes with it's own buildout and I used that to install it. That buildout contains a section which creates a script at bin/replay, which is configured by some parameters in the buildout.cfg. The included parameters look like they should work for my instance as I'm running on port 8080 as well. I copied one of my (smaller) apache logs into the base directory of my mr.ripley buildout and chowned it so that my zope user can read it. Then I try to run it like this: time bin/replay mysite.com_access.log It seems to run (doesn't produce any errors or drop me back into the shell) however I don't see any signs that it's loading up the server. My RAM and CPU usage in top still look like the machine is idling. Many hours later the process does still not seem to have been completed. I ran it using screen , detached and returned several times to the session, but it just seems to be stuck. Any recommendations as to what I might be missing?
