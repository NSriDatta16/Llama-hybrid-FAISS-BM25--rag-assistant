Issue with string to int conversion in C++

I have an application where I get a vector . I need to iterate through each element in the vector and see if a value is an integer value. Although the vector represents strings, few of the elements can contain an integer. I need to figure out which of those elements are integers, and if an element is an integer, I need its value. If an element in the vector is a string, then I just ignore it. I tried to use atoi(vector[index].c_str()) , but I have an issue with it. atoi returns an integer value if the value contained in the string is an integer. If not, it returns 0 So, consider the following: atoi("Shankar") = 0 atoi("0") = 0 and atoi("123") = 123 atoi("123Shankar") = 123 So, how do I distinguish between the above shown cases? If this cannot be achieved using atoi, then what is the alternate solution to this problem? Please assist. EDIT : I can loop through the string and see if every character is an integer, but that reduces performance, since for m strings with an average of n characters, I need to check m X n times which makes it O(n^2). is there a better way to solve this problem? EDIT2 : Unfortunately, I cannot use any 3rd party library for this and just use STL EDIT3 : In my application, the vector does not contain any negative integers so I am considering Xeo's solution since sstream does not distinguish between "123" and "123Shankar" Thanks everyone for your assistance.
