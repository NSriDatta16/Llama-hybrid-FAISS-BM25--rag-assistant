I do not think you should favor manual testing - unless you prefer to test instead of code. Instead you have another option - if you test the functionality and not the implementation, try to avoid testing private methods (that can be refactored) and in general write less-fragile tests you'll see that using a mocking/isolation framework does not require you to over specify the system nor does it cause your tests to become more fragile. In a nutshell - writing fragile tests can be done with or without fakes/mocks and vise-versa.
