There's Harvey Goldstein's iterative generalized least-squares (IGLS) algorithm for one, and also it's minor modification, restricted iterative generalized least-squares (RIGLS), that gives unbiased estimates of the variance parameters. These algorithms are still iterative, so not closed form, but they're computationally simpler than MCMC or maximum likelihood. You just iterate until the parameters converge. Goldstein H.
