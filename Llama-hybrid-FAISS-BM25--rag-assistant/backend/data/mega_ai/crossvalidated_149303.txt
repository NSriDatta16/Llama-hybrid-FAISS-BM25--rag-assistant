Let's imagine that we have the true probability density function $f(x)$. What would be the expectation of an average of 9 random values from this distribution? $E\left[\frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1}^9 x_i\right]=\frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1}^9 E[x_i]=\frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1}^9 \int_{-\infty}^\infty x_i\cdot f(x_i) dx_i$ The integral is the same for all 9 random variables: $\mu$ the expectation of the distribution. Hence, that sum is: $E\left[\frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1}^9 x_i\right]=\frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1}^9\mu=\frac{9\mu}{9}=\mu$ This means that the expectation of the simple average of 9 random numbers is the expectation of the distribution. In statistics this is called an estimator, and the notation is usually $\hat\mu=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. It's a "good" estimator, because it converges in some sense to a true value.
