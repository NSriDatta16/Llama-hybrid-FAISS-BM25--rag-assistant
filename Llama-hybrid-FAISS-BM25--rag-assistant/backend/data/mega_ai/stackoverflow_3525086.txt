How can I add an additional field to an SQL Group By clause

I have the following MS-Access SQL Table:- NAME, SUBJECT, SCORE ..and I need to find the average score, highest score and the subject that the highest score was achieved against. I have managed to produce the following query but not sure how I can incorporate the SUBJECT field:- SELECT NAME, Avg(SCORE) AS AverageScore, MAX(SCORE) AS best_score FROM Scoretable GROUP BY NAME Any ideas ?
