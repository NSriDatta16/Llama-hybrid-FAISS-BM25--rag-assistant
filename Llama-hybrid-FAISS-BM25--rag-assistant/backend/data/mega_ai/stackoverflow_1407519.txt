Get a blog, release code through it. Explain why you wrote it, what problem it solves. And encourage others to improve upon it, keep the code posted as current as possible. If your tools are useful you will very quickly develop a following that 'trusts' your code. Separate documentation isn't a must for small tools, but anything creeping into the framework world should probably have ample documentation and examples if you want any serious adoption from the community at large.
