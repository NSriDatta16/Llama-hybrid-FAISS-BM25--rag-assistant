PCA plots I have made, I would say the data is certainly not linearly separable, and not non-linearly separable either. Note that, using PCA to map to 2D space will lose information in the data. It is possible the data "can be" separated well, but PCA 2D does not look good. Even with the plot shown, there is still "hope", two different types of the data are "clustered", think about K nearest neighbor algorithm. It should give some "reasonable" performance. Also, it is wrong to say they are not non-linear separable. If you do not have two overlapping points with different color, I can make a non-linear classifier with 100% accuracy.
