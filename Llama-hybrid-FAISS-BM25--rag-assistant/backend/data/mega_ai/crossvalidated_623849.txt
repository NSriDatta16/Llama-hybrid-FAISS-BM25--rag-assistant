They don't have statistical definitions but statistics may be helpful in showing either. "Testable" means ... well "can be tested". If (sticking to psychology) is that, say, "In college, men prefer male professors and women prefer female ones" then that is testable because I can (at least in theory) look at a whole bunch of male and female college students and get them to rate male and female professors. This is a case where statistics will be very helpful in doing the test. On the other hand, if my hypothesis is "every male student dislikes every female professor" then statistics isn't needed. One example is enough. "Falsifiable" means that there is some possible evidence which would lead me to reject my hypothesis. Maybe statistical, maybe not. EDIT: In the second paragraph, I mean "reject" in the common language sense, rather than in the sense of statistics (although they could overlap).
