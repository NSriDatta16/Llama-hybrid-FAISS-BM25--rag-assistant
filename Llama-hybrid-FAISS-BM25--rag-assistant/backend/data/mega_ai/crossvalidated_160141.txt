Have a look at heavy tail Lambert W x F distributions (disclaimer: I am the author). The random variable $Y \sim Lambert W \times F$ is a heavy-tail version of $X\sim F$, where you control the tails with tail parameter $\delta \geq 0$: for $\delta = 0$, $X = Y$ and thus Lambert W x F is the same as F; and for $\delta \rightarrow \infty$ you get more and more heavy tails in $Y$ (Tukey's h is a special case of Lambert W x F random variables for F = Gaussian and $\alpha = 1$). Note that this works for any (non pathological) continuous distribution -- not just the Normal distribution. For your particular request of mean = 0, symmetric, and variable variance and kurtosis you can set $\mu = 0$, $\delta_{\ell} = \delta_r = \delta$ (by default), and vary scale $\sigma$ and tail parameter $\delta$. In R this is implemented in the LambertW package (use type = "h" and distname = "normal" ). See also (my) related replies here: Transformation to increase kurtosis and skewness of normal r.v : this shows some illustrations of how the densities vary when varying $\delta$. What's the distribution of these data? : an application example of how to use this to estimate model parameters and Gaussianize your data.
