How can I pool correlations?

I'm measuring a phenomenon over several days. On any particular day, the phenomenon is well correlated. I was wondering how I could pool the correlations over several days to get a single estimate of how well correlated the data are. The last observation yesterday has nothing to do with the first observation today, so I don't think computing the correlation as if it were a time series is appropriate. What is the recommended approach for analyzing correlations of this nature?
