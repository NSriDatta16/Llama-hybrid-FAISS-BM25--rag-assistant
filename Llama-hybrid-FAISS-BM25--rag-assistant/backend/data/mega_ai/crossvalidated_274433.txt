Logistic regression and SVM are discriminative models. They model only $p(y|x)$. Naive Bayes is a generative model. It models $p(x, y)$. It is well known that when you have very little data that a generative model can beat a discriminative model. This paper by Andrew Ng has some good comparisons. https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-discriminativegenerative.pdf
