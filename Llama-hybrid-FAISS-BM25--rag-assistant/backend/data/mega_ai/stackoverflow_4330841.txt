@Anon has the right of things - training and what I'll call validation sets. That noted, the bits and pieces I see about developments in this field point at two things: Bayesian Classifiers : there's something like this probably filtering your email. In short you train the algorithm to make a probabilistic decision if a particular item is part of a group or not (e.g. spam and ham). Multiple Classifiers: this is the approach that the winning group involved in the Netflix challenge took, whereby it's not about optimizing one particular algorithm (e.g. Bayesian, Genetic Programming, Neural Networks, etc..) by combining several to get a better result. As for data sets Weka has several available . I haven't explored other libraries for data sets, but mloss.org appears to be a good resource. Finally data.gov offers a lot of sets that provide some interesting opportunities.
