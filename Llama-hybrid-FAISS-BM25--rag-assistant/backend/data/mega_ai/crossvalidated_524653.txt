I might be able to provide some justification for the cutoff for AICs less than 2 units apart. I wrote a paper analyzing Quetelet's famous analysis of 5723 Scottish chest girths, one of the first applications of what would come to be called the normal distribution. Quetelet, long before goodness of fit tests, argued that the chest data were normal. Others have disagreed. The AIC for the fit of the normal to Quetelet's Scottish chest data is 24629. I generated 10000 random data with n = 5732 using Matlab's pseudo-random normal generator with the same mean and sd as Quetelet's data, obtaining a mean AIC of 24630 ± 2 [± half 95% confidence interval]. I would certainly agree with the ▵AIC = 2 cutoff, but I have no idea about justification for the 4-7 or >10 cutoffs. Gallagher, E. D. (2020). Was Quetelet's Average Man Normal?
