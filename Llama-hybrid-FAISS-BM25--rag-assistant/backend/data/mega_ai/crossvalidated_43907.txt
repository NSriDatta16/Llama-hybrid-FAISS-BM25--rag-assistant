Your final formula is missing a left parenthesis. This is a standard problem that requires no difficult work. The wikipedia page on Bayesian regression solves a harder problem; you should be able to use the same trick (which is basically just a form of completing the square, since you want it in terms of $(\beta - m)' V^{-1} (\beta - m)$ for some $m$ and $V$), with fewer terms to worry about. That is, you get to something like this: \begin{align}(\mathbf{y}- \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol\beta)^{\rm T}(\mathbf{y}- \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol\beta)&= (\boldsymbol\beta - \hat{\boldsymbol\beta})^{\rm T}(\mathbf{X}^{\rm T}\mathbf{X})(\boldsymbol\beta - \hat{\boldsymbol\beta}) + \mathbf{S} \end{align} where \begin{align}\mathbf{S} = (\mathbf{y}- \mathbf{X} \hat{\boldsymbol\beta})^{\rm T}(\mathbf{y}- \mathbf{X} \hat{\boldsymbol\beta})\end{align} in the exponent. See also the references at the wikipedia article. If this is for some subject, please mark it as homework.
