A few answers and a few questions. For simplicity let's start by assuming you're just seeing one long chain of movements. The simplest model would involve a Multinomial distribution for each node (essentially at each node there is a specific die to roll to determine where you go next). Our goal would be to estimate the parameters of these dice. As Ash mentioned the Bayesian approach would be to put a Dirichlet Prior Distribution on each die, and update this prior with new data to obtain a Dirichlet Posterior Distribution . You can think of a Dirichlet distribution as a dice factory. The fact that the posterior distribution is also a Dirichlet is because the Dirichlet distribution is the Conjugate Prior to the Multinomial distribution. While this may sound quite confusing it's actually very simple. The prior can be interpreted as pseudo-counts, essentially pretending that you've already seen some data (even though you haven't). For example, if you are at Z you can go to C, D, Z (our die is three sided here). We can use a Dirichlet prior that acts as though we've already seen one transition from Z to each of those states. So each probability will equal 1/3. If the player transitions to C, we would update our distribution with one more count, so transition from Z to C would have probability 2/4 and the other would each have probability 1/4. If we use a prior with more pseudo-counts as though we had seen 10 transitions from Z to each of the other states, the updated probabilities (11/31, 10/31, 10/31), would be much closer to the original ones, this is a stronger prior. The strength of the prior is normally determined by Cross-Validation . The model I described above is referred to as memoryless , because the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends only on your current state. If you wanted to do something more elaborate you could incorporate not only where you currently are, but also where you were last step, although at this point the number of parameters you have to estimate will increase dramatically, and therefore the variance in estimating will as well. Question: You gave some intuition of the form of "Why would I go from B->C->X when I could just go from B->X?" These ideas seem to be specific to the problem you're working on, so I can speak directly to it. Although if that is a concern, perhaps you want to use the non-memoryless (memoryfull?) model, or incorporate this information in your prior. If you would like to explain what the real life significance of this graph is, and therefore where this intuition is coming from perhaps we can be more helpful. Note: You want to look up Markov Models, maybe no so much Hidden Markov Models. Those have a hidden state that is controlling the observed data, and trying to learn to use them might get in the way of this project.
