jQuery sortable - how to add a sort indicator?

I've successfully implemented the jQuery sortable() plugin but want to enhance it with a sort indicator. This would be a vertical bar in between the items where the draggable can be dropped. See the image below for an example. Can this easily be achieved with the sortable() plugin? alt text http://www.host2000.be/_temp/sortable.jpg
