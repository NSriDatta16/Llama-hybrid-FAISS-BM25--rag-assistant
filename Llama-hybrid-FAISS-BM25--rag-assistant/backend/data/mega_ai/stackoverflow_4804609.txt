Sometimes simple things become so complicated. I've got it... An easy and handy solution... Actually it is possible to have hidden items as easy as having more subitems than columns. E.g. having 6 subitems and 4 columns means that we have 2 "hidden" subitems. The only remaining thing is redirecting the sort procedure to these sortable hidden subitems (columns).
