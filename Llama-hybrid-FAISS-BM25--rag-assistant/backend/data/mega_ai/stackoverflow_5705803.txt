Um, no, not the same. First off, I need to clear up some terminology. MS Access is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool that allows you to quickly build forms and reports that are bound to relational data. It comes with a file-based database engine (Jet/ACE). Access the RAD tool can be used with many different backend databases (Jet, SQL Server, any db that supports ODBC, etc). I have to assume your colleague was specifically commenting on Jet/ACE, ie the database engine that MS Access uses. I think the single biggest difference between the Jet/ACE database engine and MS SQL Server Express is that Jet/ACE is file-based and SQL Server Express uses a client/server model . This means that SQL Server Express requires a running service to provide access to the datastore. This can complicate deployment in some scenarios. SQL Server Express is really just a throttled-back version of SQL Server: max database size of 4GB (10GB in 2008R2), only uses a single physical CPU, etc. These limitations are imposed to prevent large organizations from using the freely available Express edition in place of a full-blown SQL Server install. The upshot to this is that SQL Server Express offers a truly seamless upgrade path to SQL Server. It is also (generally speaking) a more robust and fully featured database management system then Jet/ACE. Similarities relational database management systems written by Microsoft Differences MS Access File based free distributable runtime (2007 or later) RAD tools (form/report designer) uses Jet SQL max file size 2GB SQL Server Express Client/Server model free no RAD tools uses Transact-SQL max database size 4GB (10GB for SSE R2), max one physical CPU
