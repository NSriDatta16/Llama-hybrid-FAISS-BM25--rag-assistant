Running a Logistic regression - overflow error

I am running a logit regression and the "field1" is an existing list of 1's and 0's (which I am converting into a numpy list before passing as a parameter to Logit). I am trying to come up with a predicted set of 1's and O's using the Logit regression. I read an excel file, import it into a data frame. I assume that the y.astype(float) parameter - which is the existing 1's and 0's are needed to be passed into the Logit method (Which is the field1). The input file contains dummy variables for a few fields. Before passing parameters to Logit, I have had to convert these parameters into float, using the following post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33833832/building-multi-regression-model-throws-error-pandas-data-cast-to-numpy-dtype-o Code: I get the error at the end of this question - any ideas appreciated!! What am I doing wrong? My guess is that I don't need to include the Actual set of 1's and 0's because the 0's are causing the overflow? import pandas as pd import statsmodels.api as sm def runLogit(): df = pd.read_excel('InputFile.xlsx', sheetname='InputToCode') field1 = df['field1'] field2 = df['field2'] field3 = df['field3'] field4 = df['field4'] field5 = df['field5'] field6 = df['field6'] field7 = df['field7'] field8 = df['field8'] field9 = df['field9'] field10 = df['field10'] field11 = df['field11'] field12 = df['field12'] field13 = df['field13'] df = pd.DataFrame({ 'field1': field1, 'field2': field2, 'field3': field3, 'field4': field4, 'field5': field5, 'field6': field6, 'field7': field7, 'field8': field8, 'field9': field9, 'field10': field10, 'field11': field11, 'field12': field12, 'field13': field13 }) """ Field1 is an Actual list of 1's and 0's in the input data set (which we are trying to predict through the Logit). """ y = df['field1'].values print(len(y)) print(df.shape) logit_model = sm.Logit(y.astype(float), df.astype(float)) result = logit_model.fit() print(result.summary()) # Init call runLogit() The error I am getting: Warning: Maximum number of iterations has been exceeded.
