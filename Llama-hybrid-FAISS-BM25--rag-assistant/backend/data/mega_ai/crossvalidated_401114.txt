The correct formula for weighted average

The formula for a weighted average is: sum of values, multiplied by respective weights, divided by count of values. Right? That’s what I thought it was until I saw other variations, which are basically the expected value—no dividing by the count of values. Does the weighted average require dividing the sum of weighted values by their count or is it exactly the same as the expected value formula?
