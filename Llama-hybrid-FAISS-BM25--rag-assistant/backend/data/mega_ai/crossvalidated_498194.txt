How to check the robustness of a null result of an lmer() model using a Bayesian analysis?

I have an lmer() model that has a theoretically important null result. I would like to use a Bayesian analysis to check the robustness of this null result. What is the best way to do this? I had assumed that computing a Bayes Factor would be the way to go, but it seems that this value varies widely depending on the prior. I don't have a good way to choose a prior. Do you have a suggestion for how I can check the robustness of the null result? Is there: A generally accepted prior I can use? An automated way to compute Bayes Factors at different values of the prior? Edit: I am adding some additional details of my model. It is a linear mixed effects model of an experiment in which participants made responses to words. There are random effects for both words and subject. There are several fixed effects in the model: five continuous variables and one dichotomous predictor. This dichotomous predictor is the one with the important null result. I'd like a way to quantify the robustness of this null result. I don't have a good way to choose an informed prior.
