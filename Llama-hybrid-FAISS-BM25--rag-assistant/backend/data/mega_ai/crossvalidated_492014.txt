That is certainly possible to do, but somewhat different that the other image recognition approaches you mentioned. With those approaches, the encoding that you use in transfer learning has been optimized for some image recognition task, so the it likely has features that are beneficial for that task. Fine tuning just takes a previously optimized set of features and adjusts them slightly to the new task. An autoencoder is trained to create an embedding that can reproduce the original data space - an unsupervised machine learning problem - but there is no reason that embedding is useful for another task. It might be, but it wasn't trained for that purpose, so it might not have the right structure for a supervised machine learning problem.
