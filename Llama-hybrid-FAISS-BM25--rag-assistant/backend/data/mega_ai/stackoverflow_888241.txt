Eclipse CDT Debug console not displaying program output

I am using Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers (Eclipse Ganymede Package - version 3.4.2) on Windows XP with MinGW GCC 4.2.1 and GDB 6.8-3 . I am facing a problem very similar to that mentioned here . A simple hello world program will not print to the console output in the debugger. A run command displays the output correctly. I have checked both gdb output console and the output console. What are the right settings to get the output in console window of eclipse?
