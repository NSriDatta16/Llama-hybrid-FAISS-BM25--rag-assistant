The Application is Sandboxed in the location you specified is correct. /Users/INSERT_YOUR_USER_HERE/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/ That is this is the place where the Application(.app file) the installation file will be there. I was wondering that you were searching for the build file or the binary file(.ipa). In Xcode4 they have changed it. Previously in Xcode 3 versions the build file will be in the folder where you have created your Project along with all your .h and .m files. Now the build file is in this Path /Users/YOURUSER/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/YOURPROJECTNAME_SOMETHINGSOMETHING/Build/Products EDIT: More simple solution would be In the left side Navigator window in the Project structure under the Products Folder you will find your app. Right click on that and select open in finder will you take you to folder containing your app .app file. If you want .ipa file just drag and drop the .app file into itunes it will convert that into itunes file and again rightclik and show in finder will give you the ipa file
