While PHP can be used as a general purpose programming language, it is DESIGNED for use in webpages. It's NOT a good choice for general systems programming use, nor is it particularly suited to any standalone application, particularly one involving sockets. Instead, learn python. It's different from C or Java. It's a general purpose programming language, has widespread adoption, supports the various system calls you'll be wanting, if you're doing a socket-based application, and has better overall language design. If you don't believe me, go look at the naming for string functions in php. It grew organically, and it suffers from it.
