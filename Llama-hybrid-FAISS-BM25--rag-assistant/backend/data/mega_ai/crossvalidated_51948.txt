Bayesian inference with Gaussian distributions

This is Problem 4(c), Chapter 2 from Thrun's Probabilistic Robotics . Note that this is self-study and not homework. Suppose I know my position $x$ to be a normal distribution with density $N(\mu_1=1000,\sigma_1^2=900)$. I query a position sensor, which outputs a measurement $z=1100$; however this sensor is faulty, and its output is a normal distribution with variance $\sigma_2^2=100$. Given the prior probability and sensor error, how likely is it that the measurement was the given value,$z$ = $1100$? Given that $p(x) = N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$ and $p(z|x) = N(\mu_2=1100,\sigma_2)$, the updated position is given by Bayes' rule: $p(x|z) = \frac{N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)N(\mu_2,\sigma_2)}{\int_{\mathbb{R}}N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)N(\mu_2,\sigma_2)dx} $ I found that $p(x|z) = N(\mu=1090,\sigma^2=90)$. But I am unable to take this reasoning further, and am unclear of whether I made any progress. Can you help?
