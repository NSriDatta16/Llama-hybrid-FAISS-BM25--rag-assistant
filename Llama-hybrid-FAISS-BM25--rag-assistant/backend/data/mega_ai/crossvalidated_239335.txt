Analyzing reaction time data by implementing GAMM analyses with non-normal distribution parameters

I have two questions, a conceptual one and a practical one (that are closely related). And just as a note, I'm not super familiar with this level of stats (much more comfortable with simple linear regression and ANOVA), so apologies if there are oversimplifications/obvious conceptual issues at play here. First: There are clearly issues with using means to analyze reaction time data because RT data are not normally distributed. An appropriate distribution that's frequently referenced is the ex-Gaussian distribution. Because I wanted to implement an analysis using an appropriate distribution without transforming the data I looked into using the GAMLSS package to run the analysis. But then I go back to the literature and what I see is that the ex-Gaussian parameters (mu, sigma, and tau) are being extracted from the gam model and then being used in a GLMM. So the question is: why not just report and interpret the gam model with an ex-Gaussian distribution? Is there anything incorrect about doing so in order to examine these data with a non-normal distribution? Second: a brief rundown of the study then the questions (sample output is at the end). Participants completed a simple RT task at two timepoints at two different locations. The RT task has a condition called valence with three levels. Participants are randomized to watch 1 of 2 videos at both timepoints. Participants complete a measure called STAI once. Variables: location (w/in factor with two levels); valence (w/in factor with three levels); video (between factor with two levels); STAI (continuous variable). Random intercepts are included for individual participants. There are a few things I don't understand about GAMLSS: 1) The output is different when I include different estimation parameters (so if I include only mu in the formula e.g. gamlss(formula = RT~location, data=data) it's different from gamlss(RT~location, sigma.fo = ~location, nu.fo = ~location, data=data) Any thoughts on why this is the case? Are fit statistics reliable between these two models? I post an example output with the mu and nu formulas only at the end. 2) This is a continuation of the first part: my understanding of interpreting the parameters is that they each refer to a distinct component (mu refers to mean; sigma to sd; tau to the exponential component of the mean and sd). So if location (which strongly influences RT in every model I try and run except when I included the tau component in the analysis) is significant for tau, but not mu - does this mean that the real explanation for the difference of location on RTs is not global (i.e. average) but somehow explained by the exponential convolution of the mean and sd? How would I explain this? Below I provide an example output of the model I ran first with all formulas, then only the mu and nu formula (gamlss refers to nu, but it's actually equivalent to tau in the context of the exGAUS distribution, I think?).
