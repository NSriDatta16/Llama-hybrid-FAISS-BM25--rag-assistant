How can I get an average for a row in a matrix

Have a matrix report now that has Position, Hours and Wages for a location for a month. There may be any number of locations...that's why I'm starting with a Matrix report...the user may chose up to 50 locations to view. Location 1 Location 2 Total Hrs Amount Total Hrs Amount Position1 441.68 $4,201.46 556.73 $6,103.67 We would like to get an average by position for that month, like so Location 1 Location 2 Avg Total Hrs Amount Total Hrs Amount Avg Hrs Position1 441.68 $4,201.46 556.73 $6,103.67 499.20 Can't quite figure out how to get this to work in SSRS 2005...
