WPF: Apply a RenderTransform such that GetPosition is relative to center, not top-left

I am trying to drag the circle at A around so that it produces an angle relative to the hidden center element, B. I'm using MouseEventArgs.GetPosition(IInputElement relativeTo) , so: Point p = args.GetPosition(B) I'm getting points relative to the top-left of B, not its center, despite setting a RenderTransformOrigin of 0.5, 0.5 on B. I know that I can compute the correct offset manually: Easiest way to get the angle of mouse position in WPF relative to the center of a circle
