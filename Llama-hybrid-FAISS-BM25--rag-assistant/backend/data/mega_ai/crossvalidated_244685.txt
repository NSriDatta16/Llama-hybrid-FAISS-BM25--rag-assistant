Not a complete answer, but more of a 'too big for comments' pointer: I'd start by looking for generalisations of Bayesian nonparametric hidden markov models combined with markov decision processes. Here's a paper I found using that as the base for a search: 'The Infinite Partially Observable Markov Decision Process' (NIPS '09). I've not read it carefully, but there appear to be some interesting references for other elements of your question (non-stationarity, finite case algorithms). On non-stationarity, and take this with a pinch of salt, but Dirichlet Process based models can fit very complex data, to the extent where you might find that sets of states are active for finite stretches of your time series (i.e. achieve non-stationarity, possibly at the price of complexity).
