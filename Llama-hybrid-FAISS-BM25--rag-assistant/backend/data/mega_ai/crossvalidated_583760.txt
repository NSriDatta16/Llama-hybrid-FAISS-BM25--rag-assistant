The book I was reading pointed out in a later chapter the obvious that I had missed. By learning to work on Markov chains analytically, it's possible to derive probabilities that are functions of inputs of high dimension, and answer more interesting counterfactuals in the form of "if I vary this one parameter out of five, what happens to the quantities involved?" This is technically possible also numerically, but the higher dimensions of inputs start to hurt sooner -- both computationally and in trying to interpret the results, as they will always be conditional on a bunch of other values.
