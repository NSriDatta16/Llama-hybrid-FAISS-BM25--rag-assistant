That means every 100 bits in the 1 bit image correspond to 1 pixel in the new image. You'd need to average the value over 10x10 1bit pixel area. For smoother greyscales, you'd better average over n bits where n is the bit depth of your target pixel, overlying the calculated area partially with neighbor areas (16x16px squares 10x10px apart, so their borders overlay, for a smooth 8-bit grayscale.)
