Understanding standard errors in logistic regression

I am having trouble understanding the meaning of the standard errors in my thesis analysis and whether they indicate that my data (and the estimates) are not good enough. I am performing an analysis with Stata, on immigrant-native gap in school performance (dependent variable = good / bad results) controlling for a variety of regressors. I used both logit and OLS and I adjusted for cluster at the school level. The regressors which are giving me trouble are some interaction terms between a dummy for country of origin and a dummy for having foreign friends (I included both base-variables in the model as well). In the logit estimation, more than one of the country*friend variables have a SE greater than 1 (up to 1.80 or so), and some of them are significant as well. This does not happen with the OLS. I am really confused on how to interpret this. I have always understood that high standard errors are not really a good sign, because it means that your data are too spread out. But still (some of) the coefficients are significant, which works perfect for me because it is the result I was looking for. Can I just ignore the SE? Or does it raise a red flag regarding my results? I usually just ignore the SE in regressions (I know, it is not really what one should do) but I can't recall any other example with such huge SE values.
