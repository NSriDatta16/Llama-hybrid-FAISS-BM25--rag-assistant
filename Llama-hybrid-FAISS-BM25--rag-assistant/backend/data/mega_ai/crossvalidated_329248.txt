In it necessary to split train, test, validation dataset for unsupervised machine learning algorithm (eg. autoencoder)?

Generally in supervised machine learning algorithms, the model performance is measured splitting train, test, validation set. But in case of unsupervised method , like autoencoder, is it necessary to have such split ? Can't the training dataset itself be a test set to evaluate its performance ?
