Linq-To-SQL CreateDatabase doesn't create stored procedures

to-SQL DataContext and I run: datacontext.CreateDatabase() This works fine. Recently I dragged a stored procedure onto the methods pane. I was thinking this stored procedure was now part of the datacontext and would get regenerated when creating the database. It doesn't seem to. Does anyone know why or how to make it happen?
