Sorry to ask a question but I don't have enough rep to comment. Do you have to use this dataset? https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/btc-usd-historical-data This dataset contains all close prices including weekends (you can adjust the amount of time but it does only have data going back to 2012 if that's a concern). If not you should use imputation, in R there are many packages to do this, careful which one you choose though because your data is almost certainly autocorrelated. While I have not used it myself, the 'imputets' package is supposedly a strong choice for imputing the values in R, also consider 'amelia' (uses bootstraping, which would be better and less biased). You could take a moving average to impute the data yourself if you prefer, but I think if you can use a dataset that has the actual values you should, what if volatility spikes on weekends, or conversely, there's less vol on the weekends because major firms that trade in the currency may not be actively trading? If you can't find a full dataset, a time series specific imputation would be most efficient and least biased, compared to an average.
