Do we need to write our own middle-ware, or we can make use of available reporting tool

Previously, we have a legacy system, which we are using C++ code to generate reports in Text file and Excel file. However, it is a pain to perform manual coding to perform all the raw data processing and report format rendering. Recently, we had success to migrate all the raw data into SQL database. To avoid writing manual code, we decide to evaluate the following tool. JasperReports - Able to help us perform report format rendering? OpenReport - Provides us web access to the generated report? Currently, our raw data looks something like : Based on the demo provided by OpenReport and JasperReports, I believe we can generate a report like Summary Report for Lot 2 ------------------------ Measurement Type Value ---------------------------------- Lead 1 Average 1.30 Lead 1 StdDev 0.16 . . Lead 2 Average 2.08 Lead 2 StdDev 0.55 However, this is a little far than what we want. What we want is to able Take the multiple rows of Lead 1, 2, 3 ... under Average category, and have a logic code function to recalculate them into a single Lead row. Do the same for rest of the statistics like StdDev... Have a report format like : Summary Report for Lot 2 ------------------------ Measurement Average StdDev ---------------------------------- Lead 2.33 1.23 So far for the demo that I had seen, most of them are just 1 to 1 mapping from raw database to report. In the middle of 1 to 1 mapping , I know there can be some simple SQL statement for filtering and manipulation. I haven't seen an example which can perform a sophisticated processing. The reason I call it sophisticated , as in C++ code, we require to perform std::string processing, making use of std::vector, std::map data structure and arithmetic operation. I am doubt SQL statement can perform similar. Based on my listed 3 requirement, is it possible that I can use available reporting tool in the market to generate report? Or we need to develop our own middle-ware to perform such task? (Perl/ Python/ ... whatever)
