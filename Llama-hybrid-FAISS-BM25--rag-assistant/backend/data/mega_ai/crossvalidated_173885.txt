Comparing which set better represents data

Here's the question/assignment: Twenty football players practised goal shooting, each had 6 attempts. Here's the per-player score results: $$ \begin{array} {|r|r|} \hline 4 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 6 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 3 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ a) Make a frequency table (proper terminology might've been lost in my translation) b) Calculate $M_o$ (Mod) and explain the meaning of it. c) On the second training the average goals was $ 3.7 $, with a standard deviation of $ 0.8 $. For which training does the mean ($\overline{x}$) better represent the set? My question is mostly about c , but I'll put my solutions for a and b , too in case they help with explaining c . My friend wrote on the margins next to c "standardizing", but I am not sure if they're related. Which is actually why this confuses me so much! I haven't got the slightest idea on how to apply satandization here. I'd have just calculated the standard deviation ($\sigma$) for both sets and decide the one with the smaller standard deviation more accurately represents the set, because the values are more " densely " together. EDIT I don't need the actual solution (although I don't mind if it helps in explaining), a small guide on how to get to it would suffice. a) Frequency table $$ \begin{array} {|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline x_i & f_i & f_i x_i & f_i(x_i - \overline{x})^2 & N_i \\ \hline 1 & 3 & 3 & 16.5675 & 3 \\ \hline 2 & 5 & 10 & 9.1125 & 8 \\ \hline 3 & 3 & 9 & 0.3675 & 11 \\ \hline 4 & 3 & 12 & 1.2675 & 14 \\ \hline 5 & 3 & 15 & 8.1675 & 17 \\ \hline 6 & 3 & 18 & 21.0675 & 20 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ (Seems you can't do Markdown tables, so I resorted to a $\LaTeX$ array) b) Mod This one is easy( I think ). It's just the $x_i$ from the row with the largest $f_i$: $$ M_o = 2 $$ c) Which set is a better representation of the team's skill? First Set $$ \overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{f_ix_i}}{N} = \frac{67}{20} = 3.35 $$ $$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{f_i(x_i-\overline{x})^2}}{N}} = \sqrt{\frac{56.55}{20}} = 1.725 $$ Second Set $ \overline{x} = 3.7 $ $ \sigma = 0.8 $
