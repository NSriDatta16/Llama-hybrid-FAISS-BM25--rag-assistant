If you want to do something in .NET related to game development, your best way would be to use the .NET XNA Framework . As far as making the gameboard, you'll need to learn how to program video games; there's really no 'built in' drag-and-drop create-a-board-game framework. Looks like someone has a tutorial on how to create a 'board based' game in XNA 4.0.
