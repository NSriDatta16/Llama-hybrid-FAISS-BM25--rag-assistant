Decision making in different intervals in MDPs

I want to model a problem as an MDP model where every day is divided into small time slots (for example minutes) and two decisions A and B should be optimized. At the beginning of every day, both decisions are made. However, the decision B for other time slots on the same day are constant and should not be changed. That is, if decision B is made at 7 A.M., the same decision is repeated over 7:01, 7:02, ...., However, it is possible to change decision A without any problem. I willing to know if this problem can be modeled as an MDP and in case of possibility, how it is possible? If there is any paper which has addressed the same assumption, I would be thankful to know. Thanks
