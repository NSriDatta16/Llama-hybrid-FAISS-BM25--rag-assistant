How to calculate the RMSPE when the data contains zeros?

I made some predictions with my model and measured its performance using the RMSE. I cannot compare the errors between predictions because some time series have different scales. Some in the 1000's other in the 1000000's. So I decided to use the RMSPE as stated in RMSE is scale-dependent; is RMSE%? My problem is that some of my time series data contain zeros in it as legitimate values and the RMSPE occasionally gives a division by zero. I thought of adding a very small value like 0.000001 to the denominator just to prevent the division by zero but is there a better way of doing this?
