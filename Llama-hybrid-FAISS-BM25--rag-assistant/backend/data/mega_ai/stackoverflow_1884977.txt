Check out Microsoft Stubs that has the simple premise of: Replace any .NET method with your own delegate! And a more detailed description of it's capabilities (emphasis is mine). Stubs is a lightweight framework for test stubs and detours in .NET that is entirely based on delegates, type safe, refactorable and source code generated. Stubs was designed provide a minimal overhead to the Pex white box analysis, support the Code Contracts runtime writer and encourage the programmatic models rather than record/replay tests. Stubs may be used on any .NET method, including non-virtual/static methods in sealed types.
