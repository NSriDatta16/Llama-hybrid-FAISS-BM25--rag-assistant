With Eclipse Galileo (3.5) or Helios (3.6), I would rather recommend an external directory called 'mydropins' (for instance), which you can reference from your eclipse.ini , with the option: -Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=C:/Prog/Java/eclipse_addons This is called a shared dropins folder . See in this SO answer an example of plugin deployment in this shared dropins folder. (Your link refers to the previous provisioning mechanism, pre-p2. P2 is the new provisioning system introduced late in Eclipse3.4, refined (debugged?) in eclipse 3.5 and 3.6. See the supported dropins formats to check how you can organize your own personal dropins folder (that you can reuse between several eclipse installations) You said you are using: -Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=/home/taher/opt/eclipse/Third-party-eclipse-links That means, under /home/taher/opt/eclipse/Third-party-eclipse-links, you: won't have any .link file will copy: eclipse-cpp-helios-linux-gtk eclipse features plugins Note: the structure within eclipse-cpp-helios-linux-gtk should be the one describe above, for p2 to pick it up.
