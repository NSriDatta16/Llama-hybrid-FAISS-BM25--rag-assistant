ial intelligence operations remained covert; according to University of California, Berkeley professor Trevor Darrell, the company's secrecy deterred graduate students. The company started expanding its artificial intelligence team in 2015, opening up its operations by publishing more scientific papers and joining AI industry research groups. Apple reportedly acquired more AI companies from 2016 to 2020. In 2017, Apple released the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X with the A11 Bionic processor, which featured its first dedicated Neural Engine for accelerating common machine learning tasks. Despite its investments in artificial intelligence, Siri was criticized both by reviewers and internally at Apple for lagging behind other AI assistants. The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence and the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 reportedly blindsided Apple executives and forced the company to refocus its efforts on AI. In an interview with Good Morning America, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that generative AI had "great promise" but had some potential dangers, and that it was "looking closely" at ChatGPT. It was first reported in July 2023 that Apple was creating its own internal large language model, codenamed "Ajax". In October 2023, Apple was reportedly on track to release new generative AI features into its operating systems by 2024, including a significantly redeveloped Siri. In an earnings call in February 2024, Cook stated that the company was spending a "tremendous amount of time and effort" into AI features that would be shared "later that year". Release timeline Language support Supported devices All Macs and iPads with an M-series Apple silicon chip support Apple Intelligence with macOS 15.1 and iPadOS 18.1 and later, respectively. iPhones and iPads with the A17 Pro chip or later are also supported with iOS 18.1 and later Apple claims the less capable Neural Engine of older chips, which is used for AI tasks, are not powerful enough for Apple Intelligence features. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo speculates that the RAM requirements of the on-device model prohibits Apple Intelligence from running on older iPhone models. On March 31, 2025, Apple Intelligence was introduced to the Apple Vision Pro with the release of visionOS 2.4. Apple Intelligence cannot be used on Macs if the operating system is booted off of an external drive, but workarounds exist to circumvent the limitation.

Allison Johnson of The Verge found the release "underwhelming", but noted that features like notification summarization was "a little more promising". News summary controversy In December 2024, the BBC sent a complaint to Apple over its notification summary feature falsely stating the BBC News app to have reported that Luigi Mangione, then recently arrested following the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had killed himself. In January 2025, the BBC followed up its complaint highlighting further incorrect summaries of its stories, such as announcing that Luke Littler had won the PDC World Darts Championship hours before the final had even taken place (though he did win), and that "Brazilian tennis player" Rafael Nadal (who is actually Spanish) had come out as gay, a story that was in reality about Brazilian player Jo√£o Lucas Reis da Silva. In a response to the BBC, an Apple spokesperson clarified that all Apple Intelligence features were still in beta and were being continu
