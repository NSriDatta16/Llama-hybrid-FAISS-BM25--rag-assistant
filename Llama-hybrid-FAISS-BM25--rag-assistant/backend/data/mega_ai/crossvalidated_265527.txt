If your question is whether territory abandonment is associated with any of the environmental variables then a sensible starting point would be to carry out a logistic regression. Use "abandoned" as your response variable (but changing "n" to 0 and "y" to 1) and the environmental variables as your predictors. Because there is only one dependent variable ("abandoned") this is a univariate analysis, not a mutlivariate analysis. The repeated measures aspect of your question doesn't really apply. In order to ask if there is abandonment of territories then you must have measured the same territory more than once. But it isn't necessary to account for this in the model structure because you aren't including the occupancy status of the territories in 1990 and 2017, only whether the occupancy has changed. You might also want to add some other predictors: the difference in temperature, precipitation and forest cover between the two time points. This will allow you to look at whether changes in these values are more important than the values themselves. You should carry out some preliminary data exploration and regression diagnostics to see whether the results are driven by extreme values or whether polynomial terms should be included (or the use of smoothing functions). I have provided links to some useful resources in another answer - Proportion / Percentage Regression Analysis methods Reply to further comments I think there are a couple of ways of looking at this problem. Firstly, you could treat "abandoned" as a predictor (an independent variable) and then say you have measured a number of attributes of each territory (temperature, precipitation, forest cover), these being the response variables (which would be linked because they are being measured in the same territory - that is, they are repeated measures). Then you could do a multivariate analysis to see whether the territories, when mapped in multivariate space, group separately depending on whether they are abandoned or not. One way to do this is to normalise the environmental variables, calculate euclidean distances, map out with non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and then determine whether the points map out in different parts of the multidimensional space using an ANOSIM test. However, it is stated in the comments that that territory is the dependent variable (i.e. the response that is of interest to you), and the question asks about GLMM which is an extension of GLM (and therefore logistic regression), and also asks about providing an explanation of the response in terms of the different environmental variables (they are acting as predictors). So, from this viewpoint I thought starting with a logistic regression seemed the most appropriate.
