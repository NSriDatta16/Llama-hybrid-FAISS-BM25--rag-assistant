Interesting. Session-scoped beans have their @Predestroy invoked when the session-close event occurs. If the container never sends that event, then Spring won't be informed. I'm not sure if this constitutes a bug or not, and if so, whetyer it's a bug in Spring or Tomcat. The latter seems more likely, but I don't know if a Servlet container is obliged to do this. If this is a show-stopper for you, you might want to consider having the scoped bean register itself with a "registrar" singleton during its @PostConstruct , and deregister itself on @PreDestroy . If the registrar is shutdown, it can propagate that event to any remaining session-scoped beans still registered with it. Not ideal, but a pragmatic solution.
