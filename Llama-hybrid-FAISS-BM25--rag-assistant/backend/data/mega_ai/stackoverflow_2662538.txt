This may sound a bit from the ivory tower, I hope not... If you'd base your algorithm not on a position but rather a vector, then you can notice to which direction an object is dragging. Your code kicks off once two positions (of which you can form a vector) are available. Then you should be able to figure out whether the user is moving towards or away from the edge Some more on a vector: Since you are having a x,y coordinate system, you can break down such a vector into its x,y parts. Take any two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), then you can imagine a vector as a line that connects the two points. That line and e.g. the x-axis form an angle which would tell you to which direction that line is pointing to. In your case you'd get away with comparing x2 and x1. Is x2 bigger, then the user is moving to the right. Is y2 bigger than y1 it is moving to the top and similar comparisons for the other directions...
