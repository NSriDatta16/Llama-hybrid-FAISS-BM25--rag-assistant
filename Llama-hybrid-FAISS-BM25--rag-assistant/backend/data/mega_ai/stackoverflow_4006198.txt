Proper way to handle button clicks in asp.net mvc?

I'm making a webpage ( http://example.com/calculation/ ). This site will do simple calculations. The page will present the user with two input fields in the form of text boxes (asp:TextBox). I'm wondering how do I go about handling clicking on the "Calc" button (asp:Button)? Do I use the controller for the page since I'm using MVC template? How should I organize my code? I want to fetch the users input in the two text boxes and output the value in a "result" label.
