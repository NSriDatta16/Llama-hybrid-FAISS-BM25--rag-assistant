Aggregation of daily correlations to different frequencies

After using the DCC-GARCH model to find the estimated correlations between 2 time series, I would like to perform linear regression with these daily correlations as my dependent variable and test the influential significance of several independent variables (ex: CPI, long term interest rate ...). The problem is that the correlations are of daily frequency, while the independent variables are of monthly and yearly frequency. A suggestion from my professor is to aggregate the daily correlations to monthly and yearly frequency to perform the regression, but I can not seem to figure out how to do it. What is an effective way of performing this procedure?
