Well, actually, you can call a single method. But within this method, you may accomplish several things. For example close a window and open another. It's not necessary to create a complete class - which would correspond to a .m file. You just add another method - (IBAction) doIt:(id) sender to an existing class file. Connect this to your button in IB. Therefore, you set "File's Owner" to the class where your IBAction is (or, better, put the IBAction method in "File's Owner" class file). In interface builder, select menu item File>Reload all class files Now, right click "File's Owner" in interface builder. You should see your action there. Drag the round circle on the right of the popup to your button. Now, each time your button is clicked, the method should be called.
