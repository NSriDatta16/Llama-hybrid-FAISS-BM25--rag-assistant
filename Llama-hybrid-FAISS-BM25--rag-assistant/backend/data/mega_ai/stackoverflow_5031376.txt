ForeignObject is probably the answer why it doesn't work. Given that your svg is quite simple, I'd suggest removing the foreignObjects and using svg text and tspan elements instead. That should make it work in all browsers. And seeing how you used inkscape to create the svg it could have done all the linewrapping etc for you anyway. From other answer about flow-elements in inkscape: Inkscape can generate and for you quite easily, just don't click and drag an area but instead just click where you want the text and start writing, then press return where you want a new line. I'm not sure if IE9 supports foreignObject. There's a way to do automatic linewrapping in svg tiny 1.2, which is supported in Opera, a workaround solution could look something like this . But to get IE9 compat too, you'll probably have to go with text+tspan.
