How to detect perfect separation of logistic regression?

I have same error message as in this post . However all my coefficients look normal with no inflated value or standard errors. My question is how can I make sure the error message is a sign of perfect separation or it's just some of my observations have extreme predicted probabilities? Also, my model has Residual deviance=Inf and AIC=Inf, would they suggest that there is no perfect separation as they are measures of goodness of fit?
