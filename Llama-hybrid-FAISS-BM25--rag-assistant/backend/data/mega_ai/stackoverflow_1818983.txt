objective C switch problem

My code looks like down this: -(void)touchBegan:(HWPoint *)point { switch (self.states) { case HWDrawState: HWShape *shape = [[HWShapeManager sharedInstance] addShapeWithType:_shapeClass]; break; case HWSelectState: break; case HWDeleteState: break; default: break; } } Why is there a problem with HWShape.... ? I got an error with it: "error: expected expression before 'HWShape'". Why is that? Thank you very much for replys.
