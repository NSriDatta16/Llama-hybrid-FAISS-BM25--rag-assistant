Loss function for autoencoder on categorical data

I have some categorical variables that can take values {a,b,c}. I have a dataset of sequences of such variables E.g. x=[ (a,b,b), (b,c,a)...] I would like to apply some basic autoencoder to this dataset. I could derive some meaningful latent space representation by mapping each categorical value to an arbitrary input a->0, b->1 etc.... and by using a simple encoder decoder model with mse loss between source and reconstructed (arbitrarly mapped) sequence. What would be a more sound loss function in this case?
