This question is insanely broad… you should better go for an API documentation/tutorial... Python is usually the preferred porgramming language and two major API are used: scikit-learn for machine learning and Keras/tensorflow for Deep learning… (but there are quite a few more) I'll give you some links... You should firstly consult these kind of sources of information and coming here later on with more specific and detailed issues. Scikit-learn examples: https://scikit-learn.org/0.20/auto_examples/plot_anomaly_comparison.html (for your problem) https://towardsdatascience.com/5-powerful-scikit-learn-models-e9b12375320d (general) Really good blog with Machine/Deep Learning examples: https://machinelearningmastery.com/blog/ https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-python-deep-learning-library-keras/
