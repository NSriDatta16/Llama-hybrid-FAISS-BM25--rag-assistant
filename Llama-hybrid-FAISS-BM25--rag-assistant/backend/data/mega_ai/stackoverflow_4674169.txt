This isn't possible without your iframe workaround. The ability to access the same localStorage object from multiple domains would violate the Same origin policy,and the spec: User agents must raise a SECURITY_ERR exception whenever any of the members of a Storage object originally returned by the localStorage attribute are accessed by scripts whose effective script origin is not the same as the origin of the Document of the Window object on which the localStorage attribute was accessed. http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#security-localStorage If this wasn't for iPhone, I would suggest a flash solution. But with localStorage, I think you are out of luck until they implement a cross-domain policy.
