Bag of words: it's a model to represent you text as a bag of words, which ignore the order of the original text (If you only include unigram words). Naive Bayes/KNN/SVM are all machine learning classification approach by using the features(words) from bag of words model to predict. I think none of these methods take the order into consideration if you only include unigram words. If you incorporate N-gram words (bigram, trigram..) into your bag of words model, the order of these features/words will be taken care of in all machine learning models
