If you want just the version (rather than the whole string), you can do something like: -- Save this as (say) javaversion.sh #!/bin/sh # Changed code to remove the 'head -1' as per the suggestion in comment. JAVA_VERSION=`java -version 2>&1 |awk 'NR==1{ gsub(/"/,""); print $3 }'` # export JAVA_VERSION echo $JAVA_VERSION This gives: $ 1.6.0_15 On my system (damn it, even more out of date !! :-) ) I found '2>&1' necessary on my system, since the output seems to go to 'stderr' rather than 'stdout'. (2>&1 = send the output of standard error to the standard out stream; in this case so we can go ahead and process with the head etc...). The 'gsub' bit in the awk is necessary to remove the double-quotes in the string. (Global SUBstitue), $3 is the third field (awk defaults its field separator to white-space). The "backticks" ( ` ) are used so we can capture the output - and then we store it on a variable. [ Using 'cut' rather than 'awk' might be more elegant here - see GrzegorzOledzki's post.]
