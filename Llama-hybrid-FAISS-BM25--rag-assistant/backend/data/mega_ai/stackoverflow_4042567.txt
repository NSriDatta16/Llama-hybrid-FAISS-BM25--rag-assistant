MemoryStream "out of memory" C#

I have an implementation of a custom DataObject (Virtual File) see here . I have drag and drop functionality in a control view (drag and drop a file OUT of a control view without having a temp local file). This works fine with smaller files but as soon as the file is larger than say 12-15megs it says not enough memory available. seems like the memory stream is out of memory. what can i do about this? can i somehow split a larger byte[] into several memoryStreams and reassemble those to a single file? Any help would be highly appreciated.
