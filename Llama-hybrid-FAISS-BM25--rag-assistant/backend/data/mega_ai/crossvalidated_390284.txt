How to use trial and error algorithm to predict the next number in a sequence?

I have a time series data. I want to use trial and error algorithms to predict the next number in a variation_sequence. I mean about Trial and error algorithm is using an online learning and where I do not have any more information on the sequence. There is a possibility to use order-n Markov predictor. But I don't know which algorithm is suitable to order-n Markov predictor? If there is alternative possibility? import matplotlib.pyplot as plt year = [1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010] variation_sequence = [449.48, 553.57, 696.783, 870.133, 1000.4, 1309.1] plt.plot(year, variation, color='orange') plt.xlabel('Variation') plt.ylabel('year') plt.title('Variation of data') plt.show()
