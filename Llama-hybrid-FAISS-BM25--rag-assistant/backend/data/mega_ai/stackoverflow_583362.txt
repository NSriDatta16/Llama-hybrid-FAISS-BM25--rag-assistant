Your regex generates separate match for every single character outside g1,g2,g3. So when you use it with MatchEvaluator it generates lots of evaluator calls. Thats why its slow. If you try following regex: (? .*?)((? abc)|(? def)|(? ghi)|$) you will get single "rest" group match for entire fragment of text that doesnt contain "g" group. Regex C# code: Regex regex = new Regex( @"(? .*?)((? abc)|(? def)|(? ghi)|$)", RegexOptions.Singleline | RegexOptions.Compiled );
