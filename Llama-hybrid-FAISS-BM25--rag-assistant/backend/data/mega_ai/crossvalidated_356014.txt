Steps 1 and 2 have to be merged into one step. You can't evaluate different algorithms against each other without knowing what hyper-parameters to use for those algorithms. I am assuming that in step 1 you are using default parameters, so maybe linear regression beats random forest with default parameters, but maybe random forest with a different value for mtry would have beat linear regression.
