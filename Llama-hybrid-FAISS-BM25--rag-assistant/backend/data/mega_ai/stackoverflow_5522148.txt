Why won't basic UIScrollView with a few buttons scroll?

Why won't basic UIScrollView with a few buttons scroll? So all I have done is: Create a view based iPhone app drag in a UIScrollView into the main controller xib file the scrollview now sits as a child of View in IB in IB in scrollview increase it's view height up to 1000 add some buttons to the scroll view (so they appear as children of the scroll view) did create the instance variable also, and property IBOutlet, synthesize linked in IB the File Owner scrollView outlet to the scroll view checked to ensure the scroll view in IB had the attribute "scrolling enabled" ticked But still after all this in the iPhone simulator it won't let me scroll the view?
