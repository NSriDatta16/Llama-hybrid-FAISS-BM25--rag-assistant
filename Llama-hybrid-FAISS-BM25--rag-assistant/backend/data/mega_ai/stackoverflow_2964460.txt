Matching 3 out 5 fields - Django

I'm finding this a bit tricky! Maybe someone can help me on this one I have the following model: class Unicorn(models.Model): horn_length = models.IntegerField() skin_color = models.CharField() average_speed = models.IntegerField() magical = models.BooleanField() affinity = models.CharField() I would like to search for all similar unicorns having at least 3 fields in common. Is it too tricky? Or is it doable?
