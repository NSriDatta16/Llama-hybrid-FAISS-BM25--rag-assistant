I think the error is explicit enough. The app is too large in size for the internal storage. I think it's time to redesign your app. For instance you can download the mp3 file from the network on demand and then save it to the sdcard. BTW, if you plan to support just Android version > 2.2 you can add android:installLocation="preferExternal" into your manifest file and this should rid the problem
