Blocking Binomial Data (Bernoulli Trials)

Imagine you have a colony of roaches and you want to compare the efficacies of two insecticides. On one day you apply insecticide A to 50 insects and record your "outcome" as "1" (died) or "0" (survived). You do the same to insecticide B. But you know that the specific insect cohort makes a difference as well, so you repeat the trial with a new cohort on a different day. Ideally this blocking factor, "cohort", would be treated as a random effect, but the experiment cannot feasibly be repeated with enough cohort trials to effectively model it as a random effect. I want to know if, after controlling for the error attributable to "cohort", mean differences between treatments were still significant. Because I am familiar with R, I will use that to describe what I have unsuccessfully tried: I tried mod1 . Both insecticide and cohort were significant. Using {emmeans} I looked at emmeans(ref_grid(mod1), specs = "insecticide", type = "response") to look at the estimated marginal means of insecticide averaged over the mean of "cohort." I do not think this was the correct approach. Standard error estimates for insecticide treatments were far too small. Effectively (or so I think) the estimated marginal means pooled the data into 100 bernoulli trails per treatment rather than two series of grouped bernoulli trials. How do I skin this cat?
