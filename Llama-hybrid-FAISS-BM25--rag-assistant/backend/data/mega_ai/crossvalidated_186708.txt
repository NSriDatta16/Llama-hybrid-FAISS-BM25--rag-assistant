how to learn / imitate clustering algorithm?

I have a device which every 100 milliseconds receive 15 data-points, and return the same data-points divided into distinct subsets (each of size My end goal is to be able to imitate this device's logic, so given a set of 15 data-points, I could divide them into subsets in the same fashion as the device (luckily I'm allowed a low accuracy). how do I achieve that? It would also be very helpful if I could "understand" the logic so I could implement it in a hardware system (so deep neural networks which take a lot of time to spit the answer are less favorable then decision trees). The data-points are a bit nasty, as they have some simple attributes such as SNR, which the device probably clusters those with similar values together, and others where each value is a set of multiple vectors, and the device probably clusters those data-points which their vector-sets are most orthogonal to each other. Feel free to ignore the data-point problematic attributes and focus on the general problem.
