Calculate confidence intervals on accuracy metrics

I've trained a logistic regression model on sklearn and then used it on some sample data which outputted accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values. Is there a way I can use the number of samples tested to estimate some form of confidence intervals for these metrics? i.e. how confident am I that the accuracy is the calculate 87%, and can I calculate a range like 84%-90%? Many thanks
