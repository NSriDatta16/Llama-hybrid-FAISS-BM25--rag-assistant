I've studied this exact issue as part of my master's thesis. An alphabetical organization or organization based on public/private is better for being able to find specific things. However, in some IDEs you can set the outline tool to sort alphabetically and to use special indicators for public/private. My approach was to group methods based on what members they use: there is often a conceptual connection between methods that use the same fields. I actually created a visualization from that, which helped to quickly navigate and understand the structure of huge classes.
