How would i use Sevenzipsharp with this code?

iv tried numerous different ways to get this to work and i got it to basicly work but i cant get the WaitForExit(); 's to work like they do here... so how would i convert this to work with sevenzip? cause i cant get it to work, and also i the SFX's are passworded so that they cannot be accessed except by the use of the program and as for adding the 7z.DLL i cant add it in because i get the error: A reference to 7za.dll could not be added. please make sure that the file is accessible, and that it is a valid assembly or COM component. string tempFolder = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData); System.Diagnostics.Process defrag1 = System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(@"AusLogics_Defrag.exe", string.Format(" -o{0} -y -Pthisisthepass", tempFolder)); defrag1.WaitForExit(); string executableDirectoryName = Path.GetDirectoryName(Application.ExecutablePath); System.Diagnostics.Process defrag2 = System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(tempFolder + "\\" + "AusLogics_Defrag" + "\\" + "DiskDefrag.exe", ""); defrag2.WaitForExit(); System.IO.Directory.Delete(tempFolder + "\\" + "AusLogics_Defrag", true); new: ok well this is what i have so far but im getting that error "Can not load 7-zip library or internal COM error! Message: failed to load library" SevenZipExtractor.SetLibraryPath("7z.dll"); //no idea of this is needed or not SevenZipCompressor.SetLibraryPath("7z.dll"); //no idea of this is needed or not string tempFolder = Environment.GerFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData); SevenZipExtractor defrag = new SevenZipExtractor(@"Programs\Optimize\Auslogics_Defrag.7z"); defrag.ExtracArchive(string.Format("-o{0} -y -PThisisthepass", tempFolder));
