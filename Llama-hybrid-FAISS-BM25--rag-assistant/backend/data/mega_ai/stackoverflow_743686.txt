Determine where a function has been called with PHP

do you guys know how can i determine from what file was a function called inside of that function? I was thinking of using debug_backtrace .. but that does not look as an elegant way to do it, and they also enumarate other reasons in another question here So what other alternatives are there ? thanks a lot
