If K is a 1 x N matrix, then size(K) yields [1 N] . When you use it your for loop, it does not work because it is not a scalar (actually, and quite painfully, Matlab simply uses the first element to limit the loop, and does not even issue a warning). Instead, write: for ii=1:numel(K) Xsol(ii) = (K(ii) - average/2) ; Xsag(ii) = (K(ii) + average/2) ; end The function numel returns a scalar, i.e., the total number of elements. However, as pointed out by @Jonas, you do not need a loop in this case. In general, loops are extremely slow as compared to array operations.
