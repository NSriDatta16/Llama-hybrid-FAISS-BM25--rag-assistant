Based on the limited data you presented, Neural Network #1 is better. The metric (accuracy) for both the training and test set are comparable, whereas the second network its overfitted for two reasons: Training metric is higher than test Training metric is 100%!!! In the general case (new or old unseen data) the overfitted model is likely to perform less well. What you shouldn't do is combine scores from the training and test set to generate some weird total.
