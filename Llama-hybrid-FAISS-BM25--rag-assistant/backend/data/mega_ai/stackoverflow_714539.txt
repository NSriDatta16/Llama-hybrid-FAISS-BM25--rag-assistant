What about Google Gears. It is made for offline storage, but I think it might work. http://code.google.com/apis/gears/design.html From the documentation: Storing User's Data Applications that are more than just static files have data that is typically stored on the server. For the application to be useful offline, this data must be accessible locally. The Database module provides a relational database for storing data. On the Architecture page you will find a discussion of strategies for designing the local storage that your application needs. When an offline application reconnects, you will need to synchronize any changes made in the local database with the server. There are many different approaches to synchronizing data, and there is no single perfect approach. The Architecture page describes some strategies for synching. An additional feature of the Gears database is Full-Text Search, providing a fast way to search text within a database file. Read the details here.
