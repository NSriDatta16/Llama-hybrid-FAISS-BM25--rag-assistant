Does the coefficient from regressing a binary variable on a binary outcome only show the effect of when that binary variable is true?

I have a conditional fixed effects logistic regression of parental health shocks (0 if no shock, 1 if health shock) and clinically problematic child development (0 if no development problems in the child, 1 if development problems in the child). I have 3 waves of panel longitudinal data. When I look at the coefficient on parental health shock I assume I am looking at an effect of health shock being true on the effect of problematic development being true. I recently read a thread which made me wonder, although I consider the coefficient as a change from binary no health shock (0) to binary health shock (1) on a change from no binary developmental problem (0) to binary developmental problem (1), does the effect of a change in the opposite direction, from binary health shock (1) to binary no health shock (0), also enter into the coefficient or screw up my results in some other way? For example, I assume that across the 3 waves parents with binary health shock values of 0,0,1 are included in the analysis but parents with health shock values 1,1,0 wouldn't contribute anything? Am I wrong? What does this imply for the coefficient of health shock on development I report, is is an effect of both health getting better and health getting worse? Or is it just the effect of a health decline on a developmental decline?
