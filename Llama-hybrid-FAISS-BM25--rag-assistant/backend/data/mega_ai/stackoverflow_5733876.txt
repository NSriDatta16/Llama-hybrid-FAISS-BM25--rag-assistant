TextBox OnClick event without Javascript

I have a textbox which I want it to be fired on Click. I read some forum in which I wrapped in LinkButton. Here is my mockup UI part: And this is my code behind: protected virtual void txtAgentName_TextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { } And it seems like it is not firing up! I dont want to use Javascript :-P
