Checking existence of file types via extensions bash

I need to test if various file types exist in a directory. I've tried $ [ -f *.$fileext] where fileext is the file extension but that does not seem to work. Both of these methods work function checkext() { fileext=$1 ls *.$fileext>/dev/null 2>&1 if [ $? -eq 0 ] then echo "We have $fileext files!" else echo "We don't have any $fileext files!" fi } and function checkext2() { extention=$1 filescheck=(`ls *.$1`) len=${#filescheck[*]} if [ $len -gt 0 ] then echo "We have $extention files!" else if [ $len -eq 0 ] then echo "We don't have any $extention files!" else echo "Error" fi fi } The second method is less tidy as any ls error is shown so I prefer method 1. Could people please suggest any improvements, more elegant solutions e.t.c
