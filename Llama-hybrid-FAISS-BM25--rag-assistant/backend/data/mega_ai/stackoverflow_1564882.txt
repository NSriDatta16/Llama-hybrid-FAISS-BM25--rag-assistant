The Red Book is the standard book on OpenGL. Don't be discouraged by the fact that the Amazon review for the 7th Edition has only two stars; this is because people are disappointed that there isn't more on the newest OpenGL features in the book. Previous editions got more stars. Another good book is the OpenGL SuperBible . The NeHe Tutorials are one of the most often cited OpenGL tutorials, with sample code not only in C++ but in many other programming languages.
