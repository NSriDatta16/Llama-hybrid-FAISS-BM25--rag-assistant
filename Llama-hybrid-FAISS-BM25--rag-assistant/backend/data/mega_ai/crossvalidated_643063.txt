Autocorrelation of discontinuous time series data

I am attempting to perform an autocorrelation study using python on a discontinuous time series dataset. To share a bit about how my data looks like, it is a single column of values, which spans over 18 time slots per day, for multiple days. My problem is that if I use the "traditional" autocorrelation function plot found in the statsmodels package to compute the autocorrelation with the first lag for example, I fear that the first slot of the 2nd day will have as its first lag the 18th (last) slot of the previous day. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? Should I compute the autocorrelation for each day on its own and then average the values? Or is there another way of doing this? Thanks!
