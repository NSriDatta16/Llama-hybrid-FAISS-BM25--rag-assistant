You can use the counts from your confusion matrix to simulate data in the long format that SPSS expects. As a very simple example, imagine your four cells of the confusion matrix were 1, 2, 3, 4 (instead of 100, 20, 40, 100). Create 1 example of include-include, 2 examples of include-exclude, 3 examples of exclude-include, and 4 examples of exclude-exclude: RaterA RaterB Include Include Include Exclude Include Exclude Exclude Include Exclude Include Exclude Include Exclude Exclude Exclude Exclude Exclude Exclude Exclude Exclude Update: Here is the formula for the two-rater unweighted Cohen's kappa when there is no missing ratings and the ratings are organized in a contingency table. $$\hat{\kappa} = \frac{p_a - p_e}{1 - p_e}$$ $$p_a = \sum_{k=1}^q p_{kk}$$ $$p_e = \sum_{k=1}^q p_{k+} p_{+k}$$ Here is the formula for the variance of the two-rater unweighted Cohen's kappa assuming the same. $$v(\hat{\kappa}) = \frac{1-f}{n(1-p_e)^2}\left(p_a(1-p_a)-4(1-\hat{\kappa}\left(\sum_{k=1}^qp_{kk}\hat{\pi}_k - p_a p_e\right) + 4(1-\hat{\kappa})^2\left(\sum_{k=1}^q\sum_{l=1}^qp_{kl}((p_{Al}+p_{Bk})/2)^2 - p_e^2\right)\right)$$ From this variance estimate, you can compute the standard error and calculate a $p$ -value and confidence interval. See Gwet (2014) page 142 for more information.
