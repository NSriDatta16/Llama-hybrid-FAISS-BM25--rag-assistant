How to code an SVM's equation including kernels?

So I need to code an SVM from bottom up in Python, and I cannot use stuff like libSVM or scikit-learn, for reasons of my own. Referring to Andrew Ng's excellent notes on Support Vector Machines , I need to specifically implement the second equation on page 20, $$\max_\alpha W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i - \frac 1 2 \sum_{i,j=1}^m(y^{(i)} \times y^{(j)} \times \alpha_i \times \alpha_j \times \langle x_i, x_j\rangle)$$ Subject to the given constraints, $\sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i y_i = 0$, and $0 \le \alpha_i \le C$. Does someone have the code for this in any language, or can explain the intuition behind coding this? Most SVM implementations I could find either stick to scikit-learn or neglect kernel functions altogether. While I am working in Python, I would try to understand code in any language.
