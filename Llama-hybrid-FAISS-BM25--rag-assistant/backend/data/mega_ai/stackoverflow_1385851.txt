Are you updating the table each time the user moves a item? If yes, then you can store the order of items in the database as a as linked list . Each item will know his parent - the item which is on top of him. The move of one item to some other place will need 3 database updates, which will change the parents. If you have this order of elements : A B C D E and drag B between D and E so you have A C D B E So instead of the "order" column in your database you would have a "id_parent" column which would point to the element which is one place up. And in this example you would do : UPDATE C set parent = 'A' UPDATE B set parent = 'D' UPDATE E set parent = 'B'
