MD5 code kata and BDD

I was thinking to implement MD5 as a code kata and wanted to use BDD to drive the design (I am a BDD newb). However, the only test I can think of starting with is to pass in an empty string, and the simplest thing that will work is embedding the hash in my program and returning that. The logical extension of this is that I end up embedding the hash in my solution for every test and switching on the input to decide what to return. Which of course will not result in a working MD5 program. One of my difficulties is that there should only be one public function: public static string MD5(input byte[]) And I don't see how to test the internals. Is my approach completely flawed or is MD5 unsuitable for BDD?
