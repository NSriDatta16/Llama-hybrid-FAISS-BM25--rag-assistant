If each paragraph is wrapped in a p tag then you could do something like this (example is significantly with jquery but wouldn't be too bad with just javascript) content: script: $('#wrapper:nth-child(2)').append("SOME OTHER COOL STUFF IN BETWEEN"); as regular javascript var p3 = document.getElementById('#wrapper').childNodes[2]; var text = document.createElement("p"); text.innerHTML = "SOME OTHER COOL STUFF IN BETWEEN"; p3.insertBefore(text,p3);
