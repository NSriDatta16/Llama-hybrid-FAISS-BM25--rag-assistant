Do I need to detrend & deseasonalize the times series with lag 1 and lag 12 differencing before applying an ets model on it? Does your series have a unit root or a seasonal unit root? If not, why would you consider taking lag 1 or lag 12 differences? (Eyeballing your series does not suggest that.) Each would introduce a unit-root moving-average component into your process and increase your error variance (the first would double it, the other I am not sure by how much). In general, removing a deterministic trend and/or non-unit-root seasonality by differencing is not a good idea.
