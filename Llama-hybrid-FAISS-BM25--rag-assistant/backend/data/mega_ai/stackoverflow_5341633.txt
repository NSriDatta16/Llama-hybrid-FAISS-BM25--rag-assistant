I had the same issue, but I got it to work eventually. I had to use the btouch tool, on the latest version of Google Analytics for iOS . This recreated the GANTracker.dll. I also added this to my project file under iPhone Build->Additional mtouch Args: -v -v -v -gcc_flags "-L${ProjectDir}/Google -lGoogleAnalytics -lsqlite3.0 -force_load ${ProjectDir}/Google/libGoogleAnalytics.a" I have a Google subfolder in my project with these files: GANTracker.dll GANTracker.h libGoogleAnalytics.a Sorry, I don't have more specific instructions on btouch, it's been a while.
