This seems to be a pretty straightforward multinomial logistic regression problem. You have 6 mutually exclusive unordered outcomes (the vote choice) and a set of predictors, evidently with complete data. The regression would directly evaluate the log-odds of choosing each of 5 parties against one party chosen as a reference, as a function of your predictor values (essentially 5 binary logistic regressions done together). You can then express results as probabilities for each of the 6 parties. From the data sample you show, you might need to put your data into a wide form, with 1 row per individual.* The outcome would be the party choice, represented as an unordered categorical variable. In the process you would place the cand_eval values currently in separate rows for each party and individual into separate columns, one specific to each of the 6 parties, for each individual. Then you could examine the interaction between those party candidate evaluation metrics and political knowledge via interaction terms. Even though the political knowledge measure is constant for each individual, those interaction terms (and the candidate evaluations) wouldn't be. Measures that combine information from all of the 6 cand_eval values for each individual could also be considered as predictors. This UCLA website has links to how to perform multinomial logistic regression with any of 5 different software packages. *There might be a way to do the multinomial logistic regression directly with the data as currently formatted, but I'm not sure. Moving from long-form data into wide form is now nicely supported by tools in the R tidyverse .
