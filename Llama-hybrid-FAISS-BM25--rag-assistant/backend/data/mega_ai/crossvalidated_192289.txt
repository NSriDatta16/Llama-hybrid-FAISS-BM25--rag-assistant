Performance evaluation measures for binary random forest classifier

I am using Random forest (Matlab) to classify the binary data. Broadly, the input to the random forest is number of features and class label. And random forest, after training, return the labels for "unseen" data (30% of the overall data). I have two (very basic) questions related to performance evaluation: I don't have any threshold, I am using simple random forest implementation in Matlab. Is there any way to compute ROC curve? Will the threshold be "number of tress"? (I am very new to ROC curves, just read about these) I already calculated TPR, FPR, F-scores and confusion matrix, are there any other performance evaluation measures for binary classification? Pointers or just names will be good help. Suggestions/Comments?
