C++ acknowledges upper and lower cases, so yes the above does conform. There is a difference between ABC and abc-they are completely different identifiers. However, using this distinction to make unique identifiers in the real world is discouraged because it practically guarantees you will mix them up at some point. Note that, int abc(); int abc(); is illegal, but int abc(); int ABC(); is not.
