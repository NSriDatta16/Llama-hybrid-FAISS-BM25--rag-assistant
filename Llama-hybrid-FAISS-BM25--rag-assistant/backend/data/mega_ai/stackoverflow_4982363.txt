You don't, generally. There are two reasons you might want to do this: So that a single free() will release the entire block of memory. To avoid internal memory fragmentation. But unless you have an exceptional situation, neither are very compelling, because there is crippling drawback to this approach: If you do this, then block[i] is meaningless. You have not allocated an array. There is no way to tell where your next struct starts without either examining the struct or having outside information about the size/position of your structs in the block.
