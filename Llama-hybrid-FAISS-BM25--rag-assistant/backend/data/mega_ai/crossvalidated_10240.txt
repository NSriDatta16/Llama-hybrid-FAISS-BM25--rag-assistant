Although it hasn't always been this way, these days $P(z; d, w)$ is generally used when $d,w$ are not random variables (which isn't to say that they're known, necessarily). $P(z | d, w)$ indicates conditioning on values of $d,w$. Conditioning is an operation on random variables and as such using this notation when $d, w$ aren't random variables is confusing (and tragically common). As @Nick Sabbe points out $p(y|X, \Theta)$ is a common notation for the sampling distribution of observed data $y$. Some frequentists will use this notation but insist that $\Theta$ isn't a random variable, which is an abuse IMO. But they have no monopoly there; I've seen Bayesians do it too, tacking fixed hyperparameters on at the end of the conditionals.
