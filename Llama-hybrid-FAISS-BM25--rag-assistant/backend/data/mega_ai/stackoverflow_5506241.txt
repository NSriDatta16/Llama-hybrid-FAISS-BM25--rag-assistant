Jquery to drag items to table cells in google calendar like fashion

In an attempt to create a calendarlike application sort of like this http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ or maybe this http://thechriswalker.net/select-drag/ and http://neb.net/playground/dragdrop/ I was wondering what the simples approach to using JQuery is. It seems the pages I've found are sort of experimental (except the fullcalendar but the source code for that is 150 kb - ie not a good place to start)
