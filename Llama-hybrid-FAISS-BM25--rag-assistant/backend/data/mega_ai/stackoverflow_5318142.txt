How to create embeddable images

I am developing a site that encourages other bloggers to take a image and post it in their blog. More or less advertisements. I want to be able to develop a page that has a series of images with an embed code below them, so users can copy the html embed code and paste it into their files. Typically, I would just send the image, or provide users with the actual image link ( eg: http://sitenamehere.com/images/ad.jpg ) but I think there is a much better way of letting site visitors securely embed content from my site to theirs. In this case, it will just be embeddable gifs or jpgs. Are there any great tools or services out there to help with this subject? Upon review, this seems like a dumb question because a simple image path would suffice...but perhaps there are tools that generate textareas with the code pre-inserted in them for easy copy/paste...Any suggestions? Jquery solutions encouraged!
