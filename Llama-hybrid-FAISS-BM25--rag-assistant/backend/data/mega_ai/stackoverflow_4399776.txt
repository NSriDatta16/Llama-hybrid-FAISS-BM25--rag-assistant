How to get data from two SQL tables into .net

Previously, I asked a question about getting data from two tables where I take one row in a table and join it with several rows in another table. Here's the link to that discussion: SQL Select data from two tables (one row -> multiple rows) Here is my SQL code: SELECT customer.fName, customer.lName, phone.phoneNumber FROM Customers customer INNER JOIN phoneNumbers phone ON customer.customerId = phone.customerId What I would like to know now is: what is the best way to get this data organized in .net? Let's suppose I have a C# class as following: public class CustomerDetails { int customerId; string fname; string lName; List phoneNumbers; } For the sake of discussion, let's suppose that the above SQL query returns the following result: fname, lname, phoneNumber "John", "Smith", "111-111" "Jane", "Doe", "222-1111" "Jane", "Doe", "222-2222" At a glance, I see that I have two customers; one has one phone number and the other has two phone numbers. How can I write code to efficiently parse this in C#?
