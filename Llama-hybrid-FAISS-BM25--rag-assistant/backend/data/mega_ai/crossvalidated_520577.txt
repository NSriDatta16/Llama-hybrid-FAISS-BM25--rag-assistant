How important are confidence intervals?

I am writing a research paper about time series forecasting using neural networks. In my results I created tables containing error values (RMSE, MAE and RMSSE) for the predictions and made plots showing the predicted values over the original data. Now, I have been told that I need to add confidence intervals to my predictions because limited amounts of data can make confidence intervals very wide. My time series is approximately one year long. I understand what confidence intervals are, but I don't understand how they will make my results better. How important are confidence intervals? How do they change how you analyse the predictions of a model?
