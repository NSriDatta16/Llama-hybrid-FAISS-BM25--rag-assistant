I have similar issue. Well, this will not give you a solution, but will explain you why... One of the goals of an aggregated page is a common look-and-feel across the Portlets contained on that page [A500]. This not only affects the decorations around the Portlets, but also their content. Using a common CSS style sheet for all Portlets, and defining a set of standard styles, provides this common look-and-feel without requiring the Portlets to generate Consumer-specific markup. Portlets SHOULD use the CSS style definitions from this specification in order to participate in a uniform display of their content by various Consumers. For markup types that support CSS stylesheets, Consumers MUST supply a CSS stylesheet to the End-User's agent with definitions for the classes defined in [Section 9.5] of this specification. I think somebody had made mistake when writing the spec.
