What is difference between this two C# methods

What is the difference between these two cases. Firstly, if I open the connection and pass it into my method as a parameter, compared to opening the connection directly in the method? cnn.open() func(cnn,param1,param2); vs func(cnn, param1,param2) { cnn.open(); //open connection here }
