What is an elegant way to bin/map an integer in various categories in C?

Assume we have an integer 'x' and 'n' possible values that 'x' can be mapped/binned to. What is an elegant way in C to have a function that returns the closest 'nth' value to x? Pseudo code example; int x = 40; int res; int bins[] = { 0, 20, 80, 200 }; /* Sorting is guaranteed */ res = int_bin(x, bins); assert(res == 20); /* 40 is closer to 20 than 80 */ x = 150; res = int_bin(x, bins); assert(res == 200); /* 150 is closer to 200 than 80 */ By elegant I mean not just a bunch of if/else if/else statements.
