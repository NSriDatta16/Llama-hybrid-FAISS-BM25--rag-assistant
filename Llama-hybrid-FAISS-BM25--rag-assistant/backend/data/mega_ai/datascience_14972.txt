Pros and Cons of Python and R for Data Science

So, let's start out by saying I am NOT asking which is better. I like both of these languages for data science and I think this is a matter of and rather than or since there is no need to choose one of them. My general opinion is that R has more data science depth while Python has more breadth in terms of diversity of application. I will start this out with a few of my own scattered opinions. Python I tend to use Python as the overarching language (sometimes using it to execute scripts in R) since: Installed standard on Macs and many *nix setups Easy to install/set up in environments with security restrictions Has a great suite of tools whether I want to: Set up a website Interact with the Apache suite of tools Build out pipelines Build and score predictive models Develop an application / front-end Has a larger audience if I get stuck and need to ask questions on here Debug / Unit test Auto Document A good example of this was in building a Robot some facial recognition stuff over the summer. Raspbery Pi comes with Python by default, the sensors had Python API's, and a few of the web API's I bumped up against had Python API's available. This would have been a difficult application to take on using R. R I like to use R for early data explanation since data table tends to load larger sets into memory more quickly than Pandas and the general environment seems more mature for exploratory stuff. If I need mixed models or something similar that isn't Machine Learning "bread and butter" R is more likely to have what I need. sklearn is pretty good but doesn't feel quite as polished as what I have in R. On the data viz side, ggplot2 is obviously better than matplotlib (the html based stuff is tough to share in an environment with heavy IP and security restrictions so I tend to lean towards the simple stuff.) How do you use them? How do you interact with these languages? Do you mix them together? Specialize in one? What's your rationale? Strengths/weaknesses?
