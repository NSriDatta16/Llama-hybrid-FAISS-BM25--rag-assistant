Different approach, just to provide an alternative: Assuming most people know how to behave or just can't be bothered to misbehave, just retroactively clean the votes. This would also keep voting unobtrusive for the voters. So, set cookies, log every vote and afterwards (or on a time interval?) go through the results and remove duplicates based on the cookie values, IP/UserAgent combinations etc. I'd assume that not actively blocking multiple votes from same person keeps the usage of highly technical circumvention methods to a minimum and the results are easy to clean. As a down side, you can't probably show the actual vote counts live on the user interface, or eyebrows will be raised when bunch of votes just happen to go missing.
