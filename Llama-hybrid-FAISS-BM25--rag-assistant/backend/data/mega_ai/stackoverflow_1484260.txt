Update: This was a bug in older versions of Xcode. Bug #7256749 has been fixed. I just tried with the newest version of Xcode, and everything is roses. Historical Info: (for Xcode versions prior to the release of Xcode 4.0) If you start typing a C-style function declaration: void SomeFunc(... Then "void" will appear as the first suggestion. Xcode's code sense applies different rules depending on the surrounding syntax, and when you are creating an Objective-C function declaration, it appears to exclude all of the built in types, including void . I have filed a bug with Apple (via bugreport.apple.com ), and I recommend that you do the same. Apple prioritizes their software fixes (at least partially) based on the number of duplicate reports that they see for a given problem. Note: Here is the full text of the bug report submitted to Apple: Summary: Xcode's code sense provides a list of suggested matches as you type. This list is filtered depending on context. When typing an Objective-C method declaration, the built-in types (void, int, float, etc.) are filtered out. Numeric types such as int and float may be intentionally missing in order to encourage the use of NSInteger or NSNumber, but the void type is still used all the time, and should really appear in the list of suggestions. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Xcode 2. Create a new project with the Cocoa Application template 3. Open the application delegate header file 4. Begin creating a method declaration with a void return type: - (vo 5. Press escape to bring up the complete list of suggested completions Expected Results: I would expect to see "void" at the top level of the suggestion list, and I would expect it to be highlighted as the most likely choice. Actual Results: The list does not even contain "void", and the selected candidate is "voidPtr", which is declared in CarbonCore/Threads.h Regression: Unknown, but it definitely happens in the latest build of Xcode (3.2 (1610)) on Mac OS X10.6 Notes: See discussion on StackOverflow.com ( Xcode editor default to -(void) instead of -(voidPtr)? )
