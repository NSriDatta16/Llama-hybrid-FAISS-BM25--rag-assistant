Arithmetic coding is not hard to implement and achieves (within two bits over the entire transmission) the minimum average code length, which as Bryan rightly points out is the information entropy. See the original paper for details: R. C. Pasco, “Source coding algorithms for fast data compression,” Stanford University, 1976.
