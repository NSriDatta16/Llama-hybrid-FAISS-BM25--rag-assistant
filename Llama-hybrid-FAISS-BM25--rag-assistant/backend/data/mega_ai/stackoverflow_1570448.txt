I don't know of a python module to do it, but the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow format is pretty standard, so if you wanted you could just open the files, parse their current contents and then add the new group if necessary. Before you go doing this, consider: What happens if you try to add a group that already exists on the system What happens when multiple instances of your program try to add a group at the same time What happens to your code when an incompatible change is made to the group format a couple releases down the line NIS, LDAP, Kerberos, ... If you're not willing to deal with these kinds of problems, just use the subprocess module and run groupadd. It will be way less likely to break your customers machines. Another thing you could do that would be less fragile than writing your own would be to wrap the code in groupadd.c (in the shadow package) in Python and do it that way. I don't see this buying you much versus just exec'ing it, though, and it would add more complexity and fragility to your build.
