Treat heap as a very important real estate and use it very judiciously. The basic thumb rule is to use stack whenever possible and use heap whenever there is no other way. By allocating the objects on stack you can get many benefits such as: (1). You need not have to worry about stack unwinding in case of exceptions (2). You need not worry about memory fragmentation caused by the allocating more space than necessary by your heap manager.
