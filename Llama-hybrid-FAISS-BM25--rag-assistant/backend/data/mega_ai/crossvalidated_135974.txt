Is the solution of SVM classifier a vector in second conjugate space of the RKHS

Let the training points be given by $x_1, x_2 \cdots x_m$. Suppose we want to predict the class of a new point $x$ as $f(x)$. In an linear SVM this is a dot product usually denoted by $ $ where $w$ is the separating plane. Can we call this solution $F_x(f_w)=f_w(x)= $, where $w$ and $x$ both reside in hilbert space. $w$ can be said to exist in space spanned by training vectors as it is a linear combination of training vectors. Is this reasoning correct? If not please help me through the correct interpretation
