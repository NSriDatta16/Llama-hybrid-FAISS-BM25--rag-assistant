Look at the "UPDATED" part of my old answer . It seems to me that it describes what you need. You should return JSON results from the action GetCategories() and convert the JSON input to the corresponding HTML fragment inside your custom buildSelect function. Because you use editoptions in the form editoptions: { value: { 1: 'One', 2: 'Two'} } instead of editoptions: { value: { One: 'One', Two: 'Two'} } , you should modify a little the code of the action and the buildSelect function from the answer . One more remark. Because you use 'Category' column options in the form edittype: "select", editoptions: { value: { 1: 'One', 2: 'Two'} } you want probably to use Category ids (1 and 2) in the JSON data and display for the user the values 'One' and 'Two'. In the case you should add additional option formatter:'select' (see details in the documentation here ).
