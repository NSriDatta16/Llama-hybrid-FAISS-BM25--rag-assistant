I'm not aware of any the dimensionality reduction algorithms (like PCA) that can work with categorical values. However, an approach that could help you with that is to make a one-hot encoding of your categorical variables (if the number of possible values is manageable. Otherwise, try to pick only the most frequent values and assign the rest to a single variable). If you are using Pandas DataFrames, get_dummies can be helpful.
