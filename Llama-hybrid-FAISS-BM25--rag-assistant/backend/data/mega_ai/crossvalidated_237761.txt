Clustering large number of time series in R or Matlab

I have a sales data of like 700K rows and three columns: Date (in dates), Store (as represented by numbers and there are more than 4800 different stores) and Sales amount (integer). Looks more like this: Date Sales Store 6/9/2012 392 7184 6/9/2012 507 584 6/9/2012 1279 3060 6/9/2012 503 5572 My objective is to detect the similar patterns in Sales data, and which store is assigned to which pattern. There is a couple of pattern detection problems already asked but this time the patterns need to be linked by stores. By 'similar pattern', I would consider two time series having more or less the same seasonality effects, same or similar numaber of times and dates for peaks, having an upward trend or so. But this is just my interpretation of similar. I know how to use Minitab, but it is not useful for this question. I guess R or Matlab, would work but i'm really novice in this languages. Probabaly, R would help more in the following problems, I ll face like forecasting, goodness of fit etc. I need a general help on for instance which package to use and how. I know it sounds open ended, but heck that's all I can right now:/ Thanks!
