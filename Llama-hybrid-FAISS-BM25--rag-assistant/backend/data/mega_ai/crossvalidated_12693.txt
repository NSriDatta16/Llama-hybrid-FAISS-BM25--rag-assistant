Besides R, here are a few links that may be of interest that do not appear to be on the AI Geostats page: SpaceStat (not free) Passage software (haven't tried it, looks like it has functionality you stated in your question plus some more) High performance Geostat library (looks like GUI is in the works, but only beta versions of it are available) SAM (Spatial Analysis in Macroecology) . It has a kriging module so I assume it must allow you to estimate the semi-variogram. Pierre Goovaerts has a book chapter review on Geostatistical software publicly listed on his website. (A note, he works for the makers of the above SpaceStat software, so unsurprisingly he gives it glowing reviews.) The book, A Practical Guide to Geostatistical Mapping , has relevent examples using R and Google Earth (of course R is used to estimate the variograms).
