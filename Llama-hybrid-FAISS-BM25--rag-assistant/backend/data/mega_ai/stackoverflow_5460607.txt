Using a framework like Spring or Guice helps you keep your applications organized and loosely coupled over time. A dependency injection framework essentially extracts object construction away from an application, allowing the application to focus on what it needs to do instead of any architectural concerns. Another upfront advantage of using dependency injection is that your application no longer worries about object construction, thus allowing you to build mock objects to test each portion of you application independently. I highly suggest reading Dhanji Prasanna's book Dependency Injection .
