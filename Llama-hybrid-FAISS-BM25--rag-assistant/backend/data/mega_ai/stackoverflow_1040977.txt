General Oracle Data Collection Storage

I am designing a new laboratory database. I want to store the raw results for all tests together. In some cases, the result is a single value. However, the result is sometimes a raw waveform or signal. Which case below is ideal (and why)? ... or provide your own ideal option. Option 1: Store each individual data point as a separate result row (with an offset from t=0). OR Option 2: Create a signal_header table (start time, sample rate, units, etc) which links to a raw_signal_value table (signal, offset index, value). OR Option 3: Store the raw data in an external file to retrieve when necessary. Also, in a related post General Oracle Results Table , I asked about whether or not to fork a general results table into child tables based on precision and scale (data type).
