Reducing number of levels of unordered categorical predictor variable

I want to train a classifier, say SVM, or random forest, or any other classifier. One of the features in the dataset is a categorical variable with 1000 levels. What is the best way to reduce the number of levels in this variable. In R there is a function called combine.levels() in the Hmisc package, which combines infrequent levels, but I was looking for other suggestions.
