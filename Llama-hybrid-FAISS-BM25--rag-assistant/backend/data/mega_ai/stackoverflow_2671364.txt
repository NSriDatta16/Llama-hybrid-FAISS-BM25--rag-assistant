Connecting a DomainContext and loading data manually in Silverlight 4 RC application

I am new to WCF & RIA services and have what seems like a basic problem. I have multiple times in my silverlight 4 RC application dragged and dropped from my datasource window to my form and have returned information from the database. However I have a need to query the database for other information (Building a report) When I try to use the following code, I recieve no error, but I also do not get any information back from the service. //Global public UMSDomainContext _umsDomainContext = new UMSDomainContext(); //In the Initialization portion _umsDomainContext.Load(_umsDomainContext.GetUMOptionsQuery()); //Queries var name = from n in _umsDomainContext.UMOptions select n.DistrictName; var street1 = from c in _umsDomainContext.UMOptions select c.Address1; var street2 = from c in _umsDomainContext.UMOptions select c.Address2; var city = from c in _umsDomainContext.UMOptions select c.City; var zip = from c in _umsDomainContext.UMOptions select c.Zip; Im calling the current additional references. using System.Linq; using System.ServiceModel.DomainServices.Client; using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; using MTT.Web;
