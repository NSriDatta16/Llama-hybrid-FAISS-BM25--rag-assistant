Do you really mean consecutive .... or do you mean annual? Time series data have to be ordered in time ... and most methods assume equal spacing. But the interval can be anything you want. 1996-2000-2004 would be fine, so long as everything else is spaced 4 years apart. The classic methods -- building an ARIMA model, or exponential smoothing -- all assume that the data are equally spaced.
