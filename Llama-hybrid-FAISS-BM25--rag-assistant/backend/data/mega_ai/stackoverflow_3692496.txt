One thing I must tell you Arrays are the building blocks for any programming language. If you want to declare a storage having more than one element, Arrays are the basic option for you. Say for instance a List. If you see the definition of List, it actually holds T[] items Just use Reflector and find the definition of List, you will be surprised to find out List to be actually an Array. In .NET most of the collection other than LinkedList are basically an Array implementation. They used Array because of its fast storage and retrieval. I agree that Array has limitation of Update or Remove, if your main emphasis is in storage than speed, you might go for Linked List.
