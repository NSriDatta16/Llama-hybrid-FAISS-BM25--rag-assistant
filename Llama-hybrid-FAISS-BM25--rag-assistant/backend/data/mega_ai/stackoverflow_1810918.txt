Netbeans 6.7.1 mainPanel resizing problem

I've created a small gui app in Netbeans. As I was adding in some buttons and text areas the mainPanel resized itself. Now it is really wide [probably 4x as wide as I want] but when I try to drag the edge in it won't resize back down. If I drag it out, making it bigger, it takes that change. I would just like to return the mainPanel back to a reasonable size. Not sure what I'm doing wrong here. I've tried to change the min size, max size, and preferred size settings for the mainPanel with no success. I've even tried to change the menuBar & statusPanel settings at the same time as the mainPanel [thinking that one of them was making the others too big] without success. Any ideas?
