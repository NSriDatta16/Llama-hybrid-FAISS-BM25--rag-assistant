i've been in the same circumstance recently. you mostly need to pay attention to the "edges" of the app. INI files, file I/O, log files, etc. win API calls from delphi work since they've now connected the unicode API calls instead. check each 3rd party component set to make sure they're at least ready for Delphi 2009...better yet 2010. even my use of databases simply wasn't an issue...nearly everything worked right away. it just wasn't a big deal. anything that relies on the size of a character should be reviewed. really the transition of most concern is 2007_or_earlier --> 2009_or_later. there are plenty of discussions/blog entries about it. you could read, read, read...or you could get started & see what happens. (i did some of both). i'm sure there are "stack overflow" issues discussing your question. i'm not pretending to give a detailed description of what could happen. it's simply not as scary as it sounds.
