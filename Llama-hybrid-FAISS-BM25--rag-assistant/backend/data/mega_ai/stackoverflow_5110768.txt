I've had to deal with this in the past, and I just grabbed the std::string conversion template from SWIG and tailored it a bit to use PyString_FromStringAndSize when creating a Python string from a std::string and the std::string constructor that accepts a size argument when going the other way. That was with a really old version of SWIG, though - I thought the builtin conversion template in newer versions had been updated to do that automatically. Is it possible the problem is on the C++ side? (e.g. as in Mark Tolonen's examples, where the first example is truncated due to the embedded NULL in the constructor call without a size argument).
