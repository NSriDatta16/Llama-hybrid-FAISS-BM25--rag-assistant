Your assumption is incorrect. Dispose() doesn't reclaim the instance and doesn't affect the reference. It is a utility method that gets some special attention from the framework/compiler that allows you to easily clean up resources not handled by the GC. Other than that it is just a regular method. Calling a method should not affect the reference itself. The recommendation for implementing Dispose() specifically states To help ensure that resources are always cleaned up appropriately, a Dispose method should be callable multiple times without throwing an exception.
