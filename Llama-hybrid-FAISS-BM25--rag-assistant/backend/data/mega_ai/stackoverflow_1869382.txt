Another option is to set the item's permissions to be only visible to / editable by Site Collection Administrators. Anyone who is not a site collection admin will not see the item when viewing the list. This way only the site collection admins are allowed to really delete / edit those items later, when they really aren't needed anymore, or restore the permissions if the item needs to be visible to other users again. Read more on how to change permissions on items, folders, lists etc. here: Manage permissions for a list, library, folder, document, or list item . Look under the "Break permission inheritance on a folder, document, or list item" paragraph.
