Oracle table compression and SQL Server page compression both do this, in addition to other tricks. The nice thing about using inbuilt compression routines is that they are completely transparent - no extra joins are required in your code, and because there's less disk access, it is often quicker to access compressed than it is uncompressed. I think Postgres does this as part of TOAST when it uses the EXTERNAL storage strategy, but only on larger fields.
