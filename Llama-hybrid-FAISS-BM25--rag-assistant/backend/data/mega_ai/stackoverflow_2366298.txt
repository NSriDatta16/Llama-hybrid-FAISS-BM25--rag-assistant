You need an intermediary numbers table, or a table-valued function (if that option is available to you) which will produce numbers. Assuming you had a Numbers table, which is populated like so: Number ------ 1 2 ... 100000 (or as large as you need it to be, and there are efficient mechanisms for generating a numbers table of large size ) You would then issue the following query: select p.Product from Products as p inner join Numbers as n on n.Number This would produce the result you want. A numbers table is incredibly helpful in SQL, and Itzik Ben-Gan goes into it and other great querying techniques in his books (listed on his website). I highly recommend them.
