ametric: Linear discriminant analysis Quadratic discriminant analysis Maximum entropy classifier (aka logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression): Note that logistic regression is an algorithm for classification, despite its name. (The name comes from the fact that logistic regression uses an extension of a linear regression model to model the probability of an input being in a particular class.) Nonparametric: Decision trees, decision lists Kernel estimation and K-nearest-neighbor algorithms Naive Bayes classifier Neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons) Perceptrons Support vector machines Gene expression programming Clustering methods (methods for classifying and predicting categorical labels) Categorical mixture models Hierarchical clustering (agglomerative or divisive) K-means clustering Correlation clustering Kernel principal component analysis (Kernel PCA) Ensemble learning algorithms (supervised meta-algorithms for combining multiple learning algorithms together) Boosting (meta-algorithm) Bootstrap aggregating ("bagging") Ensemble averaging Mixture of experts, hierarchical mixture of experts General methods for predicting arbitrarily-structured (sets of) labels Bayesian networks Markov random fields Multilinear subspace learning algorithms (predicting labels of multidimensional data using tensor representations) Unsupervised: Multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) Real-valued sequence labeling methods (predicting sequences of real-valued labels) Kalman filters Particle filters Regression methods (predicting real-valued labels) Gaussian process regression (kriging) Linear regression and extensions Independent component analysis (ICA) Principal components analysis (PCA) Sequence labeling methods (predicting sequences of categorical labels) Conditional random fields (CRFs) Hidden Markov models (HMMs) Maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) Dynamic time warping (DTW) See also Adaptive resonance theory – Theory in neuropsychology Black box – System where only the inputs and outputs can be viewed, and not its implementation Cache language model Compound-term processing Computer-aided diagnosis – Type of diagnosis assisted by computers Contextual image classification Data mining – Process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets Deep learning – Branch of machine learning Grey box model – Mathematical data production model with limited structure Information theory – Scientific study of digital information List of datasets for machine learning research List of numerical-analysis software List of numerical libraries Neocognitron – Type of artificial neural network Perception – Interpretation of sensory information Perceptual learning – Process of learning better perception skills Predictive analytics – Statistical techniques analyzing facts to make predictions about unknown events Prior knowledge for pattern recognition Sequence mining – Data mining techniquePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Template matching – Technique in digital image processing References Further reading Fukunaga, Keinosuke (1990).
