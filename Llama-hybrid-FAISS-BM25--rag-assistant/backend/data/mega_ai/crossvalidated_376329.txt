Pierrot's answer is correct, but as this seems to be a question about intuition, I wanted to give what might be a more intuitive approach to thinking about the question. I (+1)'d this question because it is in a way insightful; you are taking seriously that you need to understand what a method really means. However, when you take a higher-level view to the meaning behind the MCMC method, you also need to take a higher-level view to what it means to update the prior. If your prior belief can be described as a gamma distribution and your posterior belief can't, you have certainly updated your prior beliefs, and this does not bring any problems of "compar[ing] apples and oranges" (with respect to saying whether or not you've updated your prior). If you assign a different probability to various events in your posterior belief to the probabilities you assign in your prior belief, you have updated your beliefs, and this has nothing to do with whether your prior and posterior are the same type of probability distribution with just different parameters, or are represented by different types of distribution entirely. In other words, a Bayesian update does not require the posterior distribution to be of the same form of the prior. This fact does not mean that only a "one-shot" update is possible either. Let me give a simple example. Suppose your prior belief is that it is just as likely on any particular day that it will rain (call this event $B$ ) than that it will not. Then your prior is a discrete uniform distribution assigning probability $0.5$ to $B$ and $0.5$ to $\neg B$ . However, suppose you have also observe that it is April (call this event $A$ ) and you know both that the probability that a day is in April is $\frac{1}{12}$ and that the joint probability that it will rain on a day and that the day is a day in April is $\frac{3}{48}$ . Then $$ \Pr(B|A) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(A)} = \frac{3/48}{1/12} = 0.75 $$ Now your posterior belief assigns probability $0.75$ to $B$ and $0.25$ to $\neg B$ , which is not a uniform distribution, but we would still validly call this a Bayesian update. Moreover, this need not be a one-shot update, because you could easily further update your belief about $B$ if, for example, you observed dark clouds in the sky, etc. This answer does not address another question that might be lurking within the question you asked -- how you use the posterior approximation from MCMC as a prior in another update. Perhaps Pierrot's answer can give you some insight there.
