Yes,Certain machine learning algorithms have higher variance. A good rule of thumb is the more parameters a model has the higher the variance of that model. Trees have high variance, you reduce the variance by ensembles i.e random forests. Neural networks also have higher variance, if you don't use regularization or drop out layers. You can also map your data into a higher dimensional space using polynomials as well.
