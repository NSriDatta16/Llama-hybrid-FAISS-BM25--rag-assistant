Load Excel add-in

I tried: $sAddIn = "H:\prog\essxleqd.xla" $oExcel = ObjCreate("Excel.Application") $oExcel.Visible = 1 $oExcel.WorkBooks.Add $oAddIn = $oExcel.AddIns.Add($sAddIn) $oAddIn.Installed = True $oExcel.WorkBooks.Open("H:\Balance_Inquiry.xls") When I do: Run('"c:\pathtoexcel\excel.exe" "c:\pathtoaddin\addin.xla"') It will work. But I prefer the former solution because I need two different add-ins. $sAddIn = "H:\prog\essxleqd.xla" $oExcel = ObjCreate("Excel.Application") $oExcel.Visible = 1 $oExcel.WorkBooks.Add $oAddIn = $oExcel.AddIns.Add($sAddIn) $oAddIn.Installed = False $oAddIn.Installed = True $oExcel.WorkBooks.Open("H:\Balance_Inquiry.xls") This seems to do the trick. First time it got installed and worked. Afterwards it didn't. Even when it is installed it doesn't execute the second time. Maybe someone can explain or provide a more elegant solution?
