Even though the question as it stands now is arguably off-topic, I will provide a quick answer. There is no function in MATLAB to directly compute multiple correlation coefficient. In principle, you could either use multiple regression function regress() to get $R^2$ and obtain your correlation coefficient $R$ with a square root, or canonical correlation function canoncorr() , which reduces to multiple correlation if one of the datasets consists of only single variable. However, in your particular case three PCs are uncorrelated (it is a property of PCA), so square of the multiple correlation of your behavioural score with the three PCs is simply equal to the sum of squares of usual correlations between the behavioural score and each of the three PCs. So you can compute these three correlation coefficients, square them, add them up, take the square root, and you are done.
