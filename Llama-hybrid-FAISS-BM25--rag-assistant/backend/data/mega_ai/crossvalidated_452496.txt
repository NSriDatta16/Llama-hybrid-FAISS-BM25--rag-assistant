Applying the Bayesian theorem to rape statistics

I'm studying the prosecutor's fallacy. Imagine that: $C = \text{Convicted of rape} \\ I = \text{Innocent of rape} \\ A = \text{Accused of rape}$ If I want to know the probability of being innocent having been accused, I apply Bayes' theorem: $P(A|I) = \frac{P(I|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(I)}$ So if $P(I|A) = 4\%$ (number of false rape accusations) and $P(A) = \frac{26,3}{100.000}$ (stats for Belgium) and $P(I) = 1-\frac{26,3}{100.000}$ then: $P(A|I) = 1.052277e^{-05}$ So the probability of being accused while innocent for a random person is far under the probability of being innocent while accused ?
