Understanding variance explained by independent variables in Binary Logistic Regression.

I am running a Binary Logistic Regression. I am trying to understand the amount of variance explained by each of the independent variables. Can I run the full model, record the Nagelkerke r square and then remove one independent variable, record the new r square and take the difference between the two as the amount of variance explained by the variable I removed? Thanks! :)
