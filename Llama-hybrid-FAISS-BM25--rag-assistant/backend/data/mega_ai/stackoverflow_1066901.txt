Is it possible to embed a SWF in a form using swfobject 2+ in IE6+?

I've been having endless problems embedding a dynamically loaded SWF into a HTML Form within IE 6,7,8 using swfobject.embedSwf. All the proposed manual workarounds for the problem involve creating a reference to the Object DOM element from the window object. For example: window[id] = document.getElementById(id); Where id is the id of the swf object dom element. In my case I cannot set window[id] to the swf object id because it hasn't been created yet! The line in swfobject that's causing the javascript errors is: el.outerHTML = ' ' + par + ' '; As the SWF movie sets up its Javascript external interface it tries to access window[id]. Since this doesn't exist, it fails. If I apply the workaround mentioned above and populate window[id] with the DOM element that's being replaced by embedSwf it still fails beacuse it's trying to call Flash specific methods on a div DOM element rather than an object DOM element. I find it amazing that this problem hasn't been fixed since Flash 8 and IE6!
