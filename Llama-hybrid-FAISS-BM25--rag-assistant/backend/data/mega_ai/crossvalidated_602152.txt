Meta-Analysis: Summarizing several effects of a study

I am currently conducting a meta-analysis looking at a rather global effect. Therefore, some of the included studies report several effects which can be included. As far as I read in the literature, it is most common to take an average of the reported effects per study to not introduce a bias. In some cases the effects cancel out, but it seems somehow wrong to just report a "null"-effect, as it might be quite interesting to see in which cases the effects are negative and in which they are positive. Is it somehow possible to include all the effects measured within a single group, or at least display all "subeffects" in a forest plot? At the moment, I am using the metafor package in R, using a random-effects model. Thanks a lot to anyone reading and thinking about this!
