Comparing two datasets (of the same physical quantity) - what do I learn from this graph?

I'm having a hard time understanding what the authors of this paper (pdf) want to tell me with this graph (Fig. 2,3 (shown below) and 4, right): [Caption: A comparison between the standard deviation of the differences (green line) and the standard deviation of all GOMOS (red line) and LIDAR (blue line) ozone profiles.] Note: contrary to convention, the measured quantity is plotted on the x-axis, not y-axis. The problem at hand is as following: Two instruments measure the same physical quantity (in this case vertical distribution of ozone in the atmosphere). Their corresponding (instrument characterized) standard deviations (averaged over if I understand correctly) are displayed in red and blue. The difference between the two datasets is computed and the standard deviation of the difference data set is plotted in green. What does this graph mean? Is this a way to say that the two datasets are in agreement? If yes, on what basis? What would other extremes mean? stdev of the difference is much larger than the measurement stdevs I think: measurement stdevs are too optimistic. stdev of the difference is much smaller than the measurement stdevs I think: measurement stdevs are too conservative. Maybe an example would help me to understand this better. Thanks
