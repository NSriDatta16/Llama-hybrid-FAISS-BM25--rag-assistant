Interpreting variables "weights" and "loadings" from PCA parallel coordinates plot

I am presented with the following parallel coordinate plots in PCA: The following is then said: PCA of the Raw Breast Cancer Data Variables 24 and 4 dominate the parallel coordinate plot of the raw data and result in a PCA with the following features: the first eigenvector is concentrated almost exclusively on the largest two variables, with weights of 0.85 (for variable 24) and 0.517 (for variable 4; the second eigenvector is concentrated on the same two variables, but the loadings are interchanged; the third eigenvector has a weight of 0.99 along the third largest variable; and the contribution to total variance of the first PC is 98.2%, and that of the first two PCs is 99.8%. "PCs" here is referring to 'principal components'. With regards to 1., are the so-called "weights" actually the eigenvalues? So, in other words, the eigenvalues are the "weights" of the eigenvectors, right? With regards to 2., what is meant by "the loadings are interchanged"? My understanding is that the "loadings" are the eigenvectors, right?
