Cross-browser jquery ajax history with window.history.pushState and fallback

I want to implement a navigation history using jQuery and AJAX in a cross-browser manner. My approach is to use window.history.pushState and fall back to a hash url /#!/url in browsers that do not support window.history.pushState . For example: home about contact On browsers that support window.history.pushState , clicking on one of these links should change address without page refresh to http://domain.com/home , http://domain.com/about etc. When the browser does not support window.history.pushState , it should use a fragment identifier, i.e: http://domain.com/#!/home , http://domain.com/#!/about . Update: Based on the feedback here I have implemented Ajax SEO ( git ) that uses jQuery Address for HTML5 History API with old browser fallback to /#!/url .
