I always see labels as the lazy man's branch. If you are going to do something so significant that it requires a full-source label then it is probably best to denote this with a branch so that all tasks associated with that effort are in an organized place with only the effected code. Branching is very powerful however and something worth learning about. TFS is not the best source control but it is not the worst either. TFS does support the concept of a trunk from which all branches sprout as well. I would recommend this as a good place to read up on best practices - at least as far as TFS is concerned.
