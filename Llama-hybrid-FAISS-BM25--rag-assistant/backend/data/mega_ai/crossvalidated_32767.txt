Dealing with project uncertainties: is the sum of the most-likely estimates equal to the sum of the expected times?

I found this document on the internet: Dealing with Project Uncertainties In this article I read: In order for uncertainties to be included in the project estimates it is necessary to take into account an optimistic estimate ( $o$ ), a pessimistic estimate ( $p$ ), and a most-likely estimate ( $m$ ). This approach is referred to as stochastic, or statistical estimating, and is the correct technique to use when developing what is known today as a PERT (Program Review and Evaluation Technique) So to obtain the estimate for 1 task one can use this formula: $$ Te = \frac{o+4m+p}{6} $$ It then presents us with this formula (I had already heard of this formula (in the book The black art of Software Estimation )): $$ D = \sum T_e + Z\sqrt{\sum\sigma^2} $$ Where $\sum T_e={}$ the sum of all path expected times and $\sum \sigma^2={}$ the sum of all critical path variances and $Z$ is the number of standard deviations of a normal distribution (the standard normal deviate). And $D$ is the project’s duration at a desired level of confidence $Z$ , such as $1.281$ for $90\%$ confidence To obtain the variance it presents the formula: $$ \text{Variance} = \sigma^2 = \left( \frac{p-o}{6} \right)^2 $$ The article also says: Regardless of the shape formed by the data values of the estimates, the shape of the values making up the sampling distribution of the expected times will approach a normal distribution based on the central limit theorem, if the sampling size is sufficiently large (usually $30$ or greater). When the sampling size is less than $30,$ and the Central Limit Theorem cannot be invoked, a tdistribution must be used Now the questions: ¿Is this $D = \sum T_e + Z\sqrt{\sum\sigma^2}$ an accurate way to sum estimates? I asked before about file storage estimation , and this formula was not used to provide me with answer... ¿why is that? ¿is it because did not have different estimations with different optimistic, pessimistic and most likely sizes? ¿If sampling size is less than 30... how can I use this "tdistribution" to sum estimates ? ¿what is the formula then?
