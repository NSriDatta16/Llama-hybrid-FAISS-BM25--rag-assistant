Describe the output of the following SQL query: select custId, name from customer where region = "New York" UNION select cust.custId, cust.name from customer cust where cust.custId IN (select cust_order.custId from customer_order cust_order, company_employee comp_emp where cust_order.salesEmpId = comp_emp.empId AND comp_emp.name = 'DANIEL'); My question is: at the line which contains from customer cust is 'cust' referring to a column in the customer table? This is a homework question I have identified the components leading up to this line and I think that cust is a column in the customer table... I am not asking for an overall solution just a bit of encouragement if I am on the right track...
