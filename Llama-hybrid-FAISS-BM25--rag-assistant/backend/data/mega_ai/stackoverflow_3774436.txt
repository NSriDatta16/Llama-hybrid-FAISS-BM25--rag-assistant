Uri from FilePath

I am using the Gallery3D -Code but want it to only display images from a sub-folder on the SD, not all of the images that are stored on it. To do this, I tried to change public static final Uri STORAGE_URI = Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI; to public static final Uri STORAGE_URI = Uri.fromFile(new File(ROOT_DIR)); , where String ROOT_DIR = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString() + "/mySubDirectory"; but I guess this is transforming a content:// -Uri to a file:// -Uri and this may be a problem? In any case, it doesn't work :-(! Instead of just showing images from the ROOT_DIR -directory and its sub-directories, it shows no images at all ("Gallery empty"). Could anyone point me in the right direction as to what I am doing wrong?
