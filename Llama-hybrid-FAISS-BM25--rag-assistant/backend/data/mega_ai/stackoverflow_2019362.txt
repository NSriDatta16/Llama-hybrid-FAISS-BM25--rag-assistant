How to convert array of floats to array of doubles in Java?

I have an array of floats and I would like to convert it to an array of doubles in Java. I am aware of the obvious way of iterating over the array and creating a new one. I expected Java to digest a float[] smoothly where it wishes to work with double[]... but it can not work with this. What is the elegant, effective way of doing this conversion?
