I'm afraid TeamCity doesn't provide a way to specify that agent can run only configurations with a specific property (and not run other configurations). So, there are only two ways to specify agents: either with agent requirements, or with configuring the agent to only run selected configurations. You could probably try to make some batch change in your build configuration properties, because all build configuration settings/properties are stored in XML files on disk.
