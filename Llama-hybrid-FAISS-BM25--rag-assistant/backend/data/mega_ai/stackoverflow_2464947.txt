Themeing and Master Pages

I have the requirement to support themeing of my site's pages. The way I am doing this is by dynamically choosing a master page based on the current theme. I have setup a directory structure like so /shared/masterpages/theme1/Master1.master /shared/masterpages/theme1/Master2.master /shared/masterpages/theme1/Master3.master /shared/masterpages/theme2/Master1.master /shared/masterpages/theme2/Master2.master /shared/masterpages/theme2/Master3.master And I am still using the page directive in the view I would still like to leverage the view's MasterPageFile property and just change the theme directory. I can only think of three ways to do this none of them which sound great. Create a custom BaseView class that uses OnPreInit to change the theme like this Create some xml file or database table that links each view to a master page file and then set this in the controller. Build some tool that reads all the views and parses them for their masterpagefile, (similar to 2 but could be done at run time potentially.) Option 1 seems the best option to me so far. Does anyone else have any thoughts on how to do this?
