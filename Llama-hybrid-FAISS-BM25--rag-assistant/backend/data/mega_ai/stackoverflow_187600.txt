Along with David's answer: Monitor row migration and row chaining activity and change table storage parameters if necessary Check your redo log file system: disable FS caching (i.e. use Direct I/O), disable last access time, change block size to 512B. Or even better, migrate to ASM. Read about index-organized tables and see if you can apply them anywhere. Verify that asynch I/O is used. For large SGA sizes, enable large pages and LOCK_SGA (platform specific) Experiment with different DBWR settings (e.g. fast_start_mttr_target , dbwr_processes ) At the hardware level, make sure you got a decent RAID-10 controller with write-caching enabled! Get lots of 15K RPM hard drives. Last but not the least: define repeatable and realistic performance test cases before you do any modifications. There's a lot of hit and miss in this kind of tuning - for each test execution do only one change at a time.
