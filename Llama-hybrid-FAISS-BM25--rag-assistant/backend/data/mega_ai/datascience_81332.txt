100% accuracy on both train and test after feature engineering

The original dataset is of ~17K compound structures almost equally divided with labels indicating yes or no, after heavy use of mol2vec and rdkit I have created ~300 datapoints Using the boosted trees method on the same shuffled train and test dataset gives 98% train accuracy and 89% test accuracy, but a simple neural network gives 100% train and test accuracy I have checked the code again to ensure target leakage is not occurring, I have also coded it from the scratch twice to ensure I haven't made any mistake, yet I do not believe I should be getting 100% accuracy on both train and test Does this mean that the model is actually accurate due to so many data points?
