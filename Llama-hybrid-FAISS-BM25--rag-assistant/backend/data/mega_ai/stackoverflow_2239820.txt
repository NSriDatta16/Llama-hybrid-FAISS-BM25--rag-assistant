tomcat 5.5 setting up context path with virtual hosts (non webapps directory)

I have been a web developer for a couple of years (some ASP, mostly PHP) and have recently taken on Java/JSP in the last two years. The one thing I have tried repeatedly but continue to fail to wrap my head around is the way to setup a working JSP application in another location that is NOT the webapps folder. Rocking my application out of webapps does not seem to be a problem for me. Could anyone help break this down, or point me to post somewhere which outlines it? I have Googled repeatedly and read and re-read the documentation on the apache.org website, but I still cant seem to get it :( I am trying to setup an "exploded" site (folders and files separated - not part of a WAR). I know that I CAN edit the server.xml file, but am not supposed to (not that it matters... even when I attempt to edit that I fail). I know I am missing something with the way the paths work. I THOUGHT I understand but I dont thinks so. Any help is mucho appreciated!! Love this site. -- I have decided to re-phrase my question with more detail -- Let's say I have a directory structure as follows (**NOTE: webproject is NOT in the tomcat/webapps directory) /webproject /webproject/htdocs /webproject/htdocs/images /webproject/htdocs/images/logo.gif /webproject/java /webproject/java/page1.jsp /webproject/java/page2.jsp I would like to setup a virtual host so that I can view my project via a URL: http://webproject I THINK all I need is two things (I am using apache): a 'VirtualHost' entry in my httpd.conf file. some type of 'context' file or fragment somewhere. Am I right? If so, could someone help me define these two elements? Also, if I want to use a domain-relative URL for referencing my logo.gif file from either of my jsp pages what would my path look like? What if I want to use a domain-relative URL for referencing page2.jsp from page1.jsp?
