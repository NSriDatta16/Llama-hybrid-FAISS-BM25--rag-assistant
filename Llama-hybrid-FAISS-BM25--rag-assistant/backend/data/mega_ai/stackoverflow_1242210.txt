Assuming your huge matrices are sparse, which I hope they are at that size, have a look at the PARDISO project which is a sparse linear solver, this is what you'll need if you want to handle matrices as big as you said. Allows efficient storage of only non-zero values, and is much faster than solving the same system of dense matrices.
