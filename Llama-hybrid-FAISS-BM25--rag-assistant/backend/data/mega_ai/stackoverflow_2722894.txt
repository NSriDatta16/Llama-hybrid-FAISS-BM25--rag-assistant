Get methods covered by a unit test

Is is possible to do the following from a Visual Studio 2010 plugin? If yes, how? Run all unittests in solution (with code coverage enabled) Wait for all tests to complete For successfully completed tests: Determine which methods were called during each test (directly by the test or indirectly by the tested methods). And store their names in a variable in the plugin. What I actually don't know is how to interact with the testing framework from code.
