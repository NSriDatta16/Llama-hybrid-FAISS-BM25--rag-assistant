There are two good answers here. I thought I might list a couple additional possibilities. From your description, it sounds like you are interested in if your ranks are higher than average. If so, that could be tested with a sign test , i.e., a binomial test of whether the proportion greater than some rank (say 50th) is $>.5$. Here's a simple example using your data, coded in R: binom.test(x=4, n=4) # Exact binomial test # # data: 4 and 4 # number of successes = 4, number of trials = 4, p-value = 0.125 # alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5 # 95 percent confidence interval: # 0.3976354 1.0000000 # sample estimates: # probability of success # 1 On the other hand, if you really want to test if your distribution differs from the uniform distribution, you could use a distribution test, like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . (Note that not being uniform doesn't necessarily mean they're better.) ks.test(x=c(89, 91, 94, 98), "punif", min=0, max=100) # One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test # # data: c(89, 91, 94, 98) # D = 0.89, p-value = 0.0002928 # alternative hypothesis: two-sided
