How can I check whether a SVM classifier delivers "degenerate" predictions?

If I fit an SVM to imbalanced data (e.g. two classes and a sample where more than 90% belong to class 1 and only 10% to class 2) it may happen that the classifier simply classifies all cases as class 1. This problem can be handled by specifying costs and/or resampling, but I would like to know whether the classifier has such a simple form. Is there a way to check for this in a "simple" form (e.g. by looking at output objects in Python Scikit)?
