Yes, that is the correct way to do it. There is no block scope in javascript; there is only function scope and global scope. you could also give each "block" functional scope using anonymous functions, although it's not very practical in this case: if (someVar) { (function () { var a = 1; })(); } else { (function () { var a = 2; })(); } As a side note, this is also why for (var i = 0; ...) is discouraged in favor of var i; for (i = 0; ...) , to avoid 2 consecutive loops in the same function both trying to declare the variable i
