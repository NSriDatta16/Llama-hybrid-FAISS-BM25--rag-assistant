Analyzing sets of data without the original values

One of my colleagues is collecting data from an experiment, and analyzing the average value and standard deviation of each sample set individually. My plan is to do some extra analysis on this same data, but I may not get access to his original data other than his statistics. So say, if he takes eight measurements ten times from the same population, then calculates the average and standard deviation for each of the eight samples. If I only get the averages and standard deviations, is there a way to calculate the standard deviation of the eighty data points considered as a single sample?
