How to get a password with a CLI program?

I am writing a Linux CLI program. I need to get a password from the user and, obviously, I don't want the password to be echoed to the console. There are several solutions available here, but they are all for plain C. C command-line password input How to mask password in c? Getting a password in C without using getpass (3)? How can those be adapted for C++, using std::string instead of char[]? What would be the most elegant C++ solution?
