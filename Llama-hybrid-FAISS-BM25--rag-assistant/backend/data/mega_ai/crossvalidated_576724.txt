Assumptions in logistic regression for applying LRT and AIC criteria

I have a question. Do the following assumptions in logistic regression Linearity between the log-odds and the continuous covariates Non multicollinearity Absence of outliers need to be satisfied in order to apply AIC or LRT criteria for variable selection? As far as I know, those assumptions must be satisfied if you want to ensure the p-values associated with the model coefficients are reliable. But I am not sure about the other criteria.
