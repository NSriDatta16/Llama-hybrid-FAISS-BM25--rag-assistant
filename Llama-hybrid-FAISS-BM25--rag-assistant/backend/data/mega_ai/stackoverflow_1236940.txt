Respecting Fellow Developers

We've all been there. You have written some code and unit tests, the tests all pass, and the code is decent (nothing's perfect, right?). Then, someone who is sure that they know better than you comes along and decides to change your code or the interfaces to your code just because he/she does not like the variable/class names that you used. No "real" refactorings, no real optimizations, no real improvement -- just different words -- not necessarily better words, just different. My real problem with this is that (a) its a waste of time and (b) it shows a blatant disrespect for the fellow developer that wrote the code in the first place. My visceral response is to lash out, but that's counter productive. Instead, I though that I might wright a paragraph or two as sort of a "Charter" or "Philosophy" that is adopted for the project. I'm wondering if anyone else has tried this, and if so, was it successful? After looking at the initial comments below (which are appreciated), I think that my problem is primarily that this change broke the build for code that was already working. So time needed to be spent to fix the code for what was (in my opinion) a non value-added change. -- Thanks
