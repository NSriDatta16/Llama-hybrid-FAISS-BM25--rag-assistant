logistic regression continuous independent variable interpretation in R

I have age as a covariate in my material. A continuous variable. The age varies between 18-70 years. I'm into a logistic regression and do not really know how to treat the variable. As a linear effect or as a polynomial? gender passinggrade age prog 1 man FALSE 69 FRIST 2 man NA 70 FRIST 3 woman NA 65 FRIST 4 woman TRUE 68 FRIST 5 woman NA 65 NMFIK 6 man FALSE 70 FRIST my model; mod.fit summary(mod.fit) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.42653 0.28096 8.636 how would you treat the variable age? and how should I interpret the results for age?
