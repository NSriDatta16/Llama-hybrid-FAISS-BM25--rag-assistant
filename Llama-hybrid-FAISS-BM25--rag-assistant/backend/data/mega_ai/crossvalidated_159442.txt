Answers will depend partly on what you mean by "tend to rise or fall". Consider a situation which each period has a 99% chance of small growth (by 1%) and 1% chance of a large drop (a drop to 37% of the previous period's value) - e.g. one typical case: in 100 periods you'll increase 99 times and decrease once, but overall you'll end up down about 1%. Does that count as "tend to rise", since you nearly always go up from one period to the next, or does it count as "tend to fall" since in the long run you will tend to end up lower than when you started? The answer affects how you should measure it. If you think that's "tend to rise" you should look at something like the proportion of rises; if you think that's "tend to fall" you could look at something like the average percentage change (or average change in the logs)... which will tend to be somewhat similar to whuber's approach.
