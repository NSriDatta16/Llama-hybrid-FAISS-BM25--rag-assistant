First, since your DV ranges from 1 to 10, you will want to carefully check how much the model violates the assumptions of linear regression - linear regression assumes that the DV is continuous. You might want ordinal logistic regression. Linear reg might lead to problems: Either of your equations may lead to predicted values that are outside 1 to 10, for example. Now, to your main point: The two models do not contradict each other. They say different things, but they complement rather than contradict. The first model says: LOC = 0.13*college - 0.08*over25 (plus other stuff) the second one says LOC = 0.03*college - 0.47*over25 + whatever college over25 + other stuff (you did not tell us what the parameter estimate for the interaction was). The second model's main effects cannot be directly and generally interpreted. In particular, the 0.03 is the effect of college for people under 26 and the 0.47 is the effect of being over 25 for people who did not graduate college. To see what happens for those who did both you need the interaction. In addition, the parameter estimates for the intercept and the "other stuff" will change. I suggest looking at the predictions of each model when college = 0 or 1 and over 25 = 0 or 1. This will show you what the models are doing.
