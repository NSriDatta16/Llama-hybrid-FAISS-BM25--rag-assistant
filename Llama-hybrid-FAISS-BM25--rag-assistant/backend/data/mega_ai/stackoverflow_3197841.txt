Theoretically 3G has a 1.75 MB/s downlink upper limit and a 0.25 MB/s lower limit, most actual implementations probably will be close the that minimum but if you are be optimistic and use 0.5 MB/s as a average speed you can divide 20 MB by that and get 40 seconds, the time it would take to download it. (Momentarily my 3G bandwidth clocks at 0.20 MB/s, the lower limit is more of a recommendation you see, not enforced)
