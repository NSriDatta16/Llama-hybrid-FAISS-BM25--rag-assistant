I want to prove that, overall, signal B is correlated to signal A. If you want to prove that, you could calculate the empirical correlation and estimate its statistical significance under the assumption of $i.i.d.$ observations. However, time series data is notorious for not satisfying the $i.i.d.$ assumption; the conditional means and/or variances of time series usually change with time. Hence, you need some model to describe the relation between A and B and their time development (including possibly the time development of the relationship itself). Once you have built a model and validated its assumptions, you may proceed to model-based inference. For example, you may test the model's overall significance or significance of particular coefficients or their combinations. That way you may establish (or fail to establish) significant relationships between A and B. (You may think of the $i.i.d.$ case as being a very simple model that reflects constancy of means and variances (and higher order moments) and also constancy of the relationship between A and B.) This may be too general to be directly useful, but it should provide a framework to think and develop a further discussion within. Unfortunately, I do not yet understand your problem sufficiently well to suggest a concrete model to work with.
