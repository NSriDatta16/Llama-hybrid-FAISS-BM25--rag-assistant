Is your layer called "com.mylayer.records"? That is usually just an example layer. Create your own layers here: http://simplegeo.com/layers If you cannot see that page, then you don't have access to the private beta of SimpleGeo Storage. It should be in the public in a few months though. If you want to geocode addresses in the US, use SimpleGeo's /1.0/context endpoint: http://simplegeo.com/docs/api-endpoints/simplegeo-context#get-context
