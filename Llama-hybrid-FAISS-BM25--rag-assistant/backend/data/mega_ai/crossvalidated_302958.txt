For question 1, to add to the answer by @Grosvenor, you can also include the lagged values of the number of articles in the linear regression as predictors. The regression will figure out which lagged values or combinations to include. You move into the direction of time series here, and there is a lot going with autocorrelation and things like that, but, this could be a useful first step. For question 2, linear regression will still calculate coefficients without problems. It always does, unless you have too few datapoints, then the system is underdetermined. These are based on minimizing the squares between all the differences between prediction and actual value (to pick a single explanation of linear regression), and the fact that a line doesn't fit through multiple points doesn't change much for that step. Whether they are "correct" is a bit of a philosophical question maybe, and I would say that they are never correct. A model is just a system that you came up with to describe what you see. How useful the model is remains to be seen.
