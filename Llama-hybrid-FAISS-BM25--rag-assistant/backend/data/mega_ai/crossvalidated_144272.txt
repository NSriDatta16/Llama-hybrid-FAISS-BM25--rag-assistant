two margin comparison and one conclusion?

I read following notes, and couldn't get it. any idea or hint would highly appreciated. a SVM classifier using a second order polynomial kernel. The first polynomial kernel maps each input data x to $ \phi_1(x)=[x, x^2]$ . The second polynomial kernel maps each input data x to $ \phi_2(x) = [2x, 2x^2]$ my question is how we reach the following conclusion? In general, is the margin we would attain using $ \phi_2(x)$ is greater in comparison to the margin resulting from using $ \phi_1(x)$.
