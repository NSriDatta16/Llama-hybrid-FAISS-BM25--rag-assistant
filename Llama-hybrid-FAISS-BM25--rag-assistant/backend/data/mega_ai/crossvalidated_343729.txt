I had the opportunity to ask David Blei this question in person, and he told me that intractability in this context means one of two things: The integral has no closed-form solution. This might be when we're modeling some complex, real-world data and we simply cannot write the distribution down on paper. The integral is computationally intractable. He recommended that I sit down with a pen and paper and actually work out the marginal evidence for the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians. You'll see that it is computationally intractable, i.e. exponential. He gives a nice example of this in a recent paper (See 2.1 The problem of approximate inference ). FWIW, I find this word choice confusing, since (1) it is overloaded in meaning and (2) it is already used widely in CS to refer only to computational intractability.
