These questions are impossible to answer without extra clarification. The question is tagged C++, which means that the language is supposedly C++. In this case, if the declarations are made in namespace scope, the ix declaration is invalid. It is illegal to use an unnamed class type (which has no linkage) to declare an object with external linkage. The declaration of ix would work in local scope void foo() { struct { int x; } ix; // OK, no linkage } It might also work if ix was declared with internal linkage at namespace scope static struct { int x; } ix; // OK? Internal linkage? although I personally believe that this was intended to be ill-formed as well (Comeau somehow allows it). But a namespace-scope declaration with external linkage is ill-formed // In namespace scope struct { int x; } ix; // ERROR So, if the namespace scope is assumed and if the above declarations are meant to be taken as a single piece of code, there are no meaningful answers to these questions. The whole code is simply invalid. It is meaningless. It is not C++. Otherwise, if ix is declared with no linkage (local) or with internal linkage, then ix is an object. As for ia , it is an object regardless of where it is declared, since the class type is named . Note though that the notion of object in C++ has nothing to do with classes. Object in C++ is a region of storage (memory). A variable of int type is an object in C++, for one example. Added later: The bit about legality of ix declaration is an interesting issue. Apparently C++98 allowed such declarations, which was proposed to be outlawed in DR#132 . However, later the proposal was rejected (for a rather weird reason) and the things were left as is. Yet, Comeau Online refuses to accept a declaration of an object with external linkage with unnamed type (internal linkage is OK). It could quite possibly be a formal bug in Comeau compiler (not that I'd complain about it). Added even later: Oh, I see that there's an even later DR#389 , which finally outlaws such declarations, but the status of this DR is still CD1.
