Yes, there is such a thing as a Multivariate (multi-response) Generalized Linear Mixed Model (MGLMM) Many popular software packages for fitting GLMMs are unable to handle multiple responses, especially those that work utilise the frequentist paradigm. However if you adopt a Bayesian approach then there are a number of options, such as BUGS, JAGS, Stan and the R package MCMCglmm. The latter even has a good vignette: "MCMC Methods for Multi-response Generalized Linear Mixed Models: The MCMCglmm R Package": https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCglmm/vignettes/Overview.pdf There are also a number of relevant journal papers: Bailey, T.C. and Hewson, P.J., 2004.
