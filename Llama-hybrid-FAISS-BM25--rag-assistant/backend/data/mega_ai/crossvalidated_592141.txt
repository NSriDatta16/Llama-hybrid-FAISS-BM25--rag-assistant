Cross validate after tuning hyperparameter

I want to build classification machine learning using logistic regression. First i check my model roc_auc score using train test split and check with k cross validation. Turns out there is indication that my model is overfit.. so i decided to do hyperparameter tuning. After i got some best parameter from hyperparameter tuning using grid search cv. Should i check my model roc_auc score once more with k cross validation?
