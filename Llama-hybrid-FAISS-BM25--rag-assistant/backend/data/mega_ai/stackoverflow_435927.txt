Can anybody recommend a PDF solution for the Compact Framework?

We have a requirement to generate PDF documents using information from a PDA / Mobile Phone. We cannot send the information back to a server as the information is required immediately and the engineers with the devices may be out of coverage. So, can anybody recommend a .NET compact framework component for producing PDFs? Could you also tell me about your experiences with it? Thanks
