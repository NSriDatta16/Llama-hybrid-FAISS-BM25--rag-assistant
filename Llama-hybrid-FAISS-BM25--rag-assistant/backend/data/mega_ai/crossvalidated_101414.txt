How about, if the 3 star rating is smaller than the average of the 5 and 4, and also smaller than the average of the 1 and 2: if (number_of_ratings > 6) // kind of meaningless unless there's enough ratings { if ( ((rating(5)+rating(4))*0.5 > rating(3)) && ((rating(1)+rating(2))*0.5 > rating(3)) ) { // Opinion divided } else { // Opinion not divided } } else { // Hard to tell yet if opinion is divided } Off the top of my head I can't think of any situation in which that wouldn't work. Using the example above: Amazon customer reviews for The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee : $$\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\rm Rating&1&2&3&4&5\\\hline\rm Frequency&208&54&89&198&2273\end{array}$$ In this case: $$\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\rm Rating&average(1,2)&3&average(4,5)\\\hline\rm Frequency&131&89&1235\end{array}$$ This would pass the test and be considered divided opinion.
