Why do variables with large values influence PCA stronger?

In principal component analysis, the loadings are weights which are used to transform (linearly) the original values. If the values are values of gene expression, then gene1 expression*weight of gene1 + ... + geneN expression*weight of geneN = the value of the sample on the PC. ==== The above is a summary of what I know. Why in data that has not been scaled will the variables (genes) with higher expression influence a PC more strongly and have larger loadings? Since loadings are the weights of each gene, from the above it seems that variables with large expression values will "need" a small weight to influence a PC.
