Help with static constructor in c#

I need help initializing static readonly variables in c#. I have a class with this signature public class AgentDescriptions { public static readonly int P1; public static readonly int P2; static AgentDescriptions() { int agencyID = 1; //I need to pass this in the constructor somehow P1 = GetIDFromDB(agencyID); P2 = GetIdFromDB(agencyID); } } P1 and P2 are used over and over in the application and I am trying to avoid two things. 1)Magic numbers and 2)trip to the DB every time I need to use P1 and P2. In the application I am using them in many places in this manner if (something == AgentDescriptions.P1) //Blah(); Please help. How can I pass the agencyID in the static constructor? If I add another contructor and pass agencyID there, will I have to initialize the class every time I use it? will this mean a trip to the DB every time?
