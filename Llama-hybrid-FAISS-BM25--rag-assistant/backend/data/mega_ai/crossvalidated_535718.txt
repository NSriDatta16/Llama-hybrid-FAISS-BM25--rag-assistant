Applying Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) instead of Euclidean Distance for Clustering Synchronized Time series data

I am trying to cluster members based on hourly login data. As this is mostly synchronized, I first applied Euclidean and it failed to cluster them into groups with sensible patterns. I tried DTW thinking it might be more accurate for time series, it did show some sensible patterns. My question is, can we apply DTW for data that have the same length and is synchronous instead of Euclidean in K mean? Are there any issues with using DTW for synchronized time series data?
