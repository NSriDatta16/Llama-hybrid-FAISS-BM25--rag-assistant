I assume you've got an up-to-date installation of Drupal and all the modules you're using. That's the biggest thing you need to be sure of -- keep an eye on Drupal versions and always upgrade when a security update is released. However, it's far more likely to be one of your modules that has a security flaw rather than the Drupal core. There have been (and likely still are) flaws in Drupal itself, but the really nasty issues have tended to be in modules. The reason for this is that modules tend to be written by third-parties, who may or may not have a good understanding of good security practice. And whereas the core is used by everyone and gets a lot of developer attention, most modules won't have such broad usage, so they get less development work, less testing and less usage, so bugs are less likely to be spotted. Have a look at the non-core modules you've used for your site (it might help to edit your question to list them here, on the off chance someone knows something specific). Use Google to search for drupal modulename security or something similar, and see what turns up. Also visit their pages on drupal.org and read the notes there; see how active the project is - when was the module last updated? and how often? how many developers have worked on it? etc - if those figures are low, consider finding an alternative module to do the same job. If your PHP skills are good enough (and you have the time), you could do a code review of them to see if you can spot anything. Of course, it may not be a drupal issue at all. If you're on a shared hosting platform, the box could have been compromised by a security issue on any one of the hosted sites, resulting in all sites on the box being compromised (this happened to me one - not good). But since the code that was injected is drupal-specific, it would seem that it's likely to be a drupal hack, so the main suspect must remain your installation. Hope that helps.
