Algorithm for Negating Sentences

I was wondering if anyone was familiar with any attempts at algorithmic sentence negation. For example, given a sentence like "This book is good" provide any number of alternative sentences meaning the opposite like "This book is not good" or even "This book is bad". Obviously, accomplishing this with a high degree of accuracy would probably be beyond the scope of current NLP, but I'm sure there has been some work on the subject. If anybody knows of any work, care to point me to some papers?
