I believe there are following reasons for not centering the data for LSI: Term-document matrices are typically very sparse, but if we center it, it will no longer be sparse and will be slower to process and occupy more space Angle between documents is not preserved when centering the data Here we don't care much about the variance: $k$-rank approximation $A \approx A_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T$ (that reveals the "latent topics") minimizes the Frobenius norm of the reconstruction $\| A - A_k \|_F^2$ and it doesn't need centering for that. Update: Recently I came across another reason for not mean-centering data for term-document (or document-term) matrices when doing LSA/PCA: Due to sparsity and high dimensionality of the data the mean was already close to 0, and we chose not to remove mean from the data. It's footnote 1 from a paper by Leonid Zhukov and David Gleich "Topic identification in soft clustering using PCA and ICA". ( pdf )
