I have limited samples for one class, unlimited samples for the other class. Need to balance?

I want my machine learning algorithm to learn the difference between two classes, actually picture of X or picture of something else . My sample data is: 500 pictures of X (I know it is low, unfortunately I can't do much about it) 1,000,000 pictures of something else Question : Should I do the training with all of the 1,000,000 pictures of something else ? Or would such an imbalance have negative effects? For instance would it kind of "drown" the other data? Notes: Computing power and time is not an issue. In the real world, pictures of X make up 5% to 10% of the data, so I don't think I have a class imbalance problem. I think the classification is an easy one, machine learning will probably be able to understand quickly. I am OK with a reasonable amount of misclassifications. In case that matters, I am planning to use Keras and Tensorflow with Flatten/Dense relu/Dense softmax/AdamOptimizer/sparse_categorical_crossentropy.
