"Question1: How will i tell any framework that go and use version so and so pf python like day django to use 2.6 and say mjango to use 2.4?" You simply run them with the specific python version they need. Run mjango with /usr/bin/python2.4 and django with /usr/bin/python2.6. As easy as that. "Question2: Is there more elegant way to switch between version as my hack of symlinking was a virtual disaster?" Yes, see above. Have two separate installs of Python, and run explicitly with the different versions. "Question3: Can I download a deb for say hardy and make jaunty believe its for her?" That generally works. If it doesn't, it's because it has dependencies that exist in Hardy, and does not exist in Jaunty, and then you can't. And here is a Question 4 you didn't ask, but should have. ;) "Is there an easier way to download all those Python modules?" Yes, there is. Install setuptools, and use easy_install. It will not help you with library dependecies for those Python modules that have C code and need to be compiled. But it will help with all others. easy_install will download and install all the Python dependencies of the module in question in one go. That makes it a lot quicker to install Python modules.
