Strictly speaking, a least squares fit is not defined for a vertical line (since the error for each point is measured parallel to the Y axis). However, if you swap X and Y, you can find the horizontal line with the best least squares fit. It works out to simply the mean of the Y coordinate values: The equation for a horizontal line is simply y = b. The error at each point (x i , y i ) is (y i - b). The sum of the squares of the errors is SSE = sum( (y i - b) 2 ). We wish to find the value of b that minimizes SSE. Take the partial derivative of SSE with respect to b and set it to zero: sum(-2(y i - b)) = 0 Simplifying, sum(y i ) - Nb = 0 and b = sum(y i )/N So in your case, averaging the X coordinates gives you the X coordinate of the vertical line that best fits your points.
