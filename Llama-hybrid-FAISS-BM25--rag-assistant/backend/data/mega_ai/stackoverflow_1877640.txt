Searching through an ArrayList of Strings to find text

This is what I have so far but I don't now what to do next. The question is as follows (sorry the coding is not all appearing in one box): Implement a method public void search (String searchString) { } to iterate through the notes ArrayList until it finds a note that contains the searchString. It should then print either the item found or the message "String not found". When testing check for a String that is in the list and for one that isn't. Code: import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Iterator; /** * A class to maintain an arbitrarily long list of notes. * Notes are numbered for external reference by a human user. * In this version, note numbers start at 0. * * @author David J. Barnes and Michael Kolling. * @version 2008.03.30 */ public class Notebook { // Storage for an arbitrary number of notes. private ArrayList notes; /** * Perform any initialization that is required for the * notebook. */ public Notebook() { notes = new ArrayList (); } /** * Store a new note into the notebook. * @param note The note to be stored. */ public void storeNote(String note) { notes.add(note); } /** * @return The number of notes currently in the notebook. */ public int numberOfNotes() { return notes.size(); } /** * Show a note. * @param noteNumber The number of the note to be shown. */ public void showNote(int noteNumber) { if(noteNumber
