Overfitting is a concern with trees, and pruning can certainly help avoid that. See The Elements of Statistical Learning , section 9.2, for a good discussion of the concern and a recommendation on pruning strategy. That being said, in practice a Random Forest is just as easy to implement, will produce better results, and will be nearly impossible to overfit, so you may just want to go that route.
