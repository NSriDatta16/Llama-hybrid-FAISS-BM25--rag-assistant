Most forums (maybe even all) are going to be database driven and not file driven. Some, as webarto alluded to, may store attachments in the file system and others may store them in the database. Some may even support storing them in Amazon's S3 storage which would mean you wouldn't have to worry about going over the limit. So the only files you'll have on the system will be the actual forum code. Depending on the forum and the language this can vary greatly but you'll be well under 50,000.
