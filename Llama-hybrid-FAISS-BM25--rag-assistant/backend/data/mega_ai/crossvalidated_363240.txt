Mean of abs(Gauss) as a function of the standard deviation?

I want to produce Gaussian noise with mean 0 and the absolute value on average 100. Emperically I see that random guassians (0, 125.31) gives me 100. What is the expression I must use so that I can plug in any value $x$ in place of 100 to get the corresponding $\sigma$ instead of 125.31?
