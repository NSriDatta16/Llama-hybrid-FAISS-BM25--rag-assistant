The main reason would be the density and diversity of sentiments in long texts. Assuming the presence of a certain sentiment (positive, negative), it can be measured easier within a short text as the probability of having more than one subject or more than one specific sentiment about a subject, is less. If you read a long text, there might be several different subjects and several different sentiments about each subject to be estimated. As an example, assume a one-paragraph opinion about a movie. It will most probably summarize an overall opinion about the movie and will be easier to be captured. But a two-page criticism on a movie might consider very good acting, so-so music, and very bad special effects. Then the whole problem of sentiment analysis will change here. Are we talking about each sentiment on each subject or an overall sentiment on the whole movie? Is overall sentiment on the whole movie is the average of all sentiments over subjects or detecting the sentiment of the paragraph which summarizes the whole article? Even in almost short reviews when the writer writes about several subjects in a review rather than being to-the-point about on the central subject, sentiment analysis is not the easiest task.
