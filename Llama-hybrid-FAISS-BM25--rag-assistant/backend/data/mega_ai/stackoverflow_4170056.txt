Grails or Rails?

I know that there have been plenty of topics describing this topic but I still can't put up my mind what to choose.First of all, I need you to know that I am a student in his last year, who will probably continue studying for a few years. However, I'm trying to find what I would benefit most from. I've been in contact with RoR last year; seeing Ruby's squirky syntax amazed me, and Rails CoC and DRY principles make me dream. I've written some scripts to generate sql statements in Ruby, but that is about all. I'm considered to be a java developer, as they call me the java guy on school, (no, i do not consider myself good, on the contrary, every day I realise more how much more i've got to learn). Now, I've taught myself several technologies related to java. To make my work easier, I opted learning hibernate and maven. Now we are developping an application in Spring + Spring MVC. Grails caught my attention lately since it is built on top of these technologies, and uses a language that is similar to java, and allows access to java classes. However, i'm not sure what is the best way to go. Should I struggle through Ruby's quirkyness first, and learn Rails? Or would learning Grails first give me an advantage over learning RoR? Also, as far as from what i've read, RoR would give me a bigger advantage on the market than grails would; but how do I get a "proof" that I can use RoR? Would it be enough to be able to show applications made using RoR?
