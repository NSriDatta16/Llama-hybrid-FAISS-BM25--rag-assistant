Urlscan 3.1 block User Agent

I need to block requests from certain User Agents to our Sharepoint Environment that have been identified after going through the IIS logs. I have tried the below by amending the urlscan.ini config file and doing and iisreset, but it doesn't block anything. Am I entering the correct strings? I'm copying user agent string from the iis logs http://blogs.msdn.com/rakkimk/archive/2009/06/12/urlscan-rejecting-the-request-depending-on-the-user-agent-string.aspx
