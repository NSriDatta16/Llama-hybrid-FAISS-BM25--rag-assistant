1) The average impact of D on Y is \begin{equation} \beta_{0} +mean(0,\beta_{4},\beta_{5},\beta_{6})\end{equation} You might want to weight the mean by the frequency with which the years appear in your dataset 2) $ \beta_{0}$ is the impact of D on $Ln(Y)$ in the omitted year. Therefore, $ \beta_{6}$ On it's own is the relative percentage impact D being 1 has on Y, when compared to the omitted year. I.e. if $ \beta_{6}$ =0.1. Then D being equal to 1 had 10 (exp(0.1)*100) percentage point greater impact on Y in 2000. 3)It depends on what your coefficients are and what D and Y stand for!
