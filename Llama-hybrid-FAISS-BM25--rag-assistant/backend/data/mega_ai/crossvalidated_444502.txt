Assumption of error of logistic regression

I know there are debates about whether the error exists and its distribution in the case of logistic regression. Suppose we assume that the error term follows the logistic distribution. Are we looking for a set of betas that will make the error term generated accordingly (in the population) satisfy the logistic distribution using maximum likelihood?
