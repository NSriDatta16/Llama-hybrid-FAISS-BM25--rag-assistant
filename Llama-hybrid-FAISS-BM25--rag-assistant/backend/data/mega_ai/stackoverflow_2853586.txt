I tend to use #3. It looks weird at first but you (sort of) get used to it. I went this way after suffering for too long under strings of acronyms jammed together, e.g. NPCAIXMLParser was one. I decided that NpcAiXmlParser was much easier to read and have been doing that ever since, even though seeing these things lowercased still looks weird sometimes. In terms of "the standards," I tend to think of these entities as "words" and as such capitalize them as I would capitalize any other word. E.g. if I had a local variable representing some NPC (non-player character), I would name it 'npc' and not 'nPC'. In regards to PEP-8, I disagree with this statement; I find the last spelling of the word to be preferable. Note: When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.
