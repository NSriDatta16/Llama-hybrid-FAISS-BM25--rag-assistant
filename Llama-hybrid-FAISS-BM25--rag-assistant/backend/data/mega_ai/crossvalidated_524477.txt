Time series model to analyze hard disk failure

I wanted to use time series models to analyze the Backblaze Hard Drive Data . Here SMART features are associated with the hard drive failure. In the failure column, 0 represents healthy drive, and 1 means failed drive. There is another column available in the original data set with the model name. Each day in the Backblaze data center, they take a snapshot of each operational hard drive. The daily snapshot of one drive is one record or row of data. I am interested to see which model of the hard disk will fail first. How can I get this answer from the following data? I was wondering if you could give me some hints. I appreciate your time! Thanks!
