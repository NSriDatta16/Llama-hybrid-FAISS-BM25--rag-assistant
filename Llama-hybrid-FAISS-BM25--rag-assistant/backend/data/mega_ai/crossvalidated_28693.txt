The reason for drawing the Bernoulli parameter from a beta distribution is that the beta is conjugate to the binomial. Using a conjugate prior distribution enables a closed-form solution to finding the posterior. EDIT: clarifying. Either model will work. Even with MCMC, it's useful to have conjugate priors because that permits the use of specialized samplers for various types of distributions that are more efficient than generic samplers. For example, see the JAGS user manual sec. 4.1.1 and sec 4.2.
