Group level random effect

In a lab experiment Participants took part in four different treatment. At the beginning of each session they were randomly assigned to groups of 4 and played repeated public goods game for 30 periods. So far I have collapsed the data to obtain group averages, so that observation in a period are independent. This data was used to estimate a model with group-level random effects. Since in some groups there were participants whose incentives were different than those of other members of their group, I would like to test whether difference in incentives lead to disparities in behaviour. Would it be OK for me to split the group average into two observations: With the decisions made by the "special" individuals with the average of 3 others The same random effect would be assigned to both.
