After reading the article from Fine and Grey, it seems that they define the subdistributional hazard, $\lambda_1(t; Z)$, as the following: $$\lambda_1(t; Z) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} Pr\left( t \le T \le t + \Delta t ; \epsilon = 1 | T \ge t \cup (T \le t \cap \epsilon \ne 1) \right)$$ Where T is the observed failure time, Z is a covariate vector, $\epsilon$ is a cause of death indicator taking levels $1, \ldots, K$ exclusively. The intepretation of this subdistributional hazard function is the instantaneous risk of death from cause 1 given you are either still alive, or you've already died of something else. In effect, it averages across these two possibilities in such a way that a high risk of dying previously from other causes lowers your hazard for that specific failure. This is reflected in the "risk sets" by including previous failures somewhat erroneously in the denominator. The interpretation of the model coefficients, then, is subdistributional hazard ratios which should approximate relative incidence rates.
