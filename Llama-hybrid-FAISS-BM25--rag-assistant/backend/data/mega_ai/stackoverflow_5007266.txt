Lua programming - os.execute() is not working in Windows

I'm creating a function in pure-Lua to scan the files from a directory and put they on a another file. The command I tryed was: os.execute( "dir /B C:\\Users\\Fernando\\workspace\\Organizator2\\s1 > C:\\Users\\Fernando\\workspace\\Organizator2\\temp.txt" ) but... dont works! I did many tests with others simpler commands, like "start notepad" or "mkdir C:\test", and they dont worked too! The worse part is that I tryed this same commands directly in the Prompt, and there is all correct. I tryed use tooo the io.popen(), but it the system returned "illegal operation" for any command i passed (even a empty string!). here is the all code: function ScanDirectory(source, str) local str = str or "temp.txt" os.execute("dir /B "..source.." > "..str) directory = io.open(str,"r") return directory end -- main script do local source = "C:\\Users\\Fernando\\workspace\\Organizator2\\s1" local directory = ScanDirectory(source, "C:\\Users\\Fernando\ \workspace\\Organizator2\\temp.txt") end I'm using windows 7 and the Luaforwindows, 5.1, and the LuaEclipse Have someone ever seen a problem like this?
