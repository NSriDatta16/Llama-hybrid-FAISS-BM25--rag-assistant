Classification for 'not something' Neural Networks

This is a very basic question about neural networks in general. How do you have a classification for 'not something'? Example: Say that you have to determine the accuracy of a certain simulation by comparing it to the actual scenario (in this case, comparing simulated and actual galaxy images). Theoretically, I can make a CNN and classify these images as 'galaxies' and 'not galaxies'. But what kind of images do I need to use for 'not galaxies'? I only have images for true galaxies.
