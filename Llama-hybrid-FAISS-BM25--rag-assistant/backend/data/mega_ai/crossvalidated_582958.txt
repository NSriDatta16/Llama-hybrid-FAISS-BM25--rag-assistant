Rule number one in working with data: plot it. The red dots indicate the points where you want to fill in data. The first thing we see is that the beginning 75% of your time series is invalid. I hope you don't want to fill this in some way? If so, don't, and conclusions you will draw from such made-up data will be invalid. Second, the bunch of dots in the middle of the valid period is also disconcerting. Yes, you will be able to fill that in somehow . But the question is really whether the "filled" data will be any use. During this period, you have a big problem. As to how to fill in such data, you could interpolate linearly: for each invalid data point, pick the last valid data point before, and the first valid point after, then fill with the average of these points. Or more sophisticated: interpolate linearly between these valid points. Or pick not one valid point on both sides, but two or three, and use the average of these points. Given the major data problems in the middle, you may be better off analyzing or working with your data using a method that can handle invalid data points, rather than trying to fill these in.
