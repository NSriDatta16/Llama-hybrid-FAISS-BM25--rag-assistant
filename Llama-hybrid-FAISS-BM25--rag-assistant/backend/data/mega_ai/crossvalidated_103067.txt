Loss function that relates ROPE with HDI?

In Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (link to the book ) and Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t-Test , J. Kruschke proposes using the following criterion to reject or accept the null hypothesis in a location experiment: Accept null hypothesis if the 95% HDI falls completely inside the ROPE Reject the null hypothesis if the 95% HDI falls completely outisde the ROPE Presumably ROPE is given by a desired effect size (correct me if I am wrong). Is there a way to connect the above decision rule with the optimization of a posterior expected loss? If so, what would is the loss function that corresponds to this criterion?
