Can a neural network recognize a letter B as an A if your trained it so?

You have a neural network. And you have, say, pictures of $100,000$ hand-written letters (A-Z). Now you make a typical Training and the neural network will recognize an A as an A, a B as a B, ... Now you repeat Training but with a change: you tell the neural network for all pictures with the letter B that its an A too. Now the questions after training: Does the network recognize A as an A as good as before? Does the network recognize B as an A too?
