Obtaining knowledge from a random forest

Random forests are considered to be black boxes, but recently I was thinking what knowledge can be obtained from a random forest? The most obvious thing is the importance of the variables, in the simplest variant it can be done just by calculating the number of occurrences of a variable. The second thing I was thinking about are interactions. I think that if the number of trees is sufficiently large then the number of occurrences of pairs of variables can be tested (something like chi square independence). The third thing are nonlinearities of variables. My first idea was just to look at a chart of a variable Vs score, but I'm not sure yet whether it makes any sense. Added 23.01.2012 Motivation I want to use this knowledge to improve a logit model. I think (or at least I hope) that it is possible to find interactions and nonlinearities that were overlooked.
