error on truncated rms

I am computing the RMS of a sample to estimate the standar error $\sigma$ of the underlying distribution (for simplicity let say a normal distribution $N[\mu$, $\sigma$]). $ \text{RMS} = \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar x)^2 / (N-1)$ I am using a truncated version of the RMS to avoid outliers in the population. I am considering only the $x_i$ inside the smallest range $I$ contanting a fraction $f$ of the total sample (for example $f=90\%$). $ \text{RMS'} = \sum_{x_i\in I} (x_i - \bar x)^2 / N'\quad\text{with}\quad N' = Nf \qquad \text{(let forget the -1)}$ Now $\text{RMS'}$ is biased, but it is quite easy to fix it, multiplying it by a constant $\alpha$ which depend only on $f$ (see here ) The question is: what is the error on $\text{RMS}'$? For example I have computed the error on $\text{RMS}$ from here and using $\text{RMS} = \sqrt{s}$: $\text{error on RMS}=\text{RMS} / \sqrt{2 N}$ I expected so: $\text{error on RMS'}=\alpha \text{RMS'} / \sqrt{2 N'}$ but it seems to don't have good coverage (to cover 68% of the times the true value $\sigma$).
