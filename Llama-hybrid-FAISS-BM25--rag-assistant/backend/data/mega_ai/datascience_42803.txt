How to implement a Fourier Convolution layer in keras?

I'm currently investigating the paper FCNN: Fourier Convolutional Neural Networks . The main contribution of the paper is that CNN training is entirely shifted to the Fourier domain without loss of effectiveness. The proposed architecture looks as follows: The authors state that the implementation was done in keras, however, it is not publicly available. I know I can define a Fourier transformation in the following way: model.add(layers.Lambda(lambda v: tf.real(tf.spectral.rfft(v)))) But this is not a Fourier Convolution, right? How should I go from here?
