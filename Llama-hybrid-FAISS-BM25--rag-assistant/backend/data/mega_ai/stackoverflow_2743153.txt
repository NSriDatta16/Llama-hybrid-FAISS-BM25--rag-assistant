Can't get Sum() working in Northwind example

The following code is generating a runtime error and I have no idea why. from o in Orders group o by o.Employee into employeeOrders select new { employeeOrders.Key.EmployeeID, employeeOrders.Key.FirstName, Orders = from eord in employeeOrders orderby eord.OrderID select new { eord.OrderID, eord.OrderDate, OrderTotal=eord.OrderDetails.Sum (od => od.UnitPrice) } } The error is Member access 'System.Decimal UnitPrice' of 'LINQPad.User.OrderDetails' not legal on type 'LINQPad.User.Orders I've also tried this in VS2010 with a standard drag and drop data context and same thing. Thanks in advance
