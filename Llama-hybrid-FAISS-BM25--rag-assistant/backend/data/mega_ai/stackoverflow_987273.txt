Use a conditional comment . edit: Now that Wellbog has fixed your question, no, there's no way to do that with pure valid CSS. You could conceivably use PHP or another server-side language to detect IE6 from the user agent string and serve a different CSS file, but it's much better to just use the conditional commenting technique. What's your reason for refusing to use the existing, working, non-hacky solution Microsoft provides?
