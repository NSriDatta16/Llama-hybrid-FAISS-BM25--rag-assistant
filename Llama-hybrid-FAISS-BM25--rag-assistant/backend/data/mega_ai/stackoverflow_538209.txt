File Copying optimization through multiple threads

Can you make file copying faster through multiple threading? Edit : To clarify, suppose you were implementing CopyFile(src, tgt). It seems logical that under certain circumstances you could use multiple threads to make it go faster. Edit Some more thoughts: Naturally, it depends on the HW/storage in question. If you're copying from one disk to another, for example, it's pretty clear that you can read/write at the same time using two threads, thus saving the performance cost of the fastest of the two (usually reading). But you don't really need multiple threads for reading/writing in parallel, just async-IO. But if async-IO can really speed things up (up to 2x) when reading/writing from different disks, why isn't this the default implementation of CopyFile? (or is it?)
