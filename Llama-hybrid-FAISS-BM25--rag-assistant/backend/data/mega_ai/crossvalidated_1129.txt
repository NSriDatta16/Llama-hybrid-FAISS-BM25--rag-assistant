Another vote for Rob's answer. There are also some interesting ideas in the "relative importance" literature. This work develops methods that seek to determine how much importance is associated with each of a number of candidate predictors. There are Bayesian and Frequentist methods. Check the "relaimpo" package in R for citations and code.
