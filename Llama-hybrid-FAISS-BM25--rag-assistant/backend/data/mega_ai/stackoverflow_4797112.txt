Removing an event from a DynamicObject

I have successfully added event handlers to my dynamic object. However, I am not able to remove them. dynamic d = new MyDynamicObject(); d.MyEvent += new EventHandler(this.MyHandler); d.MyEvent -= new EventHandler(this.MyHandler); When I add the event handler, I get a call to TrySetMember with the handler as argument, however, when removing it the value is null. If it's null, how I am supposed to know which handler to remove from my internal storage of handlers for that particular event?
