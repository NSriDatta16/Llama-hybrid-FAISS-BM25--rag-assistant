A half-Cauchy is one of the symmetric halves of the Cauchy distribution (if unspecified, it is the right half that's intended): Since the area of the right half of a Cauchy is $\frac12$ the density must then be doubled. Hence the 2 in your pdf (though it's missing a $\frac{1}{\pi}$ as whuber noted in comments). The half-Cauchy has many properties; some are useful properties we may want in a prior. A common choice for a prior on a scale parameter is the inverse gamma (not least, because it's conjugate for some familiar cases). When a weakly informative prior is desired, very small parameter values are used. However, there are cases where the posterior is somewhat sensitive to the specific choice so perhaps 'weakly informative' isn't a great description of such a prior. The half-Cauchy is quite heavy tailed and it, too, may be regarded as fairly weakly informative in some situations. Gelman ([1] for example) advocates for half-t priors (including the half-Cauchy) over the inverse gamma because they have better behavior for small parameter values but only regards it as weakly informative when a large scale parameter is used *. Gelman has focused more on the half-Cauchy in more recent years. The paper by Polson and Scott [2] gives additional reasons for choosing the half-Cauchy in particular. * your post shows a standard half-Cauchy. Gelman would probably not choose that for a prior. If you have no sense at all of the scale, it corresponds to saying that the scale is as likely to be above 1 as below 1 (which may be what you want) but it wouldn't necessarily fit with some of the things Gelman is arguing for.
