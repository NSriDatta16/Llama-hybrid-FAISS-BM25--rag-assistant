How do I interpret the odds ratio of an interaction term in Conditional Logistic Regression?

I am wondering what the correct interpretation of the odds ratio of an interaction term in conditional logistic regression is. Let's say there are two independent variables A and B, as well as an interaction term (AxB). Coefficient of A=1, Coefficient of B=2 and Coefficient of (AxB)=3. The odds ratio for the independent variable A would be exp(1). The odds ratio for the independent variable B would be exp(2). Questions: Is it correct to say that the odds ratio of (AxB) is exp(3)? If exp(3) is 1.5, would it be correct to interpret the odds ratio of (AxB) as: an increase in the interaction term (AxB) by one unit of measure increases the odds of "success" by a factor of 1.5? Or is the interpretation in question two wrong and it would be correct to say the following: A possible alternative interpretation would be that the odds ratio of the interaction term (AxB) is exp(1+3B). This could be interpreted as: if A increases by one unit, then the odds increase by a factor of exp(1+3B), which would be dependent on values of B. Thank you.
