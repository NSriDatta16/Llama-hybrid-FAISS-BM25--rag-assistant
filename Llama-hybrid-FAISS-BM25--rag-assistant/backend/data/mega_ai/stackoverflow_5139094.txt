In R how to get the statistics on time difference of sessions

I have data that represents different sessions of users. This is in a format like User StartTime EndTime user1 1291043867 1291044055 user2 1290970409 1290972041 user3 1291019561 1291019562 user2 1290897232 1290897244 user1 1291100532 1291100559 user3 1291142492 1291142496 user2 1291128374 1291128391 user2 1291032746 1291032748 ... Note that the timestamps are unix times. I need to get the summary statistics like mean, percentiles on the number of sessions for each user. I also need to get the average time between each successive sessions for all the users. How do I go about doing this in R.
