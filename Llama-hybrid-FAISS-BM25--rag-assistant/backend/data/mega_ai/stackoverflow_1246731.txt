DIV identified by WebDevToolbar isnt in file?

I'm trying to use Magento for my shopping cart and want to switch from a right col layout to left col. I've turned on ID/CLASS display on the Web Developer Toolbar in firefox, and am seeing ".main col2-right-layout", which i believe i must switch to ".main col2-left-layout", the alternate style is predefined. but running searches for files with the phrase "col2-right-layout" in them is only pulling up the style sheet. I am searching THE ENTIRE Magento directory. How is this possible? Not case sensitive, and I'm even searching hidden folders. How can it be? **i have looked in that file, the div is not mentioned. **
