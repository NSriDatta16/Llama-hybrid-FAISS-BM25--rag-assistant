How to interpret the UCLA "adjusted count" logistic regression pseudo $R^2?$

Here , UCLA gives a number of pseudo $R^2$ values for evaluating logistic regression models. Despite the issues with doing this, the last two deal with hard classifications rather than the probabilistic model outputs. The second-to-last pseudo $R^2$ , "count", makes sense, as it is just the proportion classified correctly ("accuracy"). What is the interpretation of the final pseudo $R^2$ , the "adjusted count"? $$ R^2_{\text{AdjustedCount}} = \dfrac{\text{ Correct - n }}{\text{ Total - n }} $$
