I think you're getting caught out by the notational liberties taken by the author. The return type of δ(R) is most certainly a set, or rather a language. If you look at the definition: you can see that there is an inconsistency in the return type, formally λ is an element, but ∅ is the empty language... What it should say is: The fact that the author uses λ for both the empty string as well as the language containing only the empty string is further evidenced by his definition of the Kleene star operator: Clearly, the last part should be if we want to be pedantic. Given that the return type of δ(R) is a set, or rather a language, the equations you give make perfect sense and express exactly what you described.
