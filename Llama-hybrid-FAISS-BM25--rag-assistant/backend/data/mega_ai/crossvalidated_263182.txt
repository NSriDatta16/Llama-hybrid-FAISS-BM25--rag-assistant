There are multiple definitions of fixed and random effects , but one of the definitions is that we assume that the effect is random if it is a realization of a random variable , where fixed effects can be seen as a special cases of random effects with variance equal to zero. In case of Bayesian models all the parameters are considered as random variables, so all of them may be seen as random effects. Because of the ambiguity Gelman and Hill in their book Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models recommend talking rather about effects varying between groups , or not.
