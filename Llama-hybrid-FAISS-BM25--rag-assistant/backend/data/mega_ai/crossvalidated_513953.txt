Second-order and strictly stationary time series is weakly stationary - proof

I keep reading that second-order and strictly stationary time series has constant mean, variance and its autocovariance is time independent, but I can't find proof of that. My definition of such time series would be that $(X_1, \dots, X_n) =^D (X_{1+h}, \dots, X_{n+h}) \forall n, h$ where $=^D$ means equality in distribution and $\mathbb{E}X_t^2 . Could you show or point me to one? I think I managed to prove the constant mean: Since $(X_1, \dots, X_n) =^D (X_{1+h}, \dots, X_{n+h}) \forall n, h$ if we set $n=1$ we obtain $X_1 \sim X_{1+h}$ and that happens for every h so $X_1 \sim X_2 \sim \dots$ and so on. Since $EX_t^2 we have $EX_t so all r.v.s must have the same (constant) mean. I got stuck at the variance and autocovariance though.
