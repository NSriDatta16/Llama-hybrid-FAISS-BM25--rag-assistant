How is Bayes Stats supposedly more "intuitive" when it requires us to think probabilistically which IS NOT intuitive for most folks?

People don’t naturally think in probabilistic ways, they often form priors through point estimates because it’s less cognitively taxing to reduce everything down to single numbers. So if the fundamental premise of Bayesian Inference is a method formulated mathematically of updating our prior hypothesis from evidence presented to us as the practitioner, then why are we forced to think in a way that divorces from everyday convention? And yes, I get that "intuitive" is relative depending on who you ask but that's often one of the arguments I hear from Bayesians as to why it's superior to Frequentists.
