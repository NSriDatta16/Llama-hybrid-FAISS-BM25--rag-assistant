Poisson Problem

Problem. Eggs are thought to be infected with the bacterium salmonella enteritidis so that the number of organisms, $Y$ , in each has a Poisson distribution with mean $\mu$ . The value of $Y$ cannot be observed directly, but after a period it becomes certain whether the egg is infected ( $Y > 0$ ) or not ( $Y = 0$ ). Out of $n$ such eggs, $r$ are found to be infected. Find the maximum likelihood estimator of $Âµ$ and its asymptotic variance. I'm practicing for an exam and I can't understand this question. I need to find the MLE of $\mu$ , but what distribution should I use? In the exercise, it says that we do not observe $Y$ , but we know if the egg is infected or not. I'm confused... should I use the Poisson distribution, not with $n$ , but with $n-r$ (un-infected eggs); is that a binomial? I don't really understand what to do... I'll try and solve the exercise this way, using a new variable with binomial distribution, since we don't observe Y we need to use X. Is it correct?
