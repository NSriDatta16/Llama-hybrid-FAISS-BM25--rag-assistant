ARIMA methods are so 1960. Use an LSTM or RNN, or really any ML model. Ideally, give the model more features than just the historical values. You can engineer dozens of features just from a single timestamp, but you may have other external signals (including other concurrent time series) that are in some way predictive. There have been several Kaggle contests for predicting time series that you can look at for inspiration. For example, this LSTM won one competition. (ok, I’m dismissive of old-school (S)ARIMA and ARCH methods. They’re still used some places, and in fact you can use one or more as inputs to an ML model. If you have no other predictive inputs of any kind, and don’t know how to encode time features, these methods can outperform ML.)
