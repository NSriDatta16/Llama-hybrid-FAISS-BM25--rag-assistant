The UNIVERSE db , which is a descendent of Pick, lets you store a list of key value pairs for a given key. However this is very old technoligy and the world ran away from these databases a long time ago. You can implement this in an SQL database with a three column table CREATE TABLE ATTRS ( KEYVAL VARCHAR(32), ATTRNAME VARCHAR(32), ATTRVAR VARCHAR(1024) ) Although most DBAs will hit you over the head with the very thick Codd and Date hardback edition if you propose this, it is in fact a very common pattern in packaged applications to allow you to add site specific attributes to a system. To prarphrase Richrd Stallmans comments on LISP. "Any reasonably functional datastorage system will eventually end up implementing there own version of RDBMS."
