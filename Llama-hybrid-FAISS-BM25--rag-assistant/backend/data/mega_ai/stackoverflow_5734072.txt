CCMoveTo of Cocos2D

i have two CCSprite on the scene CCSprite *spriteA; CCSprite *spriteB; spriteB's position is fixed,and spriteA's position is not.I touch the spriteA,and it only can be moved by the way a straight line, only four direction "up/down/left/right"ï¼Œnot slash,and also it can be moved until the spriteB stop it. such as I(spriteA) can keep running until the wall(spriteB) front of me stopping me. i use the following code - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { return YES;} - (void)ccTouchEnded:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; CGPoint convertedLocation = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:location]; [spriteA stopAllActions]; [spriteA runAction: [CCMoveTo actionWithDuration:1 position:convertedLocation]]; } it can be moved,but not only four direction, and how can i use spriteB stop spriteA,if spriteB is at the front of spriteA? thanks
