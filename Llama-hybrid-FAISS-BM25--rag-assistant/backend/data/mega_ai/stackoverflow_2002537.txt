In CRUD operations , the INSERT is the 'C' and the UPDATE is the 'U'. They are two of the four basic functions of persistent storage. The other two are SELECT and DELETE . Without at least these four operations, a typical database system cannot be considered complete. Use INSERT to insert a new record. Use UPDATE to update an existing record.
