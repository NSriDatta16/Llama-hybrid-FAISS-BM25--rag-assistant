fluctuating values for validation set only

My model's structure is Output ^ | ---------------- | Dense Network | ---------------- /\ || || || |--------------------| || | ----------------------| | RNN on features | ========>|| These are the Training and Validation set metric outputs of my model. Why are the values fluctuating so much for the validation set?. Any ideas? [![4 Graphs. Loss, Accuracy, Precision, Recall][1]][1] Update : As suggested in comments I have tried increasing the validation set size Now the size ratio is 49.6%-50.4% Also I have made the model very simple by Using fewer layers. The new graph obtained looks like this [![4 Graphs. Loss, Accuracy, Precision, Recall on simpler model][2]][2] Is this acceptable as 'okay-fluctuating'?
