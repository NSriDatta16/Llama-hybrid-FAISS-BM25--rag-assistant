How do I estimate the covariance matrix of a set of dependent Poisson RVs?

LeBron James has averaged 27 pts, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists per game essentially since his debut in 2003. Despite this, he has never had a game with a stat line of exactly 27/7/7. I'm interested in calculating the joint probability $P(Pts = 27, Reb = 7, Ast = 7)$ . I had thought to model these as Poisson RVs. However, I can't find anything that describes how to estimate the covariance matrix of a multivariate Poisson vector when the components have a dependence structure. I could just model each variable as normal, but that wouldn't be as accurate, I don't think. Let me know what you think!
