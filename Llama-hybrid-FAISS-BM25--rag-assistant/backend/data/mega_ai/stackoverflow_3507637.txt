OpenFlow AFItem UIImageView touchesBegan

I'm trying to use the OpenFlow project inside of my application. My target is; when the user tab to any flow item which currently UIImageView according to OpenFlow's AFItemView, it will be zoom-in in the screen (with/without animation) and then user will be able to close and get back to cower flow view in the app. I didn't get the tocuhesBegan event when I used the default OpenFlow library, then I saw this line self.multipleTouchEnabled = NO; self.userInteractionEnabled = NO; self.autoresizesSubviews = YES; in the AFOpenFlowView.m, when I change self.userInteractionEnabled = NO; to self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; I'm getting the touchesBegan event in the AFItemView.m that it already implement UIView, but flow doesn't work when I apply to this change. I'm wondering where is the my mistake ? Any help and example code would be appreciated. Edit : Let me explain my goal; The target is user will open OpenFlow the scroll images with touch then when the touched any image that inside of the OpenFlow view, selected image will be come with zoom-in or flip or sth. animation. When the user touch to close icon which will be right side of the opened image, screen will be get back to the OpenFlow main screen, I did not find any solution to it on OpenFlow project. It's really urgent. Regards
