preg_replace: wildcards do not match umlaut-characters

i want to filter a String by using the \w wildcard, but unfortunately it does not cover umlauts. $i = "Die Höhe"; $x = preg_replace("/[^\w\s]/","",$i); echo $x; // "Die Hhe"; However, i can add all the characters to preg_replace, but this is not very elegant, since the list will become very long. ATM, i am preparing this only for German, but there are more languages to come. $i = "Die Höhe"; $x = preg_replace("/[^\w\säöüÄÖÜß]/","",$i); echo $x; // "Die Höhe"; Is there a way to match all of them at once?
