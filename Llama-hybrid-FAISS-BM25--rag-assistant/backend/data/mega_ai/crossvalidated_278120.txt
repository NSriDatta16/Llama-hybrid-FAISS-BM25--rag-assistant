How to measure if performance is based on luck or skill?

In Thinking Fast and Slow, Kahneman analyzed investment advisers' returns over eight years to see how consistently advisers performed over time. While he expected large variation in performance, he was surprised to see that the correlation was basically zero. "The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill," he writes. What statistical tests did he use? Here are the CSAT averages for 12 imaginary agents at Limitless Customer Support Ltd over 6 fortnights. CSAT is calculated based on an average of customer ratings, where customers give a 0 (horrible), 1, 2, or 3(awesome). 3.00 2.93 2.44 3.00 2.80 2.57 3.00 2.75 3.00 2.95 2.92 3.00 2.95 2.97 2.97 3.00 2.97 2.96 2.76 3.00 2.89 2.82 2.79 2.69 3.00 2.56 2.94 2.75 2.69 2.81 2.53 2.74 2.83 2.76 3.00 3.00 2.78 2.88 3.00 2.94 2.91 2.88 2.92 2.78 2.85 2.82 2.71 2.90 2.75 2.76 2.91 2.94 2.90 2.90 2.71 2.90 3.00 3.00 3.00 1.00 2.85 2.86 2.86 3.00 3.00 3.00 2.50 2.80 2.80 2.85 2.93 2.85 Here are the averages of the above (same 6 fortnights). 2.80 2.79 2.86 2.85 2.88 2.81 Do I need to give the amount of survey responses that go into the creation of each fortnightly CSAT before we can answer the question of whether performance is skill-based or luck-based? Or can we already get a pretty good answer on the question of whether agents' CSAT is luck- or skill-based based on each agent's average CSAT per fortnight? (If the answer is 'yes', how do we do it?)
