Cacti is a good web-based monitoring/graphing solution. Very complete, very easy to use, with a large userbase including many large Enterprise-level installations. If you want more 'alerting' and less 'graphing', check out nagios . As for 'what to monitor', you want to monitor systems at both the system and application level, so yes: network/memory/disk i/o, interrupts and such over the system level. The application level gets more specific, so a webserver might measure hits/second, errors/second (non-200 responses), etc and a database might measure queries/second, average query fulfillment time, etc.
