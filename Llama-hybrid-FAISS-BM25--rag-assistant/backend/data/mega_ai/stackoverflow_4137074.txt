There is a pygame.display.get_wm_info() call that gets you the Window handler -- from then on, it is using either X11 or Windows API32 to get information from the window through this handler. I didn't find any readily available information on how to do that. So, just to be clear: there is no ordinary way to do that from within pygame. You have to proceed with another library, possibly using ctypes , after you get the window handler. On the other hand, if you have to manipulate the window itself, maybe pygame is not the most suitable library for you to use -- you could try PyQt or even GTK+ - they also provide multmedia facilites while being more proper to operate on the level of GUI Windows and other controls update There are ways to setup an OpenGL backend for pygame graphics, that will allow complete control of the display - including embedding it in another window, as part of a tkinter or Qt application. People that are interested can search a little deeper along those lines.
