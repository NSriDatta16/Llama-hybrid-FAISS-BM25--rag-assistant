ARMA/GARCH estimation in sequence

I have a time series that shows a nonstationary seasonal autoregressive component as well as known heteroshedasticity. In order to model the series, I have fit a seasonal ARIMA model for the mean with the auto.arima model in the forecast package in R and a GARCH model on the residuals of the ARIMA model. Is the procedure of sequentially estimating ARIMA and GARCH model correct or would it have been better to jointly model the mean and the variance of the series? If this were correct, is there a (possibly R) function to do it?
