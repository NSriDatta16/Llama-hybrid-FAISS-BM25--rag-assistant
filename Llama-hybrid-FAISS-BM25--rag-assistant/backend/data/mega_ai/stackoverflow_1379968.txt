SQL Update trigger column name

can't seem to find a way to do this anywhere. I have an SQL trigger that fires on an update. The trigger copies some details about the update to another table that someone elses program uses. Among the details passed is the name of the updated column. There a many, many, potential columns that have been updated (although only one at any one time), and I could just use something like: IF UPDATE(ThisColumn) BEGIN Do stuff with ThisColumn END IF UPDATE(ThatColumn) BEGIN Do same stuff with ThatColumn END But as I said there are many columns in this table and I'm sure there must be an elgant way to get the name of the column that has been updated without me typing pages of essentially the same IF statements. Thanks in advance!
