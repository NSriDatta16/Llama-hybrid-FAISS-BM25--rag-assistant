Authentication on odata service

I want to add some authentication to my odata service. Depending on the user calling i want to: filter rows and/or remove columns. I read in scott hanselmans fine blogpost on odata ( http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CreatingAnODataAPIForStackOverflowIncludingXMLAndJSONIn30Minutes.aspx )that it is possible to intercept the incoming queries. If this works i could add some extra filtering. How would this intercepting and altering queries work exactly? I can not find any examples of where and how to do this. (i'm using entitie framework and wcf dataservices (just like scotts example blog)
