Intercept of logistic regression too high, probability not close to zero

Through an L0 and L2 regularization method I have developed a logistic model that has an intercept of around -3. Taking the exp() of that alone I get a probability of around 5%. So that is when other parameters in the model are zero (they cannot be negative). My question: Is that wrong for a logistic model ? Should they go from 0 to 1 no matter what, and hence my model is completely wrong, or...?
