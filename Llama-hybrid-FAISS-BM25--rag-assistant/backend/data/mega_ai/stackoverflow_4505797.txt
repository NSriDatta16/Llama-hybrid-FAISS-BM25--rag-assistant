You can keep track of everything entered (onchange, etc), encode, and put it into local storage. When the page loads, see if you have anything in local storage and fill the form with the user's data. Make sure you empty storage when needed (form submittal, onbeforeunload, after reading the data, etc.) If the problem you're trying to solve is so narrow, you can make the data very short-lived in storage too. Also, make it session-only if you can. You can also limit the saving of data to the onbeforeunload event, instead of saving on every change. At the very least, do a setTimeOut() with some reasonable amount of seconds after onchange is fired and do your saving in the setTimeOut handler, this way you won't use up CPU unnecessarily.
