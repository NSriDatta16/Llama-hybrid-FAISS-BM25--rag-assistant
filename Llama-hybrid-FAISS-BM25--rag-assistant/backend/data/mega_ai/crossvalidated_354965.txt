DV is a Fractional Response Variable. General assistance is appreciated

I have the model found in the image below, where the DV 'BEVMarketshare' is a ratio bound to 0. Observations for the DV range anywhere from 6.13 e^-5 to 0.029. Straight to the point... I've got the basics down when it comes to regression, but literature regarding my DV being a percentage leads me a little off the beaten path. Specifically, a paper entitled "Econometric Methods For Fractional Response Variables With An Application To 401 (K) Plan Participation Rates" is causing a bit of confusion. In the opening paragraphs, an argument is made against using the assumption of a beta distribution for a fractional DV saying that it "is difficult to justify in applications where at least some portion of the sample is at the extreme values of zero or one." As my data is almost entire bound to zero, I'm guessing beta regression isn't the way to go. Instead I have performed regression in R using the frm package, which includes the following details: "frm uses the standard glm command to perform the estimations. Therefore, frm is essentially a convenience command, allowing estimation of several alternative fractional regression models using the same command." I have used this frm method with a logit link, and have sucessfully obtained a summary table. My only question is, have I gone about this the right way? I hope I've provided enough information in order to make the situation clear. If not, please let me know! Thank you in advance!
