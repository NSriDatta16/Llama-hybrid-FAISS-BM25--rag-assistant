Error is usually minimized for a classifier via gradient descent, like mean square error or cross-entropy error, etc. On the other hand, SVM and cascade correlation neural networks are solved via gradient ascent. CV accuracy is one metric that can be used to reflect performance. Basically, if error is low, accuracy is typically high.
