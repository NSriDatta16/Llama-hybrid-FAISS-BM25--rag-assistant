How to measure variability of categorical time series?

I have a list of categorical variable time series. For example A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A A, B, C, A, B, C, C, C, A A, Z, D, X, Y, T, A, A, F C, D, C, D, C, D, D, C, C A, A, A, A, B, A, A, A, A A, A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B I'd like to capture the jitteriness or the unpredictability of the time series and to order the list by that measure. Are there any good measures for this?
