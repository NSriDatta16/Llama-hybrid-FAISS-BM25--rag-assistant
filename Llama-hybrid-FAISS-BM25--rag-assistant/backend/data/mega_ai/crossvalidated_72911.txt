R correlation between two time series analysis

This is my very first post on CV so comment if I can improve my post. I have two webs that sell very similar products and also have a very similar group of customers. I was trying to prove that concept that "Fast Moving Inventory From Web A Will Also Move Fast on Web B" I have the daily snapshots of the inventory of both WebA and WebB. For example, for the product A from Web A, data looks like this: TimeStamp Product Stock UnitPrice Oct 1st A 100 1.2 Oct 2nd A 90 1.2 Oct 3rd A 40 1.2 Oct 4th A 240 1.2 .. For those two Webs, some of their products are exactly the same. For example, WebA and WebB both have product A. I am wondering is there a way to use R to do some time series analysis so I can prove that for those products that they have in common. There is a very high correlation (WebA sell product A crazy last weekend, which is also a good sale reflected on Web B's data)? Is there some R functions to do what I want? Then I can tell Web B that you need to carry those top selllers of Web A but Web B doesn't carry now.
