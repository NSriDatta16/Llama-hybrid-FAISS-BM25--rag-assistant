White noise is the denomination of a random variable that presents mean 0 and constant variance and is serially uncorrelated. White noise does not need to be normal distributed, but if it is, then you denominate as Gaussian White Noise. There are a bunch of tests to be done in a time series that you can obtain an answer showing if your series is a normal distribution or not. Example Jarque–Bera test or Shapiro–Wilk test.
