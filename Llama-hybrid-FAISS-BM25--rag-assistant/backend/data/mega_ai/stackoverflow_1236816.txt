You cannot do this with a telnet: URL in most browsers (IE, FF, afaik). The telnet URL was originally described in RFC 1738, and it provided only information for a hostname, port, username and password. When you click on it, the browser will usually ask the OS for the default "telnet" handler, which is an external application that is run. Most modern telnet clients accept these parameters and put them to use. This architecture varies a bit between browsers, but the application is usually external. There was the occasional request in bugzilla.mozilla.org for support for a telnet plugin or a native telnet client, but it never got much attention. There might be inline solutions like a java applet, but I doubt they are called with a telnet: URL.
