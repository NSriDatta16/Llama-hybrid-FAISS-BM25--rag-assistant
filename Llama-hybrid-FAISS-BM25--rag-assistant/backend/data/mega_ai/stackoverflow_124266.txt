Sort Object in PHP

What is an elegant way to sort objects in PHP? I would love to accomplish something similar to this. $sortedObjectArary = sort($unsortedObjectArray, $Object->weight); Basically specify the array I want to sort as well as the field I want to sort on. I looked into multidimensional array sorting and there might be something useful there, but I don't see anything elegant or obvious.
