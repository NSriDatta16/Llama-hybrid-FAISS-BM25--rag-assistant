The boost libraries use some dark magic to select the libraries to link from the headers and compiler options. I don't really know all the gory details, but you can take a look at the boost/config/auto_link.hpp header for extra information. In particular, this seems to be an important piece of the puzzle: # pragma comment(lib, BOOST_LIB_PREFIX BOOST_STRINGIZE(BOOST_LIB_NAME) "-" BOOST_LIB_TOOLSET BOOST_LIB_THREAD_OPT BOOST_LIB_RT_OPT "-" BOOST_LIB_VERSION ".lib")
