disable the menus before starting the thread. The thread needs to invoke some method on your controller when it's done, and in that method you enable the menus again. The agent won't be messing with menus; it will be just notifying the controller when it's done. The controller will enable the menus when it knows that the agent is done. Also, supposedly it's not good practice to subclass Thread. You should instead implement Runnable and then create a Thread with your Runnable as its target, and start the thread. This way, if your agent is a Runnable, you can run it in its own thread, or in the main thread (by simply calling run()) or in a thread pool, etc.
