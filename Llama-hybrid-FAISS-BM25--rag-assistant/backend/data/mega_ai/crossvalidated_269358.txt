Why use linear regression instead of average y per x

Concretely, if we're interested in predicting house price (dollars) from house size (square meters), we can calculate the best fitting line and use that for predicting new values. But why not simply calculate the average price per square meter and use that for our predictions? We can use that to plot a line as well, can't we? I'm just a bit confused over the difference between the two.
