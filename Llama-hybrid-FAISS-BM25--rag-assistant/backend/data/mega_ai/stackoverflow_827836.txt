jQuery: Is there a way to make this shorter and more elegant?

I have a code that looks like this: I want to wrap each img with dynamically. So my solution was to do this: $(".images").wrap(' ') $("#wrapper a").each(function(n) { $(this).attr('name', n); }) Is it possible to chain the 2 statements into 1 statement? I know that jQuery is particularly do elegant chaining so I think it's definitely possible. I just don't know how to yet.
