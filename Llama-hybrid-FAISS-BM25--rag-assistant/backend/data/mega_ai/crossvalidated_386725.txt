Proving that given Markov chain is homogeneous. Find state space and transition matrix

Let $X_i$ be the results of a consecutive throws of a die. Let $Z_n=3(X_1^2+\cdots+X_n^2) \bmod 5$ . Show that the sequence ${\{Z_n \mid n\geq1\}}$ is a homogeneous Markov Chain. Find a state space and a state-trasition matrix. (Easier version): $Z_n=X_1^2+\cdots+X_n^2 \mod 5$ . I know the Markov chain property which is $P(X_n=s \mid X_0=x_0,\ldots,X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}) = P(X_n=s\mid X_{n-1} = x_{n-1})$ and then the Markov chain is homogeneous, when $$P(X_{n+1}=j\mid X_n=i)=P(X_1=j\mid X_0=i)$$ We know that $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are independent so $P(X_n=s \mid X_0=x_0,\ldots,X_{n-1}=x_{n-1})=P(X_n=s)$ and $P(X_n=s\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1})=P(X_n=s)$ hence $P(X_{n+1}=j)=P(X_1=j)$ , but from this point I don't know how to continue. Any help will be much appreciated.
