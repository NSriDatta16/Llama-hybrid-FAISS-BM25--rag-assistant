Get started to build a Widget

I own a football community website (with RESTful web services available) written in Grails and I would like to develop an embeddable widget to be distributed into other websites or blogs . My requirements: This widget (written in javascript/HTML rather than Flash since I don't know Flash) will display the latest articles of my website (easy...since I have RSS feeds available). However, the most difficult part consists in having remote users to make predictions or give a rate to football games directly from the widget itself . Two modes are supported : anonymous user or user-authenticated (user account located and managed on my website). Statistics from user actions of the client website (i.e. the website embedding the widget) will also be reported inside the widget. My solution: Here you go! Where do I start? Do you advise me to go with online widget creation tools like Widgetbox , KickApps , Widgadget , Grazz or any other ones you like? If yes, which one is the easiest to use and enough flexible to fit my requirements ? Or is there another simpler solution like a Grails plugin? Thanks for your help.
