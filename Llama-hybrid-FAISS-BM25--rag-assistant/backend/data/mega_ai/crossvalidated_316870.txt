Time series model residual plot keeps indicating AR(3)

Like the title says, my residuals keep indicating an AR(3) model. My original model was AR(14), but the residuals' acf and pacf indicated an AR(3) and so did the ar function and auto.arima. So then I fit an AR(17), and then the residuals indicated AR(3) again. What could be going on here?
