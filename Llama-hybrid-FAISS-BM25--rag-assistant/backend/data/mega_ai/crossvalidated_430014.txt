It is often possible to use small amounts of data to identify a useful ARIMA model. It all depends on the ratio of signal to noise that is in the data... the greater the ratio the fewer observations are needed to identify the model. It is also important to possibly include "data cleansing" to deal with anomalies/pulses that otherwise might obfuscate the model identification phase. If you post one of your "small time series" , I might be better able to help ... OR simply simulate a model and post the small data set . I don't know of a book that particularly addresses this issue ....
