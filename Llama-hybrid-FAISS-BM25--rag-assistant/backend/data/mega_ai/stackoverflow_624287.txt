We embedded the Acrobat Reader in our Delphi application. Take a look at this article " How to embed Adobe Acrobat into your application ". Once you have added the Acrobat Reader ActiveX component to your Form you can use following code: procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); begin // This example assumes that you have a TOpenDialog // and TPdf dropped onto your form OpenDialog1.Filter := 'PDF Files (*.pdf)|*.pdf'; if OpenDialog1.Execute then Pdf1.src := OpenDialog1.FileName; end; There is native Delphi components out there but embedding the Acrobat Reader component served our needs.
