It seems to me like the #1 ILMerge Best Practice is Don't Use ILMerge. Instead, use SmartAssembly . One reason for this is that the #2 ILMerge Best Practice is to always run PEVerify after you do an ILMerge, because ILMerge does not guarantee it will correctly merge assemblies into a valid executable. Other ILMerge disadvantages: when merging, it strips XML Comments (if I cared about this, I would use an obfuscation tool) it doesn't correctly handle creating a corresponding .pdb file Another tool worth paying attention to is Mono.Cecil and the Mono.Linker [2] tool.
