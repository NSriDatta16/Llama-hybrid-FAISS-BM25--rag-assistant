How to Disable/Enable WYSIWYG editor in Magento 1.4

When entering code in CMS static block(possible page as well) and in this code there is empty DIV tags such us: The DIV tags will be gone next time you open the block to edit. it will look as this without the div tags ...and saving again it modifies your code. I think it something to do with the 'show/hide editor'. By default it goes into the WYSIWYG editor, so when updating static block i don't see any other solution than 1."hide the editor' by clicking 'show/hide editor' 2.delete the old code from the editor 3. get code that doesn't miss the DIVs 4. Merge new code with code in 3 in some other editing software than magento 5. paste result in the magento editor, 6. Save Is this bug? What is your solution? Can i turn of WYSIWYG editor?
