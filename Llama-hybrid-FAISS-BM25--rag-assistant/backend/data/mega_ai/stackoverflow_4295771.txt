The new Wordpress Themes have child themes, it is a new way to organize and simplify upgrading themes, but it can be a pain because they are not as easy to modify as older themes. Anyway, there is the old way: You can use the settings in the Administration Page to set your homepage to display only one post (Settings / Reading / Blog pages show at most -> 1 post). But if you want just your home to display one post, and decide you want your archives to display the basic 10 posts, you can edit your theme template to use this function: Function Reference/query posts http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts To be sure no date or category is displayed, you also have to edit the template and remove the corresponding php code (in the loop, you should look for these functions: Function Reference/the category http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_category Function Reference/the date http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_date To use the new way, you have to create a child theme to your theme, and override the loop by creating your own loop.
