remove everything between 2 tags that span branches of an xml tree

I'm trying to remove everything in an XML Document between 2 tags, using python & lxml. the problem is that the tags can be in different branches of the tree (but always at the same depth) an example document might look like this. Hello world this is a paragraph Goodbye world. I'm leaving now i'd like to remove everything between the start and end tags. which would result in a single p tag: Hello world I'm leaving now does anyone have any idea how this might be accomplished using lxml & python?
