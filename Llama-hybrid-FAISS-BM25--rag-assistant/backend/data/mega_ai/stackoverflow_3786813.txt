kickstarting a touchesMoved/UIPanGestureRecognizer mid-move for a new view

Concept is that a user taps on an icon in a view, a copy of the icon pops up under the user's finger, and they can drag it around until they lift their finger. To do this, I desire the following icon has touch event add transparent whole screen UIView and paste a UIImageView containing the icon on it. track touchMoves or a uiPanGestureRecognizer and move the UIImageView until touch up The problem is that the touchMoves (and uiPanGestureRecognizer) don't track until the user lifts his finger and puts it back down. i.e. what's happening is: icon has touch event add transparent whole screen UIView and add a UIImageView subview containing the icon on it. user drags finger and nothing happens, so they lift finger and drag again track touchMoves or a uiPanGestureRecognizer and move the UIImageView until touch up Apparently, for a UIView to recognize a drag, it seems to have to originate within the UIView. I tried (naively) to just send the touchdown event to the transparent view, but it isn't working. Any other ideas? many thanks...
