The docs say: This strategy consists of fitting one classifier per target. This is a simple strategy for extending classifiers that do not natively support multi-target classification. So using the convenience function sklearn.multioutput.MultiOutputClassifier allows you to use classifiers with and without multi-target support in the same pipeline. One example of a classifier which does not support multi-target is xgboost . Often it is possible to combine sklearn functions (like the one discussed here) with other algorithms.
