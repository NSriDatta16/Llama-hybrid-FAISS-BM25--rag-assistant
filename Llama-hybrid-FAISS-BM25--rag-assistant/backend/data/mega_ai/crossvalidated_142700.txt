It depends on the type of Neural Network you are using. A single layer Perceptron could do this by subtracting the eta value from each node the number of iterations you trained on based on the activated or not activated features and outputs. If you are using any optimization techniques like early stopping however it wont make sense since the network was dynamically adjusted during training. If you want to incorporate or exclude data from your training set, I would instead go with an unsupervised learning model like KNN, or save the data and re-train the network using something like early stopping to optimize the outputs for the next version of the model without the instance of data you are attempting to "forget"
