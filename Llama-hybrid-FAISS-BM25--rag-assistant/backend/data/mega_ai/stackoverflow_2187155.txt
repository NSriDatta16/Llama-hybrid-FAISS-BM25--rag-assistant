jQuery .each function across browsers (works in ff, ie8, not ie7)

I've been messing with this for far too long, and managed to get IE8 working, but IE7 has me stumped. I've got a table, and for each column, I am trying to extract a number of divs. I am only extracting divs which match specific selectors, not all divs in the column. My original jquery selector was jQuery('div.a1, div.a3, div.a4, div.a7','table#a'+tableId+' td:nth-child('+columnNum+')').each(function(){ alert(jQuery(this).attr('id')); }); This worked great in FF, but didn't trigger the .each function at all in IE. After messing around for a bit, I got to jQuery('td:nth-child('+columnNum+') > div.a1, td:nth-child('+columnNum+') > div.a3, td:nth-child('+columnNum+') > div.a4,td:nth-child('+columnNum+') > div.a7', table#a+'tableId).each(function(){ alert(jQuery(this.attr('id')); }); Not so nice, but works in IE8. I had tried all sorts of combinations using .eq(+'columnNum+') but nothing else was working. Now I go and test in IE7, and again the .each isn't being triggered. What is the nicest way (and cross-browser compatible) to work with this sort of .each element? --------------addition-------------- After further testing and playing around with suggestions from DrJ and bdukes, I've found that the table#'+tableId breaks the function in both IE7&8. I've gone back to my original code jQuery('div.a1, div.a3, div.a4, div.a7','table#a'+tableId+' td:nth-child('+columnNum+')').each(function(){ alert(jQuery(this).attr('id')); }); as that seems to me the most efficient. If I remove 'table#a'+tableId, i get the correct response in all browsers, except that it is adding up the results from all tables, and I need to be able to get only the results from one table at a time. I have also tried 'table#a'+tableId+'>td:nth-child('+columnNum+')').each, but that doesn't work either. The first function i've used works perfectly in firefox. ----------------the html being selected--------------------------- The tables are being created dynamically in javascript so I can't really copy and past it, but here is what the output looks like. It ends up looking kinda like a gantt chart on a table. Group Name ;
