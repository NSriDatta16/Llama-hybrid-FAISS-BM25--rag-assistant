Associate File Type and Icon

Ok, I have looked all over and I am having a difficult time trying to figure out how to associate a custom file type with my C# application. I am using Visual Studio 2008 and am limited to .NET 2.0 due to company deployment. Basically all I really want to do is be able to allow the user to double click my custom file type or drag and drop it on the app icon and it load the data, as well as display a custom icon on the file itself. I can open the file via a dialog box and everything works great. Trying to read Micosoft's online documents is hard to understand and does not really give me all the details that I need. If anyone out there know's where I can find a good tutorial or can explain it I would appreciate it. Thank you Patrick
