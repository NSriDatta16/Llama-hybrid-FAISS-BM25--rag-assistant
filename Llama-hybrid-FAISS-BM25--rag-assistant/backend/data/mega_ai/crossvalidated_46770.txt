How can I quantify the phase/amplitude relationship between two signals?

I have two signals A and B . I want to show that high amplitude events in B are phase locked to oscillations in signal A . I have already identified candidate events signal B . I estimate phase_of_A using the angle of the hilbert transform of A , and I estimate the envelope_of_B using the abs of the hilbert transform of B . A scatter plot of the joint distribution shows a clear relationship between the two variables. Additionally if I randomly re-order the phase_of_A variable the structure is disrupted. My current thinking is use Monte-Carlo methods to demonstrate that the real data is more structured than the shuffled data, I'm just not sure what parameter/statistic to compute on the joint distribution.
