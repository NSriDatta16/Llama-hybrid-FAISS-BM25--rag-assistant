Question about bias-variance trade off

This question is from a uni module about machine learning. I'm a bit stuck as I can't relate it to the bias-variance trade-off, to me the question implies all models have something to do with the trade off but I can only think of B being overfitted on its training data implying a low bias and high variance. I don't know how to explain A having both a high error in testing and training, and C I'm lost.
