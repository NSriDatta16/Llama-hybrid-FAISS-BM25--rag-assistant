Measuring Variable Effect in Random Forest Regressor

Is there a way to measure the effect individual predictors have on an outcome for a Random Forest Regressor? If there's not something similar to a regression coefficient, is there a way to utilize importance measures (MSE,etc.) as a sort of proxy measure?
