IIRC, Qt uses (or used?) a similar approach for their QList et al. Basically, it would work, but you have to make sure you put everything that depends on T inside vector template. Unfortunately, that is almost all code there is in the vector class (in many cases, the code needs to call some T constructor or destructor), except for allocating raw storage and size() / capacity() . I'm not sure that it pays off, so double-check. It does certainly pay of when you can abstract away from some template parameter (eg. set ::iterator need not be aware of the set's comparator) or if you can brew a full implementation for a large class of types (eg. with trivial copy-ctor and dtor).
