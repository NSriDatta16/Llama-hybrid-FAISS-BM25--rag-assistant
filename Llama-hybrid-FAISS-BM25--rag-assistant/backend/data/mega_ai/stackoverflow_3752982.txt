Using Relative Paths To Log Files In Pylons' development.ini

I am working on a Pylons app that runs on top of Apache with mod_wsgi. I would like to send logging messages that my app generates to files in my app's directory, instead of to Apache's logs. Further, I would like to specify the location of logfiles via a relative path so that it'll be easier to deploy my app on other people's servers. Right now I can log to files, but only via a fragile absolute path. Here is the relevant part of my development.ini file: # Logging configuration [loggers] keys = root, routes, myapp, sqlalchemy, debugging-logger [handlers] keys = console, debugging-logger-file [formatters] keys = generic [logger_debugging-logger] level = DEBUG handlers = debugging-logger-file qualname = myapp.controllers.logging-test-controller.debugging-logger [handler_debugging-logger-file] class = FileHandler args = ('/var/pylons/myapp/logs/myapp-debugging-errors.log', 'a') level = DEBUG formatter = generic Although the .ini helpfully advises using %(here)s to refer to the current path, using %(here)s in the "args = ('foo')" line of the error handler does not behave the way that I expect it to. The syntax of this ini file is documented on the Paste Deploy site , but does not specify how %(here)s can be used in relation to quoted strings. What syntax should I use in the "args = ('foo')" line to specify the current path?
