While the student does not have type A repeatability measurements, the student may/should be able to estimate the type B error contribution caused by equipment supplied from elsewhere ("For an estimate xi of an input quantity Xi that has not been obtained from repeated observations"). This is detailed in the SI/bipm Guide to Uncertainty in Measurement (there's a NIST equivalent). This at least allows a route to making some judgement about the results. The alternative, if the student did have a time series measurement (mentioned in one of the comments) is to estimate the smooth curve shape and hence the measurement error on top of that underlying smooth shape. And lastly, if all the control groups were actually the same (not clear from the comments) then they could form a single group for the estimation of measurement noise. Finally, use this as a 'post-mortem' to identify the level of measurement accuracy that would have been required to confirm the hypothesis at risk, and hence the likely number of repeat measurements needed to obtain that accuracy (error in the mean), given particular levels of basic accuracy (error on a single measurement). This at least rescues the student from feeling like it was a complete waste (i.e something learnt!).
