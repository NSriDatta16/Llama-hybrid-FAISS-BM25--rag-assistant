d" and that "If the Arab countries have a better plan, then thatâ€™s great." Trump has requested that Arab governments like Egypt and Jordan take in the displaced Palestinian populations. Abdullah II of Jordan, meeting with Mahmoud Abbas prior, entered into talks with Trump about the plan but did not directly agree with or contradict the president, suggesting instead that Egypt would propose an alternative plan. It is reported that Trump's plan is based on a paper drawn up by economics professor Joseph Pelzman. On 21 February 2025, after opposition from Arab states, Trump said he would "recommend" but not enforce his plan for the US takeover of Gaza and the resettlement of the Palestinian population. On 12 March 2025, Trump said that "nobody is expelling any Palestinians" from Gaza, which signaled a change from his previous stance. On 15 May 2025, during his presidential visit to Qatar, Trump reiterated his desire for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip and "make it a freedom zone". According to "three sources familiar with the effort", Israel and the United States were interested in resettling Gazans to either Syria, Sudan, Morocco, or the separatist Somali regions of Puntland and Somaliland. Somalia and Sudan rejected the proposal, while Puntland and Somaliland expressed willingness to enter discussions on the matter in exchange for diplomatic recognition. In May 2025, reports emerged that the Trump administration was working on a plan to permanently relocate 1 million Gazans to Libya, while offering the release of around $30 billion in funds frozen by the U.S. since the toppling of the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in exchange for Libyan authorities agreeing to the deal.

The US and Israel were working to identify countries for this plan. AI-generated video On February 26, 2025, Trump posted an AI-generated video on social media. The clip depicts the Gaza Strip transformed into a luxury resort called "Trump Gaza" and features Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing, children emerging from rubble into an upscale setting, a golden statue of Trump, scenes of bearded men dancing in bikinis, Trump standing with a belly dancer, and a figure resembling Elon Musk being showered with banknotes. The video received criticism from Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. and abroad, as well as from Republicans and conservatives on Truth Social and Instagram. It was not created by Trump; NBC News reported that it was first posted on social media on February 7 by a pro-Israel X account. The video's true creators later came out saying they did not know how Trump obtained it and criticizing him for posting it without credit or permission. They described it as being created as satire and as a joke, rather than a political statement, and said they did not support Trump's "propaganda machine". The Economist suggested the video typifies a new form of political communication, where "knowingly absurd" AI-generated content conveys controversial ideas under the plausible deniability of humor. International law Trump's proposal for Gaza is against international law; the forcible transfer of populations is prohibited. Members of Trump's administration have walked back on elements of the plan on a few occasions, although in one subsequent statement, Trump held firm to his original plan. On 21 February 2025, after opposition from Arab states, Trump said he would "recommend" but not enforce his plan for the American takeover of Gaza and the re-settlement of the Palestinian population. Arab League leaders met in March to create a counter proposal to Trump's plan, which was rejected by the U.S. and Israel due to concerns about the proposed governance of postwar Gaza and other issues.
