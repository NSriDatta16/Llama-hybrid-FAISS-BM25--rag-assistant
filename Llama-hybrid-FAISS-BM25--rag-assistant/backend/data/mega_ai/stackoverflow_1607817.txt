You have two options: 1) use pax runner 2) Use eclipse bundle witch serves as starter ( i believe it's org.eclipse.equinox.launcher ) Edit: 1*)For equinox options starter see this link paragraph Configurations and all that... BTW I've been wrong it's not launcher bundle it's common and update bundles. 2*)Fox pax runner example see this screen cast
