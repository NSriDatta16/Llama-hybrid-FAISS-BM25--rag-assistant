You can just calculate the overall size of the array and then use memcpy to copy it. int cb = sizeof(char) * rows * columns; memcpy (toArray, fromArray, cb); Edit: new information in the question indicates that the number of rows and cols of the array is not known, and that the array may be ragged, so memcpy may not be a solution.
