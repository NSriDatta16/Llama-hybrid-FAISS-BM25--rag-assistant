Do you have any other information available? previous studies of similar cases? number and types of foods that were not measured? guesses about the process from biologists? If you can find other existing information then possibly your best bet (other than the simple descriptives) is a Bayesian analysis. But be very careful in how you create your priors and the relationships, without a lot of data it can be easy to over interpret results that are more a reflection of the prior than the data.
