welcome to the site! I think the key word you need to know that defines your task is: multi-target classification or regression . You can find an explanation and some possible techniques at this link . For neural networks : The key is to remember that the last layer should have linear activations (i.e. no activation at all). As per your requirements, the shape of the input layer would be a vector (135,) and the output (132,). The usual loss function used for regression problems is mean squared error (MSE). Here's an example of multidimensional regression using Keras: model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(200, input_dim = (135,))) model.add(Activation('relu')) model.add(Dense(200)) model.add(Activation('relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.3)) model.add(Dense(132)) model.compile(loss='mean_absolute_error', optimizer='Adam')
