Can I delete older revisions or repositories to free up storage space? The short answer is no. The way Subversion and CVS work is that they keep an entire history of changes, including deleted files, binary files, etc. Each revision is dependent on the last revision, so you can't just chop out a revision somewhere in the middle or you corrupt your repository. There are 2 things you can do if you are running out of space: 1) Delete your module, and re-create it using just the HEAD revision, which will clear out all old revisions (but you will lose your commit history). 2) The better option- upgrade to a higher plan :-). This is less of an issue with Git since it has a much less server side storage requirement. How do I completely remove a file from the repository's history? There are special cases where you might want to destroy all evidence of a file or commit. (Perhaps somebody accidentally committed a confidential document.) This isn't so easy, because Subversion is deliberately designed to never lose information. Revisions are immutable trees which build upon one another. Removing a revision from history would cause a domino effect, creating chaos in all subsequent revisions and possibly invalidating all working copies. The project has plans, however, to someday implement an svnadmin obliterate command which would accomplish the task of permanently deleting information. (See issue 516.) In the meantime, your only recourse is to svnadmin dump your repository, then pipe the dumpfile through svndumpfilter (excluding the bad path) into an svnadmin load command. See chapter 5 of the Subversion book for details about this. quoted from: http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#removal http://codesion.com/benefits/faq.htm#deleterevisions
