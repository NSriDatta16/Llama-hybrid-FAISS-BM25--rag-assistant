With logistic regression, your response variable is 0 or 1. If you only have 1 explanatory variable, and it is categorical, then everything is finite counts in discrete combinations. You could just make a $2\times 18$ table. If you want to, you could convert the table from raw counts to column-wise proportions. If you want a visualization, you can make a stacked bar plot with 18 adjacent bars. You might want to sort the categories: if there is a natural order, use that, otherwise increasing order, or if people will try to look up the category they're interested in, maybe alphabetical order, although this is typically less good and 18 shouldn't overwhelm people. You don't need to worry about converting the coefficients from your model: with all categorical variables, they will exactly match the observed proportions.
