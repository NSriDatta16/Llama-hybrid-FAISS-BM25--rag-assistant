Using fake datasets to optimize a model

I have a machine learning application I'm working on that will make predictions based on data about retail stores. Problem is, any data collected by BI regarding the performance of a given retail store is highly guarded. Is it feasible for me to work with a mock dataset and still get a good idea of my model's performance on real data? For instance, could I just pick a function describing the true behavior of the system, add a zero mean random error to each response, and generate data points? Is it common to work with fake data in cases where real data is not available?
