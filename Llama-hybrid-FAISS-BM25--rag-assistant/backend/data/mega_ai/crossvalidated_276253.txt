Random Forests versus Boosting - Different Distributions

Trying to wrap my head around the impact of variables with different distributions on Random Forests versus Stochastic Gradient Boosting. Specifically: -How would variables with long tails impact trees in random forests versus stochastic gradient boosting, and what might that mean for results? -How would variables with truncated distributions impact trees in random forests versus stochastic gradient boosting, and what might that mean for results?
