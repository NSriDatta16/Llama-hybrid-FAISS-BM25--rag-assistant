How to learn certain Maths to understand machine Learning papers?

I have done the deeplearning.ai course on deep learning. But I cannot Understand equations like minGmaxDV(D,G)=Ex∼pdata(x)[logD(x)]+Ez∼pz(z)[log(1−D(G(z)))] What kind of Maths am I am supposed to learn? I know Calculus basic Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra. So should I learn Probability (Advance probability maybe)?
