$R^2$ (OOB) worse than $R^2$ (test)

I have fitted a regression random forest model using a data set split (80/20) for training and testing. The resulting model gives me an $R^2$ (OOB) of 0.21, and the $R^2$ computed on the testing is 0.82! That is a huge difference and I am unsure whether my model explains 21% or 82% of the variability in the response. Should I believe the OOB $R^2$ ?
