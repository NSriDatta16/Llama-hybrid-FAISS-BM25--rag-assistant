If, for your target platform, shifting left is the quickest way to multiply a number by two, then the chances are your compiler will do that when compiling the code. Look at the disassembly to check So, for that one line, it's probably exactly the same speed. However, as you're unlikely to have a function containing just that one line, you might well find the compiler would defer the shift until the value is used, or otherwise mix it up with surrounding code, making it less clear cut. A good optimizing compiler will generally do a good job of beating poor to average hand written assembly.
