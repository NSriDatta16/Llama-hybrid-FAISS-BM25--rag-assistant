Recently I've been learning/improving my python by solving the Project Euler problems in python. This has worked really well for me because: It is fun and competitive, so I'm motivated to keep going It forces me to use the python data structures in a really natural way to get the performance I need, so has taught me a lot about lists, sets, strings, iteration etc. Most of the problems need less than a page of code to solve, so you have more time to think about polishing or rewriting in a more elegant way Python copes with large integers really easily, and so it just feels like the right language to use I'd thoroughly recommend this.
