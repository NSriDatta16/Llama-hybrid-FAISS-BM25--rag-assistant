Problem with time series outliers

I'm studying this time series (Italy - Producer Price Index): Using TRAMO for outlier detection, I have found an innovation outlier on October 2008. Differentiating the series, this outlier becomes a temporary change . Is it possible this situation? Do you suggest to cut the series from the IO or to linearize the differentiated series?
