If you just have one-dimensional data, you could do a box plot thereof, and everything beyond the whiskers is considered outliers. If you want to presume approximate normality, you can take the z-score as an anomaly score and decide about a threshold yourself. If you have time series data, you might want to look into belonging libraries like e.g. the R package tsoutliers . If you also want to do spatial comparisons, i.e. compare precipitation of different locations and want to find outliers, i.e. rare values for precipitation, I would recommend isolation forest .
