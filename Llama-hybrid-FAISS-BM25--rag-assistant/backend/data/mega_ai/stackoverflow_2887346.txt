Perhaps you can make use of the django-values project, which provides a dbsettings app, which ... ... allows placeholders for settings to be defined in Python, while their values are set by staff using an editor while the server is up and running. Many value types are available, and they each map to a native Python type, so model methods and other Python code can access them as standard class attributes. Much effort has also been made to reduce the overhead of this feature, so that the database is only queried once during each server restart, and only updated when the values themselves are updated. NOTE: This is not intended as a replacement for settings.py. This is designed for values that are expected to change based on the needs of the site or its users, so that such changes don't require so much as a restart. settings.py is still the place to go for settings that will only vary by project. One way of looking at it is that settings.py is for those things that are required from a technical perspective (database connections, installed applications, avaialble middleware, etc), while dbsettings is best for those things that are required due to organizational policy (quotas, minimum requirements, etc). That way, programmers maintain the technical requirements, while administrators maintain organizational policy. The project is by Marty Alchin (who wrote the Pro Django book) and does not require any changes to Django code - it's a standard Django application.
