How to find center of clusters of numbers? statistics problem?

I have a problem where I have a set of numbers eg. 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 7, 20, 23, 23, 24, 24, 24, 25 In the above set, there is two "clusters" of numbers, I want to write a program to find the centers of these clusters. Could you call them attractors as in Fractal theory? So the program would, I guess, find that the set can be divided into two: A - 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 7 B - 20, 23, 23, 24, 24, 24, 25 Set A can then have it average calculated, set B can have its average calculated then I have the two centers of the attractors. Maybe this is a simple problem for a good math/statistics person? Can anyone point me in the right direction? I may have between 1 and 5 "attractors/clusters".
