Have you considered RRDTool - it provides a round robin database, or circular buffer, for time series data. You can store data at whatever interval you like, then define consolidation points and a consolidation function, for example (sum, min, max, avg) for a given period, 1 second, 5 seconds, 2 days, etc. Because it knows what consolidation points you want, it doesn't need to store all the data points once they've been agregated. Ganglia and Cacti use this under the covers and it's quite easy to use from many languages. If you do need all the datapoints, consider using it just for the aggregation.
