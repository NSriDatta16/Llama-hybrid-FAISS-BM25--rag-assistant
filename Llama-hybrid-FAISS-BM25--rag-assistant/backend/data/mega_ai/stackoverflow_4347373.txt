In addition to the PreparedStatement answer: Java's char is a 16-bit UTF-16 value. MySQL's CHAR is a synonym for CHAR(1) ... which is just a single character wide, (number of bytes depends on the table's character set). Now, PreparedStatement 's setString should take care of the encoding conversion for you, but that still leaves one problem: MySQL on some systems defaults to the latin1 character set. Which means CHAR is too small. There is a fix for this. During table creation, you can force a table to be a specific character set: CREATE TABLE testtable1( key1a CHAR, key1b CHAR, encoded1a CHAR, encoded1b CHAR) CHARACTER SET utf8; Note: You can also use utf16 instead of utf8 ; I just used utf8 for storage size reasons.
