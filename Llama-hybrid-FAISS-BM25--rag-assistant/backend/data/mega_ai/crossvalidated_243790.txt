Difference in means between two dependent variables over multiple year

I am trying to figure out the correct way to perform this analysis. My data consists of multiple companies over a 8-year period. The companies are always the same through this period. For each company, two rates are calculated each year that are dependent. I would like to compare the averages of these two rates over the years to find out whether or not they, on average, match. So for each year, the averages for both rates would be calculated from that year's rates and for each year the difference would be tested. I would appreciate any kind of help.
