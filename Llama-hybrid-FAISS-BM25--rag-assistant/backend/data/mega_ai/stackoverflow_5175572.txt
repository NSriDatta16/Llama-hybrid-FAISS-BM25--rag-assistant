String representation of byte array

I have a string that represents a byte string s = "\x00af"; I write this string to a file so the file contains the literal "\x00af" and not the byte it represents, later I read this string from the file, how can I now treat this string as byte again (and not the literal)? Here is a sample code: public static void StringAndBytes() { string s = "\x00af"; byte[] b = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(s); // Length would be 1 Console.WriteLine(b.Length); // Write this to a file as literal StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter("c:\\temp\\MyTry.txt"); sw.WriteLine("\\x00af"); sw.Close(); // Read it from the file StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("c:\\temp\\MyTry.txt"); s = sr.ReadLine(); sr.Close(); // Get the bytes and Length would be 6, as it treat the string as string // and not the byte it represents b = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(s); Console.WriteLine(b.Length); } Any idea on how I convert the string from being a text to the string representing a byte? Thx!
