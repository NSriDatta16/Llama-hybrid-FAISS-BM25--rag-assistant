because two NULLs don't compare as equal, they play funny games with UNIQUE constraints. See last paragraph of UNIQUE constraints in the PostgreSQL documentation : In general, a unique constraint is violated when there are two or more rows in the table where the values of all of the columns included in the constraint are equal. However, two null values are not considered equal in this comparison. That means even in the presence of a unique constraint it is possible to store duplicate rows that contain a null value in at least one of the constrained columns.
