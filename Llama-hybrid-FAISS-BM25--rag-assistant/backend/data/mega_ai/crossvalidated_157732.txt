The answer is no, user2991243; you can apply that interpretation in the linear regression model, while the interpretation of $\beta$ coefficient in the logistic regression model is pretty different, because of the logit transformation and the fact that $\beta$ coefficients are odds ratios and, so, not linear in the probability. Here you can find the explanation of such transformation and the relative interpretation (using stata). Hope this helps.
