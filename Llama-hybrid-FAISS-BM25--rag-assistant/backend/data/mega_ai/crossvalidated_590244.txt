The title of this thread and the body point towards different questions. I'll address the title question here. There is no guarantee that the principal components (PCs) that capture most of the variance in the data are the same as those that are informative for any purpose, including clustering. This depends on the nature of the variation in the data. Given that we have chosen the variables to summarise with a PCA, it is unlikely but possible for the first PC to be uninformative, and the 10th (or 20th, or nth) PC to capture useful information. Visual examination of patterns in each PC and an examination of the loadings are helpful steps to establish whether they are informative.
