Files can contain any arbitrary pattern of bytes, so there is no (digital) way to create a file that is "corrupted". You can certainly modify a file in an existing format (for example, an XML file) so that it no longer is valid in whatever format it's supposed to be, but it's still just a file on disk and is perfectly readable. You generally need to physically alter the storage medium on which the file is stored, in order to make the file actually unreadable .
