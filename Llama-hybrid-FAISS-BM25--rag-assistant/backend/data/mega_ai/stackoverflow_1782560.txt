Choosing specific record for form

On this form, I create a grid, almost looks like a bar chart with little "cells" stacked by month. Each of these "cells" are square sub forms, and I create the little square forms that I use as the sub forms. So what I wanted to know is, what is the code (VB) for running a select query, and only working with specific records within that query? For example, each one of these little "cell" like forms that become the sub-forms, represent a organization, and if I run a top Nth query I get the 10 Top store by whatever....so the idea is to use each little form as a representative of each record from that query. So for the first cell I want to run the SELECT query, get the results, and work only with the first record. Then on the second form, run the exact same query, and work only with the second record, and so on! Its a little weird I suppose, but it will give them exactly what they want, and the only part I am not sure about, is the "defining exactly which record I want to use in the VBA"
