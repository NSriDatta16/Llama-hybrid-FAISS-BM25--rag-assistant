Filtering DataGridView By Date Prior to Printing

I am filtering the DataGridView by a TIMESTAMP column so users can determine the date of data to print. Following is how I am creating my filtered DataGridView . However, in order to get the correct dates for instance Feb 8, 2010 to Feb 10, 2010, I have to select one date prior so the date range has to be Feb 7, 2010 to Feb 10, 2010 to get Feb 8, 2010 to Feb 10, 2010. This is too confusing for users. TIMESTAMP is declared as SqlDbType.DateTime . Where am I screwing up? private void CreateFilteredDataGridView(DataGridView dgv, string fromDate, string toDate) { try { myDataSet = new DataSet(); myDataSet.CaseSensitive = true; DataAdapter.SelectCommand.Connection = myConnection; DataAdapter.TableMappings.Clear(); DataAdapter.TableMappings.Add("Table", "GARAGE"); DataAdapter.Fill(myDataSet); myDataView = new DataView(myDataSet.Tables["GARAGE"], "TIMESTAMP >= '" + Convert.ToDateTime(fromDate) + "' AND TIMESTAMP
