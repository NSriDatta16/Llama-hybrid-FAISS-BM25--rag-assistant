Android SD Card Characteristics on Samsung Galaxy

My app requires that the use manually copy a file from their PC to the SD card in a subdirectory that my app creates there (or I will look for it in the root directory). So far, so good (most people not having a problem except when they try to run my app while the phone is still connected and then ask why it tells them "SD card not mounted" :-) ). Anyway, I'm wondering how the Samsung Galaxy phones work since my understanding is that they have an external AND internal SD card. My app currently calls "Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()"; does this return the root of the EXTERNAL card? Also, when the user mounts the device to their PC, what does it look like? Do they see two mounted drives, or only the external card as a drive, or something else?
