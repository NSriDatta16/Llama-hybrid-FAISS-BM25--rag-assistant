repeated measures multinomial logit or competing risks?

I need some help/advice for tackling the following problem: interested in exploring the association between various covariates and the reason for termination from a data registry. The hypothesis/suspicion is that a lower proportion of ethnic/racial minorities will get kidney transplant rather than dialysis at time of end stage kidney disease onset (i.e., time of termination from registry). Outcome is reason for termination (the dataset has this as a categorical variable with numerous categories which I narrowed down to only 4 categories: transplant, dialysis, death, other). The "other" category is the most numerous as it contains everybody terminated for any reason other than transplant/dialysis/death, plus over 300 cases who had missing value for reason for termination (these patients might still be in the registry for all we know, there's no way of knowing what happened with them), followed by transplant, dialysis and death (just a couple of cases of death). Covariates : some are time-independent (sex, race/ethnicity) while others are measured repeatedly at 6-months visits so time-dependent (such as lab values, hypertension status, eGFR). I'm thinking that either option A or B might work here: A. repeated measures multinomial logistic regression analysis, given the outcome with more than 2 categories, and the time-dependent nature of some of the covariates, or B. repeated measures competing risks/cause-specific hazards analysis However, I am not sure if I even need to consider repeated measures here, as the outcome itself (reason for termination) is fixed. Nor am I sure if I even have competing risks per se - I think the idea is that we will see some racial effects where minorities get the transplant less frequently and are more often receiving dialysis but I don't really know if we need competing risks for this? Now, If I do need to account for the repeated measures nature of some covariates, I have no experience with how to do this for multinomial or competing risks models and I haven't been able to find many resources that are easy to understand and provide specific examples for implementing in R or SAS. Can somebody please help advise what the appropriate type of analysis would be given the study context/research hypothesis? Thank you kindly!
