JQuery Resize div

I want to add a div on a click and automatically start the resize mouse ui functionality with the mousedown. I can add the div easily, I have the resize functionality easy. But I can't figure out how to pass the mouse event and bind them so that the resize can start right away. Imagine a painting like program so the div can be added and drawn by dragging the mouse...? Thank you so much.
