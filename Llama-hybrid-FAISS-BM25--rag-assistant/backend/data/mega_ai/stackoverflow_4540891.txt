NHibernate - mapping connection-table & back-references

Hey, I have to map the following entities: class Document { public int DocumentId { get; set; } public DocumentList ContainingList { get; set; } } class DocumentList { public int DocumentListId { get; set; } public DateTime LastUpdateTime { get; set; } public IList Documents { get; set; } } With the constraint that only one DocumentList can own a specific document (altough a collection-table exists here). Mapping has to rely on the following tables (which cannot be changed, for the sake of simplicity): TB_DOC ------ DOC_ID (int, PK) DOC_CONTENT (blob) TB_DOC_LIST ----------- DOC_LIST_ID (int, PK) DOC_LIST_UPDATE_TIME (datetime) TB_LIST_AND_DOCS ---------------- DOC_LIST_ID DOC_ID So the mapping i tohught of would be like this: enter code here and: [ ??? ] - property to reference the "owner" document list Now, following the known patterns, i can't figure out how should the back-link from Document to the DocumentList be mapped, since i have a "weired| one-to-many relation here, broken by a third table. I also don't want a Document object to reference an IList to solve this with back-referencing many-to-many, since each Document has only one such "owner" DocumentList. Any elegant idea? what am i mispercepting here?
