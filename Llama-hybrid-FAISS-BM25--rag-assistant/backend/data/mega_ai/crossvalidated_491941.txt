With only 31 observations in your data set, you don't have balance. As the aov manual page says: aov is designed for balanced designs, and the results can be hard to interpret without balance... Your data set is specifically missing a 32nd case for which B=1 , A=4 , and S=1 . If you provide such a case along with a corresponding value of Y , restoring balance, you will get the type of summary report that you expect. If there isn't such a case, then you can't properly use aov for the analysis. In this case, the unexpected form of the summary report has prevented you from using aov inappropriately with unbalanced data. It's good that you paid enough attention to the form of the summary to catch that problem.
