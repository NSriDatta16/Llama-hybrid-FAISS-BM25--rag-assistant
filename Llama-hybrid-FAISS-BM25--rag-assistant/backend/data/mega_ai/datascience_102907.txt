How can I model this problem to train a Machine learning model

I am new to Machine Learning and need help understanding how can I model the below (hypothetical) problem. Say I record the following info about thousands of people. For 365 days, each day I record the following info about each person. Person's weight Gender (1 for male, 0 otherwise) Calories intake Calories burnt Hour's slept So that my complete dataset looks like this Person1 Day weight gender cal-intake cal-burnt hours-slept 1 82 1 2010 1890 6 2 81.5 0 2050 1785 8 ... 81.7 1 2055 1780 7 365 81.2 1 2060 1810 7 Person2 Day weight gender cal-intake cal-burnt hours-slept 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 365 ... ... ... ... ... and so on. I want to train a model in python using this data. The model should be able to do the following: I will supply 30 days of information on a new person as input to the model and it will give out a binary value indicating whether the person will loose or gain weight 7 days from now in the future. Can this be done? Edit: I want to learn how to approach such a problem, the suitable algorithms and how to shape my data. Not worried about the accuracy of the trained model as I won't be using it in real life.
