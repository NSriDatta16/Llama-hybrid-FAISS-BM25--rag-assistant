TeamCity Extracting Artifact Dependencies

I'm trying to create a build step in Teamcity that has an Artifact Dependency on another build step. The previous build step's artifacts are available as a .zip file. The build step is able to retrieve the artifacts and they are downloaded to: C:\BuildAgent\work\27f84e3eca3a33d5\artifactdir\artifacts.zip Clearly a .zip file isn't much use to me, I need these to be decompressed so that the build step can access the build file. How do I get TeamCity to decompress the artifacts?
