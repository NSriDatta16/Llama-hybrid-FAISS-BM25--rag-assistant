There is actually a big substantial difference, which is related to the technical differences that you mentioned. Logistic regression models a function of the mean of a Bernoulli distribution as a linear equation (the mean being equal to the probability p of a Bernoulli event). By using the logit link as a function of the mean ( p ), the logarithm of the odds (log-odds) can be derived analytically and used as the response of a so-called generalised linear model. Parameter estimation on this GLM is then a statistical process which yields p-values and confidence intervals for model parameters. On top of prediction, this allows you to interpret the model in causal inference. This is something that you cannot achieve with a linear Perceptron. The Perceptron is a reverse engineering process of logistic regression: Instead of taking the logit of y, it takes the inverse logit (logistic) function of wx , and doesn't use probabilistic assumptions for neither the model nor its parameter estimation. Online training will give you exactly the same estimates for the model weights/parameters, but you won't be able to interpret them in causal inference due to the lack of p-values, confidence intervals, and well, an underlying probability model. Long story short, logistic regression is a GLM which can perform prediction and inference, whereas the linear Perceptron can only achieve prediction (in which case it will perform the same as logistic regression). The difference between the two is also the fundamental difference between statistical modelling and machine learning.
