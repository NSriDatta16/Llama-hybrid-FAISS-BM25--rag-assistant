How to write a script for organizing my desktop windows? (WinXP)

I would like to write a script that moves the currently open Windows to a certain location. Ideally, my program would look like this: var window = FindWindow("Winamp"); window.setPos(1140, 900, 160, 124); // set x, y, width and height window = FindWindow("Windows Live Messenger"); window.setPos(1140, 0, 900, 124); // etc... I suspect that I need to use the Windows Scripting Host . I had a look at the documentation on MSDN, but I can't seem to find the API calls that I need. Can someone point me in the right direction? PS: It doesn't have to be a scripting language, C++ is fine as well.
