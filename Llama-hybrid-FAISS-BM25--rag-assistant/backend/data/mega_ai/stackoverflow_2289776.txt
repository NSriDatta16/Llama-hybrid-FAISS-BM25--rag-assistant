I think you have to make sure your JavaScript is binding. Is your javascript before or after your paragraph element, for some reason my brain is aiming towards that. I would look into using something like jQuery, it will help. using jQuery your code would be (with the relevant jQuery files included of course) : $(document).ready(function() { $("#javascript-warning").click(function(){ alert("HELLO"); }); });
