One solution that would leverage your json investment would be to simply convert the binary data to something that json can support. For example, Base64 encoding might work well for you. You could treat the output of your BAse64 encoder just like you would a normal string in json. it looks like python has Base64 support built in , though i only use java on app engine so I can't guarantee that the linked library work in the sandbox or not.
