SSL and SocketChannel

Ideally, I only need a simple SSLSocketChannel . I already have a component that reads and writes message over ordinary SocketChannel , but for some of these connections, I have to use SSL over the wire; the operations over these connections, however, are the same. Does anyone knows a free SSLSocketChannel implementation (with the appropriate selector) or something similar? I've found this , but the selector doesn't accept it since its vendor isn't SUN. I'm decoupling the reading_from/writing_to net logic from the insertion and retrieval of network data via a simple object, in order to use a SSLEngine without getting mad, but it's really tricky to implement that correctly, given the fact that I don't know the internals of SSL protocol...
