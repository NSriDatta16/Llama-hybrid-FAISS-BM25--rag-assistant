How useful macroeconomic indicators at item-level forecasting?

When planning forecasting strategies for an organization with high hierarchy (at geography, market product level), can I conclude that: For the medium (~3 months-2 years) and long horizon (~2 years and up) forecasts macroeconomic indicators are crucial to achieve better forecasts. But, at the item-level forecasts for purchasing and inventory planning, since they have short horizons (~0-3 months), macroeconomic indicators (external variables) has the minimum effect, instead the internal variables such as price changes and promotions must be considered perhaps in a multiple linear regression. I am new to inventory forecasting and, eager to know your thoughts. Thank you in advance.
