I need to use Prototype to do something I can easily do in jQuery

I know my jQuery, but sadly don't know much about Prototype. $(function() { $('#home-gallery-container').append(' '); }); How would I do this in Prototype, or Magento's library if that adds anything extra. Note in the sample above, I have taken into account jQuery.noConflict() etc
