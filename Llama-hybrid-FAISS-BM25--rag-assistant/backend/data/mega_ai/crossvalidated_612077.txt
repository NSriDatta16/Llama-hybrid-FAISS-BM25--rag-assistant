Are categories meaningful when they're equally predictive?

I have some categories in a fraud dataset I'm working on that are composed of 99% one category and 1% the other. On inspection these categories contain the exact same percentage of frauds ~1.4%, which is inline with my dataset's average. If the categories present nearly the same information in terms of the target, are they meaningfully different?
