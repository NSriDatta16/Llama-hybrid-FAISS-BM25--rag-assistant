Understanding entropy/salience of probability distribution of two data sets

I'm using a 1.6M tweet corpus to train a naive bayes sentiment engine. I am trying to "compute the entropy of a probability distribution of the appearance of an n-gram in different datasets". My two data sets are n-grams constructed from a positive corpus & negative corpus, and I want to remove any common n-grams with a high entropy. I have spent several hours searching the web for how to do this in code. I'm not necessarily looking for code, as I'd prefer to understand what I'm doing, but I just don't know where to start. I was either a math or CS major my 2 years in college, so I have enough of a background in this area to be... still utterly confused :) I'm also relatively new to this space, so I'm sure my ignorance is playing a bit of a part in this, but I'm hoping somebody can help nudge me in the right direction. I posted the question on SO but the more I think about it, the more I'm not sure that's the right place to ask... The two equations are as follows (first time ever trying to use Latex formatting, so sorry if it's butchered): $$\text{entropy}(g) = H(p(S|g)) = -\sum_{i=1}^N p(S_i|g) \log(p(S_i|g))$$ $$\text{salience}(g) = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^N \left(1 - \frac{\min(P(g|S_i),P(g|S_j))}{\max(P(g|S_i),P(g|S_j))}\right)$$ G is a set of n-grams representing the message, N is the number of sentiments (in my case, 2), S represents Shannon Entropy If breaking that down into layman/pseudo-code isn't an appropriate scope, I'm happy to be pointed towards resources where I can learn this on my own. Many thanks! [Edit] I am attempting to follow this pdf document , specifically step 5.3 for increasing accuracy (not used for developing bayesian sentiment) [/Edit] [Edit 2] So given an N of 2, I believe entropy is defined as: $$p(S_1|g) * log(p(S_1|g) - p(S_2|g) * log(P(S_2|g)$$ Where $p(S_1|g)$ is calculated as (ng_count) / (ng_count+total_count), if ng_count is the number of instances my n-gram shows up in my $S_1$ corpus, and total_count is the total count of all n_gram instances. Is that correct? [/Edit 2]
