How to choose best proposal distribution for importance sampling

From Robert & Casella p95 , we know that the choice of proposal distribution $g(x)$ with minimal variance is the $g$ proportional to $|h(x)|f(x)$. If we restrict our proposal distribution to cetain function class, for example, The normal distribution $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, is there an algorithm to choose best parameter $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that is most "proportional" to $|h(x)|f(x)$? I mean, is there a score for the "proportionality" between 2 functions?
