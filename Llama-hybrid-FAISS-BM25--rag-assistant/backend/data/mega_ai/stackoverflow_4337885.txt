Pulling from two arrays a non-matching object

I have two arrays. If an object in one array has no matching email attribute in the other, I want to build an array out of all those objects.. My attempts at attacking the dragon : CardReferral.all.map(&:email) - CardSignup.all.map(&:email) That almost does what I need! Unfortunately, it only supplies an email in an array. And I want the whole object.
