Something else to consider is that for compatibility with pre OS 3.0 devices, Core Data (SQLite) isn't really an option. Besides Core Data's (un)availability, I'm not sure that the data you need to store maps cleanly onto a relational data model. I'd lean towards the plist storage. I think it makes the most sense given your needs.
