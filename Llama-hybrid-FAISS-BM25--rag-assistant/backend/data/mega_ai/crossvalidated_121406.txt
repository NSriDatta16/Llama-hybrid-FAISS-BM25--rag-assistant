Consider solving it using an absorbing Markov chain of a line of 6 states and one absorbing state at one end, say the right end. Transition starts from the state at the leftmost end. Following is a depiction of that: $(6/0) \leftrightarrow (5/1) \leftrightarrow (4/2) \leftrightarrow (3/3) \leftrightarrow (2/4) \leftrightarrow (1/5) \leftrightarrow [0/6]$ Each state is represented as (# of red cards/# of blue cards). The absorbing state is represented using square brackets: [ ]. All the right transitions occur with probability (# of red)/6. All the left transitions occur with probability (# of blue)/6. Consider finding What is the expected number of transitions before the absorbing state is reached. More details: It can be found by computing the expected number of times the chain is in the first (leftmost) state plus the expected number of times the chain is in the second state plus so on up to the sixth state given that the chain states from the first (leftmost) state. To compute that, first build the transition probability matrix, which will look like: \begin{align*} {\bf P} = \left[ {\begin{array}{ccccccc} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 1/6 & 0 & 5/6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 2/6 & 0 & 4/6 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 3/6 & 0 & 3/6 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4/6 & 0 & 2/6 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5/6 & 0 & 1/6\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} } \right], \end{align*} where$[{\bf P}]_{i,j}$ is the probability of transitioning from $i$th state to $j$th state. Then the expected number of times a state is visited starting from another state can be calculated as follows: ${\bf N} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} {\bf P}^k = \left({\bf I} - {\bf P}\right)^{-1}$, where $[{\bf N}]_{i,j}$ is the expected number of time the state $j$ is visited given that the chain started from state $i$. Then the total expected number of time we remain in the chain before going to the absorbing state is $\sum_{j=1}^{6} [{\bf N}]_{1,j}$. I have done the calculation. The answer seems to be $83.2$.
