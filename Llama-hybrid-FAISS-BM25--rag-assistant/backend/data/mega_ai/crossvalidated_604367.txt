Your network is not connected. To be specific, it is not strongly connected as a directed graph. The concept of closeness makes little sense for disconnected networks. This is pointed out in the igraph documentation. A short explanation: The closeness of a vertex is defined as the inverse of the mean distance to all other vertices. What if not all other vertices are reachable? R/igraph 1.3 will only consider reachable one when computing distances and doing the averaging. However, this means that the closeness values of vertices from which a different set of other vertices are reachable will not be comparable. Consider alternative centrality measures. Harmonic centrality is often used as an alternative to closeness in disconnected networks.
