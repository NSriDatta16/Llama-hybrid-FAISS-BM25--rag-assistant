Loss function range normalization

This is from a referee report in a conference to which I submitted my paper - I don't quite get it and I'm not sure what I need to do about it. I use Euclidean loss and Softmax cross-entropy (pixelwise) loss in my model. The referee pointed out that the losses are not in the same range and they are not weighted. I've never seen that done in other models (e.g. Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN). Any suggestions how to address this issue?
