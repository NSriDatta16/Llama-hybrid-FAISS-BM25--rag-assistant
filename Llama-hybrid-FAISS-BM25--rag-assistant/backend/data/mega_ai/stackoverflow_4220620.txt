There are quite a few ways to fix this, but if you want to minimize your code changes you can just add another class to your target elements that doesn't change, then bind to that. If you can't add an additional class for some reason, try this: $('span.project_sel,span.project_unsel').mouseout(function() { $(this).removeClass('project_sel').addClass('project_unsel'); }).mouseover(function() { $(this).removeClass('project_unsel').addClass('project_sel'); }); You could also take a look at toggleClass() if you feel add/remove is inelegant. Edit: Karim's hover solution is better than doing it via mouseout/mouseover.
