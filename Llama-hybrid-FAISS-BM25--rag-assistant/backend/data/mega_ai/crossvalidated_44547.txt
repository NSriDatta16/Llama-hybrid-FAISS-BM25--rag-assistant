I believe (and someone will correct me if I'm wrong) that "classification function" can be used much more broadly - for any function that does classification, whether from logistic regression, discriminant analysis or whatever. "Discriminant function" is restricted to those from discriminant analysis. At least, that's how I've seen them used.
