You mentioned using memset, but your code didn't call it. You can leverage the features of the language to allocate & memset all in one blast: int someInts [256] = {0}; This will allocate an array of 256 ints, and set each one to zero, accomplishing the same as: int someInts[256]; memset(someInts, 0, sizeof(someInts)); ...but possibly faster, depending on how your compiler will optimize the alloc-memset code block.
