(Will update with details as I learn.) Yes. A Haar measure is essentially a uniform distribution over the set of all orthogonal matrices. Orthogonal matrices of dimension $n$ are also known as orthogonal groups , denoted $\mathrm{O}(n)$ . and 3. Yes. For example, one could use the Gram-Schmidt process (GSP) which orthogonalizes a set of vectors in an iterative manner. This is a deterministic procedure, but randomness can be injected by initializing a set of random vectors and applying the GSP to these vectors. The resulting matrix will correspond to the Q matrix in QR decomposition . The Wikipedia article on orthogonalization lists other methods that can be leveraged in the same manner as above. For sampling from the Haar distribution, see How to generate random matrices from the classical compact groups (used in SciPy's ortho_group function).

How to generate it?
