You are not missing anything, the correct answer is $-9500$! First find the idiosyncratic characteristics of Caroline, by updating her background variables $U$ given the evidence $EX = 9$, $ED = 2$, $S = 97000$. This is the Abduction step, $$ 97000 = 65000 + 2500(9) + 5000(2) +U_{s} \implies U_s = -500\\ 9 = 10-4(2) + U_{EX} \implies U_{EX} = 7 $$ Now we perform the action, which is setting Caroline's new education to 1, that is, $do(ED = 1)$, and properly mutilating the graph and structural equations. Finally we perform prediction under the new system (using the new updated information about the exogenous variable and the interventional graph), $$ EX_1(Caroline) = 10-4*(1) + 7 = 13 \\ $$ And, $$ \begin{align} S_{1}(Caroline) &= 65000 + 2500\times EX_{1}(Caroline) + 5000(1) -500 \\ &=65000 + 2500(13) + 5000 - 500\\ &= 102000 \end{align} $$ Thus, $S_1(Bert) - S_1(Caroline) = 92500 - 102000 = -9500$. PS: Pearl is aware of the typo and this will probably be in the errata and corrected soon.
