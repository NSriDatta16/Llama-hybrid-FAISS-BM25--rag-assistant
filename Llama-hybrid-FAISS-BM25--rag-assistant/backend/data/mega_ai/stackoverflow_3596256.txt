There are multiple options which are prepositioned for embedding. Most promising seems "PHP News System" http://phpns.alecwh.com/ , though I haven't used it and cannot qualify it much. But it claims the embedding process is just a single php call, which still sounds acceptable. If you want just a blog, I'd recommend Serendipity over Wordpress. Firstly because of the better security track record, and second because it specifically has a switch for embedding it within an existing layout; so unlike WP doesn't need as much workarounds.
