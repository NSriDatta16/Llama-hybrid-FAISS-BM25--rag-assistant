SWT Multiple Monitor Support on Solaris?

I am writing an application in Java using SWT. On our Solaris machines, we have multiple monitor setups, but they are treated in isolation by the operating system. This means I can't open the application and drag it to another monitor. The right-click context menu doesn't even allow me to change the monitor the application is displayed on. What I want to do is provide a way for the user to "send" all or part of my SWT shell to another monitor. How can I do this? Additional Information A call to Display.getMonitors() returns Monitor[] but the length is 1 (when it should be 2 or 3 or ... N monitors.)
