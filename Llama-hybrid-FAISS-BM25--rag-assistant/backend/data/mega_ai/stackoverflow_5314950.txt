I think you can use -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event to start a NSTimer which will count time for you and -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event to stop that timer and will get for how much time user tapped a view and then you can do an event according to that time for long press. Hope, it'll help you.
