logistic regression involves the maximum likelihood method. One looks at the results or the observations of a random experiment and considers which of several possible causes could have led to it most probably ("maximum likelihood"). The regression coefficients are interpreted differently than in linear regression. there is no linear relationship. But depending on the sign, if it is positive, then an increase in the independent variable in question is produced (maximum likelihood). Conversely, there is a decrease. This is exactly the same thing that happens in the binomial distribution.
