Samples from the posterior - Markov Chain Monte Carlo

I am self-studying MCMC in the context of graphical models. I understand that if we run MCMC on a graphical model (e.g. a belief net) that the model will hopefully converge to a stationary distribution for all the relevant paramters in my model (after burn-in). My question is, if I want to have 100 unbiased samples from the posterior distribution, then do I 1) need to run 100 seperate MCMC chains, initaliazed at different random values, and take one sample from the parameter distributions upon convergence, or 2) I only have to run one MCMC chain, and can take 100 samples from the stationary distribution upon convergence of that chain?
