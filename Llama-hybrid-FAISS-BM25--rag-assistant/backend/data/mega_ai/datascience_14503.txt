Is it possible using tensorflow to create a neural network that maps a certain input to a certain output?

I am currently playing with tensorflow, but can't seem to get a hold whether it usefull for my problem? I need to create a neural network, that is capable of mapping input to output. The way things are progression now, i haven't a single example in which this has been done, all types of problem tensorflow seem to solve are classification task, and not this kind of mapping problem... Is tensorflow able to do so?, do I have to use a different neural network framework to do so?, And if it is available could somebody show some code (not the MNIST example) My task: I am currently trying to make an neural network that takes in samples of audio files, and generates MFCC features from the samples. The MFCC features can be calculated manually, which I have done, so I know what the I output i seek is. MFCC feature is a feature vector is different real values numbers. I cannot be classified as class A or Class B, or doing so would greatly reduce the accuracy of the output, as you are fitting the output to predetermined "bins"...
