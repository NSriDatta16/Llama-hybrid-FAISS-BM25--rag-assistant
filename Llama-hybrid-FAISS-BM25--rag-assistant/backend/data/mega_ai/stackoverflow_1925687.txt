Problem with internal anchors and links

I've set up a brochure ware kind of site - with links to different sections in the page. http://www.leoniepalmer.com/ When clicking a menu item in the top right corner, everything works great! Now I have a second page at http://www.leoniepalmer.com/our-gourmet-tours/ And I want the menu to then go back home to the relevant anchor, that is, clicking About will go to http://www.leoniepalmer.com/#about Unfortunately (in FF 3.5.6 at least), it seems to append it to the URL and it becomes quite ugly, as well as not going to where it should! Could it be this rule in my .htaccess, that appends a trailing slash to pages without one? # Add trailing slash if missing rewriteRule ^(([a-z0-9\-]+/)*[a-z0-9\-]+)$ $1/ [NC,R=301,L] How could I modify it to work, or is there something else at play here? UPDATE I don't think the answer is helpful at all. You can link to an Id using the #anchor fragment.
