rts a pyramid. Computer: OK. Person: Put the littlest pyramid on top of it. Computer: OK. Person: Does the shortest thing the tallest pyramid's support supports support anything green? Computer: YES, THE GREEN PYRAMID. Person: What color is it? Computer: BY "IT", I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SHORTEST THING THE TALLEST PYRAMID'S SUPPORT SUPPORTS. Computer: RED Person: How many things are on top of green cubes? Computer: I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY "ON TOP OF" IN THE PHRASE "ON TOP OF GREEN CUBES" . DO YOU MEAN: 1 - DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE 2 - ANWHERE ON TOP OF ? Person: 2 Computer: THREE OF THEM. Person: Had you touched any pyramid before you put the green one on the little cube? Computer: YES, THE GREEN ONE. Person: When did you pick it up? Computer: WHILE I WAS STACKING UP THE RED CUBE, A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE. Person: Why? Computer: TO GET RID OF IT. Person: Why did you do that? Computer: TO CLEAN OFF THE RED CUBE. Person: Why did you clear off that cube? Computer: TO PUT IT ON A LARGE GREEN CUBE. Person: Why did you do that? Computer: TO STACK UP THE RED CUBE , A LARGE RED BLOCK AND A LARGE GREEN CUBE. Person: Why did you do that? Computer: BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO. Person: How did you do it? Computer: BY PUTTING A LARGE RED BLOCK ON THE TABLE ; THEN LETTING GO OF IT ; THEN PUTTING A LARGE GREEN CUBE ON IT ; THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE ; THEN PUTTING THE RED CUBE ON THAT CUBE; THEN LETTING GO OF THAT CUBE. Person: How many objects did you touch while you were doing it? Computer: FOUR OF THEM. Person: What did the red cube support before you started to clean it off? Computer: THE GREEN PYRAMID. Person: There were five blocks to the left of the box then. Computer: NO, ONLY FOUR OF THEM: THE RED CUBE, TWO LARGE GREEN CUBES AND A LARGE RED BLOCK. Person: Put the blue pyramid on the block in the box. Computer: OK. Person: Is there anything which is bigger than every pyramid but is not as wide as the thing that supports it? Computer: YES, THE BLUE BLOCK. Person: Does a steeple Computer (interrupting): SORRY, I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STEEPLE". Person: A "steeple" is a stack which contains two green cubes and a pyramid. Computer: I UNDERSTAND. Person: Are there any steeples now? Computer: NO. Person: Build one. Computer: OK. Person: Call the biggest block "superblock". Computer: OK. Person: Have you picked superblock up since we began? Computer: YES. Person: Why did you drop it? Computer: BY "IT", I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SUPERBLOCK. I CAN'T EXPLAIN A NON-EXISTENT EVENT. Person: Is there anything to the right of the red pyramid? Computer: YES, FOUR THINGS: THE BOX, THE RED CUBE, THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLOCK NAMED SUPERBLOCK Person: Thank you. Computer: YOU'RE WELCOME! Consequences SHRDLU was considered a tremendously successful demonstration of artificial intelligence (AI). This led other AI researchers to excessive optimism which was soon lost when later systems attempted to deal with situations with a more realistic level of ambiguity and complexity. Subsequent efforts of the SHRDLU type, such as Cyc, have tended to focus on providing the program with considerably more information from which it can draw conclusions. In a 1991 interview, Winograd said about SHRDLU: [...] the famous dialogue with SHRDLU where you could pick up a block, and so on, I very carefully worked through, line by line. If you sat down in front of it, and asked it a question that wasn't in the dialogue, there was some probability it would answer it. I mean, if it was reasonably close to one of the questions that was there in form and in content, it would probably get it. But there was no attempt to get it to the point where you could actually hand it to somebody and they could use it to move blocks around. And there was no pressure for that whatsoever. Pressure was for something you could demo. Take a recent example, Negroponte's Media Lab, where instead of "perish or publish" it's "demo or die." I think that's a problem. I think AI suffered from tha
