Single Multi-User Checkout in Subversion - Possible?

In our organization, we have the following problem. We want to have our web tree revision-controlled, but many of us want to be able to alter (and check in) any file of that tree. We would also like there to be only a single check-out for all this because the tree is rather huge. For parts of that tree, we are currently using RCS, which allows for the behavior described above, but has several other drawbacks, of course. Does anyone know how to do such a thing (maybe with some kind of workaround) with Subversion on a Unix server?
