Error when using Runtime.getRuntime().exec method to invoke an exe, if exe path has non-english chars

I am using Runtime.getRuntime.exec() Method to invoke an exe. The problem what I face with this method is that when I pass some exe path (c:\JPN_char_folder\mypath\myexe.exe) with other language chars (ex.Japanese) "it's saying "System cannot find the file specified". Would you please suggest some ideas to get around this? I even tried passing that exe path after converting to UTF-8 as well, but still I could not solve this. -Robert.
