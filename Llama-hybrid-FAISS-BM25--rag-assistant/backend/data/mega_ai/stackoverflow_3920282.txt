Event to Command in a style

Can someone tell me how to code an event to command in a style for a tabitem? I have no problems using it elsewhere but I can not figure it out for a style. I am trying to do this in Xaml for WPF using MVVM-Light toolkit. Here is an example of what I am trying to do: I am using an infragistics TabControl but it shouldnt be much different than a regular tab control.
