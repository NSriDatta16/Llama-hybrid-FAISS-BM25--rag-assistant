There are different kinds of non-seasonal randomness, with different optimal forecasts. A key part of forecasting is finding out which kind we are dealing with and choosing the corresponding optimal forecast. Here are two examples of non-seasonal randomness. White noise is essentially unstructured noise, where each data point is identically distributed. The (provably) best forecast is the overall mean of the historical observations. In a random walk , it's the increments over the previous realization that are iid. If your previous observation is 5, then the next one will be nearer to 5 than to 0. In this case the (provably) best forecast is the last observation. And of course, there are many other kinds of non-seasonal randomness, or of drivers. Trends, moving averages, autoregression, integration, causal drivers and so forth. R code: set.seed(1) white_noise
