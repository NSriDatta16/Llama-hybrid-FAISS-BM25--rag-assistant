Sometimes, the changes of layers are necessary based on the data and what the developer wants. The GlobalAveragePooling2D and MaxPooling2D are the layer for pooling the result of feature extraction/convolution to make the features ready to be learned by the classification layers (Dense layers and softmax layer). However, those two pooling functions have different method of pooling and obviously different math process. You may also try with the current model without changing it as well. It may also result different data dimensions therefore one need to adjust the number of nodes in the Dense layer to match the output from previous layer.
