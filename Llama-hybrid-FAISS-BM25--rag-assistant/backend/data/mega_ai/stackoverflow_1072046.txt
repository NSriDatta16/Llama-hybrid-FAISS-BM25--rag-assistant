How important are the messages? If they are truely just a view once "hey here's what's new", does it matter if you know if everyone sees them? (But maybe you want to measure effectiveness?) Why not just display for a week or month or whatever timeframe it is your average user logs in on. Any key site updates can be put on a separate change log page for those really interested. If there are special offers, then its just time limited and why wouldn't users want to be reminded of it each time they log in? Or you could have part of the home page (or a link) dedicated to what's new on the site and record in a cookie if the user has clicked it since it has last been updated, and if not, then highlight it for that user. Sorry for the rambley response.
