eliminating outliers in MARS regression

I using the regression method called MARS , in R is it called earth and is located in the package earth , in order to find the best regression model for my datat. I know that this method is suitable for large data-sets, can handle NA and also decides which variables will be used and which not into the regression. What I'm doing After the regression is estimated, I detect the outliers using boxplot and then I eliminate from the data the observations which are extreme values and compute the model again. I do this until maximum of grsq and rsq are found. CODE model boxplot$stats[4]) == T), which((residuals_abs 0) { data max_grsq && temp_rsq >= max_rsq) || (temp_grsq >= max_grsq && temp_rsq > max_rsq)) { model QUESTION I'm not a statistician so I don't know any better way for removing the outliers. is my approach correct? should I use another approach? I know that there are bad outliers and good outliers (leverage points), how can I remove only the bad outliers? I'm using the semi-log form of the regression. because of the use of dummy variables I can't use the log-log form . Is there any other approach for data transformation? or should I standardize the data? x Does anyone has some hints?
