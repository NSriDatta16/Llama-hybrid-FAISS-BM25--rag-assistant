Gaussian mixture distribution confusion

Have some confusion on Gaussian mixture distribution model (reference is from the book of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning ). My confusion is how below formula works? $\sum_kz_k=1$ My thought is, $z_1$ could be $0$ or $1$, $z_2$ could be $0$ or $1$, ... $z_K$ could be $0$ or $1$, how could sum of them (them I mean $z_1$, $z_2$, ..., $z_K$) to be 1?
