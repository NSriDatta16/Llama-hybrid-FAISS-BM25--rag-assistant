The example gives this information Important : The Set-Deployment cmdlet assumes that the compute service and storage service names are the same. If this is not the case, specify an additional parameter -StorageServicename , replacing the placeholder with the name of the storage service name. My storage service name does have the same name as the compute service, but adding that param made it work, ie. Get-HostedService -serviceName xxxxmytodo99 -subscriptionId cxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx -certificate (get-item cert:\CurrentUser\MY\xxxxxxxxxxxx) | Get-Deployment staging | Set-Deployment -package MyTodo.cspkg -configuration ServiceConfiguration.cscfg -storageServiceName xxxxmytodo99 -label "v2.2" | Get-OperationStatus -WaitToComplete
