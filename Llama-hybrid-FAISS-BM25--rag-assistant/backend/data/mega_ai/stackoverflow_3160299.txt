You could try CouchDB or MongoDB as far as document-oriented database. It really depends though what is being stored. A key-value store such as redis might also work. Personally, I've used a lot of CouchDB and redis so far. CouchDB powers our storage backend (citation-related data) and redis is our session store. Care to elaborate how people can help you further?
