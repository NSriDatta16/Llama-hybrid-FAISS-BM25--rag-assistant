A lot of other people have suggested shared pointers. I don't see a reason not to use a shared pointer instead of a queue here. You permit only one frame, after all. They support locking elegantly, and with just a bit of bodging can be made threadsafe and also simple. You don't really have an opportunity for circular references to occur that I can see, so you should be basically okay this way. Alternatively, this sounds like a job for a nice circular buffer. That way you could just avoid the naked char array all together. Boost implements one elegantly, and with just a bit of primitive synchro you should be able to make it suitable for your purposes. Of particular note is that this would make expanding your application to handle online data processing relatively simple as well. If you're interested, I'll hack up some example code.
