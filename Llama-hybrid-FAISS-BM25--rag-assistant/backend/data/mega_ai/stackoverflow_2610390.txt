From David Morgan-Mar 's Esoteric Algorithms page: Intelligent Design Sort Introduction Intelligent design sort is a sorting algorithm based on the theory of intelligent design. Algorithm Description The probability of the original input list being in the exact order it's in is 1/(n!). There is such a small likelihood of this that it's clearly absurd to say that this happened by chance, so it must have been consciously put in that order by an intelligent Sorter. Therefore it's safe to assume that it's already optimally Sorted in some way that transcends our na√Øve mortal understanding of "ascending order". Any attempt to change that order to conform to our own preconceptions would actually make it less sorted. Analysis This algorithm is constant in time, and sorts the list in-place, requiring no additional memory at all. In fact, it doesn't even require any of that suspicious technological computer stuff. Praise the Sorter! Feedback Gary Rogers writes: Making the sort constant in time denies the power of The Sorter. The Sorter exists outside of time, thus the sort is timeless. To require time to validate the sort diminishes the role of the Sorter. Thus... this particular sort is flawed, and can not be attributed to 'The Sorter'. Heresy!
