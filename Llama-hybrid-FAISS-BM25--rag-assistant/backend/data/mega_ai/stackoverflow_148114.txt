Here is how I did it using Python instead of Perl, but that should not matter: Separated out HTML and code into distinct files. I used a template engine for that. Created functions from the code which rendered a template with a set of parameters. Organized the functions (which I termed views , inspired by Django) in a sensible way. (Admin views, User views, etc.) The views all follow the same calling convention ! Refactored out the database and request stuff so that the views would only contain view specific code (read: Handling GET, POST requests, etc. but nothing low-level!). Relied heavily on existing libraries for that. I am here at the moment. :-) The next obvious step is of course: Write a dispatcher which maps URLs to your views . This will also lead to nicer URLs and nicer 404- and error handling of course.
