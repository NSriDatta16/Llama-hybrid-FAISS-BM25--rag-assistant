Calculating average treatment effect for propensity score matching with MatchIt and Zelig packages in R

Using the lalonde dataset provided with the MatchIt package, I'm running the following R commands (from the subclassification example code on the author's website: http://r.iq.harvard.edu/docs/matchit/2.4-20/Examples2.html ) to find the average treatment effect (ATE) for the re78 income variable via subclassification propensity score matching: library(MatchIt) library(Zelig) m.out2 The code runs without error, however I don't understand the output from summary(s.out3) and the documentation is unhelpful. Are the four mean ev values equal to the expected ATEs for each of the four subclasses? Where is the ATE averaged over all four subclasses?
