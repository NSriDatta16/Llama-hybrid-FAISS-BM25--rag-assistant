I would say probabily & statistics is the most important prerequisite. Especially Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) are very important both in machine learning and natural language processing (of course these subjects may be part of the course if it is introductory). Then, I would say basic CS knowledge is also helpful, for example Algorithms , Formal Languages and basic Complexity theory.
