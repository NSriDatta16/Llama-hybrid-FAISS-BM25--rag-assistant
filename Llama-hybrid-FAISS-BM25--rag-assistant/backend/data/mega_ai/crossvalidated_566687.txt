Both are commonly used and accepted. As you can see, both books have a common writer. The first one predicts all the points and estimates the loss at the end. The second one averages among the folds. For some metrics, and for equal fold sizes, both give the same value (e.g. MSE); and they are close if fold sizes are approximately equal. Authors of Introduction to Statistical Learning mentions the approximate fold sizes as well. The second one is useful while describing a standard deviation around your test score, can be seen in many publications for a cheaper alternative to bootstrapping or repeat experiments.
