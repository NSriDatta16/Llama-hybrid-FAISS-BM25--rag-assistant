p-value of an Average Correlation Coeficient

I have several Pearson correlation coefficients with their corresponding p-values. But I need an Average Correlation Coefficient. To calculate it, I've used the Fisher z transformation mentioned here and here . But, probably due to my lack of knowledge, I didn't find a way to compute a p-value for this average correlation coefficient. Can you help me with this?
