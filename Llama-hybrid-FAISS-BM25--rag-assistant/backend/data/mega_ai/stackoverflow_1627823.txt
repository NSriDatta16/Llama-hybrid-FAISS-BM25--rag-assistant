elegant ie6 hover css solution

I want a solution for tag:hover that is not working on ie6. My guess is it has to be done with javascript. I found this patch: csshover3.htc ( http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/csshover.html ), I checked it's demo! and i didn't work on my ie6 browser! There has to be an elegant way to solve this very BIG and basic problem, may be a jquery plugin. Any lead is appriciated
