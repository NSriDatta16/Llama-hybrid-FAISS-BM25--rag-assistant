Developing a web application using php, please give some suggestions

I am developing a web application which is using php. It will use the mySQL database for storage. But The application may upgrade in future, so I would like to know is there any framework for me to reduce the pain of upgrading database structure. I know that there is a framework called cakePHP. And the application will deploy in more servers in the future, clusters, is there any special need before the application start writing. Thank you very much.
