What algorithms are available for logistic regression?

I am trying to implement a logistic regression function in c++, and not sure what algorithm to use. So far I have heard of these: Newton-Raphson IRLS Gradient descent Are there other algorithms available? What are their pros and cons? Is there an algorithm generally recognized as superior to the others?
