Here's great podcast with Paul Randal (he wrote parts of DBCC!) where they talk about the new filestream feature in sql server 2008 for handling blobs, but they also go into the sizes of files that do and don't work well as blobs as part of the talk. I think it would help you. http://www.runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=74 I just found out that the 25-page FILESTREAM whitepaper Paul wrote has has been published on MSDN. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc949109.aspx . Based on the research cited later in this white paper, BLOBs smaller than 256 kilobytes (KB) (such as widget icons) are better stored inside a database, and BLOBs larger than 1 megabyte (MB) are best stored outside the database. For those sized between 256 KB and 1 MB, the more efficient storage solution depends on the read vs. write ratio of the data, and the rate of “overwrite”. Storing BLOB data solely within the database (e.g., using the varbinary(max) data type) is limited to 2 gigabytes (GB) per BLOB.
