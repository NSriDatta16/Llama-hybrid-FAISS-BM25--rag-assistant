Moving ViewState out of the page?

We are trying to lighten our page load as much as possible. Since ViewState can sometimes swell up to 100k of the page, I'd love to completely eliminate it. I'd love to hear some techniques other people have used to move ViewState to a custom provider. That said, a few caveats: We serve on average 2 Million unique visitors per hour. Because of this, Database reads have been a serious issue in performance, so I don't want to store ViewState in the database. We also are behind a load balancer, so any solution has to work with the user bouncing from machine to machine per postback. Ideas?
