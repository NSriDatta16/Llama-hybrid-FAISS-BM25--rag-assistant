This sounds an awful lot like peak calling in *seq (ChIP-seq, clip-seq, etc) experiments. A peak is called where either the number of reads exceeds a pre-determined threshold value or where there is a minimum enrichment compared to background signal, often in a sliding window across the genome. Some tools apply both methods. from peak calling guide for chip-seq . There are lots of different models which can be applied (after suitable bias correction) Models used for the statistical assessment of enriched regions (peaks) range from Poisson (CSAR [85]), local Poisson (MACS), negative binomial (CisGenome [56]) to zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINBA [86]), or even extend to more sophisticated machine learning modeling techniques such as Hidden Markov Model (HPeak [87] and BayesPeak [88]). From Practical guidelines for the comprehensive analysis of ChIP-seq The discussion of the modeling assumptions and comparisons to other models present in each of these papers is probably far more informative than I could be.
