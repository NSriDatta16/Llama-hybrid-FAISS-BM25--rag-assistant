a NSDictionary is not ordened, so it doens't matter in what order you construct a NSDIctionary. a NSArray is ordened. If you want to have the NSDictionary ordened in memory, you should somehow make a NSArray of key value pairs. You can also return two NSArrays with corresponding indeces. If you only want to iterate over the elements way, you can iterate over a sorted array of keys (this is what koregan suggests).
