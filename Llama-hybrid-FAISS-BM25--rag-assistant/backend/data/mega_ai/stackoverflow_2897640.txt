It depends on your situation. If you've got lots and lots of CSS code, you might want to split your code into multiple files to organize them a little. If you've not got that much of code, you could do with a single CSS file. I do prefer using a CSS compressor sometimes. Again it all depends on the circumstances.If you've got a small CSS file, compressing would not usually help much. When you compress, please do keep an uncompressed file for your development. I use the YUI Compressor. Its really easy to use.
