Any business examples of using Markov chains?

What business cases are there for using Markov chains? I've seen the sort of play area of a markov chain applied to someone's blog to write a fake post. I'd like some practical examples though? E.g. useful in business or prediction of stock market, or the like... Edit : Thanks to all who gave examples, I upvoted each one as they were all useful. Edit2 : I selected the answer with the most detail as the accepted answer. All answers I upvoted.
