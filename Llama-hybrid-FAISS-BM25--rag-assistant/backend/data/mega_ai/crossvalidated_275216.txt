Logistic regression with zero event in one category

I have a dataset with more 15 independent variables trying explain a binary outcome. The results seemed dubious and the confidence interval profiling failed by providing lower bounds of the confint larger than the upper bounds-- I found the variable creating this mess which is a four category variable. Furthermore, I understand that it is stupid to use the var==2 as a reference category since there are no "Yes" outcomes for that value, hence giving trouble for all the other values. I could relevel and just have problems with that level giving a huge SE, or maybe I should collapse level two and three. However, I would prefer not to - given the actual interpretation of the variable. Any ideas how I can sneak around this? with(w,table(outcome,var) 2 3 4 5 Sum No 35 226 281 463 0 1005 Yes 0 18 36 268 0 322 0 0 0 0 0 0 Sum 35 244 317 731 0 1327 > glm(outcome~var,family=binomial,data=w)->l > summary(l) Call: glm(formula = outcome ~ var, family = binomial, data = w) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.95571 -0.95571 -0.49101 -0.00036 2.28333 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
