"WinForms ignore the control height update while resizing" You mean UserControl ? I Highly doubt it Make sure that your events go through all the right pipes/controls and perform invalidation when needed for the display (in the userContol or/and the embedding form). That normally shoudl do. If not, Use Docking as Oliver suggested.
