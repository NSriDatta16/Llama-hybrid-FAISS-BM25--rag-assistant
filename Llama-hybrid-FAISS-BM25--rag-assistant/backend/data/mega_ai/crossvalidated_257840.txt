I will try to answer this question using an example. Suppose you have to points which are (1,1) and (2,2). These points lie on a straight line $y=x$. Another representation of these two points can be $\sqrt(2)$ and $\sqrt(8)$, which are distances of these two points from origin, or we can say projections of these two points on the vector $\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}(1,1)$. Which means that these two points represent a vector. Actually, any two points represent just a vector. To make the idea of PCA more intuitive, suppose instead of two points we have more points such as $(1,1); (2,2); (3,3),....,(10,10)$. All these ten points represent the same unit vector. Similarly, suppose if we have points such as $(1,1,2), (2,2,2),.....,(10,10,2)$. Our data is three dimensional now; however, the number in third dimension is always equal to 2. Again, the data varies in the direction of unit vector,$\frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}(1,1)$, mentioned above. So to answer your question, high dimensional data can not be represented by a lower dimensional space. Only the variation in high dimensional data can be represented by lower dimensional data, as in the example given. The link provided by Frank Drost above is also useful. Also, this is a helpful link to understand PCA: http://mengnote.blogspot.com/2013/05/an-intuitive-explanation-of-pca.html
