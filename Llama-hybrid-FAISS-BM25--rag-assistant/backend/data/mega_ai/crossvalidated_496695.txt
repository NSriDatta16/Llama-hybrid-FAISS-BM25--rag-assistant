It doesn't matter that there are more treated than control units. There are likely no papers about this because it is not theoretically relevant. The only thing it prevents you from doing is matching without replacement, and that's not a theoretical issue; that's just a matter of the definition of the method. It's just one of many ways to compute an average treatment effect (and it only targets the average treatment effect on the treated [ATT], which may not be your estimand of choice). There are several other methods you can use, like matching with replacement, IPW, propensity score subclassification, full matching, g-computation, etc. You need to be clear about your estimand (i.e., ATT vs. ATE vs. something else) and choose a method that is appropriate for that estimand and that is compatible with your data. Nearest neighbor matching without replacement is not appropriate for the ATE and is not compatible with your data, but all ATE-compatible methods will be compatible with the relative proportion of treated and control units in your dataset, and most ATT-compatible methods (other than matching without replacement) will be, too.
