What comes first here? Understanding the data or being committed to using a particular technique? Why precisely do you think the PCA is going to help? Perhaps it is beyond your control, or too late any way, but the questionnaire sounds badly designed. If a rating of "perceived usefulness" is needed, why not ask something like "on a scale of 1 to 5, please rate how useful this thing is"? (Similar comments for other scales.) More positively, I would pool the data for two countries, and then see how the people from each country compare on the scales defined by the PCs. The different sample sizes don't seem especially worrying here. do a PCA for Netherlands, then see (as above). do a PCA for Bulgaria, then see (as above). see which of #1 to #3 was most illuminating. I wouldn't try anything more complicated. What you have in mind sounds like an analysis where you would have a hard time disentangling side-effects of what you did from something revealing the structure of the data. I am calling what you did PCA, on the philosophy of calling a spade a spade (you may need a different idiom in your first language).
