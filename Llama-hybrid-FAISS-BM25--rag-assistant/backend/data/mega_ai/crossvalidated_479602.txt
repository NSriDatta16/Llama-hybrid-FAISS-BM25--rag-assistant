how to estimate means and SD from clustered means in a study

for conduction of a meta-analysis I am collecting data from various studies. Unfortunately, not every author provides means for all groups, instead, means are clustered. Say, I have independent variable 1 and 2 systematically modified in order to examine the effect on a dependent variable. To test the difference between the various levels of iV1, dV is averaged over iV2, and vice versa. My question is: Is there a way to statistically estimate the single values for each level from the clustered values? I attached a visualization that tries to explain my question. Thanks in advance!
