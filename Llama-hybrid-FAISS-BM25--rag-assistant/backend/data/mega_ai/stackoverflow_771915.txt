You shouldn't center only on worst case and only on time complexity. It's more about average than worst, and it's about time and space. Quicksort: has average time complexity of Θ( n log n ); can be implemented with space complexity of Θ(log n ); Also have in account that big O notation doesn't take in account any constants, but in practice it does make difference if the algorithm is few times faster. Θ( n log n ) means, that algorithm executes in K n log( n ), where K is constant. Quicksort is the comparison-sort algorithm with the lowest K .
