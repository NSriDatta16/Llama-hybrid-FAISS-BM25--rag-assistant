The cluster argument in survreg() doesn't model random/frailty effects. It just adjusts the coefficient variance-covariance matrix to provide robust error estimates that take within-individual correlations into account. The point estimates are thus the same as without that argument, as you found. That's not what you evidently want. The survival package can model gamma frailties in coxph() models, but not in survreg() models. As the main survival vignette says in Section 5.5.3: The penalty functions in survreg currently use the same code as those for coxph . This works well in the case of ridge and pspline, but frailty terms are more problematic in that the code to automatically choose the tuning parameter for the random effect no longer solves an MLE equation. The current code will not lead to the correct choice of penalty. The coxme package handles Gaussian random effects in Cox models. I'm not convinced that you need a parametric model to accomplish what you need, as it's possible to get survival estimates from Cox models and frailties are pretty simple to interpret in the context of proportional hazards. If you do need parametric modeling, the survival task view suggests possibilities in R. The frailtypack package provides extensive tools for this type of modeling, and the MCMCglmm package builds corresponding Bayesian models. With your dist="gaussian" , what you are trying to do also goes under the name of tobit regression . Try searching under that name, too. This UCLA web page illustrates mixed tobit models in SAS.
