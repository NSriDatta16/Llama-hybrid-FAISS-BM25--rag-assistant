Adorners for C# Windows Forms

I have a canvas (Panel Control) in my WinForms app where users can drag things like textbox's, labels etc around. But I want to make it easier for them to more precisely align the objects. I've read into it and Adorners seem to be the way to go? But, apparently it's only for WPF. WPF is not an option for me, unfortunately. What I'm trying to accomplish is to have lines pop up every time the user drags an object around in the canvas... Just how they work in the Windows Forms Designer View. I'd appreciate any help at all. Thank you.
