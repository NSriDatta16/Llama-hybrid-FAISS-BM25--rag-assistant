You can check out my answer here where I give a worked example with a dataset in R in a related way. The short answer to your query, like Peter already mentioned, is that you shouldn't delete data points like these. Here are some examples of how linear relationships can be disrupted by "outliers". None of my ideas or terms used below are new, just ways I explain them: You observe the average ages and batting averages of baseball players in the MLB. Generally speaking, age is negatively correlated with batting average in this data. But then you then find that one player is quite old and yet has an outstanding batting average. These types of outliers I call "informative outsiders", in that they may provide a lot of information for superstar athletes or those who have peculiar characteristics not already observed by the rest of your dataset. They become particularly useful when you build larger and more varied data where you may find more of these people in the future. Another dataset may involve about 50 recordings of volcanic eruptions that generally show a linear pattern. But you notice a few eruptions show an upward curvilinear trend. This is something I would consider a hidden trend. Here volcanic eruptions may actually exhibit an exponential relationship rather than a straight linear relationship, in which your linear regression as a whole may actually be more poorly specified than you think. Treating them like outliers would not be advisable. You have a dataset containing several productivity patterns for employees of a Fortune 500 company. You notice somebody has 5,000,000 logged hours for the week while most only have around 40. This is data that should raise a lot more red flags, as it is commonly a data entry error and not possible within the bounds of your data (when can anybody work 5,000,000 logged hours in a week?). However, where do you draw the line? If we scaled that number down by a lot (lets say 100), it is certainly still much larger than others, but is it an unrealistic value? You may gather that these examples show that being a subject matter expert in your domain plays a special role in making decisions based on "outliers." Most of this data is better left in and shaping an accurate model to it. In your case, the data does not look bizarre enough to warrant concern on that end, so I would leave it in as Peter already advised.
