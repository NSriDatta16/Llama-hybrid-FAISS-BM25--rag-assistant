Let $R$ be a rotation (i.e. an orthogonal matrix: $R^T=R^{-1}$). $A=U\Sigma V^*$ by SVD, and correspondingly $A^TA=V\Sigma^2 V^*$. On the other hand if $B:=RA$, then: $$B^TB=A^TR^TRA=A^TA=V\Sigma^2V^*.$$ So PCA is "invariant" under rotations applied to $A$ from the left. Specifically, this means that the covariance matrix is invariant. However the actual projections will differ. Specifically, $A=U\Sigma V^*$, whereas $B=RA=RU\Sigma V^*$, giving $B=W\Sigma V^*$, where $W:=R^*U$.
