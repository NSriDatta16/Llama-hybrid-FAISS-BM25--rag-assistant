cally and are thus of particular interest for real-world applications. The three particular cases that most often occur when gathering data are: Unlabeled samples are available with supposed class-memberships; Imbalance of the training set due to a high proportion of samples of a class; Quality of the data may vary from a sample to another. Prior knowledge of these can enhance the quality of the recognition if included in the learning. Moreover, not taking into account the poor quality of some data or a large imbalance between the classes can mislead the decision of a classifier. Notes References E. Krupka and N.
