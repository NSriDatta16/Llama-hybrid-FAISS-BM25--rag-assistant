Can we visualise regression results through diagram?

I read a journal article, in which the authors made a diagram based on regression results (beta weights). Pretty much looks like a path analysis: I'm very sure that path analysis/SEM was not employed as can be read from their paper: Both logistic regression and multiple regression analyses were used. Logistic regression was used for the prediction of condom use because the dependent variable was dichotomous. Prediction of the two intention variables was accomplished using multiple regression. This has the advantage over logistic regression of providing estimates of the effect size. Is that OK? I'm not trying to judge the quality of the paper. On the contrary, if that practice is acceptable, I would like to use it in my paper. I wanted to do path analysis, but I'm afraid my sample size (66 subjects) is too small for that analysis, so I used regression instead.
