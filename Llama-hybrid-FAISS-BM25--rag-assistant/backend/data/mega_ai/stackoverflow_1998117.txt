Can we identify individual sectors of a circle component uniquely in flex?

I have a custom circle component in my application, which is divided into 3 sectors as of now.Can we uniquely identify each segments of this circle? I want to drag and drop text or images from another container to this circle component. But I want to place different images in the different sectors. Is it possible to distinguish the individual sectors of the circle component? Here is my code: Circle component: package components { import mx.core.UIComponent; public class MyCircle extends UIComponent { public var x1:int; public var y1:int; public var radius:int; override protected function updateDisplayList(unscaledWidth:Number, unscaledHeight:Number):void { graphics.lineStyle(1, 0x000000); graphics.drawCircle(x1, y1, radius); } } } Line component: package components { import mx.core.UIComponent; public class MyLine extends UIComponent { public var x1:int; public var y1:int; override protected function updateDisplayList(unscaledWidth:Number, unscaledHeight:Number):void { graphics.lineStyle(1, 0x000000); graphics.moveTo(100,0); graphics.lineTo(x1, y1); graphics.moveTo(250,0); graphics.lineTo(185,120); } } } Actually I want the circle to be divided into 6 sectors, but for now just divided it into 3 sectors. But is it possible to uniqulely identify the individual sectors of the circle so that I can drag different images or texts into those particular sectors?
