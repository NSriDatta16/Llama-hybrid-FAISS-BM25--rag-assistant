In case of Multiple Regression,i.e. Regression with more than one Predictors, Diagnostics, Graphs play a vital role in selecting the significant predictor in the final regression model. Assuming Predictors are on a continuous scale, Go for Matrix Plot,Main Effects Plot and Interaction Plot to check for interactions between any predictors. When VIF is between 1 and 5, one can proceed with caution. One can select all the 3 predictors and check for the significance of each of the predictor. Check for DFFITS (value > abs(2*(number of parameters(p)/sample size(n))^(0.5))) Check for DFBETAS (value > abs((number of parameters(p)/sample size(n))^(0.5)) Check for Cooks distance (value >1) Check for Leverages (value >2p/n) Focus should be on those observations which exceed the value of the above diagnostics. In the ANOVA model, check for Rsq(adj) and Rsq(pred) close to each other. Other than Step wise Regression or Forward Inclusion or Back ward Elimination method, one can go for Best Subsets Regression. Check for the Mallows Cp statistic (its value should be close to the given number of parameters). Finally, using Descriptive statistics check for each of the predictor, if (Max/Min)>3, then it requires some transformation. What transformation is required that should be decided after checking the residual plots. And the F-value of the regression in the model should be equal to 4 times of the corresponding F-tabulated value. Then that model can be considered as an appropriate model for the situation.
