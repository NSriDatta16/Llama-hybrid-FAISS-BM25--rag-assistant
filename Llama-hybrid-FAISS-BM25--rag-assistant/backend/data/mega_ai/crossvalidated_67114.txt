Brier versus AIC

There are four models I'm looking at and trying to evaluate which will give me the best predictions going forward. So I loop through each model and look at the error rate, the Brier Error and the AIC. In some cases the AIC and Brier Error are not consistent (results for model 3 and 4 below). If they give contrasting indications, which one should be paid attention to? Why? Or am I looking at this the wrong way? For those interested, my R code and results are below: line line[i], 1, ifelse(data$result 0.5 & data$target==0) | (data$prediction RESULTS [1] "0.381418853255588 error rates" [1] "1633.50190616553 AIC" [1] "0.232600213678421 BRIER" [1] "0.38491739552964 error rates" [1] "1641.54699258567 AIC" [1] "0.234847243715002 BRIER" [1] "0.314091350826045 error rates" [1] "1451.51883987259 AIC" [1] "0.200957523053587 BRIER" [1] "0.324509232264334 error rates" [1] "1467.88024134523 AIC" [1] "0.205168360087164 BRIER"
