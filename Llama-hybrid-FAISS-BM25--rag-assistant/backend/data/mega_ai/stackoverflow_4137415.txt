May I suggest looking into Windows Azure table storage? It is quiet different from pure relational play of SQL Server, is the "next big thing" from Microsoft and is in general a somewhat of a paradigm shift for folks used to relational databases. If you're ever going to come face to face with Azure in the future (and I suspect many .NET people will), it maybe a beneficial of an experience to have. With respect to costs, they're negligible for individual use. 10,000 transactions a month cost a penny. A gigabyte per month of storage costs 15 cents, and data transfers are 10-15cents per gigabyte. If you have only "development" projects that store their data in the cloud, I'll be damned if you pay more than $2-3/month to MS... if that :)
