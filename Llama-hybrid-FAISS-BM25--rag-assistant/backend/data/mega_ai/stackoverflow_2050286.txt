Symfony Model Callback Equivalent

I'm working on a Symfony project (my first) where I have to retrieve, from my Widget class, a set of widgets that belong to a Page . Before returning the results, though, I need to verify--against an external service--that the user is authorized to view each widget. If not, of course, I need to remove the widget from the result set. Using CakePHP or Rails, I'd use callbacks, but I haven't found anything similar for Symfony. I see events , but those seem more relevant to controllers/actions if I'm reading things correctly (which is always up for discussion). My fallback solution is to override the various retrieval methods in the WidgetPeer class, divert them through a custom method that does the authorization and modifies the result set appropriately. That feels like massive overkill, though, since I'd have to override every selection method to ensure that authorization was done without future developers having to think about it. It looks like behaviors could be useful for this (especially since it's conceivable that I might need to authorize other class instances in the future), but I can't find any decent documentation on them to make a qualified evaluation. Am I missing something? It seems like there must be a better way, but I haven't found it.
