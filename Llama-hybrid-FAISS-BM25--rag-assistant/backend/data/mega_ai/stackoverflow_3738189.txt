Where is The Abandoned Cart Report Located in Magento?

I would like to see how the abandoned shopping cart report is being generated from (what models it is using). I am hoping to add the ability to split out the customers first and last names since we want to use this to import the information from Magento into our email list management program. Does anyone know where this report is generated from or what object it uses?
