What supervised machine learning model can be used to generate a scorecard-like result?

A scorecard is typically used in Credit Application. One very common model for developing a credit scorecard is logistic regression since it has well-defined probabilities. Apart from logistic regression, is there any model that can be used in the scorecard? For example, I don't know whether Support Vector Machine can be used since it only outputs a decision boundary. More on the scorecard: Features are assigned with weightings All features are categorical The sum of weightings of all features with value True is the total score (like a checklist) There will be a cutoff point to classify good/bad (label, +1,-1) How far from the cutoff point represents probabilities.
