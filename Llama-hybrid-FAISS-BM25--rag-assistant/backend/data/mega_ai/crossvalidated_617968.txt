I'd say there are three ways to proceed: What you're doing now, with the exclusion of the data from days 1-29, is ok. It will be under-powered (i.e. less likely to detect a change if there is one) just because you are throwing some data away. I don't know how much data you have outside of this period, if you have plenty of days either side of this period then it might be easiest just to leave it out. Do a "sup"-Chow test: for each day in the period, do a Chow test, and then use the day that gives you the most significant result. Like in the start of the answer to this question , treating the result of this like a standard Chow test will give you more false positives, so you will need to correct for this. You can get an estimate of the "sup"-Chow distribution by simulating from your estimate of the model parameters with no change. Let me know if you want more information on this. This question is quite well-suited to a Bayesian approach. You could have a prior along the lines of $P(\textrm{no change}) = 0.9, P(\textrm{change on day 0}) = 0.1/30, \dots, P(\textrm{change on day 29}) = 0.1/30$ , so that we are sceptical that there is a change, and if there is a change we do not have any prior information about where it will be in the interval. Our prior probability that there are no changes must be high otherwise we will definitely accept the change. With priors on the regression parameters $\beta$ as well, you could then compute the posterior probabilities $P(\textrm{no change} \mid X), \dots P(\textrm{change on day 29} \mid X)$ (where $X$ is your data), using $$P(\textrm{change on day t} \mid X) \propto P(\textrm{change on day t}) \int p(X \mid t, \beta) p(\beta) d\beta$$ Let me know if you want more information on this.
