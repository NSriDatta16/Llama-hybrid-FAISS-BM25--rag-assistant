It could be correct to combine lags and interaction terms, there is certainly no a priori reason why this would always be wrong. My guess is that StataCorp did not implement the combination of factor variables and time series operators in the graphical user interface in order to make the interface easier to use. The logic being that combining the two would make the menu a lot more complicated and the combination of the two would be just too rare to be worth the possible confusion. As you noticed, you can easily type the commands and that way combine the factor variable and time series operators.
