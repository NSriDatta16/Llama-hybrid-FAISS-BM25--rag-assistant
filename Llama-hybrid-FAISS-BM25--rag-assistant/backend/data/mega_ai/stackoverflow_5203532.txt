JUnit files not found

I've added the JUnit jar to my classpath, and it can find and run tests alright using the command window, but when I try and compile a test I know works, it can't seem to find anything to do with JUnit. I get the following error for every test class. Tested it on another computer and it works, but not on mine. Any ideas? EstateAgentTest.java:25: incompatible types found : Test required: java.lang.annotation.Annotation @Test public void rentable1() { Thanks a lot.
