The joint variable of two factors is their interaction (and that is what you have hand-coded in D1,..., D7.) In R , if Gender and Age are the two factors, this can be done as in the code snippet below: set.seed(7*11*13) Gender Then to make the interactions variable: mydf and now you can compare with your manually constructed variable. See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2080774/generating-interaction-variables-in-r-dataframes . This way we have constructed the dummies for the interaction. Maybe more useful, we can also construct a new factor variable which codes the interaction . This is simple: mydf$D and now D can be used directly in formulas. EDIT As for questions in comments: Yes, you can use the 7 dummies. But logically, the variable is represented by the full set of 8 dummies, and sometimes we want them all. If I replace my code above ~ (Gender:Age) - 1 with ~ (Gender:Age) then (try it) you will get the 7 dummies, but you will also get the intercept, which was omitted by my code (that is what -1 does.) See What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM? for a case where you do not want to drop one dummy!
