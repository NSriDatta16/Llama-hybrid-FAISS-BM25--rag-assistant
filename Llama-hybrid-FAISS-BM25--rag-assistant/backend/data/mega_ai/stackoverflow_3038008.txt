Elegant way to distinct Path or Entry key

I have an application loading CAD data (Custom format), either from the local filesystem specifing an absolute path to a drawing or from a database. Database access is realized through a library function taking the drawings identifier as a parameter. the identifiers have a format like ABC 01234T56-T , while my paths a typical windows Paths (eg x:\Data\cadfiles\cadfile001.bin ). I would like to write a wrapper function Taking a String as an argument which can be either a path or an identifier which calls the appropriate functions to load my data. Like this: Function CadLoader(nameOrPath : String):TCadData; My Question: How can I elegantly decide wether my string is an idnetifier or a Path to a file? Use A regexp? Or just search for '\' and ':', which are not appearing in the Identifiers?
