The expression $$\mathbb E[g(x;y;\theta;h(x,z),...)]$$ always means "the expected value with respect to the joint distribution of all things having a non-degenerate distribution inside the brackets." Once you start putting subscripts in $\mathbb E$ then you specify perhaps a "narrower" joint distribution for which you want (for your reasons), to average over. For example, if you wrote $$\mathbb E_{\theta, z}[g(x;y;\theta;h(x,z),...)]$$ I would be inclined to believe that you mean only $$\mathbb E_{\theta, z} = \int_{S_z}\int_{S_\theta}f_{\theta,z}(\theta, z)g(x;y;\theta;h(x,z),...) d\theta dz$$ and not $$\int_{S_z}\int_{S_\theta}\int_{S_x}\int_{S_y}f_{\theta,z,x,y}(\theta, z,x,y)g(x;y;\theta;h(x,z),...) d\theta\, dz\,dx \,dy$$ But it could also mean something else, see on the matter also https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/72614/28746
