Is my xgboost model overfitting? (timeseries)

I am very skeptical looking at this, I haven't used the xgboost library that much before, maybe someone can help me out. The errors and the predictions on my test set are too good to be true. I mean, I normally don't see this type of performance. Is there any thing I am overlooking here? To reproduce: library(xgboost) library(caret) m RMSE Rsquared MAE 0.07043080 0.99728270 0.05669385
