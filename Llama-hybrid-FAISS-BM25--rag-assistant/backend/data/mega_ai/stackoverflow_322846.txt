Convert Fortran to C or C++

I have some numeric code that I need to convert to C or C++. I tried using f2c, but it won't work on the Fortran code. f2c complains because the code uses C style preprocessor directives (#include). The code's readme states that it is Fortran77, that works with the fort77 linker, that would expand those includes. Does anyone know how to successfully convert this code? My last resort is to write a simple preprocessor to expand those includes and then feed the code to f2c. Note: IÂ´m working in a Windows/Visual C++ environment here, so any gcc shenanigans would probably be more trouble than they are worth...
