Why not use the same distribution for the prior in Bayesian statistics?

I am wondering why introductory books on statistics use a conjugate distribution family for the prior instead of using the same pdf of the one we are trying to infer the parameters? For example, the binomial distribution has the Beta distribution as the prior. They are very similar except for a normalization constant due to the Beta distribution. Why not use another binomial distribution (which can be also uninformative) as the prior? A case where I see the conjugate prior as necessary is the case when inferring $\Sigma$ of a multivariate Normal given $\mu$ which certainly needs a distribution with symmetrical paramters (e.g. Wishart/Inverse Wishart distribution).
