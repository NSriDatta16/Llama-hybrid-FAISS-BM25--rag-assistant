Best practice for recording page hits using PHP?

I want to record number of hits to the pages and I'm thinking either plain file-based or SQLite storage. File-based option A file includes only an integer incremented with each page visit and every page has a unique file name. If I open a file using a mode, I can write but is it possible to not to close it in order to save from opening and closing the file each time? SQLite option A simple table with columns PageName and Hits. Same question again is it possible to not to close it in order to save from opening and closing the db each time?
