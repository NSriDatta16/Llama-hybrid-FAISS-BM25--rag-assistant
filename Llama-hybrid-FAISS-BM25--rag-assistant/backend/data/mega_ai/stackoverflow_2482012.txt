Is there such a thing as too many tables?

I've been searching stackoverflow for about an hour now and couldn't find any topics related, so I apologize if this is a duplicate question. My inquiry is this. Is there a point at which there are too many tables in a database? Even if the structure is well organized, thought out, and perfectly facilitates the design intent? I have a database that is quickly approaching 40 tables - about 10 main ones, and over 30 ancillary tables (junction tables, 'enumeration' tables, etc). Am I just a bad developer - or should I be trying something different? It seems like so many to me, I'm really afraid at how it will impact the performance of the project. I have done a lot of condensing where possible, grouped similar things where possible, etc. The database is built in SQL Server 2008.
