Yes, two pairwise cointegrations implies the third one. Consider the simple case of $\{x_t\}$ , $\{y_t\}$ and $\{z_t\}$ each being I(1). If $\{x_t\}$ and $\{y_t\}$ are cointegrated, they share a common stochastic trend and there is no other stochastic trend in $\{x_t\}$ or $\{y_t\}$ that they do not share. The same with $\{z_t\}$ and $\{y_t\}$ . Therefore, $\{x_t\}$ and $\{z_t\}$ share a common stochastic trend and there is no other stochastic trend in $\{x_t\}$ or $\{z_t\}$ that they do not share. Thus, $\{x_t\}$ and $\{z_t\}$ are cointegrated. In the more general case of $\{x_t\}$ , $\{y_t\}$ and $\{z_t\}$ each being I(d) with $d>0$ , similar logic holds but the formulation gets a bit more involved. For another perspective of the same thing, see @whuber's elegant proof in the comment.
