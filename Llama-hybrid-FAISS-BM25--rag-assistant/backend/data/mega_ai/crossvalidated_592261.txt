Interpret plot_trace from PYMC

New to Bayesian Modeling and the python library PYMC. Got some confusing result. How would an expert on Bayesian modeling interpret these graphs? with BVAR_model: trace = pm.sample(chains=4, random_seed=rng) az.plot_trace(trace) After changing the number of lags, from 2 to 4, and applied differencing I got the following result. The right hand side looks better, but the left hand side confuses, strange distribution.
