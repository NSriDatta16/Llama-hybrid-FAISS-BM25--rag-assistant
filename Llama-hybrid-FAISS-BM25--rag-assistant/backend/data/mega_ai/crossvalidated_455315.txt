The difference between two mean differences

I'm an English teacher who is writing his MA thesis and I don't have much knowledge in statistics required for my research and I would like to ask you for a solution to my problem (if there is one). I will give you a much simplified example of what my study is about. I have a Polish student who is learning English. I wanted to test the effectiveness of a pronunciation teaching technique and to see if he can produce English vowels better. I did a test before the treatment and another one after it with the hope of verifying potential progress. In short, I wanted to see, for example, if in the English word "beach" he uses the proper long English /i:/ or his Polish native vowel (Polish /i/ is similar in quality but much shorter). I recorded his three productions of "beach" (the words were embedded in English sentences and he was told to try to say them in English) and then three productions of the Polish word "bicz" (this word sounds very similar to "beach" but has shorter /i/). In a speech visualisation software I measured the durations of the English /i:/ in the three "beach"es and calculated the average duration (in milliseconds) based on those three samples. I did the same thing with three Polish /i/s in the "bicz" words. I made this measurement in both languages in the pre-test and in the post-test. Here are the results: Pre-test: Average English /i:/ duration: 161 ms (std. dev. = 19) Average Polish /i/ duration: 98 ms (std. dev. = 5) Average difference: 63 ms Post-test: Average English /i:/ duration: 243 ms (std. dev. = 43) Average Polish /i/ duration: 86 ms (std. dev. = 10) Average difference: 157 ms My question is: how can I compare those two average differences (63 and 157)? My (probably oversimplified idea) was to just subtract one from the other and say that, since the average difference was bigger in the post-test than in the pre-test, the treatment worked because the English-Polish difference in the duration of /i/ was greater in the post-test, but it all doesn't seem very statistically sound. Should I perhaps calculate the p-values for the pre-test difference and the post-test difference and compare those p-values? Note: I presented a much simplified example of what I'm really doing. The majority of my samples include so called formant values (not durations) of different vowels in different words and they must each time be compared across the two languages because they are not very stable (in either of the languages). Therefore, I could not just record and measure only their English words in the tests (which obviously would be much easier). Also, I actually have three tests because I expose my subjects to two kinds of treatments, but I first wish to find a solution to the simplified problem I presented.
