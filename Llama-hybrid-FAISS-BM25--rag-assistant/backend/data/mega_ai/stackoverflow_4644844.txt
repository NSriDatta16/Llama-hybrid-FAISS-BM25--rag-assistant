Rails and jQuery sending Ajax requests

Hi I currently have a Rails app that uses the jQuery library to run the ajax requests. However i've run into a slight problem as the ajax request that is being sent out is giving me an error: a(this).data("draggable") is undefined The rails program is supposed to take a draggable object and drop it in a valid container and then update the properties of the draggable object to reflect the new permissions given by dragging and dropping. So its basically a way to organize permissions but through dragging and dropping. This is the Rails code "function(ev,ui){ if (confirm(\"#{escape_javascript(_('This will add User to this Group, are you sure?'))}\")) {#{remote_function(:update => 'module_content', :url => {:controller => :projects, :action => :member_change, :id => @project.id}, :with => "'u=' + encodeURIComponent($(ui.draggable).attr('id')) + '&r=' + encodeURIComponent($(this).attr('id'))" )};} }", :accept => '.RolesUsersSelection', :update => 'roles_edit', :url => {:controller => :projects, :action => :role_user_update}, :hoverclass => "#{drop_class}_active" %> And this is the JavaScript created by jrails and jquery: // Im guessing it's got something to do with the ($(this).attr('id')) but im not sure what else should be there... Thanks,
