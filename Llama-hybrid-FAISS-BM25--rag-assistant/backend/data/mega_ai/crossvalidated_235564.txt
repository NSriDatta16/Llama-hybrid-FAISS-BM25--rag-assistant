Deleted the original answer, since it was wrong. Here is a new suggestion: If $\Sigma_X$ acquired by $\hat{\Sigma}_Z - \Sigma_Y$ is indeed not positive semidefinite, it indicates that the estimator $\hat{\Sigma}_Z$ is not a good estimator for $\Sigma_Z$ probably due to small sample size. Since by design, $\Sigma_Z = \Sigma_X + \Sigma_Y$, should be positive definite. However, since $\hat{\Sigma}_Z$ still may have some information in the covariance structure, what if we take a Bayesian way? We set a prior for $\Sigma_X$ to use $Z=X+Y$ information and use observed $Z$ for the likelihood function. \begin{align} p(\Sigma_X) =\text{Inverse-Wishart}(\Psi, \nu)\\ p(Z|\Sigma_X) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_Y, \Sigma_X + \Sigma_Y) \end{align} Then, we will get posterior distribution for $p(\Sigma_X|Z)$ and the point estimate of the distribution will always be positive semi-definite.
