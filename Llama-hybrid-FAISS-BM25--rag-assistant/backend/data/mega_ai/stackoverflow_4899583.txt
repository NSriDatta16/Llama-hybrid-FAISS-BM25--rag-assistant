Here is my personal opinion: I've been in the .NET world for a while. When iPhone launched the ability to create native apps, it called my attention. I really tried to learn Objective-C. I read 2 books and started trying and trying and trying for like a month and then I left iPhone programming due to the fact that you had to make tons of things that on .NET required one line of code. When Miguel de Icaza launched MonoTouch, I gave it a try, and I realized that most of my previously done code was fully functional. I've always tried to separate UI code from business code, and this is really the point of .NET on the iPhone - To bring most of your already-done business logic to the device. Also on Objective-C, you wont find anything like LINQ or the var keyword. Consuming web services on MonoTouch is just a few clicks away. If you want to target the Android platform, there is also MonoDroid (monodroid.net). Also if you want to target Mac OSX there is MonoMac. So you can share class libs between these 3 platforms without much hassle. Not to mention, it will work on Windows too and vice-versa (when possible). The only thing you will need to worry about is the UI, but most of your business logic should work. Here is a complete list of .NET Assemblies supported in MonoTouch: http://monotouch.net/Documentation/Assemblies . Also, MonoTouch exposes a C#/CIL binding to all the CocoaTouch APIs. Also the support of the MonoTouch team is awesome. You can just get on IRC, ask a question, and it will be answered right away. They have a mailing list too. :) I really enjoy MonoTouch. I know that no language is perfect for all tasks, and Objective-C is no exception.
