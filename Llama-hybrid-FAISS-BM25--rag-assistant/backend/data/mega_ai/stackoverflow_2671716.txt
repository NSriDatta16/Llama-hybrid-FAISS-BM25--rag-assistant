Remote Backup User Data on iPhone

I wrote a few iPhone apps using Core Data for persistent storage. Everything is working great but I would like to add the ability for users to back up their data to a PC (via WiFi to a PC app) or to a web server. This is new to me and I can't seem to figure out where to begin researching the problem. I don't want to overcomplicate the issue if there is an easy way to implement this. Is anyone familiar enough with what I am looking to do to point me in the right direction or give me a high level overview of what I should be considering? The data is all text and would be perfectly stored in .csv files if that matters.
