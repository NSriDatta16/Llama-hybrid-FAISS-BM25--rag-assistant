You are right that Linq is lazy loading your attachments. Whether or not it is dragging the varbinary data down from the database depends on the query. Can you post it? You don't need to change the structure of your database to sort out the problem. Make sure that your query isn't touching the varbinary field - you'll need an appropriate select/projection to ensure this. Also if you know that you are always going to get all the attachments related to a controller you could use LoadWith to instruct Linq to get it all at once rather than lazy loading on demand. This will cut down the number of database round trips required to get the job done. LoadWith info on MSDN Also worth checking that your indexes are ok on the tables. To get some real insight into what is going on point SQL Query Analyser at your database and then run the code. You'll see exactly what SQL is hitting the database and can grab and run it in Management Studio to see exactly what data is getting dragged back. Hope this helps a bit.
