Find the covariance

Say $X_t$ is a time series. Find the autocovariance function for $\Delta X_t$ using explicit methods. I get: $$ Cov(X_{t}-X_{t-1},X_{t-k}-X_{t-1-k}))=Cov(X_t,X_{t-k}) - Cov(X_t,X_{t-1-k})-Cov(X_{t-1},X_{t-k}) + Cov(X_{t-1},X_{t-1-k})$$ However the solution says it should be $2\gamma_k - \gamma_{k-1}-\gamma_{k+1}$. I know that $Cov(X_t,X_{t-k})=\gamma_k$, and it makes sense for $Cov(X_t,X_{t-1-k})=\gamma_{k-1}$ from this by substitution. But I am unsure of the other terms?
