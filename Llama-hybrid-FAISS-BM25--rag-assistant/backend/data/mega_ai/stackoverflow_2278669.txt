Error when building OpenCV on my mac: 'Py_ssize_t' issues

I've been following the instructions here: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port , and have just finished the make -j8 step. Although the make completes to 100%, I am getting errors make[2]: *** [interfaces/python/CMakeFiles/cvpy.dir/cv.o] Error 1 make[1]: *** [interfaces/python/CMakeFiles/cvpy.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2 Specific errors I see in the stack trace are all from a file called cv.cpp: /other/open_cv/opencv/opencv/interfaces/python/cv.cpp:18: error: ‘Py_ssize_t’ does not name a type /other/open_cv/opencv/opencv/interfaces/python/cv.cpp:206: error: ‘Py_ssize_t’ does not name a type /other/open_cv/opencv/opencv/interfaces/python/cv.cpp: In function ‘PyObject* iplimage_tostring(PyObject*, PyObject*)’: /other/open_cv/opencv/opencv/interfaces/python/cv.cpp:282: error: ‘what_size’ was not declared in this scope /other/open_cv/opencv/opencv/interfaces/python/cv.cpp: In function ‘PyObject* cvmat_tostring(PyObject*, PyObject*)’: /other/open_cv/opencv/opencv/interfaces/python/cv.cpp:425: error: ‘what_size’ was not declared in this scope (which continues for a long while). I followed all of the steps and am not sure where I am going wrong. Any help for installing open cv on my mac (Snow Leopard)? Thanks!
