Take a look at the afconvert command line utility on your Mac. It does many conversions between different audio formats, and if you have a lot of sounds, you can script the conversions... I use SoundToolbox and AVAudioPlayer with sounds mostly in uncompressed linear PCM, created in GarageBand. SoundToolbox is great for playing a short little "Boing" or "click" or other sounds that you trigger to play and you don't care about stopping or messing with their volume etc. If you want to stop a playing sound or to know if the sound is done playing, AVAudioToolbox is nice. If you want to play sounds with control over the left and right components of the sound, then look at OpenAL. If you haven't already, read Apple's iPhone Application Programming Guide on Sound support. If sound is important to your app, you may want to take advantage of some of features available to you for very little work.
