If you're dealing with WPF, you can put them in a single Panel or Canvas, and apply/update continuously something to the "RenderTransform" property of the Panel/Canvas containing each. So, Transform t = new TranslateTransform(0.0f, 0.0f); panelA.RenderTransform = t; panelB.RenderTransform = t; Then with your favorite timing method, update t slightly each tick. I'm sure there are more elegant ways (baked XAML animations, etc.) but I'm pretty shaky on giving advice with those, as I'm not quite sure on how to make them work myself. =)
