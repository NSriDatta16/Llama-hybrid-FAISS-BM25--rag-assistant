Json results prompting "Save As" dialog in browser instead of being processed. ASP.NET MVC

I know this has been an issue for others, but I've yet to find anything that fixes my problem. I have a partial view that is displayed in a lightbox (colorbox). It is a simple form. I want the form to submit and return a little bit of data. The data will be used in calling subsequent functions, and I want the main DIV just to be updated with a "success" message. Here is the full code of the partial view: " %> $('propcatform').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: $(this).attr("action"), data: $(this).serialize(), dataType: "json", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", success: function(data) { document.getElementById('main1').innerHTML = "Success"; }, failure: function() { document.getElementById('main1').innerHTML = "Failure"; } }) }); Fields Category Title: Here is my controller code. The code works, in that it successfully adds the form data to the table/database. What exactly should my "return" line look like? [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public JsonResult Create(Category propcat) { Category resultcat = new Category(); _db.Categories.InsertOnSubmit(propcat); _db.SubmitChanges(); resultcat = propcat; return Json(new { CatID = resultcat.CatID, CatTitle = resultcat.CatTitle, message = "Category successfully created!" }); } Currently I'm not actually using any of the result data in my partial view code (even though I reference it in my "success" parameter). I'm just trying to get it to work (and not prompt me to save the results). Thanks.
