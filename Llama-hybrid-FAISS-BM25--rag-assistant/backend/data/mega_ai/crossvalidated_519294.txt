Relationship between Bayes Rule and Bayesian Networks

Learning about Bayesian Networks in school - I ran across a problem which ask to find the probability of $Pr(Alarm|Storm=T)$ given a column of event data for four variables: Storm, Burglar, Cats, and Alarm where all these variables are either true or false. The Bayes Network solution apparently is the following: I did not fully understand why we are multiplying the intermediate conditionals i.e.: $... Pr(Burglar|Storm=T) x Pr(Cat|Storm=T) ...$ I thought a more bayesian way to solve this is with probability trees: Perhaps my other way it is not right but the answer turns out the same. So, my question is where is the bayes in bayes networks? What is the relationship between bayes rule (not naive bayes) and bayesian networks? Is there a logical explanation for the multiplication of the intermediate probabilities - or is it just a trick?
