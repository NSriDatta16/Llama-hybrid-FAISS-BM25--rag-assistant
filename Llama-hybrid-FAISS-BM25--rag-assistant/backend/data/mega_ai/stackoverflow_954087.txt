Sending Data from Excel to a Website

I have been asked to make a Macro which sends the Excel Data to a Website. There should not be any database involved. I have been trying to use HTTP Post after reading examples on this website. I have made a ASP.NET webpage which runs on localserver. While debugging the macro, the control does reach the webpage Page_load event but I am unable to see the data there. Can anybody help me find my mistake? Excel Code: Sub SendData() ' ' SendData Macro ' Dim sdata As String sdata = "Abhh" ' Set objHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP") URL = "localhost:2782/Default.aspx?"; + sdata objHTTP.Open "POST", URL, False objHTTP.setRequestHeader "User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)" objHTTP.send ("") End Sub C# Code using System; using System.Data; using System.Configuration; using System.Collections; using System.Web; using System.Web.Security; using System.Web.UI; using System.Web.UI.WebControls; using System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts; using System.Web.UI.HtmlControls; namespace Fetch { public partial class _Default : System.Web.UI.Page { protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { Label1.Text = Request.Url.Query; // I dont know where the data is in the Request object.(If it is there at all..) } } } Thanks Abi
