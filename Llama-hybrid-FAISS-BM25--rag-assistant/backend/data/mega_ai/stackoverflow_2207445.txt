undefined method `env' for Rails:Module

I want to test the waters of mongodb together with RoR for a bit. I am trying to create the project with the following command: rails mono_test_app -m http://gist.github.com/raw/284753/b5584c78fb5d29ab39a8218090801ea89b95a541/Rails%20MongoMapper%20Template Part of the output is create log/test.log applying template: http://gist.github.com/raw/284753/b5584c78fb5d29ab39a8218090801ea89b95a541/Rails%20MongoMapper%20Template executing rm public/index.html from /Users/olle/Projects/mono_test_app executing rm public/images/rails.png from /Users/olle/Projects/mono_test_app executing rm public/javascripts/controls.js from /Users/olle/Projects/mono_test_app executing rm public/javascripts/dragdrop.js from /Users/olle/Projects/mono_test_app executing rm public/javascripts/effects.js from /Users/olle/Projects/mono_test_app executing rm public/javascripts/prototype.js from /Users/olle/Projects/mono_test_app file app/views/layouts/application.html.erb What should I call the database? experiment undefined method `env' for Rails:Module Projects olle$ The template I am specifying with the -m parameter contains # MongoDB FTW! db_name = ask('What should I call the database? ') initializer 'database.rb', Allot of people on github seem to have forked or cloned the gist and appear to use it, why on my system does this error occur? Am I missing something? I have tried on both OSX and Ubuntu with ruby 1.8.7 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 72) [i686-darwin9.7.0] Rails 2.3.3
