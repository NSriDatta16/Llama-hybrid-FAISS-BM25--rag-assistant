WPF Flowdocument - Prevent line break before % sign

I've got a FlowDocument generating a document for a client, and it's getting a line break that they don't like. Is there any way to mark a section of text that it should avoid line breaks? Something like this: Here is a paragraph where there should be no line break in a certain part. Obviously, a Span doesn't have a NoLineBreak property, but I'm wondering if there's some equivilant functionality available, or if someone can get me started on a way of implementing a SpanWithNoLineBreak class or RunWithNoLineBreak class? UPDATE Actually, one issue I'm having is with a percent sign, where there isn't even a space: When I print and &#x00BD;% I want the one-half and '%' symbols to not line break between them. The & #x00BD; is the unicode for a Â½ symbol. I'm getting a line wrap between the 1/2 and the % even though there's no space between them.
