You may use logistic regression if your dataset follows some clear polynomial curve, which you can verify by plotting the data and looking how it is distributed. In that case, even if the data is skewed you might get a good classifier. The fact that you achieve higher accuracy - 99% as you mentioned - by always predicting one of the values is the reason why classifier accuracy is not used to evaluate a logistic regression model. Instead Precision and Recall give you much better insight into the quality of the classifier because they measure both how many of the examples it classified as positive were actually positive and how many of the positive examples in the training set it classified correctly. The tradeoff between both metrics help you find a classifier which is both precise and can generalize.
