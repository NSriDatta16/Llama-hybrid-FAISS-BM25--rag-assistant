I've got two ideas: 1) You can put a class or ID on the elements in each div: And then test for that when you have the item 2) Write a function to do the clone instead of relying on the drag and drop to do it for you (http://ui-dev.jquery.com/demos/draggable/#option-helper) and then test for the parent and store that (in a singleton outside the scope of the dragger) where you can get it later. I think I would prefer the first (even if you don't have html access to add these classes, just add it with javascript)
