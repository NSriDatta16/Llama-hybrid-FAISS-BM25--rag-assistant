Is it cheating to stratified split the whole dataset based on a previous test set result?

I trained a model using a small mri dataset(57 patients). The model's performance was so low(Train set 0.7, Val set 0.7, Test set 0.45). I found the model segments tumor in upper part of brain well, couldn't segment tumor which is in middle part of brain(information from validation + test). So i stratified split the whole dataset with a position stratum(upper, not upper), the model performance was improved. I test this 3 times with different random states for split, average test accuracy increased a little. In this case, is it cheating to do that?
