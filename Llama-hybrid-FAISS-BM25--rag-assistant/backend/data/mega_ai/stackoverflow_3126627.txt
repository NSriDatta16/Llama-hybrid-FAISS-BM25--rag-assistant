The correct syntax for a T-SQL subquery and a possible join

What would be the correct syntax and join (if any) of a subquery that would return all of the employees first and last name from the employeeâ€™s table, and return their department name from the department table, but only those employees who more than the average salary for their department? Thanks for your answers
