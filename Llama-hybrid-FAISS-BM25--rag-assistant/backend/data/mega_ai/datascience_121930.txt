precision and recall is zero

Why my model shows metrics like this? While my model was training recall and precision was equal to zero? I trying to do binary classification of mushrooms [edible, poisonous]. I have CNN model with some dropout and batch normalization. Dataset have ~7000 img, ration is equal to both class. Python version is 3.10 Tensorflow version is 2.12
