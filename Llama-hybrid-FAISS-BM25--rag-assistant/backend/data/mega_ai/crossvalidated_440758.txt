An autoencoder is a deterministic function which maps input $x$ to output $\hat x = f(x; \theta)$ -- $\theta$ being the network parameters. An RBM is a pair of sets of random variables $(v,h)$ , whose joint distribution takes a "quadratic" form -- $\frac{1}{Z} \exp \left( v^T Wh + a^Tv + b^Th\right)$ . Curiously, $p(h_i|v) = \sigma(b+W^Tv)_i$ , and all $h_i$ are independent conditioned on $v$ . This closely mimics the computation of a neural network -- however I would be extremely cautious of thinking of an RBM as a type of feedforward neural network -- this is likely to lead to confusion. The tutorial you linked isn't particularly good. This may help.
