Non-stationary time series data and OLS regression (with controls)

I am using 2000-2020 quarterly data and want to test if an appreciation of the real exchange rate leads to a decrease in manufacturing output of a country. However, my data seems to be non-stationary using a ADF test. Since my knowledge in terms of econometrics is fairly limited, my plan was to use an OLS regression while taking first differences. After taking first differences, all variables seem to become stationary. Would this approach lead to valid results or would this lead to a spurious regression? I have also looked into the idea of a cointegration analysis and VECM. Furthermore, I have several control variables, some of which are stationary before taking first differences. Should I take first differences for those as well or only for the non-stationary variables? I would appreciate any feedback.
