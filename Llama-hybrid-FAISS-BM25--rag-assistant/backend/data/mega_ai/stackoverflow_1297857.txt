Reasons why gzipped content might not be grokked by the browser

I'm attempting to serve static resources (css and javascript) as cached gzipped files for performance reasons. The pages look gzipped when rendered, the Content-Encoding is correctly set to gzip according to LiveHTTPHeaders, and most importantly, the gzipped content is passing the GIDZipTest page ( http://www.gidnetwork.com/tools/gzip-test.php ) just fine. Here's an example of the output from the test: Web page compressed? Yes Compression type? gzip Size, Markup (bytes) 18,286 Size Compressed (bytes) 4,427 Compression % 75.8 ---- ResponseHeaders status HTTP/1.0 200 OK pragma no-cache cache-control private, max-age=86500 expires Mon, 24 Aug 2009 04:34:14 GMT x-amz-acl public-read content-type text/css content-md5 hqJaTBS3OzDFet/QHsd+ Qg== content-encoding gzip date Wed, 19 Aug 2009 04:34:14 GMT server -- my server -- content-length 4427 The content-encoding header is in bold, and all the other headers are as expected. The test page also shows the uncompressed page source, and it's always exactly as I'd expect it to be uncompressed, and I've even tried copying and pasting it to be rendered by the browser, and it works, so the problem must be in the actual step of recognizing that the page is gzipped and unzipping it. And this isn't browser-specific. In FF, Webkit, and IE, these gzipped files are not being unzipped correctly. I've tried everything I can think of, but am genuinely stumped.
