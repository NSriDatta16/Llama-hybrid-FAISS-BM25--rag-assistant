They are identical. From the PostgreSQL documentation: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/datatype-character.html Tip: There are no performance differences between these three types, apart from increased storage size when using the blank-padded type, and a few extra cycles to check the length when storing into a length-constrained column. While character(n) has performance advantages in some other database systems, it has no such advantages in PostgreSQL. In most situations text or character varying should be used instead. Here they are talking about the differences between char(n), varchar(n) and text (= varchar(1G)). The official story is that there is no difference between varchar(100) and text (very large varchar).
