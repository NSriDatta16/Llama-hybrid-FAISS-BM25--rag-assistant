I have taken a look at the problem but I cannot figure out what's going on. One thing I did find was that if I add a data parameter to the error and then alert(data.status) it gives code 200. The only place I could find this was to resolve it to the success code for v2?! error: function(data) { alert(data.status); } Also I'm not sure you can use that jsonp because reading the documentation it seems to put extra paramaters on the querystring? When I removed it the jsonpcallback and change the datatype to json the response code started saying 0. Not much help sorry but I've gotta go to work now.
