There are more than a few ways to do it, but you have to ask yourself first what are your assumptions and conditions. So, assuming that your space is limited in size and you know what is the maximum accuracy, then you can form a function that given (x,y,z) will convert them to a unique number or string -this can be done only if you know that your accuracy is limited (for example - no two entities can occupy the same cubic centimeter). Encoding the coordinate allows you to use a single map/hash with O(1). If this is not tha case, you can always use 3 embedded maps as you suggested, or go towards space division algorithms (such as OcTree as mentioned) which although given O(logN) on a average search, they also give you additional information you might want (neighbors, population, etc..), but of course it is harder to implement.
