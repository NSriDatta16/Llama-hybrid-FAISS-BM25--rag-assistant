Just because the ACF shows seasonal spikes with relatively slow decay it can not automatically be concluded that there is a unit-root in the seasonal componend. Actually ( Ghysels, Osborn (2001): The Econometic Analysis of Seasonal Time Series , p.29) states: "[...] for the sample sizes often observed in practice, it may be difficult to discriminate between deterministic seasonality and a seasonal unit root process." Furthermore on page 42 they write: "It is now well known that a series generated by a unit root process can wander widely and smoothly over time without any inherent tendency to return to its underlying mean value [...]. In the seasonal context, there are S unit root processes, none of which has an inherent tendency to return to a deterministic pattern. As a result, the values for the seasons can wander widely and smoothly in relation to each other [...]" Therefore it is useful to visualize the time series of the different seasons $S$ and see if they look non-stationary. In our case we have daily data and model each day as a season. So we get seasons $S=7$. Plotting gives: None of the single seasonal time series looks particularly non-stationary. Therefore the Canova and Hansen test statistics is perfectly fine. The same result is obtained when using the forecast::nsdiffs() function or the OCSBtest() function from the R forecast package source code on github .
