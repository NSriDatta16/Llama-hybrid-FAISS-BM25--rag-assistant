Not sure if this helps, but in IE6 I was getting all sorts of strange browser errors when I tried to stream dynamically generated PDFs. The errors were different depending on whether the content disposition header said inline or attachment, but it was a train-wreck either way. The issued turned out to be that IE6 must cache the PDF in order to pass it to Acrobat Reader, and the default headers in a Pylons response say "don't cache this". I allowed caching for 10 seconds by adding: del response.headers['Cache-Control'] del response.headers['Pragma'] response.cache_expires(seconds=10) to the controller that returns the PDF, and all was well.
