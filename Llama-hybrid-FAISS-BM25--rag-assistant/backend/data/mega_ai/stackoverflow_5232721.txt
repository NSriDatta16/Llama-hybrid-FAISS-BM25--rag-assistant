What is causing calls to sharepoint server vti_bin\sites.asmx

We are looking at logs on our sharepoint and see a call to this web service from several PC's. The calls apprear very regular every 5 mins, when the PC is on. Anyone know what is causing this? Edit The agent in the iis log is: Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.1;+HO32602;+HO32600;+HO32501;+.NET+CLR+1.1.4322;+.NET+CLR+2.0.50727)
