You can use SQL Server Management Studio to show the actual or estimated query plan. It gives a graphical output that you can follow. Here's a little primer: http://www.mssqltips.com/tip.asp?tip=1873 Update: You can use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to create data extracts in a graphical fashion. You can also use Microsoft Biztalk Server to create complex graphical layouts that also extract data. Finally, you can use Microsoft's WF to create automated processes in a graphical fashion that can do similar functions as Biztalk. Alas, these aren't free :(. If you have a MSDN subscription they are :) Biztalk Map: http://geekswithblogs.net/images/geekswithblogs_net/Chilberto/WindowsLiveWriter/BizTalkMapComparisonbetweenTableLoopinga_B5B9/image_6.png
