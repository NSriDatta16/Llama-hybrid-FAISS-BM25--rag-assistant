In Magento Layered Navigation, how do I get all items for active filters?

Once a filter becomes active it returns 0 items thus it won't show anymore in the "SHOPPING OPTIONS". For my custom layered nav I need to fetch and show these items. I know some extension are already doing this (and providing checkboxes next to an item) but I'd like to know how to do it myself.
