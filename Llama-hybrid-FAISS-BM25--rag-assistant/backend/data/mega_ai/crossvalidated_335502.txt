Why does a Gaussian Process need to have a PSD kernel? Can I use a non-PSD kernel?

Is there an absolute need to use a PSD kernel for Gaussian processes (and maybe SVMs?) For example, If I used a Minkowski distance with 0 In Gaussian Process regression, we would need to invert the covariance matrix to do inference. What would it mean to have negative eigenvalues in terms of this inference? Is there any corrections that can be done so I can use a Minkowski distance function 0
