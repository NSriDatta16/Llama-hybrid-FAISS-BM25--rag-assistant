I invoked Eclipse with eclipse -clean but JDT Weaving was already enabled. I never changed its value so this is slightly confusing. Nevertheless I created a new Scala project and the same error ocurred. Additionally in the error log I found the message The -clean (osgi.clean) option was not successful. Unable to clean the storage area: D:\Programme\eclipse\configuration\org.eclipse.osgi What went wrong ? The command line didn't spit out any error message.
