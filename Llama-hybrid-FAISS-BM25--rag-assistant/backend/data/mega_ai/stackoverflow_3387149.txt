Just an idea but you may want to serialize your event and save it to some persistent storage and then, when you need to remove it, deserialize it and remove that exact event. This assumes that you want to add and remove events between multiple application launches and that the user does not modify your event by hand (dunno if it's even possible but still). Also from what I see in the documentation EKEvent has much more properties than just two you listed. EKEvent Class Reference
