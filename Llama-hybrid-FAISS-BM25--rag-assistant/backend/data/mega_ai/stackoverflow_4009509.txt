When you dynamically allocate memory using operator new , you have the guarantee that: The pointer returned shall be suitably aligned so that it can be converted to a pointer of any complete object type and then used to access the object or array in the storage allocated (until the storage is explicitly deallocated by a call to a corresponding deallocation function) (C++03 3.7.3.1/2). vector does not create an array of char; it uses an allocator. The default allocator uses ::operator new to allocate memory.
