When does a Gaussian Process not suited to my data?

I am interested in fitting Gaussian Processes and multi-output Gaussian Processes on my time series. Which criteria should I check before doing so to be sure that these kind of processes are indeed relevant for the specific kind of data I am studying? I hope there are better ways than checking that any finite linear combination of samples has a joint Gaussian distribution?
