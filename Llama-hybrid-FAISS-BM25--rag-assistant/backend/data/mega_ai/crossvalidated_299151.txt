How do I display my germination rates? Is it count data? Not sure!

I have 4 treatments, each with 5 Petri dishes (so total 20), and each Petri dish has 25 seeds in it. I am looking to discuss how many seeds have germinated. Should I get the mean germination of each treatment and then discuss it as a percentage of 25 seeds? So if in the root treatment, 4,4,6,6,0 germinate, so my mean is an average of 5 seeds out of 25, how do I best display/discuss this? > ARpetri attach(ARpetri) > names(ARpetri) [1] "Distilled" "Marigold" "Mixed" "Root" > ARpetri Distilled Marigold Mixed Root 1 2 1 1 5 2 2 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 4 3 1 0 4 5 0 1 1 1 the counts on each row do not belong together, just the columns and the first column is excel generated and not my own. I hope that helps clarify. Many thanks for all the advice and I will definitely check out the R mailing list as suggested. Any recommendations for where I can look up how to create the plot pictured above? I think it would be useful to re-create with my other counts and "eyeball" the data. Thanks all!
