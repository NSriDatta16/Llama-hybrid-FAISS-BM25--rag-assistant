Spam detection in social media

I want to train a binary classification algorithm for spam detection using labeled data set of mentions from social media. These mentions have the following features: URL, text message, posting date, is deleted, author where the author has its own fields: URL, nick, type ( person or community ), number of subscribers, registration date, last activity date I have $\approx 13.5k$ observations with $\approx 450$ spam messages among them. My suggestions: transform data features in real numbers binarize URLs by media sources (e.g. facebook, instagram, etc.) use SVM with Gaussian kernel for all data Questions: Am I on the right way? What else can I do? How can I process text data? Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
