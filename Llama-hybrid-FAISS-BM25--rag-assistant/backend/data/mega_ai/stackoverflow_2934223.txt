What web framework uses "javascript:__doPostBack()"

I've seen this all over the web javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$lnk2','') Checking headers of the last place I saw it didn't reveal a server side language. What server side language and/or framework encourages this style of link?
