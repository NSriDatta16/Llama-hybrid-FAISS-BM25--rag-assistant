You said: I first calculated group means for both groups and then took the Ln of both. Then subtracted the log transformed parameters like I referenced before (ln AUC1 - ln AUC2). You should at least take the logarithms and then take the average logarithms. The point being that if AUC is lognormal distributed then it is the average logarithm that is normally distributed, and the average of raw AUC's will not measure the location of the data. It is difficult for me to follow what you did, not so much because you did not explain it, but because you did so many steps that it is a bit confusing. Showing data might make it easier to understand, but, at least try what I suggest here and see if that is enough, please.
