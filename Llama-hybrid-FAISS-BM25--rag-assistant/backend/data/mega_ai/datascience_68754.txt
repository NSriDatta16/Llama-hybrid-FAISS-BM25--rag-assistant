The best emulation (although I didn't check full equivalency): import mxnet as mx SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 100 stack = mx.gluon.rnn.SequentialRNNCell() stack.add(mx.gluon.rnn.LSTMCell(16, prefix='first') stack.add(mx.gluon.rnn.LSTMCell(1, prefix='first') x, _ = stack.unroll(length=SEQUENCE_LENGTH, inputs=x, layout='NTC', merge_outputs=True, ) Here layout='NTC' is for the case when input shape is (samples, timesteps, channels).
