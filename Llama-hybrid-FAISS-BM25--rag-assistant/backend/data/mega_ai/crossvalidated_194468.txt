Handling missing values in function `prewhiten` in R

I am using function prewhiten from "TSA" package in R. I get an error about NA values, but I don't understand it, because I don't have NA values in my data. Here is the error message: whitedata It works fine for some data files, but not for others. When I print xhr and ypred I don't see any NA values. Both are time series: xhr Strangely, if I run it with a different model (one built on ypred ), it runs just fine. The model I am using is: ARIMA(2,1,2) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 1.4835 -0.7641 -0.9574 0.4021 s.e. 0.1136 0.0826 0.1365 0.0910 sigma^2 estimated as 0.02589: log likelihood=79.98 AIC=-149.96 AICc=-149.65 BIC=-133.55
