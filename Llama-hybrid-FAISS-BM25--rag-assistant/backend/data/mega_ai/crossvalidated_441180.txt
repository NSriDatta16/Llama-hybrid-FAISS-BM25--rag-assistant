Retrieving similar frames

I have N images in database and K images as test images, N > K always and N is much larger in size. I have extracted CNN embeddings from all the images (both images which are in database and test images) and created arrays. Array sizes are NxM and KxM where M is the CNN embeddings size. Is there any way i can retrieve the K matched/similar frames directly from N database images using the above two arrays?
