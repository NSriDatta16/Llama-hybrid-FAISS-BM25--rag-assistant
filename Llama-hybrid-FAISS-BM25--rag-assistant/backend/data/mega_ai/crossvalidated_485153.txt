Random forest is a bagging algorithm. Here, we train a number (ensemble) of decision trees from bootstrap samples of your training set. Bootstrap sampling means drawing random samples from our training set with replacement. In random forest all the trees are built independently. Only the training sample of each of the trees are different. Since there is no flow of information between the trees, all the trees can be built parallel.
