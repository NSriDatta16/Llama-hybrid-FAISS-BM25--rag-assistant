If you want it to specifically open the links in Safari then mcgrailm's solution is good. However, you don't need the Finder for the first part so take that code out of the Finder tell block. There's no need to tell the Finder to do something that applescript can do itself. However, you probably want to open the links in whatever browser is the user's default browser. It may be Safari or Firefox etc. You can do that with the "open location" command. So something like this is probably what you want... set theFile to choose file with prompt "Pick text file containing urls" set locations to paragraphs of (read theFile) repeat with aLocation in locations try open location aLocation end try end repeat
