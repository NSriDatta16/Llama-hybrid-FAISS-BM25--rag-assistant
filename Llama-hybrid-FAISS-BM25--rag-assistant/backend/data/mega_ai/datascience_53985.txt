Manually changing coefficients of a model

Is there a way to manually change parameters of a model in Orange 3? I have a dataset and trained a logistic regression model on it. Now, I can alter the coefficients (beta values) of the logistic regression model and visualize how it changes the predictions. Is there a simple way to do that in Orange? I understand the model parameters will not be optimal if I am manually change them, but still is there a way to do it? Thanks.
