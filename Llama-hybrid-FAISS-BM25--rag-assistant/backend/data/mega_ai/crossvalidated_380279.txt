Modelling Time Series of percentages

I am trying to model a multivariate time series of percentages. And here's the kicker, at each point, each of my individual time series are bound between 0 and 1, and their Sum per period equals 1. An example of such time series would be, Y1={0.1,0.3,0.6} Y2={0.2,0.3,0.5} ... I am thinking of using Genetic Programming and compare it with ARIMA to forecast in and out of sample. I was looking for a while on how to model these issues (someone on this forum with a similar problem modeled ratios, which is not an option for me). If there is no way, I will just model the time series as is and then shave off or add the proportional difference, but this seems like a very ad-hoc procedure. Any ideas?
