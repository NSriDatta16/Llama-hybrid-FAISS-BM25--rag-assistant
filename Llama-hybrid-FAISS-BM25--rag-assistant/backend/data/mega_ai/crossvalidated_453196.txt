Contrastive learning is very intuitive. If I ask you to find the matching animal in the photo below, you can do so quite easily. You understand the animal on left is a "cat" and you want to find another "cat" image on the right side. So, you can contrast between similar and dissimilar things. Contrastive learning is an approach to formulate this task of finding similar and dissimilar things for a machine. You can train a machine learning model to classify between similar and dissimilar images. There are various choices to make ranging from: Encoder Architecture : To convert the image into representations Similarity measure between two images : mean squared error, cosine similarity, content loss Generating the Training Pairs : manual annotation, self-supervised methods This blog post explains the intuition behind contrastive learning and how it is applied in recent papers like SimCLR in more detail.
