I learned that Firefox out-of-the-box supports multiple selection ranges in a web page that contains multiple frames Hell, Firefox even supports multiple selections on a single frame! (Try click-drag then ctrl-click-drag on a separate piece of text.) in Safari I noticed immediately that when I click on an HTML Button the current user text selection goes away, as if clicking on the button repositioned the text caret Works for me, in Safari 3.2.1 on Windows. Clicking a , or leaves the selection where it is, albeit greyed out if it's in a different frame. ‘window.getSelection()’ continues to work as usual. Can you post a test case and what Safari version makes it misbehave?
