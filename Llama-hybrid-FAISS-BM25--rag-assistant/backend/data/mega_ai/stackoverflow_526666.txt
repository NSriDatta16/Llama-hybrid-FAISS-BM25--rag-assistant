What is the best way to persist PHP application setings?

I have a small application that I'm developing, that I may want to give/sell to others. I want to persist some settings, and create an admin interface to modify them. What would be the best way to store them away? A DB table seems like overkill for the 10-20 settings I'll have, and I want the retrieval of these settings to be as fast as possible. Is a flat file another viable option? What are the pitfalls associated with using a flat file? What would be the fastest/easiest way to interface with a flat file storing multiple keys and values?
