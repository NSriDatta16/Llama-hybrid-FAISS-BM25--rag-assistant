An XWindow terminal is pretty complex, I don't think you're going to find one specically targetting embedding in a Windows Forms application, since it is such a niche technology. Fortunately, Windows Forms supports embedding ActiveX controls, which opens up a whole other world of third-party controls. If you could find an embeddable XWindow terminal that is an ActiveX control, then you could possibly use that. I googled and found WinaXe , which is a windows-based XWindow terminal. From reading their literature, they seem to support embedding as an ActiveX control as well (see http://www.labf.com/winaxe/x11.html and do text search for ActiveX).
