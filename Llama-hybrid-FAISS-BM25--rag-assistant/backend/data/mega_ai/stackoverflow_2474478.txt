I left this on my list but it's a big enough annoyance that it probably stands on its own: Software that requires users to pay for bug fixes, security patches, or critical updates. If you have a patch that adds some new feature that I want, I don't mind paying for it. If you made a mistake and you are trying to get me to pay you to fix your mistake, then that's where we have a problem. Any physical product manufactured and sold would call this a "recall" and wouldn't dare charge customers to fix it. In the past, some software products have shipped with known flaws to encourage users to buy the "critical updates subscription". This is downright evil.
