I don't fully understand what exactly you want to know. But if I get it correctly, you want to use neural network to output some sort of similarity between objects. Try to look at embeddings: when a neural network takes an image as an input and outputs a n-dimensional vector - the image representation. And the euclidean distance between the vectors for different pictures is a kind of similarity measure. Read this paper, for further references.
