You can use your training set in anyway you like. Data leakage between the training and validation (or test) is important. Stepwise min/max scaling would create min/max values for each time step, which is inefficient (and unnecessary I believe) as you've also commented. Similarly, you can't apply transformations such as Box-Cox, STL decomposition etc. which is also common in time series analysis, easily.
