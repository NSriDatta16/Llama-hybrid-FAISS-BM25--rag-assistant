If you ever get to look at a network topology chart for a major organization, do so. It's enlightening. The whole point of NAT, firewalls and all that other "black magic" is to allow the network to manage addresses (including protecting you) without your knowledge. There are only three ways in which I've been able to reliably (and reliable is a relative concept here) get the external-facing IP address of a server. The first is to as the network gods themselves (and make sure you refer to them as gods when asking, this will assist you in getting the information). Sometimes (not always), it's a simple mapping of the top bytes of your IP address whilst retaining the low-order bytes. Sometimes it's more complex, but still follows rules that you can use. Just keep in mind these rules can change at any time. The second is to have a box outside of your network which you can query and it, in turn, can let you know your IP address. The third is to specifically attach to an outside DNS server (not your corporate one) to retrieve the information. Of course, you should question the need to know your external IP address. The whole point of DNS is to avoid having to worry too much about IP addresses and just refer to machines by the domain names.
