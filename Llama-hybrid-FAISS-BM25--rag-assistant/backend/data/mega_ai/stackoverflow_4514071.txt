Is there a general notation that can describe any IT system at any scale?

Has anyone ever heard of a general (textual) notation that can describe any IT system at any scale? It should be something that is clearly defined, minimalistic, and can be applied recursively at any scale from website mashups, to network architecture, to software services, to multiple objects and threads inside one process. Something that starts with the basic concepts of storage, communication, and processing, and apply them at all levels. If such a notation exists, it could be used as the base for a DSL that could programmatically "manage" and "monitor" every and all part of a complex IT system. Then one would need only create a plug-in for every system component, that expose it's functionality into the DSL. EDIT: It looks like there is no such thing, or I didn't expressed myself clearly. So I'll tell you what I want to do. I want to get into the "website business", but for me, the fun part would be to collect data about everything that happens at all levels of the system, in a central "database", and analyze that data to get insights into what is "happening", to plan my next iteration. Therefore, I want a DSL that can represent any process/structure at any level, so that I can then programmatically access that data to gain "insights". A "Big Brother" kind of thing. Since I want to do this in my new programming language of choice, Scala, something like Nagios or Zenoss Core won't help me much, IMHO.
