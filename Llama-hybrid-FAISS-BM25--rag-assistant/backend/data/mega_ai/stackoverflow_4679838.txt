I actually had a typo in my command. As type I wrote spoc instead of spock , causing no tests to run at all. grails test-app unit:spoc -coverage After changing this to the correct values, the tests were actually run and the coverage report contained them. So: YES, the coverage plugin DOES report on Spock specifications .
