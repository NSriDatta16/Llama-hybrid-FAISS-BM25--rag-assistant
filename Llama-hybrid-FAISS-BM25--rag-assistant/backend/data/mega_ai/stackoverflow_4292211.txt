AI solved it in such a way: Opened iPhone simulator. Drag there photos. And it automatically copy it to folder ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.1/Media/DCIM/100APPLE and named them as IMG_0001.PNG IMG_0002.PNG and so on. After that all works fine, but: When I tried to copy item directly to that folder, and give them suitable names, iphone didn't recognized them. And also, when I deleted them from that folder and run simulator - photos where on simulator, but in folder they were not.
