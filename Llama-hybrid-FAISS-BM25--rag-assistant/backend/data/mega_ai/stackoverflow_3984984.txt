Caching static files in Django

I was profiling the performance of my web application using Google's Page Speed plugin for Firebug and one of the things it says is that I should 'leverage caching' — "The following cacheable resources have a short freshness lifetime. Specify an expiration at least one week in the future for the following resources". When I dug deeper I found that all request for static files to the Django WSGI server lacked the Expires and the Cache-Control headers. Who should add these headers — should Django do it? If so, how? Thanks.
