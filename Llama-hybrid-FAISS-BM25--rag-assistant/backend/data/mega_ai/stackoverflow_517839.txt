javascript/jquery leaking and crashing browser

Let me just preface by saying it's actually my crappy code that's leaking and crashing my browser, I just thought I better make the languages being used as clear as I could from the outset. I have a test page here and the javascript can be found here . My problem is that when I try and drag and drop either one of the red pieces more than a few times it sucks up all browser resources and crashes the browser. I'm fairly certain the culprit is something in the following function in the Tracker() object but I'm absolutely stuck on how to debug this. My current most likely culprit: function register_draggable(ob) { ob.config.jqId.draggable({cursor: 'move', grid:[ob.config.size, ob.config.size], containment: '#chessboard', revert: 'invalid', start: function() { check_allowable_moves(ob.config.jqLocation, ob.config.jqId, ob); }, stop: function() { remove_allowable_moves(); } }); } If anyone could take a quick look and give me any suggestions on what I should be looking for, it would be enormously appreciated. Solution Turns out register_draggable() was the culprit. I registered a new draggable every time the location of a piece updated and all those draggables on the same object were doing nasty things. Currently I now explicity destroy the old draggable before creating a new one. Current code is function register_draggable(ob) { ob.config.jqId.draggable('destroy'); ob.config.jqId.draggable({cursor: 'move', grid:[ob.config.size, ob.config.size], containment: '#chessboard', revert: 'invalid', start: function() { check_allowable_moves(ob.config.jqLocation, ob.config.jqId, ob); }, stop: function() { remove_allowable_moves(); } }); }
