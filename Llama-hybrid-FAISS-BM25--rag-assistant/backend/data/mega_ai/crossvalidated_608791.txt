In this case the warning is noise and can be ignored. The final model converges and the results look good. The warning comes from estimating a simplified model for starting parameters which is not run until convergence (I had forgotten to silence it.). In general models that are strongly misspecified for the given data will often have convergence problems. This is the case in Zero-inflated models if there is no zero inflation or even a deficit of zeros. A similar case, NegativeBinomial is unlikely to converge if there is no overdispersion relative to Poisson. In those cases it is better to estimate the basic model first and check that the deviation or misspecification is in the direction of the alternative model. The following illustrates that for zero-inflation. rhs = 'AGE + COHES + ESTEEM + GRADES + SATTACH' mod = Poisson.from_formula("STRESS ~" + rhs, data) res = mod.fit() diag = res.get_diagnostic() The hypothesis test that there is no zero-inflation (or deficit) is strongly rejected: diag.test_poisson_zeroinflation().pvalue # 3.9959363587290166e-33 As a quick diagnostic for how well the model fits the data, we can compare the observed frequencies of count with the expected probabilities for each count, both averaged over the estimation sample. We can see that more zeros are observed than predicted. diag.plot_probs(), So, estimating the Poisson model indicates that there is an excess of zeros. Next, estimate the zero-inflated Poisson model. It shows that the estimation converged. Comparing observed and expected frequencies shows that the ZIP model fits the data much better than the Poisson model. mod_zip = cm.ZeroInflatedPoisson.from_formula("STRESS ~" + rhs, data) res_zip = mod_zip.fit() res_zip.converged # True diag_zip = res_zip.get_diagnostic() diag_zip.plot_probs(), (Note: get_diagnostic will be available in the next statsmodels release)
