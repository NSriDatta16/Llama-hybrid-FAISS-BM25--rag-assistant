If it is a very internal application that will be used only inside a company, it might be possible to define an IP range because smaller companies which do not operate worldwide will probably have a certain amount of IPs from their internet access provider. You could also think about using some info from $_SERVER to restrict users to a combnation of a single web browser (HTTP_USER_AGENT) and a single port (REMOTE_PORT) - as an additional way to differentiate machines. But all these solutions are bad or worse, it's technically probably not possible to solve this problem (unless you will have guarantees from your client that all machines will keep a static IP in which case it is a trivial if else problem).
