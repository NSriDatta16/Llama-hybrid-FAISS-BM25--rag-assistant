I see a similar problem but I cannot use .Clear since the DataTable is bound to a user interface list and .Clear followed by .Fill causes the list to lose the user's current selection. Thus, I implemented a (ugly) workaround which basically consists of changing a field in the DataTable to a value that I know this field will never have running .Fill removing all rows containing this value In other words: For Each drow As DataRow In dset.Tables(0).Rows drow.Item("myField") = -1 Next myDataAdapter.Fill(dset) Dim drowsRemove = (From drow In dset.Tables(0).AsEnumerable() _ Where drow.Field(Of Integer)("myField") = -1).ToList() For Each drow In drowsRemove dset.Tables(0).Rows.Remove(drow) Next Any suggestions for more elegant solutions are appreciated.
