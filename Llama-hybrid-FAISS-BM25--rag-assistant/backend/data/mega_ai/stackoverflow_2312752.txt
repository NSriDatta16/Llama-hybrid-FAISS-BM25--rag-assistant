I suggest checking out erlware.org and using the tools sinan and faxien for your Erlang development. If you stick to strict OTP compliance for your apps and releases it not only makes development easier and less error prone but it makes sharing your apps much much easier. The upcoming book http://www.manning.com/logan/ answers much more, you can read an early copy in pdf form. Putting starts and stops "randomly" in your modules is a bad idea.
