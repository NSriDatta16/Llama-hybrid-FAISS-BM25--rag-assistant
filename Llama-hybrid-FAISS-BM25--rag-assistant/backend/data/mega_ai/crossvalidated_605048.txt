glm fits what is known as a Generalized Linear Model. Logistic regression happens to part of this class of models. Let's break down the model call glm(cbind(n, year_total - n) ~ year., data = ., family = "binomial") glm is the function which fits logistic regression cbind(n, year_total-n) creates the outcome for the model. n is the number of successes (so named in the data) for a given year and year_total-n is the number of failures) for a given year ~ is read as "explained by". The left hand side of the ~ is explained by the right hand side. year is what is doing the explaining. So we're looking at n/(year_total) over year . data=. specifies where the data comes from. Since david is using the pipe %>%, using a dot . is a way to tell the function you're piping into to use the data being piped at the indicated place. family=binomial tells glm to fit logsitic regression.
