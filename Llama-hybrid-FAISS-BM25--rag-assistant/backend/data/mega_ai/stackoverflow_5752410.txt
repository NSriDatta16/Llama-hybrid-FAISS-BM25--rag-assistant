I don't know, but the kernel doesn't access NVRAM that way, so likely neither should you. Short of exhaustively searching memory or figuring out a way to debug/disassemble the EFI implementation, I don't think this is particularly doable. Access to NVRAM is provided by EFI Variable Services. (U)EFI doesn't provide an interface to get at the nonvolatile storage for variables. Going up a level, the kext that implements the NVRAM interface by setting/getting EFI variables is /System/Library/Extensions/AppleEFIRuntime.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleEFINVRAM.kext . It is not open source. There are APIs available for manipulating NVRAM contents, and the nvram tool itself is open source.
