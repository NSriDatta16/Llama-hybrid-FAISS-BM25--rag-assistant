Unless the two populations have the same characteristics it would be incorrect to take the B bootstrap samples regardless of the group. As an example, if your sample set was the average wage of a 25 year old professional, this data could vary significantly depending upon the industry and the geography the professional is in. Given the divergence it wouldn't make much sense to group all the samples into a single population. For the same reason it wouldn't make sense to collect the bootstrap samples across all the different population.
