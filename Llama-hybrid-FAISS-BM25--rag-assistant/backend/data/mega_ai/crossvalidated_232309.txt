I think there is no minimal number of "cases" to perform logistic regression (well at least you need to have 2 classes.). The only downside is that, if you have a very imbalanced data, you may model minority poorly. Also you may get some warnings from R , glm , if you have perfect separably data, so you may consider adding regularization. Regularization methods for logistic regression
