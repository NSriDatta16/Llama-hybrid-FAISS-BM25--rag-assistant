Thanks Matthew. There is a confusion to me, you mean we’ll build the model through multiple linear regression method and then the residuals will be checked VS the significant factors to see if they are structureless. We shouldn’t first check whether or not the variables (coefficients) are linear with respect to y. Since the X9 and X5 were not statistically significant, shall I check the scatter plot of residuals vs those two? What are your insights about the scatter plot of residuals vs time, do you think it still needs any transformation? If yes, can you explain the reason? Here are the scatterplot of residuals VS significant variables and different Residuals plots vs Y to check if the normality assumptions were met. Please let me know your feedback. On the other hand, can you explain a bit more what your last paragraph meant (note that both X3 and X4 are statistically significant)? Thank you again.
