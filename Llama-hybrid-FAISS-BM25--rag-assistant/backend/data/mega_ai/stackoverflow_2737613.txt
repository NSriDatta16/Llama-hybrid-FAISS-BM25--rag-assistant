The sessionid is exactly the same on both subdomains (..) Are you sure that the value (not the name) of sessionid is the same? I needed similar thing 2 years ago, but I needed it to work on completely different virtual hosts (e.g., example.com and something.else.net), so I wrote a small script that ensures that user gets the same session_id on different virtual hosts. Source code is available at http://www.misc.lv/_downloads_file.php?id=18 , but there's small bug on line 58 - arguments of strpos() should be swapped (I'm too lazy to fix it and upload fixed script). Basic requirements/steps are: all pages should be on the same server, as they need a common "storage" for session variables; there must be one "main" host; there's no limit on a number of "additional" hosts; if currently opened page is on the "main host" (and it is not a request of session_id), nothing "extraordinary" has to be done; if page is not on the "main host" and there is an active session, nothing "extraordinary" has to be done, as session_id probably has already been shared; if page is not on the "main host" and there is no active session, request a session_id from the "main host".
