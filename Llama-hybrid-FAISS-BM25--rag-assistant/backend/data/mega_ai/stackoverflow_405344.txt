I would specifically never do alternative 1 (letting the test-class hierarchy be the same as the actual class hierarchy) if this means you will be running the same tests repeatedly for each test subclass. I am also generally sceptical of subclassing test classes other than the general utility base class. I normally make 1 test for each class in a hierarchy, abstract or not. So the base class has a separate test (usually with a test-local private subclass that is used for testing it specifically), and I use my knowledge of the subclasses to write proper tests for each subclass. I can see in coverage runs what is missing tests, so I'm usually not too formalized up-front.
