How do I calculate probability of reference category in logistic regression?

I came across this quote from a paper by Pool and Doris (2021): "The 18â€“24 age group reported the highest levels of food insecurity, with 27.6% reporting being food insecure, as opposed to 8.2% of over 65-year-olds (odds ratio (OR) 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05; 5.75)." I'd like to understand how they calculated the probability of over-65s which was their reference group in the logistic regression they ran. Example logistic regression output: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.457415 0.221487 -11.095 I want to find out what the probability of the outcome variable is for the reference categories e.g. wave4 and age_r1. Apologies if this is straightforward but I've really struggled to find an answer. How can I do this in R? Reference: Pool, U. and Dooris, M., 2021. Prevalence of food security in the UK measured by the Food Insecurity Experience Scale. Journal of Public Health,.
