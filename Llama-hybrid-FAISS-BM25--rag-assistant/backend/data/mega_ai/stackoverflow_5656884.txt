The book Programming Game AI By Example is superb, and touches on just what you are looking for regarding game loops, using scripting (like LUA), and tons of examples of stuff that seem especially pertinent to you. By the way, potentially relevant is the Unity3D game engine that lets you use C# for scripting. And there is also Garage Games engines, including the game builder kits that could help you create an RTS type game, and I believe you may be able to code in C# for Torque as well.
