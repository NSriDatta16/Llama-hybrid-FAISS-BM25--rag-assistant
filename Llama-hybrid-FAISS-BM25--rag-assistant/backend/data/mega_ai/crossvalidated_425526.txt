Bayesian MCMC inference with more free parameters than data points

I've come across Bayesian inference analysis with models that include more free parameters than observed data points (even up to three times more). It is my understanding that although Bayesian MCMC is able to handle this seemingly very degenerate models, it does so by relying heavily on the priors. Is this true? Are there any published articles one could use as reference (and learn more) about this issue?
