DragDrop-Support of PictureBox-Control

After some searching i figured out how dragdrop is implemented for a picturebox. But there is one thing - the (inherited of course) allowdrop property isn't accessible from code or property window of picturebox class. So to make it work i added following line to my form-load: ((Control)pictureBox1).AllowDrop = true; Why do i have to do that? In msdn it says: "This API supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code." Any explanation appreciated and sorry for my grammar ;)
