This is several months after the fact, but I resolved the same issue based on a similar questions I asked. See Is it possible to automate postback from the client side? for more info. I used Python's Mechanize instead or Perl, but the same principle applies. Summarizing my earlier response: ASP.NET pages need a hidden parameter called __EVENTTARGET in the form, which won't exist when you use mechanize normally. When visited by a normal user, there is a __doPostBack('foo') function on these pages that gives the relevant value to __EVENTTARGET via a javascript onclick event on each of the links, but since mechanize doesn't use javascript you'll need to set these values yourself. The python solution is below, but it shouldn't be too tough to adapt it to perl. def add_event_target(form, target): #Creates a new __EVENTTARGET control and adds the value specified #.NET doesn't generate this in mechanize for some reason -- suspect maybe is #normally generated by javascript or some useragent thing? form.new_control('hidden','__EVENTTARGET',attrs = dict(name='__EVENTTARGET')) form.set_all_readonly(False) form["__EVENTTARGET"] = target
