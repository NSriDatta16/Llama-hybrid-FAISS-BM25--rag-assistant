I think the easiest way will be to just use an SQL where clause fragment via the :conditions parameter. For example: Activity.all(:conditions => ['not exists (select 1 from personal_interests where person_id = ? and activity_id = activities.id)', this_person.id]) Totally untested, and probably doesn't work exactly right, but you get the idea.
