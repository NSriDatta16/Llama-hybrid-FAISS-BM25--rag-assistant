You could think about embedding a simple HTTP server into your application running on its own thread. Maybe not be perfect but may just do what you require. See Embedded .NET HTTP Server or Simple HTTP Server Skeleton in C# as two examples. Whether this architecture is right for you is another story, but it may just allow you to server static content locally without having to worry about the security restrictions of your control. You may have some firewall issues but I would say this should be minimal as your connections are all over loopback. Hope this offers something to think about anyway....
