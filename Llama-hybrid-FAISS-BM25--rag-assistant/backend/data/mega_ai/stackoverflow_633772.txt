Automate tasks in Eclipse by buttonpress

Is there an easy way (i.e. not developing a custom plug-in) to create a button to my task bar that would run a specific Ant target? It doesn't have to be native - it's ok if it escapes to the OS shell, or other magic trickery. I'm using Eclipse Ganymede on OSX.
