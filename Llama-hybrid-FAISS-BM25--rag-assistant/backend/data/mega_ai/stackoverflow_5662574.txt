The image file is contained in the e parameter, which is an instance of the DragEventArgs class . (The sender parameter contains a reference to the object that raised the event.) Specifically, check the e.Data member ; as the documentation explains, this returns a reference to the data object ( IDataObject ) that contains the data from the drag event. The IDataObject interface provides a number of methods for retrieving the data object that you're after. You'll probably want to start by calling the GetFormats method in order to find out the format of the data that you're working with. (For example, is it an actual image or simply the path to an image file?) Then, once you've identified the format of the file being dragged in, you'll call one of the specific overloads of the GetData method to actually retrieve the data object in a particular format.
