I fully agree with Andy, and I was actually thinking of writing something similar, but then I started to wonder myself about this topic. I think we all agree that Granger causality itself really has not much to do with causality as understood in the potential outcomes framework, simply because Granger causality is more about time precedence than anything else. However, suppose there is a causal relationship between $X_t$ and $Y_t$ in the sense that the former causes the latter, and suppose that this happens along a temporal dimension with a lag of one period, say. That is, we can easily apply the potential outcomes framework to two time series and define causality in this way. The issue then becomes: while Granger causality has no "meaning" for causality as defined in the potential outcomes framework, does causality imply Granger causality in the time series context? I have never seen a discussion on this, but I think if you or any researcher wants to make a case for this, you need to impose some additional structure. Clearly, the variables need to react sluggishly, i.e. the causal relationship here must not be simultaneous but defined with a lag. Then, I think, it might be reassuring to not reject Granger causality. While this is clearly no evidence in favour of a causal relationship, if you were to claim such, then I would take the GNC test as subjective evidence.
