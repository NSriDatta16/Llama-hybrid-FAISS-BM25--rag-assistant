The questions you have are typical questions emerging in statistical tests. There are two 'flavours' of statistics out there, the frequentist and the bayesian. The frequentist answer to both of your questions its easy: NO No, you can't stop early No, you can't measure just longer Once you defined your setup, you are not allowed to even look at the data (blind analysis). From the frequentist point of view, there is no way around, no cheating no tricks! (EDIT: Of course, there are attempts to do so, and they will also work if used correctly, but most of them are known to introduce biases. ) But there is the bayesian point of view, which is quite different. The bayesian approach needs in contrast to the frequentists an additional input, the a-priori probability distribution. We can call it also previous knowledge or prejudice. Having this, we can use the data/measurement to update our knowledge to the a-posteriori probability. The point is, we can use the data and even more, we can use the data at every intermediate point of the measurement. In each update, the last posterior is our new prior and we can update it with a new measurement to our up-to date knowledge. No early stopping problem at all! I found a talk discussing quite similar like problems you have and I described above: http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/JoAnnAlvarez/BayesianAdaptivePres.pdf But beside this, are you really sure you need this at all? It seems that you have some system running deciding where to link a request. For this you don't need to proof that your decisions are correct in a statistical sense with a hypothesis test. Have you ever bought a coke, because you could exclude that pepsi is 'right' now with a probability of 95%? It's sufficient to take the one which is just better, not excluding a hypothesis. That would be a trivial algorithm: Calculate uncertainty of rate A, calculate uncertainty of B. Take the difference of both rates and divide it by the uncertainty of the difference. The result is something like the significance of the difference in sigma. Then just take all the links where there is more than two or three sigma difference. Drawback, you will never know if a single decision was statistical correct with some evidence, but in average you will have higher conversion rates.
