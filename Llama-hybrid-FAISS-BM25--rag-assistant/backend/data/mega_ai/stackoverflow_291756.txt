examine the log and minimize the amount of HTML being served per request. viewstate and bloated third party controls can ruin your application. For example we used for a long time the grid from infragistics. very very capable but even in its stripped form it made pages about 60-90k + a lot of java script. this severely limited the number of requests we could server, even on an internal gigabit connection.
