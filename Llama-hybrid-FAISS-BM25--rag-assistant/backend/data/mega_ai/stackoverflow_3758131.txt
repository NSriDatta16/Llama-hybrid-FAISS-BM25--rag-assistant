Your software can regularly ask for system time (using boost::posix_time::second_clock::local_time() ) and compare it with the last stored value. If you observe a significant negative difference, someone probably changed the system time. Beware that time can be changed on a system for legitimate reasons : the computer can be moved to another timezone, the system can be using NTP and the computer clock is ticking too fast so NTP very often sets time to an earlier value or when daylight saving time change occurs. Keep also in mind that those kind of "protection" aren't really effective in practice. If you have to store the last system date somewhere, you take the risk that someone will find where and change it to something in a far future to grant himself new licensing rights. As far as I know, there is no elegant and reliable solution to this problem.
