The paper by Chen et al "Too Many Covariates and Too Few Cases? â€“ A Comparative Study," Stat. Med 2016 Nov 10;35(25):4546-4558, available in accepted form at PubMed Central here and in journal-edited form here (if you have access) gets directly at your problem. The paper is in the context of logistic regression, but the same principles apply to survival models. Their recommendation is to keep the primary variable of interest in the model as it is, while penalizing the coefficients of the covariates as in ridge regression. With appropriate choice of a penalty, you thus reduce the effective number of predictors to minimize overfitting. With so few events, you will probably need a very high penalty, and you might have problems with the cross-validation typically used to select the penalty. Propensity scores, summarizing the associations of covariates with your "Status X," are another approach discussed by the authors. You should not rely heavily on single-predictor relationships with outcome when choosing predictors for multiple regression in survival analysis. They don't take into account correlations among the predictors and they risk missing predictors that would show significance when others are taken into account. Backward selection, carefully applied, can be OK but in your case with so few events it would probably not be very reliable. In logistic regression and in survival analysis it's important to try to incorporate all predictors that might be associated with outcome. Unlike linear regression where omitting predictors uncorrelated with the included predictors doesn't matter, omitting any predictor associated with outcome leads to omitted-variable bias in a way that diminishes the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates for the included predictors. That makes it harder to find true associations of the included predictors with outcome. There's a lovely analytic demonstration of that phenomenon for the case of probit models here ; the principle also applies to logistic and Cox regression models.
