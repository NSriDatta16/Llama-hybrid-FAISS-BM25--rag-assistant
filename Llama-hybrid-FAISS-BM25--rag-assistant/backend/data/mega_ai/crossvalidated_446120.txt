Is there an ExtraTreesClassifier-like classifier that has decision boundary function like SVM?

I'm using sklearn and I tested many models and those two worked best: Linear SVM and the ExtraTreesClassifier as binary classifiers. The ExtraTreesClassifier outperforms the Linear SVM in terms of scores: 0.92 F1 vs 0.72 F1. Unfortunately I cannot use the trained classifier as is and I need to make a threshold on the confidence of the trained classifier. This works very well with the linear SVM because it provides the decision boundary function as a confidence quantification (distance to the hyperplane). The ExtraTreesClassifier on the other hand does not provide this, even if I use the predict_prob I will only get 1 and 0 (even if I vary the min_samples_leaf). Now to my question is it possible to use a tree/forest classifier (not necessarily the ExtraTreesClassifier) and also get a proper confidence for the predictions on which I then can put threshold(s)?
