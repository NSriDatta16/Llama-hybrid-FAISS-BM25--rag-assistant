As @mpiktas points out, simple is good. But I can't help thinking there will be substantial variation among users. Roughly, we can conceive of the time to complete each question as depending on the question and on the user, so the trick is to tease out the question-specific timing factors from the experience of previous users and to estimate the user-specific timing factor from the user's experience with the questions they have already tackled. This opens up the possibilities greatly. A good answer would rely on exploratory analysis of preliminary data. In general, though, a combination of (1) determining a suitable way to express question completion times (logarithms? square roots?) and (2) robust analysis of variance techniques (such as median polish ) or IRLS regression is likely to do far better than ignoring the user-specific factors ("simple averaging"). Once you have estimated question-specific timing factors, which could be as simple as computing median or mean times per question, you could easily estimate the timing factor for a new user by comparing their times to typical times for the questions they have already attempted. For instance (this is truly simplistic, but gives the flavor of the idea) if they take twice as long to complete the first five questions as the sum of the typical completion times for those questions, you could estimate that this user will take twice as long as the average to complete the next 95 questions. You can then add the average completion times for those 95 questions and double the sum.
