The answer can be arrived at by purely counting the described events as well, although the accepted answer is more elegant . We'll consider the case of the die, and hopefully the generalization is obvious. We'll let the event space be all sequences of numbers from $\{1,2,...,6\}$ of length $6$ . Here are a few examples (chosen at random): 3 2 3 5 6 1 1 1 2 5 2 4 1 2 1 1 6 3 4 4 3 3 4 2 6 1 1 6 3 4 6 3 5 4 5 1 The point is, our space has a total of $6^6$ events, and due to independence we suppose that any one of them is as probable as the other (uniformly distributed). We need to count how many sequences have at least one $6$ in them. We partition the space we are counting by how many $6$ 's appear, so consider the case that exactly one $6$ appears. How many possible ways can this happen? The six may appear in any position (6 different positions), and when it does the other 5 postions can have any of 5 different symbols (from $\{1,2,...,5\}$ ). Then the total number of sequences with exactly one $6$ is: $ \binom{6}{1}5^5 $ . Similarly for the case where there are exactly two $6$ 's: we get that there are exactly $\binom{6}{2}5^4$ such sequences. Now it's time for fun with sums : $$ \sum_{k=1}^6 \binom{6}{k}5^{6-k} = \sum_{k=0}^6 \binom{6}{k}5^{6-k}1^k - 5^6 = (5+1)^6 - 5^6$$ To get a probability from this count, we divide by the total number of events: $$ \frac{6^6 - 5^6}{6^6} = 1 - (5/6)^6 = 1 - (1-1/6)^6 $$ I think that this generalizes pretty well, since for any $n$ other than $6$ , the exact same arguments holds, only replace each occurrence of $6$ with $n$ , and $5$ with $n-1$ . It's also worth noting that this number $5^6 = \binom{6}{0}5^6$ is the contribution of sequences in which no $6$ occurs, and is much easier to calculate (as used in the accepted answer).
