In the demo of Google Wave... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ&fmt=18 ...at 15:30 in, a group of img files are drag-and-dropped from the file system to the browser. The functionality is attributed to Google Gears. This seems a bit different from what Daniel OCallaghan and the official documentation suggest is possible. Anybody know what's actually possible w/ Google Gear and the local file system?
