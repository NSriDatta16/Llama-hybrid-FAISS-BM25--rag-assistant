In principle, you need the java.awt.dnd package. Get a DragSource , associate it with your source JLabel. Create a DropTarget, associate it with your target JLabel. Add the right listeners (DropTargetListener, DragSourceListener), and react on the method calls appropriately. Okay, seriously: Read the tutorial , try to implement it, and come back if you have more concrete problems.
