WebRequest C# 403 Error

Okay so here's what I'm doing. I'm making a request to a server to pull down a file. I do this by making a WebRequest to the website the getting the response just as you usually would, although i get a 403 error saying i don't have permissions. Problem is when i plug the URL into Google Chrome I get redirected and the file i requested comes down. I've tried the URL on other browsers and get the 403 error. What is Google Chrome doing that allows it to bypass the 403 error? I've tried using the Google Chrome User Agent, but that doesn't help me. Help
