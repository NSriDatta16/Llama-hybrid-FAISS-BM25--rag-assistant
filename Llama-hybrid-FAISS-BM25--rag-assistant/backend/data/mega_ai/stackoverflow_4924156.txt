HABTM and accepts_nested_attributes_for

Say I have two models, Book and Author with a has_and_belongs_to_many relationship between them. What I want to do is to be able to add author names in the book form, and on submit to either link the authors with the book if they already exist, or create them if they don't. I also want to do the same with the author form: add book names and on submit either link them if they exist, or create them if they don't. On edit, however, I want to neither be able to edit nor delete the nested objects, only remove the associations. Is accepts_nested_attributes_for suitable for this, or is there another way? I managed to accomplish this by following the Complex Forms railscasts on Rails 2, but I'm looking for a more elegant solution for Rails 3.
