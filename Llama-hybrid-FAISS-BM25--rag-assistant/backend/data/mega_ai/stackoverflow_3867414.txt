How to pass progress to MVC page

I have a delegate method with is called periodic while WritingAnObject uploading the file. I would like to update div (ProgressUpdate) in my MVC page with args.PercentDone value. I appreciate any idea? Thanks, //delegate method private void displayProgress(object sender, ProgressArgs args) { //Console.WriteLine(args.PercentDone); //I want to display args.PercentDone in the page } //Controller [HttpPost] public ActionResult WritingAnObject(MyViewModel bovModel) { //DoSomeStuff which is cause calling displayProgress return RedirectToAction("ListingSomeInfo", "testpart"); } //View
