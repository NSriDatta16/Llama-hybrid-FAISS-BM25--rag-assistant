Diagnose ARIMA seasonality model residual auto and partial correlation plots

I have two and half years of the weekly time series data. The seasonally period is 52 weeks. I differed the data with log transformation and feed the data into the MATLAB arima model. ARIMA('Constant', 0 ,'D', 0 ,'Seasonality', 52, 'MALags',1 ,'SMALags',52); The first plot is loged origin data and second plot is residual data. My questions: How to interpret residual data partial and auto correlations plots especillay at lag 52? The partial corr plot shows getting larger, does it indicate system going to be unstable? Does the model adequate? What can be done? Any insight will be very helpful. Thanks in advance.
