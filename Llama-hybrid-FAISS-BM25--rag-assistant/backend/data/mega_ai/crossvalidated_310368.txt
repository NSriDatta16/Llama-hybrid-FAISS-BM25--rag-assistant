Sorry that my question is a bit unorganized, but one of my question(and most confused part) is why do we want our predictors and responses variable to be symmetric or normally distributed . And after dwelling on this for two days, I think now I quite got the answer. Here is what I found is most useful: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/123252/161581 The core idea is: the log-or-power-transformed, more normally distributed variables are more likely to fulfill linear regression's assumptions , particularly linearity, homoscedasticity, and normally distributed residual. As for the reason, the quote picture in my question can answer for the linearity part. Or as @Penguin_Knight said, skewed independent variable would have some data points with very high leverage, potentially able to bias the regression slope. For others, in the link above, there are two pictures(which I copied below) that show how transformation can help to make the variance of errors more like a constant and residual plot a better look (i.e. no discernible pattern).
