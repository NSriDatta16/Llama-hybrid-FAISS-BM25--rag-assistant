Trouble understanding priors

The following comes from a book called Bayesian Statistics by Ben Lambert : Assuming the following model for $r$ disease-positive people out of $n$ people: $$Pr(Z=r, \theta) = {n\choose r}\theta^r(1-\theta)^{n-r}.$$ The probability that one disease-positive is $\theta$ and the probability that two randomly chosen individuals both have the disease is $\theta^2$ . I fully understand everything thus far. Then this is said If we assume a flat prior for $\theta$ , then this implies the decreasing prior for $\theta^2$ shown by the red line I am flummoxed. I don't even know where to begin unpacking this. Could someone lend me a hand with understanding this?
