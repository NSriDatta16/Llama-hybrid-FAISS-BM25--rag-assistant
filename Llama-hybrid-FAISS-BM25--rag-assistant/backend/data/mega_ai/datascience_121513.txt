You have a case of extreme imbalanced dataset. So until and unless you address that problem, whatever you do will not be much effective. Here are some things you can try to address data imbalance: 1.) Oversampling or Undersampling . imblearn can help you with that. 2.) Ensemble learning models : Using bagging or boosting models for imbalanced dataset. You are already using bagging model (random forest). You could also try the balancedbaggingclassifier present in imblearn library. Here is the documentation for that. Also try some boosting models like XgBoost, CatBoost etc. 3.) Choose the right metric for evaluation : You have not mentioned which evaluation metric you are using. I would suggest f1_score but you can also use precision_score and recall_score depending on your problem statement. 4.) Get more data . This might be the most effective of all. Get more data specially for the minority class which will decrease the imbalance effect.
