If you Mock a concrete class without an empty/default constructor, then Rhino Mocks is going to have to use whatever other constructors are available. Rhino is going to need you to supply the parameters for any non-empty constructors since it won't have any clue how to build them otherwise. My mistake is that I was attempting to pass nulls to the CreateMock or GenerateMock call, as soon as I generated a a non-null parameter for the constructor, the calls to create the mock or stub began working.
