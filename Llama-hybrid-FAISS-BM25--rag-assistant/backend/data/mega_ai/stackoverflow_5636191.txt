Generate permalinks on header with python markdown library

I was wondering how to generate permalinks from the following markup, using python markdown library: A header ======== A paragraph The desired output would be something like A header ¶ A paragraph Answer: Thanks @BlaXpirit ( see answer ) Use headerid python markdown extension and input the following: # A header [¶](#a-header) {#a-header} A paragraph This generates the following output: A header ¶ Then use some css styling to get the common output, something like : h1 a{visibility:hidden;} h1:hover a{visibility:visible;}
