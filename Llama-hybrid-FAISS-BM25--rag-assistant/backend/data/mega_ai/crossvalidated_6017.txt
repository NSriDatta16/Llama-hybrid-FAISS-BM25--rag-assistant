From someone who has used PCA a lot (and tried to explain it to a few people as well) here's an example from my own field of neuroscience. When we're recording from a person's scalp we do it with 64 electrodes. So, in effect we have 64 numbers in a list that represent the voltage given off by the scalp. Now since we record with microsecond precision, if we have a 1-hour experiment (often they are 4 hours) then that gives us 1e6 * 60^2 == 3,600,000,000 time points at which a voltage was recorded at each electrode so that now we have a 3,600,000,000 x 64 matrix. Since a major assumption of PCA is that your variables are correlated, it is a great technique to reduce this ridiculous amount of data to an amount that is tractable. As has been said numerous times already, the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by the variables (columns). In this case an eigenvalue represents the variance in the voltage at a particular point in time contributed by a particular electrode. So now we can say, "Oh, well electrode x at time point y is what we should focus on for further analysis because that is where the most change is happening". Hope this helps. Loving those regression plots!
