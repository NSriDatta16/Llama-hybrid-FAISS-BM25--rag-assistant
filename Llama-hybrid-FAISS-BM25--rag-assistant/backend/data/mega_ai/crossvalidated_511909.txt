Dependent variable with Poisson distribution in lavaan in R: how to deal with it?

I am planning to create a SEM model with lavaan. Most variables are normal, however, my dependent variable consists in a count of times and it has a Poisson distribution. Is there any Poisson distribution adjustment in lavaan? Another option could be to dichotomize the dependent variable, but that would mean losing information. In case, is there a logistic regression adjustment in lavaan?
