When is "controlling for" effects nonsensical?

I am not as knowledgeable about statistics as I would like and I am looking for resources to help me understand what kinds of questions are meaningful and which are nonsensical. We are developing some data analysis and transformation techniques in our lab for controlling what genomics people call " batch effects " between different data sets, understood loosely as trying to integrate these into a single data set so elements of the two sets can be directly compared. Source: https://sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/node/323 Batch effect correction is the procedure of removing variability from your data that is not due to your variable of interest (e.g. cancer type). The techniques are ad hoc and heuristic but in spite of lacking formal justification we are proceeding under the hope that they are still of practical utility. The idea is to "regress out" or "control for" the systematic differences between the two data sets, leaving only the individual variation within the data sets, so that the whole data set can be analyzed all at once and directly compare elements of the two data sets. Examples: We have data on neuron morphology from animals across different species and different parts of the brain, and we have developed a pairwise similarity score between neurons. We would like to construct a new data set which controls for morphological variation due to location in the brain, so that we can isolate the effect of species differences on morphology and identify a phylogenetic tree in this data. We have a data set on neuron morphology where the axon was present in the analysis and a data set collected using a different technology where the axon was removed and we only have the soma and dendrites. We would like to perform "batch correction" to integrate these two data sets and control for the missing axon data in one, trying to regress out the difference in morphology due to the missing axon, by modifying the similarity metric so that two cells are considered identical if one perfectly matches a fragment of another. We are trying to study the spatial distribution of proteins within cells but the cells sometimes have such different shapes that it is hard to meaningfully compare the distribution of proteins within cells. For example if the cell is undergoing mitosis then the overall cell shapes will be very dissimilar. We want to perhaps devise a geometric transformation which distorts all the cell shapes into, say, a perfect circle, and then we can compare the protein distributions within the cell without worrying about differences due to cell shape. I have concerns about these and other examples. I am not able to confidently state what exactly is the problem which is why I am asking here, but part of the problem is what seems to be implicit wishful thinking about our ability to meaningfully resolve conterfactual questions, which is a problem mentioned in this paper on misunderstanding of analysis of covariance . (However this paper addresses ANCOVA specifically and I am not sure how general the critique is meant to be.) For example Would these neurons still be morphologically dissimilar if they were taken from animals of the same species? How morphologically similar would these neurons be if we had the additional axon data that is missing for one? How similar would these protein distributions be from cells of different shapes if the underlying cells were the same shape? In each case you could argue that the question is nonsense, independently and a priori of the mathematical methods being developed here. Species contributes a core part of morphology, you can't talk about what a given neuron's morphology would look like if it came from another animal, how can we compare two neurons from different species and "control" for that difference? How can you compare a cell with missing morphological data to a cell with all morphological data and say that the cells would be similar or dissimilar if we had the additional data? The shape of the cell is an integral part of the shape of the protein distribution, how can you say "these cells have similar protein distributions if you control for their different shapes?" My specific questions are: Are the critiques I have raised justified, or am I misunderstanding the point of batch correction/statistical control? Are the problems I am pointing out actually fatal in the sense that the results to the questions will be literally nonsensical/uninterpretable, or is this kind of batch correction analysis/control/regression worth doing, at least for the sake of exploratory data analysis and forming hypotheses for further testing? My lab is very pragmatic and being a stickler and saying "this hypothesis of normal residuals/a zero skew distribution is unsatisfied, so we can't do the test" will not go over well if I cannot convincingly demonstrate or explain that the results will be genuinely nonsensical. "Well, we have no other choice, we have to be practical to get scientific results, the only alternative is to just not regress out by the covariate at all." Where can I read more about the philosophy of "batch correction", "controlling for differences", "regressing out on this" so that I can develop a better understanding of my questions raised in 1.) and 2.)?
