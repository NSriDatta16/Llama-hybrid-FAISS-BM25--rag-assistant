The nsprcomp R package provides methods for sparse Principal Component Analysis, which could suit your needs. For example, if you believe your features are generally correlated linearly, and want to select the top five, you could run sparse PCA with a max of five features, and limit to the first principal component: m Alternatively, if you want to capture the orthogonal nature of features, you can select the top feature from each of the top five PCs, limiting each PC to one feature: m An ensemble of these could be useful too; i.e., features that consistently come to the top across different methods are likely to explain a large amount of variance in the feature space. Having played around with nsprcomp a bit, it seems like the first two methods raise ~1/2 of the same features to the top. That said, optimizing this process may be an empirical effort.
