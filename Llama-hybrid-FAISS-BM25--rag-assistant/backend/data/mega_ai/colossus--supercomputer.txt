Colossus is a supercomputer developed by xAI. Construction began in 2024 in Memphis, Tennessee. It is currently believed to be the world's largest AI supercomputer. Its purpose is to train the company's chatbot, Grok, and the social media platform X. It also supports operations for Elon Musk's other companies such as SpaceX. Background Colossus was launched in September 2024 at a former Electrolux site in South Memphis to train the AI language model Grok. Reportedly, within 19 days of the project's conception, xAI was ready to begin construction. In comparison, other data centers have taken an average of four years to finalize the plans for a project, ship the equipment, and have it installed. The site was chosen because the abandoned Electrolux building could be repurposed to expedite construction. Another advantage of the site was proximity to a nearby wastewater treatment facility providing a water source. As of February 2025 xAI plans to build an $80 million facility to process additional wastewater for use at the supercomputer. xAI Musk incorporated xAI in March 2023 with the stated purpose of understanding the "nature of the universe". The team includes former members of OpenAI, DeepMind, Microsoft, and Tesla. Musk has a history of involvement in artificial intelligence; he was one of the founding members of the company OpenAI, investing up to US$45 million in 2015. He left OpenAI in 2018, reportedly to avoid conflicts of interest with his own company, Tesla. However, it has also been reported that he had made a bid for leadership at OpenAI and left when his proposal was rejected. The exact reasons for his departure with the company remain unclear. Both Dell Technologies and Supermicro partnered with xAI to build the supercomputer. It was originally powered by 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and was constructed in 122 days. 3 months after the first 100,000 GPUs were deployed, xAI announced that they had increased the system to 200,000 GPUs and that they intended to continue increasing the computer's processing power to 1 million GPUs. Colossus is currently the largest AI training platform in the world. Choice of location Musk was initially told that building a data center would take 18â€“24 months. To accelerate the project, he instead looked for a vacant facility, and this was when he found the former Electrolux factory in Memphis, Tennessee. The global appliance maker Electrolux first opened the facility in 2012, but it shut down in 2020 to relocate to Springfield, Tennessee. The center is 785,000 square feet (72,900 m2) and was previously purchased by Phoenix Investors in December 2023 for $35 million. Using an existing space rather than building one from the ground up allowed the company to begin working on the computer immediately. Tedd Townsend, Greater Memphis Chamber president and CEO, revealed to Forbes that xAI had considered seven or eight other sites before selecting Memphis, and that it took Musk about a week to finalize the decision to build in Memphis. With this finalization completed in March 2024, the construction of the supercomputer started right away. The announcement that Colossus would be built in Memphis was made during a press conference in June. The building was not the only incentive xAI had to choose Memphis. In the Greater Memphis Chamber's website, it also states that the company chose Memphis because of its "reliable power grid, ability to create a water recycling facility, proximity to the Mississippi (River) and ample land." Altogether, the city had the ability to provide the massive amounts of energy needed to run the machine. The site continues to go into detail about how the AI company would benefit from the collaboration with local organizations such as Memphis Light, Gas and Water (MLGW), Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the City of Memphis, and Shelby County. It emphasizes the importance of these partnerships, especially once the supercomputer reaches full capacity, wh
