How to detect from raw packet if it contains a HTTP Get or Post?

I have just started to do some network programming. I am using the pcap pcap.NET to get hold of network packets. My question is, can I extract from the "payload" part of the packet a HTTP Get or Post request? Does this mean I need to read individual bytes from the payload to detect if I have the specific protocol? Any guides are appreciated. Thanks.
