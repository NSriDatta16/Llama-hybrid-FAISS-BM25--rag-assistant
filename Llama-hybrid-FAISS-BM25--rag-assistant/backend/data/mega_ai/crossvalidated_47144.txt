Ordinal regression is appropriate whenever the dependent variable is ordinal: That is, when you can assume that the levels are in order, but not that the gaps between the levels are equal. If you analyze individual Likert items (each scored 1-5 or 1-7 or whatever) then this could be a very reasonable assumption. But other methods might be good too; this post on my blog might be helpful. However, if you sum a bunch (say 10) Likert items (each, say, 1-5) then your total ranges from 10 to 50 and ordinal regression, while technically correct, will be hard to implement and interpret (there would be a huge number of parameters). In this case, I suggest that OLS regression could be the default. You could, certainly, do ordinal logistic regression on each of the 10 Likert items, but then you have 10 regressions to interpret, which might lead to confusion. In any case, you should start with a bunch of graphs to see what's going on. Before summing (or otherwise combining) the Likert items, I'd also check how they relate to each other using factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha.
