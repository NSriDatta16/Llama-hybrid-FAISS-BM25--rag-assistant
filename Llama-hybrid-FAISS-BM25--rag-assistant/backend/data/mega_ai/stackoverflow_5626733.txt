Loading a view into a UIScrollView AND getting the content inside to work

I have a tab based application I am working on. I have a view controller named DetailsView.m, with an accompanying nib file called DetailsView.xib. This has a couple of UILabels in, which are linked using IBOutlet to DetailsView.m view controller. When I load this view controller/view using the tab bar controller, it works fine and the UILabels are populated dynamically. Now I want to load this entire view inside a UIScrollView instead so I can fit more content in. So I created another view controller called DetailsHolder.m with a nib file called DetailsHolder.xib, and assigned this to the tab bar controller. I wrote this code below to load the first view (DetailsView) into the UIScrollView in the second view (DetailsHolder). I wrote it in the viewDidLoad method of DetailsHolder: DetailsView* detailsView = [[DetailsView alloc] initWithNibName:@"DetailsView" bundle: nil]; CGRect rect = detailsView.view.frame; CGSize size = rect.size; [scrollView addSubview: detailsView.view]; scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(320, size.height); This correctly loads the sub view into the UIScrollView, however, the labels inside DetailsView no longer do anything. When I put an NSLog inside viewDidLoad of DetailsView - it never logs anything. It's as if I've loaded the nib ok, but its no longer associated with the view controller anymore. What am I missing here? I'm a bit of a newbie in obj C/iOS (but have many years Actionscript/Javascript knowledge. Thanks in advance, Rich Edit: Contents of DetailsView as requested: DetailsView.h: #import #import "AppModel.h" @interface DetailsView : UIViewController { IBOutlet UITextView* textView; IBOutlet UIImageView* imageView; } @end DetailsView.m #import "DetailsView.h" @implementation DetailsView - (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil { self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil]; if (self) { // Custom initialization } return self; } - (void)dealloc { [super dealloc]; } - (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning { // Releases the view if it doesn't have a superview. [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]; // Release any cached data, images, etc that aren't in use. } #pragma mark - View lifecycle - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; // Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib. } - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated { AppModel* model = [AppModel sharedInstance]; [model loadData]; int selectedLocation = [model getSelectedLocation]; NSArray *locations = [model getLocations]; NSArray *data = [locations objectAtIndex:selectedLocation]; textView.text = [data objectAtIndex: 0]; UIImage *theImage = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:[data objectAtIndex: 4] ofType:@"jpg"]]; imageView.image = theImage; } - (void)viewDidUnload { [super viewDidUnload]; // Release any retained subviews of the main view. // e.g. self.myOutlet = nil; } - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation { // Return YES for supported orientations return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait); } @end Essentially all its doing is grabbing selectedLocation (int) from a singleton (which is my model), then grabbing an array from the model, and then trying to insert an image and some text into my view. In my nib file, i have a UIImageView and a UITextView, which I have linked to the two IBOutlets declared in DetailsView.h
