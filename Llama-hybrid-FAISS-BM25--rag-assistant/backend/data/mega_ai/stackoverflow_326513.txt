That will be awfully lot of information no matter which way you look at it. 400,000,000 grid cells will take their toll. I see two ways of going around this. Firstly, since it is a web-based game, you might be able to get a server with a decently sized HDD and store the 400M records in it just as you would normally. Or more likely create some sort of your own storage mechanism for efficiency. Then you would only have to devise a way to access the data efficiently, which could be done by taking into account the fact that you doubtfully will need to use it all at once. ;) The other way would be some kind of compression. You have to be careful with this though. Most out-of-the-box compression algorithms won't allow you to decompress an arbitrary location in the stream. Perhaps your terrain data has some patterns in it you can use? I doubt it will be completely random. More likely I predict large areas with the same data. Perhaps those can be encoded as such?
