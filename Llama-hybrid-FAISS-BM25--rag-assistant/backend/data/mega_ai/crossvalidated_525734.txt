I don't think you need any statistical test. You have five values. Three are positive; two are negative. There are fewer negative tests, but their absolute value (on average) is bigger. About half the time, the accuracy goes up; the other half, it goes down. What more is there to say? (As is often the case, the word "significant" obscures clear thinking.)
