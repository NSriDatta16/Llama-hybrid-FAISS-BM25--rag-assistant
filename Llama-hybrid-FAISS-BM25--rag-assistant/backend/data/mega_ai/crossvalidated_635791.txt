It seems like a mixed model is in order, for instance implemented via the lme4 package in R. Since the main interest is in comparing individuals, we make the individual effects as a fixed effect, and model the different tasks via random effects. The information given in the comments indicate that interaction via individuals and tasks is not expected (interactions would also be difficult to estimate). So within logistic regression we model the probabilities $p_{im}$ ( $i$ indexing individuals, $m$ indexing tasks) as $$ \operatorname{logit}(p_{im}) = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_m $$ where $\alpha_i$ is fixed effects and $\beta_m$ are random variables with expectation zero. In R we can do something like library(lme4) mod0
