The sum of n Bernoulli(p) random variables is a binomial(n, p) random variable. $p \cdot q = p \cdot (1-p)$ the variance of a Bernoulli random variable with a mean of p. Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. It is maximized when $p=q = \frac{1}{2}$ , so failure and success are equally likely:
