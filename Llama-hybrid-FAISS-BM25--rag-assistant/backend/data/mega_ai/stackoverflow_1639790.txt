Processing large images with Delphi for saving as .jpeg

In Delphi 7, I have a library that uses the TCanvas component to output some information. The resulting image is about 4800*6000 pixels and I would like to print it and save it as .jpeg . To achieve this, I created a TBitmap and gave its Canvas as parameter to the library and then I assigned the bitmap to the jpeg. Apparently, this is taking too much memory, because I am getting an exception when trying to set the bitmap's width and height, saying "Not enough storage is available to process this command." // output to printer Printer.BeginDoc(); doPrint(Printer.Canvas); Printer.EndDoc(); // output in bmp.Canvas bmp := TBitmap.Create; bmp.Width := Printer.PageWidth; bmp.Height := Printer.PageHeight; // What am I doing wrong? Could I save Printer.Canvas directly as a .jpeg file? Edit: Updated image size approximation from 2000*2000 to 4800*6000
