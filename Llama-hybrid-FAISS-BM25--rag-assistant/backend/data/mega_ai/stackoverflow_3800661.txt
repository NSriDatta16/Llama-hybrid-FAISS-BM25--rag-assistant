How does OS locate contents on disk that have not been loaded into memory when page fault exception is raised?

When a page fault exception is raised because the content CPU is trying to access have not been loaded in to memory, how does the OS locate the missing content on the secondary storage (e.g. hard disk)? Thanks for your explanation in advance. -ivan
