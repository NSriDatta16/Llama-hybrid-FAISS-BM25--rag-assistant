I agree with RageZ; it is not hard to write the server side in C. There is an 'old' CGI library by Eugene Eric Kim: http://www.eekim.com/software/cgihtml/index.html Given its age, it likely does not have a heap of dependencies on other stuff. With a CGI, it is rather easy to put your script on some path, say /my/service and then dispatch on the PATH_INFO environment variable which will give you whatever is appended to the context path. Thus /my/service/a/b would yield /a/b If you need high performance and can afford the foot-print, you could also use Apache and write a module (which is also not particularly hard). But FastCGI would of course also perform very well. Jan
