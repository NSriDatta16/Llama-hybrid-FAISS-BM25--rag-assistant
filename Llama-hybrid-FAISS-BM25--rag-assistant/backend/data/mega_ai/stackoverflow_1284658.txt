Figured it out. Basically the center div is lowered because the contents of the divs are getting baselined at the bottom. See how they have a common bottom? The center div has one less paragraph. Add another paragraph and the problem goes away. Easy fix: div.one div {display: inline-block; height:100%; vertical-align: top;} Add a vertical align. It's probably defaulting to vertical-align: baseline because it's inline. Note: display: inline-block is only supported in FF3+, IE8+, Opera and Chrome . An alternative implementation with better cross-browser support involves floating the inner divs. This requires slight modification to get the margins you want though.
