How to Visualize Integrated Risk in a GMM with the Defined Risk Function

In my Bayesian decision theory research within a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) framework, I've come across the need to visualize the integrated risk function, especially in the context of two components. The risk function is defined as follows: $$ c(x) = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} P_{Z|X}(z|x) \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} P_{S|XZ}(s|xz) d(s, \hat{s}(x, z)). $$ or $$ c'(x) = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} P_{Z|X}(z|x) \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} \ln(P_{S|XZ}(s|xz)) d(s, \hat{s}(x, z)). $$ where: ( $c(x)$ ) is the risk for observation ( $x$ ), ( $ \mathcal{Z} $ ) is the set of all possible outcomes for another observation ( $ z $ ), ( $ \mathcal{S} $ ) is the set of all possible decisions ( $ s $ ), ( $ P_{Z|X}(z|x) $ ) is the conditional probability of ( $ z $ ) given ( $ x $ ), $ P_{S|XZ}(s|x,z)=\frac { P_{S}(s) P_{Z|SX}(z|s,x)}{\sum \limits_{\tilde {s} \in {\mathcal{ S}} } P_{S}(\tilde {s}) P_{Z|SX}(z|\tilde {s},x)}.$ ( $ P_{S|XZ}(s|xz) $ ) is the conditional probability of decision ( $ s $ ) given both ( $ x $ ) and ( $ z $ ), ( $ d(s, \hat{s}(x, z)) $ ) is the loss function comparing the true decision ( $ s $ ) and the estimated decision ( $ \hat{s} $ ) based on ( $ x $ ) and ( $ z $ ). (could be quadratic, or 0-1 but I'm open to suggestions if another loss function might be more appropriate.) I'm currently examining the implications of different loss functions ( $ d $ ) and decision rules ( $ \hat{s} $ ), particularly in relation to the two parameters of the GMM (let's denote them as ( $ x $ ) and ( $ y $ )), and a single observation ( $ z $ ). My objective is to compute and plot the integrated risk while averaging over all ( $ z $ ) and the decision space ( $\mathcal{S}$ ). Given the multi-dimensional nature of this problem, I would appreciate guidance on: Appropriate loss functions and decision rules for this context. Practical approaches to compute the integrated risk ( $ r(\pi, \delta) $ ) considering the defined risk function ( $ c(x) $ ). Numerical methods suitable for high-dimensional integration, possibly Monte Carlo techniques. Insights from the community on the simulation and visualization strategies for ( $r(\pi, \delta)$ ) would be invaluable.
