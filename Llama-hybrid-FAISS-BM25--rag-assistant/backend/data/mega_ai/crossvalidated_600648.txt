Correlating two measurements of a population with different number of unpaired observations

I have eight types of materials Mat1 to Mat8 (produced with different production parameters). From these eight populations I have measurements of a material property X which is easy to measure and measurements of Y which is harder and costlier to measure but is the property that we're interested in. The idea is that X is related to Y and that by measuring we can estimate Y and avoid (at least partly) doing the direct measurement of Y. The problem is that the measurements $x_i$ , $y_i$ are not paired, and as a matter of fact there are much more sample values of X available than of Y. This situation I tried to illustrate with the following histograms. If the measurements were paired I could try a regression Y=f(X) but it's not the case. I can try to compare the eight population averages $\bar x$ with $\bar y$ , but then I lose the information about the sample variance of each population and can't compute confidence intervals. Is there some statistical tool which I can use in this case to correlate these two measurements of a population with different number of unpaired observations??
