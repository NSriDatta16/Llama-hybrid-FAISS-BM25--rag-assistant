Data normalization with preference to a number size

I understand that data normalization allows us to take data and place it on a scale of [0,1]. Currently I'm working through a machine learning book and the author talks about normalizing data with preference to smaller or larger numbers. Is there a formula in general to normalize data like this? As an example, if I want smaller values to be closer to 1 than larger values is there a general formula to do this?
