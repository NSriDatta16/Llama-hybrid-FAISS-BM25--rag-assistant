Can a time series model be improved when the residuals are white noise?

For a weekly time series, I have been trying some very basic models to get an understanding of time series analysis. The models I tried so far: naive, seasonal naive, an overall mean model, and a simple exponential smoothing (SES) model. My objective is getting a reasonably accurate forecast. In the end I have to model 2000+ time series, so I would not have time to check every ACF plot, residuals, etc. The naive and the SES model seem to both do a reasonable job, in the sense that the residuals are white noise. Edit: As pointed out in the comments by @BryanKrause, this means that the model cannot be improved. Three (related) questions to this: How to differentiate between the complexer model (SES) vs the simpler model (naive) when in both cases the residuals are white noise? The RMSE is very similar. If I use the Ljung-Box test to check if the residuals are white noise, could it then still be that my series is non-stationary? (aside from sampling error) I am using the fpp2 package in R and my code is really basic (see below). I am sorry for not providing sample data. y $weekly_sales, start = c(min(data$ Year)), frequency = 52) #weekly_sales = the weekly sales data to be modelled train
