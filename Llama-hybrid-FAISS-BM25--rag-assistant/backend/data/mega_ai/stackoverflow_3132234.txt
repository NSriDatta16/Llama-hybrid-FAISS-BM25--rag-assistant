Magento code is open source, meaning you can take a look at it any time. I worked with Magento for 3 months and I didn't notice any pingbacks and generally in open source projects developers avoid pingbacks. Especially in a eCommerce environment this could be a security breach and a potential source of information leakage. I assume Magento data are estimates and not real data provided by any monitoring tools in the code. Magento is using OSL licence.
