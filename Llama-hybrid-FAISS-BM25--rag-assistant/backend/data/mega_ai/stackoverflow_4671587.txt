AjaxControlToolkit ReorderList stopped working

I am using the AjaxControlToolkit reorderlist. all was working well. then i upgraded the website to .net 4 and visual studio 2010. Now the reorder is no longer working. I did some searching and it was suggested to upgrade to the latest version of ajaxtoolcontrol toolkit. I've put the dll into and it's version 4.1.40412.2. I've checked the references for the website and it reads that is is version 4.1.40412.0. When i run the page, i am not able to drag the icon for the row. Was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. ' /> ' Text="[Edit]" />
