Bryant hit on it. One thing you might consider if all you're doing is customizing the existing control is embedding an instance of the calendar on your user control and exposing the properties you need from it. This way your user control can handle all of the requisite customizations, and also provide only a limited interface back out to the consuming application. (This is composition instead of inheritance.) If you really do need to fully derive from asp:Calendar, then you need to create a standard class which derives from the Calendar control, and then perform your customizations. You'll have no UI design for that, however -- everything you do will need to be custom code. (And if you need to change the HTML being emitted, you'll need to write those custom streams out as well -- which, with a calendar control, could be painful.)
