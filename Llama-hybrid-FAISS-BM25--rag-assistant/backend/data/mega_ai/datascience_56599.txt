Pls. refer Pattern recognition and Machine Learning for details - section 1.6: Information Theory. Left graph is Information ( events ) vs Probability . And the right graph is Expected Information /( Uncertainity ) vs Probability . If we look carefully at the left graph; the variation at either extremes of the curve dies down, representing less change. Translated in current context, it means not much Information flows-in at extremes. Staying with the left curve, it's somewhere in the middle (45-degree, from vertex) where there's relatively more "meat" in the sense that more change happens/ translated, more information flows-in . Same thing is shown by the right curve: at two extremes, Change/ Expected Information is low at extremes , and highest at centre . A crude Graph using Excel:
