In linear regression, you predict the target variable $y$ using a model that is based on a linear function of the predictors $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_k$ $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_2 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k + \varepsilon $$ In logistic regression, the target variable is binary, and you are trying to predict probability of "success" $p(y=1)$ using a linear predictor $\eta$ passed through the link function $\sigma$ (logistic function is the most common choice ), i.e. $$ \eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_2 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k \\ p(y=1) = \sigma(\eta) $$ So both can be functions of a single, or multiple variables. The differences are that the target variable differs (values on real line vs binary), and logistic regression, as other generalized linear models , uses a link function.
