I write code so that it's easy to understand and maintain. I then profile. If there's a bottleneck that's where I devote my attention. If it's in something like you've described I'll attack the problem in a different manner. Until then, I love the "sugar." It saves me the trouble of writing things out or thinking hard about it.
