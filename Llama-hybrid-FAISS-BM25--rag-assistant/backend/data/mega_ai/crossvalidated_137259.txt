This looks like a possible approach. CCA will find pairs of vectors $(\mathbf w, \mathbf v)$ such that projections $\mathbf X \mathbf w$ and $\mathbf Y \mathbf v$ have maximal possible correlations (the pairs will be ordered in the order of decreasing correlations). Projection vectors are normalized such that the variance of $\mathbf X \mathbf w$ and of $\mathbf Y \mathbf v$ is equal to $1$. This means that projections are not only correlated, but "on the same scale" and hence can be directly compared. Some things to keep in mind is that: (1) you can only center your test data with the mean of the training data; (2) in high dimensions CCA is prone to overfitting and it will be a good idea either to use regularized CCA or to preprocess the data with PCA. Here is a very simple Matlab script implementing this approach: % // Using Fisher Iris data. % // X will be petal measurements, Y will be sepal measurements load fisheriris trainN = 75; %// using half of the data for training and half for testing centerTrain = mean(meas(1:trainN,:)); X = bsxfun(@minus, meas(:,1:2), centerTrain(1:2)); Y = bsxfun(@minus, meas(:,3:4), centerTrain(3:4)); % // This computes CCA on the training data [A,B,r] = canoncorr(X(1:trainN,:), Y(1:trainN,:)); % // Projecting the test data Xtestpr = X(trainN+1:end, :) * A; Ytestpr = Y(trainN+1:end, :) * B; % // Loop over all train samples correct = 0; for i=1:size(Xtestpr,1) % // Using only the first CCA projection, find the sample in Y % // closest to the one in X. Euclidean distance is used as a % // similarity measure. [~, ind] = min(sum((Xtestpr(i,1) - Ytestpr(:,1)).^2, 2)); % // if classified correctly if ind==i correct = correct+1; end end %// compute the probability that so many correct matchings %// could be obtained by chance pval = 1 - binocdf(correct-1, size(Xtestpr,1), 1/size(Xtestpr,1)); %// compute confidence interval on correct matching rate [~, cinf] = binofit(correct, size(Xtestpr,1)); This gives me $6$ correct classifications out of $75$, which does not sound like a lot, but still is clearly significant with a p-value of $0.0005$. Confidence interval on matching probability is $(0.03, 0.17)$.
