The main difference between the two is in their assumption of the distribution of $y$ . Poisson regression assumes that $y$ is the result of a count, but it can also handle rates. Beta regression assumes that $y$ is distributed according to Beta distribution. In Poisson regression, the coefficients represent the logarithm of the ratio of the mean count for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable. In Beta regression, the coefficients represent the logarithm of the ratio of the mean proportion for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable. It sounds like they both may be valid in your case. Regarding your second question: What if I wanted to run a regression to see whether the dominant fruit in the basket also has the most dots? So for instance, in some baskets, apples dominate, while in other baskets, oranges dominate. So instead of apples vs. oranges, I would instead look at dominant vs. non-dominant fruit. â€“ In that case, you may want to reparametrize your regression. Your current definition isn't clear, as you did not define what is dominant nor what "has the most dots" mean. Do you mean that if there are more oranges than apples in a basket, THEN oranges on average have more dots? or if there are more oranges than apples in a basket, THEN it is more likely that the fruit with the most dots in the basket is an orange?
