First, check out SubSonic's BatchQuery functionality--it might help alleviate alot of the stress in the first cut without getting into material modification of your code. You can schedule trace jobs/dumps from the SQL server's end of things. You can also run perfmon counters to see how many database requests the app is serving. All that said, I'd try and encourage the customer to move the database (or a mirrored copy of the database) closer to your app. It is probably the cheapest solution in the long term, depending on how thick the app is.
