Javascript Efficiency with Constants passed as Parameters?

I have a general JavaScript question. I'll give you my scenario and then ask you the question. Scenario I am making a table with (currently) over 3000 rows , and it is growing by 5-10 every day. I am using a javascript plugin to style this table and add useful functionality. It currently takes 15 seconds to fully load the page, after which everything runs smoothly (sorting, paging, etc.). That is a very slow initial load, though. The plugin offers a way with less DOM parsing, where you pass it an array of the information to be placed inside the table, which I am very intrigued by. However, I want to make this as fast as possible, because there will still be an array of 3000 rows (each with 11 columns of, on average, 10 characters). Question Would it be significantly faster to use a JavaScript const to store this giant array? Specifically, does JavaScript know not to put a const on the stack when passed as a parameter? Furthermore, is this simply too much for JavaScript to handle? Should I dismiss this idea and start with AJAX now (which would mean much slower functionality but much faster pageload)? Thanks!
