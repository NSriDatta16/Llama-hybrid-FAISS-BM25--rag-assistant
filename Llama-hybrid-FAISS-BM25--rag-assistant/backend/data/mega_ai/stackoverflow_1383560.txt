There is no such thing as hacker proof. Sorry. EDIT FOR COMMENT: The unfortunate truth is that no matter what barricade you put in the way, if the honestly want in, they'll get in. Simply because if they're persistent enough they'll be looking at your code from an Assembly level. Not a thing on earth you can do about it. What you can look at doing is Obfuscating code, packing the jar and merging all externals packages into a single to make life harder. However no matter how high the hurdle, my comment in the previous paragraph still applies.
