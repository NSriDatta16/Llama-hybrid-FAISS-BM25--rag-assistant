I am not sure about heroku but to answer your question about Rackspace cloudFiles, there is no block storage exposed by cloudfiles but just an API to upload/retrieve/etc... the files. There is thought some fuse wrapper that would expose your cloud files as a filesystem at least on Linux/Macosx : https://github.com/redbo/cloudfuse/ there is JungleDisk as well which is tighten to cloudfiles but it's a whole complete infrastructure.
