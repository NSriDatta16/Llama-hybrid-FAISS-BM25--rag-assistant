Change date format (in DB or output) to dd/mm/yyyy - PHP MySQL

MySQL stores the date in my database (by default) as 'YYYY-MM-DD' The field type for my date is 'DATE' (I do not need any time storage).. Is there a simple way to change it by default to DD/MM/YYYY ? I call up different dates in 2 different tables, and no where in any of my code do I have anything resembling a date variable or anything! Hopefully this is a straight forward change?
