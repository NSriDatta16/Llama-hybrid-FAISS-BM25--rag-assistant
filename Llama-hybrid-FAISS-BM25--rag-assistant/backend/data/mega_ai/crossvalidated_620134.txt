In factor VAE, do you freeze the discriminator weights during the back propagation step for the FVAE loss?

In factor vae, Disentangling by Factorising , there are two losses that are minimized. One is the VAE loss (eq. 2 in the paper) that includes (1) reconstruction loss, (2) KL divergence and (3) Total correlation loss, which is obtained by using a discriminator network which itself is trained via the minimization of the Discriminator loss . Should the discriminator network weights be frozen while performing backpropagation to minimize the VAE loss ?
