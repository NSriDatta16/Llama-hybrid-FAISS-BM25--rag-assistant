As I stated in a comment - your lambda expression doesn't return anything. Therefore it can't be used in a projection. Select is meant to transform a sequence of items of one type into a sequence of items of another type. You're not doing any transforming in your lambda expression - you've just got an assignment. Now you could do this: Enumerable.Range(0, objEntityCode.Count - 1).Select(i => { return options.Attributes[i] = new EntityCodeKey { EntityCode = objEntityCode[i].EntityCodes, OrganizationCode = Constants.ORGANIZATION_CODE }; }) .ToArray(); I wouldn't recommend it though. I appreciate you're currently learning about LINQ and lambda expressions, but it's worth learning when not to use them too - and this looks like a situation where you really, really shouldn't use them.
