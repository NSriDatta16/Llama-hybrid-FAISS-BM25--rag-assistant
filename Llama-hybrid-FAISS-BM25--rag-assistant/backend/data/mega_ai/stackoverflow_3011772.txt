Reading Character from Image

I am working on an application which requires matching of numbers from a scanned image file to database entry and update the database with the match result. Say I have image- employee1.jpg. This image will have two two handwritten entries - Employee number and the amount to be paid to the employee. I have to read the employee number from the image and query the database for the that number, update the employee with the amount to be paid as got from the image. Both the employee number and amount to be paid are written inside two boxes at a specified place on the image. Is there any way to automate this. Basically I want a solution in .net using c#. I know this can be done using artificial neural networks. Any ideas would be much appreciated.
