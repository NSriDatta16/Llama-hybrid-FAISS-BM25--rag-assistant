There is some interesting meta research on this topic in regards to high impact academic papers. Schilling and Green (2011) came up with a few models describing what makes a paper high impact. For a direct look at tweets, there is the Jenders et al. (2013) paper that uses machine learning to predict viral tweets. I believe they used a naive bayes model. Those two papers, and looking at what work has cited them, should give you a really good start on the modeling techniques used to look at high impact pieces of literature/media.
