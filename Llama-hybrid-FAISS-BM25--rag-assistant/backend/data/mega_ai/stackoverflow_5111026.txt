Raster image drawing software/library with deepzoom

I'm looking for a raster image drawing software with an "infinite" zoom capability like the image viewer SeaDragon(YouTube-link) . Or, alternatively, a library (in any language) with which one could build such a drawing software. I want to draw images without having to think about resolution, being able to add ("infinite") detail wherever I feel like it.
