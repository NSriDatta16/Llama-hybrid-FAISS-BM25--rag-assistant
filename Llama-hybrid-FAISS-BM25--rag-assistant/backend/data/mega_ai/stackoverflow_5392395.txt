I need to get a query of data from a large table where I can compare like items with their tax rates

I have a table that has itemno (item number of product) and tax_rate that is in up to 321 stamp groups. The stamp groups are for differing tax rates in cities, counties, and states. I need to make a query that will show me the tax_rate and stamp_group for each itemno. Since there are multiple rows with each itemno, I want to organize my query so it will show the itemno on the left and the stampgroup across the top and then the tax_rate in the table. I want to export to an excel spreadsheet to provide to my compliance department so they can scan like items and insure that tax rates are correct. Thank you in advance for any assistance!
