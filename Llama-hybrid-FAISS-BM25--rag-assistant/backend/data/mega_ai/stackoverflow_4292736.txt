I would suggest to use sortables, because its somehow the same like draggables and droppables on both div's. It's not very diffcult with sortables, there is an receive-event. Observe this event and count the li's inside #selected, if there are more than allowed, you are able to cancel the current sorting. Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/doktormolle/K7kDz/
