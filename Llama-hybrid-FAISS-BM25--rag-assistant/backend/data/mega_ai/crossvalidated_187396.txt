Deep learning - unsupervised vs. supervised shape recognition

I am trying to use a deep learning approach to recognize and measure the size of elephants tusks. I have a large database with elephant pictures. I understand that, if i would have labelled data, that i could potentially train a deep neural net to classify tusks. However, would i also be able to use a fully unsupervised approach to "learn" a tusk feature (and especially the contours / borders) of the elephant tusks (e.g. stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines)? I can imagine that a stacked-RBM might learn a higher-level feature that might represent the elephant tusk. However - i am struggling to see how one would "extract" this feature from the RBM - so that ideally one could use it for further calculations (e.g. to determine the size of each tusk) in each picture? Any intuition or literature references much appreciated! (picture of elephant included per below for reference)
