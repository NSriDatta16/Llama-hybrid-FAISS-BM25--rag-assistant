Is REST a good choice for GUI web applications?

GUI based web applications could be build upon a GUI component, stateful framework like Wicket or they could build in a RESTful, stateless way with GUI status only on the client. From a technical point of view REST looks like the right way since it leverages the full power of http and leads to highly scalable applications. But that comes at a price. Complex GUIs will require a JavaScript application on the client in many cases. You have to stay on the same page and reload only parts, if state should be maintained on the client. Or you have to use tricks with hidden iframes. Sometimes there are pseudo resource like shopping carts on the server, to enable a RESTful design. You have to maintain intermediate state of multi step dialogues and so on ... If I look around there are very few RESTful GUI webapplications. Is this because of historical reasons or is a RESTful design unproductive in common scenarios?
