USB file transfer on iOS

I want to write an app that stores its data in a file that can be retrieved and transfered to the user's PC. Does the iOS support file transfers over USB (through my app or through a mass storage device type feature). Preferably, I do not want to write a client for the PC to receive the files, and I want to prompt the user about new files when they plug in their device to their PC if possible. Do the iOS frameworks support these features?
