"If a multilayer perceptron has a linear activation function in all neurons,..." Most neural networks do not use linear activation functions. Most use non-linear activation functions such as logistic sigmoid functions. Neural networks using non-linear transfer function will be able to implement non-linear tasks such as XOR functions. Hope this helps
