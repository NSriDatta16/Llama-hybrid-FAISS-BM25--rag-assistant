Flask/Bottle project organization

I've been looking into microframeworks for Python, and have come across two interesting options, Flask and Bottle. each have some similar features. One thing I noticed is that all the example sites show all the application code located inside a single Python file. Obviously, for even moderately sized sites, this would become difficult to manage quite quickly. Do either (or both) of these frameworks support being broken up among different files, and if so how would that be accomplished? I'm familiar with Django, and like how its a little more structured, but i would rather use something more lightweight, but still powerful.
