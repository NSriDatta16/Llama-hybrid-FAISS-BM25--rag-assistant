Only allow positive MCMC-samples: Implications for credible interval

We calculate a Bayesian model and only expect positive values for our parameters. Our prior is however a uniform priorâ€”we get negative samples from MCMC. For Bayes-factor calculations we use the Savage-Dickey density ratio . In order to account for the restriction to positive values, we normalize the positive area of prior and posterior distribution so they each have an area of one and calculate the density ratio. Question: what does this mean for our credible interval? At the moment we use the interval calculated by JAGS. But JAGS doesn't know about our restriction. I suppose the credible interval changes when discarding all negative samples? How should we calculate the correct credible interval? Thanks a lot!
