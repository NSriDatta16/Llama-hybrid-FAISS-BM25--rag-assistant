I have no experience in this regard. I will post this possibly-helpful guess anyway. ZeroMQ offers point-to-point messaging, including with various types of network topologies. Messages consist of arbitrary binary values - so you will just need a binary serialization format for your structured messages. BSON , ProtoBuffers , and BERT offer serialization of arbitrary data structures (numbers, strings, sequential arrays, associative arrays) into binary values. GitHub invented BERT for fast RCP; BSON was invented by MongoDB (or 10gen) for the same reason; and ProtoBuffers likewise by Google.
