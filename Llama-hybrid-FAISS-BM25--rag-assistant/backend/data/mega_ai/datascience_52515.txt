K means visualisation after reducing dimensionality with PCA

In clustering ( $K$ means, for example) when I have $N$ features and after creating the model (with this $N$ features) to visualize this model I need to reduce this $N$ dimensions into $2$ or $3$ dimensions, let's say I will use (PCA) fro example. My question is how I can analyze the results (grape with principal component)? this is simple example : Data without reducing : AGE,GENDER,SPENT,SALARY,CAR,..... Data after reducing dimension: Principal Component $1$ , Principal Component $2$ , Principal Component 3 what do PC1,PC2,PC3 means
