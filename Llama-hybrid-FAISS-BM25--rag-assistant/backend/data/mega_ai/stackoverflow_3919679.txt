To the extent of my knowledge, your CSS sheet plays a minimal role in SEO, what is more important is your HTML markup and execution. Following the order of ' - ' for your heading tags, with accompanying ' ' tags instead of ' ' or similar approaches is what will effect a web crawlers ability to recognise and prioritise the content in your page. While you can use CSS to hide paragraph that you only want to appear in search engines and similar techniques it has little importance compared to the HTML structure.
