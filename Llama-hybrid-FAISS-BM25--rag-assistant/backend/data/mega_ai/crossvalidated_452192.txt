Median is a measure of central tendency and defined as the middle point on a sorted array. Usually, there are outliers in your data, e.g. very high/low valued samples. In case you do not make any weighting on these samples during averaging, they will seriously affect the mean value. In contrast, since it operates on sorted data, median is robust against outliers. You can verify this as median values of $[1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[1,2,3,4,10]$ are identical.
