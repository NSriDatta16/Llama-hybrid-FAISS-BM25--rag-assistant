Answer: Based on your description, I think that your assessment is correct: betareg() cannot estimate all coefficients because there are some factor combinations that do not occur. This is currently not captured by betareg() and thus the user needs to handle it. One way of doing so would be to set up the interaction manually: data The interaction(year, age) sets up all possible combinations and then the application of factor() reduces it to those combinations that actually occur in data . Afterwards you can do: betareg(eccentricity ~ year_age, data = data) Additional remark: The empirical distributions you show do not look like beta distributions but rather like a mixture of different beta distributions with different mean and precision parameters. Ideally, these different means/precisions would be explained by the observed covariates. I would encourage you to explore more model specifications, in particular including covariate effects for the precision parameter as well. If this does not suffice, possibly a finite mixture model of beta regressions might help. See: Gr√ºn, Kosmidis, Zeileis (2012).
