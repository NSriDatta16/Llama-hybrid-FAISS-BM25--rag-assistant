google maps api V3 - MarkerClusterer combine with Infobubble

I'm looking for a way to combinate the MarkerClusterer from google-maps-utility-library-v3 with the Infobubbles. My idea is to show the Infobubbles only when the icon is unclusted (visible). And maybe see a summary for each clustericon with Infobubbles. Unfortunately I didn't find any possibility to control that Infobubbles is only visible after the unclustering. Maybe someone has an idea or an approach how to achieve this? Thank you Robert
