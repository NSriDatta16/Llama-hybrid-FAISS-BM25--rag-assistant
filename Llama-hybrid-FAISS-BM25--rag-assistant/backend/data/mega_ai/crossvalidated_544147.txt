Comment. I put 'My sample has standard deviation 4 and variance 16' into Google translate and got French translation 'Mon échantillon a un écart type de 4 et une variance de 16.' Of the various languages I have tried in Google translate, French performs best on technical terminology. I understand Google translate for French is based in part on extensive Canadian government documents available in both languages. If I write a long complicated paragraph for one of my answers here, I often run it through Google translate for French or German to see if the fundamental meaning is preserved. If not, I try to simplify the paragraph. IMHO, Google translate does not work quite as well for technical German as for technical French. Not that I claim to be exactly fluent in either.
