You need some grounding first in order to actually create a programming language. I strongly suggest picking up a copy of Programming Language Pragmatics , which is quite readable (much more so than the Dragon book ) and suitable for self study. Once you are ready to start messing with parsers, ANTLR is the "gold" standard for parser generators in terms of usability (though flex+bison/yacc are quite capable).
