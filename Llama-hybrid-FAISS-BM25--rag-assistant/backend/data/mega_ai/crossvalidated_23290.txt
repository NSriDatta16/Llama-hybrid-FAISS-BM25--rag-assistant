The overlap of two 95% confidence intervals does not in itself indicate lack of an effect at the 0.05 level. Just touching error bars is usually about 0.01 probability assuming null (depending on the similarity of the bars). You can get an idea of whether the difference between the two AUCs is significant or not if you take the average CI width between the two points and multiply it by sqrt(2). If that is less than the difference then there is an effect at the 0.05 level.
