I ended up moving the hierarchy to an assembly table because I had to store more than just parent/child relationships. Doing so also meant I could dump the DynamicData control and use a more user-intuitive TreeView with drag-n-drop server-side events (ComponentArt). Because of the nature of the control, no item could be it's own parent so the problem was moot. Wow, 7 months is a long time in my first experience with Entity Framework :)
