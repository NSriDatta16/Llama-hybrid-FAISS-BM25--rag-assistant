I assume you will report weighted averages or proportions. Usually weights are based on a reference population,eg, the United States or New York City. This basis for weights should be reported. Usually, the total sample size should be reported. Subsample sizes, eg, women over 65, are not usually informative and would overload your tables. You might want to only report statistics if the underlying number of respondents meets a reasonable minumum, eg 40 respondents.
