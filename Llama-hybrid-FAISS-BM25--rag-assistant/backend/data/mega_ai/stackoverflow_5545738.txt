Three are 2 kinds of local storages - one belongs to extension itself (can be accessed only from a background page, popup page or any page bundled into extension package), another one belongs to the site (can be accessed only from a content script). So if you need to access local storage value that was set in a popup from a content script, you need to send a request to a background page, read the value there, and send it back to a content script. How to do that is explained in Message Passing doc.
