python/genshi newline to html paragraphs

I'm trying to output the content of a comment with genshi, but I can't figure out how to transform the newlines into HTML paragraphs. Here's a test case of what it should look like: input: 'foo\n\n\n\n\nbar\nbaz' output: foo bar baz I've looked everywhere for this function. I couldn't find it in genshi or in python's std lib. I'm using TG 1.0.
