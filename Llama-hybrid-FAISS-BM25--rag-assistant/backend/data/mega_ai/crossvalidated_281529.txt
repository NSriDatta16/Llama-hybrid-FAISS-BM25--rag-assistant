OLS with Time Series Data - yay or nay?

I want to model the relationship between two (time-series) variables by using a Vector Autoregressive model (VAR). Since I am not entirely familiar with time series analysis yet, the following question came up in my mind: Is it a good idea to simply model the relationship of the variables by using OLS? I thought it might be a good starting point when writing a text in which I analyze relationships of certain variables, before diving into the more serious analysis. Do you guys think it is a good idea? Or is it rather a no-go (I am asking this since I once heared that OLS is not sophisticated enough for time series analysis)? Do I have to carefully consider something before applying OLS? Thanks in advance!
