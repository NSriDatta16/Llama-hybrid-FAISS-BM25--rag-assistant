sIFR.useStyleCheck weirdness in Safari 4 and Opera

So, I'm using sIFR (version 3, revision 436) to replace elements in my navigation, and everything is beautiful. But when I turn on sIFR.useStyleCheck to detect the CSS load, everything goes wonky in Safari 4. By wonky, I mean that it seems like the inserted dummy div lingers with its 42px left margin, and it throws off the sIFR'd text so that it's not in the correct horizontal position or doesn't wrap when it's supposed to, etc. I also get a horizontal scroll bar in my browser window, which is always fun. But, if I resize the browser window, everything repaints and is fine again. I know this doesn't happen in Firefox. It does appear to affect Opera. Haven't tested in Safari 3 yet. God knows what will happen when I fire it up in IE, but I'm guessing it'll actually be OK, since Mark (Wubben) says that the sIFR.useStyleCheck is mainly to improve performance in Safari and Opera. Any suggestions? I looked for a way to force a repaint, but couldn't figure it out. It would not be a very elegant solution though if I did.
