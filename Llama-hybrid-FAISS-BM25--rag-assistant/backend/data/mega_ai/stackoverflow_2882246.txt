Vendors that offer button controls with more options than standard WinForms: infragistics.com telerik.com devexpress.com I'd recommend downloading trial versions and see if you can make their controls do what you are failing to accomplish with the built in button control Or, you could create an image that shows the text you want and attach it to the button instead of text. This is not as ideal as if you can find a small readable font though!
