Deep neural networks -- Just for image classification?

All examples I found using deep belief or convolutional neural networks use them for image classification, chatacter detection or speech recognition. Are deep neural networks also useful for classical regresion tasks, where the features are not structured (e.g., not arranged in a sequence or grid)? If yes, can you give an example?
