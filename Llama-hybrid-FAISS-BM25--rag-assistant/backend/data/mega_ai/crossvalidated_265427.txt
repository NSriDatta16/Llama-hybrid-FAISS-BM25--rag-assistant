From the preface to the first edition of "Markov Chains and Stochastic Stability" by Meyn and Tweedie: We deal here with Markov Chains. Despite the initial attempts by Doob and Chung [99,71] to reserve this term for systems evolving on countable spaces with both discrete and continuous time parameters, usage seems to have decreed (see for example Revuz [326]) that Markov chains move in discrete time, on whatever space they wish; and such are the systems we describe here. Edit: the references cited by my reference are, respectively: 99: J.L. Doob. Stochastic Processes . John Wiley& Sons, New York 1953 71: K.L. Chung. Markov Chains with Stationary Transition Probabilities . Springer-Verlag, Berlin, second edition, 1967. 326: D. Revuz. Markov Chains . North-Holland, Amsterdam, second edition, 1984.
