A few obvious question right of the bet: 1. Why do you need to store such large such a large tree structures all at once? 2. Where's this data coming from in the first place? Whatever the answer you might have for these questions, chances are you don't need to store all of the data in memory all at once. Persists larger amounts of data to the disk and read only the bits you need at the time. It looks like it's the direction you were going anyway. There are many possible places in .NET where you could store data besides RDMS; Flat file, xml file, isolated storage, etc. Or maybe you could have whatever system is feeding you this data (question #2) to give it to smaller bits at a time? If you absolutely need to store large tree structure in memory. Research some tree structure algorithm, or maybe even data compression?
