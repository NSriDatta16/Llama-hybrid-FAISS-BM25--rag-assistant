I always use enclosing braces to reduce the risk that someone (including myself) will later introduce a bug by editing the code around the if statement without paying careful attention to which line(s) belong as part of the if-condition. EDIT: Here's a live example if this I just happened to come across in some old code: if (form.validateUpload (messages, this)) return getErrorOutcome (ctx, messages); if (LOG.isInfoEnabled ()) LOG.info ("CREATING UPLOAD"); Notice how both "if" statements are in the main block of code but due to poor formatting, at first glance they appear to be nested. Sure any "good" programmer should quickly see what's happening, but why cause any unnecessary confusion?
