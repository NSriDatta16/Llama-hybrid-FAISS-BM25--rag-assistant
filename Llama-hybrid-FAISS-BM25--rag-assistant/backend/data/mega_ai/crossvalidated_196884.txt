Machine learning - some ideas to get started in biomarker discovery

Background : I have some proteomic data and I want to analyze it for biomarker discovery. The data consists of about 1000 rows, and 20 observations. I want to see which of the expressed proteins (I apologize I am a cs student, not a biologist) have the most influence on the outcome (y) of this dataset. The problem : This data does not have outcomes, and the company did not want to share this information with us. All I have are the expressed proteins. What I have tried : I have tried several different attempts to see what I can do with this data. I have tried with Random forest: by doing the following: taking the data, and cleaning it a bit generating synthetic data from the real data Adding a class/label to the real data (1) and synthetic data (0) Passing this to the random forest, and returning the proximity matrix Using the matrix to cluster the outcomes of the real data (labeled as 1) Use the clusters as new labels for the real data Pass this data with outcomes (from the clusters) and generate a new RF Use this new RF as my model The problem I found is that when I pass this data to the random forest I get a new RF but when I try to predict on the same data (use the model trained with the training set, and test with the training data) I get a bunch of garbage (everyone is the same class, not what the training data classes are). Questions : This doesn't seem to be working with random forest. Should I be trying to cluster the variables instead (transpose the matrix)? What other techniques can I use? Should I use PCA and do a k-means clustering to get the clusters? How would I get the most important variables? What about SVM?
