This sounds like you might have a conceptual problem. When you create a new java.util.Date object, it will be initialised to the current time. If you want to implement a clock, you could create a GUI component which constantly creates a new Date object and updates the display with the latest value. One question you might have is how to repeatedly do something on a schedule? You could have an infinite loop that creates a new Date object then calls Thread.sleep(1000) so that it gets the latest time every second. A more elegant way to do this is to use a TimerTask. Typically, you do something like: private class MyTimedTask extends TimerTask { @Override public void run() { Date currentDate = new Date(); // Do something with currentDate such as write to a label } } Then, to invoke it, you would do something like: Timer myTimer = new Timer(); myTimer.schedule(new MyTimedTask (), 0, 1000); // Start immediately, repeat every 1000ms
