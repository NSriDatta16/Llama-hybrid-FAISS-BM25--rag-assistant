I would do away with the BMI grouping altogether and, at least as a start, run logistic regression on the BMI values. Then you can test the coefficient on BMI to get your p-value for BMIâ€™s effect on rate of complications. Grouping BMI puts you in the position of saying that 24.9 and 25.1 are as different as 18.5 and 30, which you probably do not believe.
