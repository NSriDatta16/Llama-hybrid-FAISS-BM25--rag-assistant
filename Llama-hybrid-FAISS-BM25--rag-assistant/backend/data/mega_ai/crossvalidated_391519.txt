Bayesian Probability question -- Pointwise Probability

I am stuck in this question: if $a = 1$ then $m \sim U(0.2,1)$ else if $a=0$ then $m \sim U(0,0.5)$ . The question is if $m$ is $0.3$ what is the probability that $a$ equals to 1? My thought is to compute $p(a=1\mid m=0.3)$ and $p(a=0\mid m=0.3)$ and whichever class gives the higher probability then it is the answer. However, when I am executing this thought I have a problem of computing $p(m=0.3\mid a=1)$ which is supposed to be zero since it follows $U(0.2,1)$ . I feel like I can use the density function to compute this probability but I am not sure why?
