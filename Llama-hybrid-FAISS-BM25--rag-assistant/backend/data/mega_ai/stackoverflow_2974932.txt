Sorry this isn't an "answer," tho it is a response to the other comments here. This problem is just flabbergasting. It is very easy to isolate (i.e., has nothing to do with number of stylesheets), and doesn't have a proper "solution," as there is no way to achieve the desired rendering. #container { margin: 1em auto; width: 40em; } #wrapper { overflow: hidden; position: relative; } #c1 {background-color: #aaf;} #c2 {background-color: #ccf;} .column { float: left; margin-bottom: -5678px; padding-bottom: 5678px; width: 50%; } #footer { background-color: #eee; padding: 1px; text-align: center; } p {margin: 1em;} This is some content in a short column. We would need some Javascript to change its height if we wanted a different background color for each column to stretch the full height of the respective columns...or we can use large padding together with an equal negative margin. Jump to P1 Jump to P2 Jump to P3 The desired effect is to have the height of the two columns appear the same. We use 'overflow:hidden' on the containing div (#wrapper) to wrap it around the floated columns. These paragraphs have fragment identifiers. Problem comes in when clicking one of the links on the left. Instead of scrolling just the page, the browser scrolls the div with 'overflow:hidden' so the target is at the top. It does this even if the target is already visible. Opera does not exhibit this behavior. This occurs in Chrome/Safari, Firefox, and IE. (Interestingly, IE also works as expected if we completely remove the DOCTYPE declaration.) Footer stuff. To see why 'overflow: hidden' (or any other piece of the CSS) is needed, just try disabling it.
