critical look at auto .arima in forecast package in R

I asked a question earlier in the forum on auto arima click here Performance evaluation of auto.arima in R and UCM on one dataset . The auto.arima provided strange forecast, upon further looking at the code I did not find anything wrong in my R code see code below. This seems a very straightforward problem. If auto.arima does not fit a simple straightforward dataset, I would be very cautious in using this function to fit more complicated datasets. I would encourage using other tools/ functions and verify forecast. plot(eggs) ## Hold out 10 data points - 1984 thru 1993 egg_price = ts(eggs,start = 1900, end = 1983) ## Fit arima model fit
