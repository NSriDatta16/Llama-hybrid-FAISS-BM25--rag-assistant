How did you obtain the .mdb file? If you exported from an SQL Server database to an Access database file, it may or may not work depending on the features used in the SQL Server database. If it was used just for "dumb" storage, the Access database file can do that, but if it used features like stored procedures, user defined functions or triggers, the Access database file can't replicate that. If the Access database has a password set, you have to specify that in the connection string. The user name that you specify is "Admin", so the connection string should look something like: "Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};Dbq=" & Server.MapPath("/YourUserName/db/TheDatabaseFileName.mdb") & ";Uid=Admin;Pwd=ThePassword;" Of course you have to substitute the YourUserName , TheDatabaseFileName and ThePassword parts with the actual values. You also have to have uploaded the database into the db folder on the server, which is set up with the proper file permissions for the web application to be able to write to the database file. What the web hotel has recommended is an ODBC driver, but I would rather use a JET driver if possible.
