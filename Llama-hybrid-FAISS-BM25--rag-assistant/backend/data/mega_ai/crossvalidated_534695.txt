Does Box-Cox need to be Reversed Prior to Running Model Evaluation?

I am building an ARIMA time series model using the Statsmodels package for Python. As a part of my pipeline, I am doing Box-Cox transformation on the response variable (i.e. the series I am seeking to forecast). Do I understand correctly that it is not necessary for me to reverse Box-Cox on my response variable prior to performing my model evaluation calculations (in this case we are using RMSE and MAPE)? (I understand of course that I would need to reverse Box-Cox on any predictions coming out of the model.)
