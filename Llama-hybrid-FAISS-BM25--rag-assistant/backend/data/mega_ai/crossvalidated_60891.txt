Here is how you set up the date for male average spending estimate with CIs: mavg ...female average: favg ...male max: mmax ...female max: fmax The general way to get the predictions given a new dataset is... predict(newspend,newdata=FOO,interval='conf'); ...where FOO is whichever one of your new data.frame s you want the results for. Or you can combine them into one data.frame and get all the results at once: mfavgmax Be warned though: your model and your predictions assume that status, income, verbal, and sex all affect spending independently of each other. In real life data is rarely that clean. I would check whether there are significant interaction terms: install.packages(MASS); # Only need to run this line once library(MASS); newspend.aic Now you can do predict on newspend.aic like you did above. You might have new interaction terms in the model. Another problem is that status, income, verbal, and sex may be correlated with each other (this is called multicollinearity). So, the population maximum (or average, etc.) for males might be different than for females. At high statuses income mean/max will obviously be different than at lower statuses. For categorical variables like male/female, you can at least get the mean/max for that category and use that for your predictions. But what if you want to get estimates for spending as status increases continuously form 18 to 75? Sure predict will give you estimates with income and verbal set to any number you like... but income and verbal are not static, they probably correlated with status and with each other... and how to pick reasonable values for these numeric variables for prediction purposes is the question that's stumping me right now and how I happened onto your question. Hope my answer helps, and it's scary, isn't it, how fast you get to the deep end of the pool with a simple-seeming problem?
