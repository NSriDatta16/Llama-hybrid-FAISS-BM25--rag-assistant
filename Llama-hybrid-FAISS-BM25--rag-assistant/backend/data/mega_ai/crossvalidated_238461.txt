Classification on a single time series - prevent leakage between train & test?

Say you have a single time series of a financial instrument. You want to classify when we are in a bull vs bear market (this is just an example). When splitting your data into a train and test set, if you split based on time period - i.e. everything before year 2000 as a train, and after 2000 as test, won't there be significant leakage between train and test, and thus result in biased accuracy estimates? How would you properly account for this when working with a single time series?
