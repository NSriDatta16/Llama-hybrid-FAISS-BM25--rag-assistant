By the way, The mongrel servers hangs for .xls or .xlsx from files of 3767 rows such as: 002N6V3 1506 RH-128 YE YEMEN MOBILE BLACK 0,5 KILOGRAMS Y Y 002N6V3 1506 RH-128 YE YEMEN MOBILE BLACK 0,5 KILOGRAMS Y Y ........ But it worked well for 1000 rows and less. By the console it worked. but after around 34 mins. Unacceptable in webs. By using Spreadsheet takes acceptable time and not hangs mongrels server. Supposedly is more moder roo gem than Spreadsheet. I used it also as the next way: parsed_file = Excelx.new(filename,false, :ignore) if (file_format.upcase == "XLSX") (1..parsed_file.last_row).each { |row| ret Someone is experiencing the same problems with this gem? Any alternatives apart from running this task in background later by using delayed_jobs?
