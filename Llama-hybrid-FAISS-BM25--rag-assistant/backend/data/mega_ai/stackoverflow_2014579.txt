Relying on the deprecated function being actually called is dangerous - you would have 100% code coverage to make sure you don't miss anything. It's all right for slowly finding all calls to deprecated functions and replace them one by one, but not good enough for a complete transition. I think File > Search in Files in your IDE is your best bet, as there are no good refactoring tools around for PHP that I know of. Afterthought : Maybe PhpXRef is the solution.
