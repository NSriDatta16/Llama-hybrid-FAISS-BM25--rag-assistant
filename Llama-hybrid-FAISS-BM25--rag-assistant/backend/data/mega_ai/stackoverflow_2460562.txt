Required reading: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html . That is, you should really really read it after reading this answer. Check your module file â€“ it has the extension .gwt.xml . You'll see a tag called entry-point . Any code that you add to your project that you want to run on the client side should be in that package or a subpackage. For example, my entry point is com.wesley.heapunderflow.client.HeapUnderflow . All my translatable code should be in com.wesley.heapunderflow.client or a subpackage. If you really need to add another package, add a declaration, where package is something like com.wesley.heapunderflow.tools or com.wesley.skynet .
