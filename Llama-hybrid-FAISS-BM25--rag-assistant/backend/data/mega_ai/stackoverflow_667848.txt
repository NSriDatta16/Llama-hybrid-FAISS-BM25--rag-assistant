Java Socket : TCP Checksum Incorrect

I'm experimenting w/java sockets. I can connect to a socket and send/receive bytes of data w/o a problem. However I am also sniffing the traffic using wireshark and noticing each packet that comes from the java socket is marked by wireshark as "tcp checksum incorrect." Anyone have any insight? java version "1.6.0_12" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_12-b04) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 11.2-b01, mixed mode, sharing) Wireshark v1.0.6 w/WinPcap 4.0.2
