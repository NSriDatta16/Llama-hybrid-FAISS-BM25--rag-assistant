The 'classic' "IsA", "HasA" thinking will always help steer you in the right direction: A "Person" "HasA" "Collection of Data", which your information from his life stages. Today you say "three" stages but of course you would never design to such a limited view of the problem ... right? so you have class Person { [vector or list or your favorite collection type] Data; Name; LastName; }; The snapshot you ask about "HasA" reference(s) to the Person, and a specifier for which piece of data you want in the snapshot: class PersonInfoSnapshot { [reference to] Person; /* "reference to Person.Data" could mean anything that allows retrieval of the data that you need */ [reference to] Person.Data; }; Details of specific types, visibility and so forth left as an exercise.
