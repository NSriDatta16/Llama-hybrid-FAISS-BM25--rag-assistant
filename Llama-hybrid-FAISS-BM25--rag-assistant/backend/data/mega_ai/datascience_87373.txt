Data science project planning is carried out through any of the scrum application such as Jira, Asana or even using Github projects. Gitlab also offers efficient tools for the same. Once you are done with planning, you can use open-source projects such as Git-lfs and DVC to version control your datasets. The notebooks that you prepare could also be version controlled in Github or Gitlab. You can easily find courses and tutorials to dynamically set up your boards and workflows in Github as well as Gitlab.
