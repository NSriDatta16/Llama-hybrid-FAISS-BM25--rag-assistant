As you mentioned, most neural networks are based on general simple abstractions of the brain. Not only are they lacking in mimicking characteristics like plasticity, but they do not take into account signals and timing as real neurons do. There's a fairly recent interview, that I felt was appropriate for your specific question, Machine-Learning Maestro Michael Jordan on the Delusions of Big Data and Other Huge Engineering Efforts , and I quote: But it’s true that with neuroscience, it’s going to require decades or even hundreds of years to understand the deep principles. There is progress at the very lowest levels of neuroscience. But for issues of higher cognition—how we perceive, how we remember, how we act—we have no idea how neurons are storing information, how they are computing, what the rules are, what the algorithms are, what the representations are, and the like. So we are not yet in an era in which we can be using an understanding of the brain to guide us in the construction of intelligent systems.
