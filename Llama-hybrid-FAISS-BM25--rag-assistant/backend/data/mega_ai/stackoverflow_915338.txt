How can I find the link URL by link text with XPath?

I have a well formed XHTML page. I want to find the destination URL of a link when I have the text that is linked. Example programming questions site news I want an XPath expression such that if given programming questions site it will give http://stackoverflow.com and if I give it news it will give http://cnn.com .
