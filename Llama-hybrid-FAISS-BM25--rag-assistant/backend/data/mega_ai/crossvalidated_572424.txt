Generate a syntetic log-normal two dimensional random field

I would like to test some functions that I wrote related to the kriging applied to rain data. In order to do that, I would like to generate a synthetic log-normal 2D random field. The idea is to extract from it some points with their two dimensional coordinates and (of course) their values. These should represent the rain stations data and locations. After that I would like to apply the functions in order to compute the semi-variogram and the kriging. Finally, I will compare the results with the syntetic 2-D random field. I do not think that is enough to compute a bi-variate log-normal distribution. Am I right? I have tried to search some packages for "synthetic rain data generator" but what I have found deal with time series and have a link to rain spatial distribution. I am a newbie but I hope to have myself clear.
