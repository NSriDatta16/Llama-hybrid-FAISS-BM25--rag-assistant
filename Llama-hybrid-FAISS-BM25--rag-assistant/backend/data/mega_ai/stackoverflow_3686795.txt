The database restoration is a very good idea. You do need a populated database to get proper code coverage. You also need to make sure that error reporting is enabled, nasty input must cause a sql error or wapiti might not find it. Wapiti does have blind sql injection testing, but its not as accurate. I would look at the normal output from a ./wapiti.py http://yourdomain.com , this will list all of the vulnerabilities found and then you can patch them. After you do your first round of patching, re-run wapiti to make sure the patches work. The reports it generates are mostly meant for managers and the like who don't know what vulnerability is, they just want to know if they are safe or not. SQL Injection probably won't corrupt the database or any of the pages, Wapiti does do stored xss testing and this will corrupt a page, but if you are restoring the database then everything should be fine.
