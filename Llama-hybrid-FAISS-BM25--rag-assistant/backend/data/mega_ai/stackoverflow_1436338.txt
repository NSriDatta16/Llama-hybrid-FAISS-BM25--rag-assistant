Garbage collection is different from simple ref counting. You can have automatic deletion when a ref count reaches 0, but that too is not garbage collection. Garbage collection means letting go of your ability to control when things are deleted from memory, and allowing the underlying language's implementation to optimize the behviours. You stop paying attention to reference counts, and trust in the dynamic behaviours of a particular implementation of garbage collection. Naturally, garbage collection uses a system of reference counting to know when something is no longer referenced, but that is a small piece of the puzzle.
