Basic Question on Conditional and Unconditional Independence

I am trying to get my facts straight on the following 3 scenarios: 1) I draw a random sample $y$ from $Bernoulli(p)$. Then let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be conditionally independent $N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$ if $y = 0$ or $N(\mu_2,\sigma_2)$ if $y = 1$. Are they conditionally identically distributed, unconditionally identically distributed, or not identically distributed? Theoretically $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are not unconditionally independent. However for all practical purposes this dependence will be irrelevant because I will not observe another sample $y$. Correct? 2) I draw a random sample $y_i$ from $Bernoulli(p)$. Then let $X_i$ distributed as $N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$ if $y_i = 0$ or as $N(\mu_2,\sigma_2)$ if $y_i = 1$ for $i = 1..n$. $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are unconditionally independent. They are also conditionally independent given any subset of $Y_i$. They are unconditionally identically distributed. However they are conditionally not identically distributed (or maybe they are if we are lucky?). Correct? The difference from first scenario is that $y$ is redrawn. 3) I have two urns. One urn contains $n$ numbers sampled from $N(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$ and the second urn contains $n$ numbers sampled from $N(\mu_2,\sigma_2)$. I would like to build a classifier given a number from any of the urns and determine which urn it came from. Basically I am assigning the urn as a class label to each number in the urns. Is it OK to pour the contents of both urns into a pool and treat them as independent samples to be fed to a machine learning algorithm? Are they going to be samples from unconditionally independent random variables, or conditionally independent random variables? Is this matching any of the above scenarios?
