Conditionally Strip HTML Node - Regexp/gsub

I want to generate a search preview of an article by removing certain html nodes including the child node(s) (particularly headers and images) and removing all other tags eg. paragraph while leaving child nodes. e.g. " Subject Subject is the who, what, where, why and when. ".gsub(/ ]*>/, '') results in Subject Subject is the who, what, where, why and when. however I require Subject is the who, what, where, why and when. I'm using the Rails plugin Loofah to sanitize user input and this works great; in fact I can define a scrubber to do this however it seems that a regexp would be sufficient for this simple operation. Thanks in advance for any advice.
