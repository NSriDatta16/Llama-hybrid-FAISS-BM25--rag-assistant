I am always inclined to the "do while you learn" principle, when learning new skills. I am writing this completely based on my experience, which helped me solve Kaggle problems and do what I am doing now. So, this is roughly how you do it, and the courses which you need to take: Introduction to Machine Learning - And the best course for studying this is Andrew Ng's coursera course. You don't need to complete the HW's etc. It is self-paced and archived. So, just watch the courses, and do the assignments for a hands-on knowledge. I even tried doing the same assignments in both Octave and Python. Completing this course would also help you solve Kaggle problems. Exploratory Analysis - Doing preliminary cleaning and exploratory analysis is very important in every data science problem. So, learning those methods would help in learning visualizations, exploratory techniques etc. This Coursera course is a nice one. Databases - Data is not always available in neat tsv's or csv's like in online courses. One needs to learn to handle data stored in databases. They might be SQL based, or NoSQL, they might be row-based or columnar. So, this is a nice course for learning about databases getting a know of how to deal with them. Algorithms - Knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms would be enough to solve most Kaggle and real-world data problems (along with all the mentioned above, though). So, get yourself a nice Intro. to algos book. So, all those mentioned above are essential for understanding and tackling a data science problem. All the others are just improvements above these concepts, including NLP, Deep Learning, etc. So, have these foundations nice and good, so that you can build upon these and get familiar and test the waters of much deeper concepts like neural nets, NLP, etc. Finally, it is always useful to get a knack of Big Data and distributed algorithms and concepts. This coursera course is a perfect start for learning the concepts of parallel computing and handling huge data.
