This paper by Chih-Wei Hsu et al. is a good starting point for kernel selection. On page 3, they suggest using RBF kernel and fine tuning it. Andrew Ng has also provided a very high level thumb rule in his video on SVM: If number of observations are larger than features, use Gaussian kernel. Use linear otherwise.
