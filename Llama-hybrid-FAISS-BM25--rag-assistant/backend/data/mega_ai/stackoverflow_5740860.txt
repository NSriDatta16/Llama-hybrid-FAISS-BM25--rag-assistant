as this looks like a TYPO3 Core bug, please report such findings in the official bug tracker on forge.typo3.org . Otherwise (almost) nobody will notice or take care. Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce this. It always worked for me. Have you tried sth. else than I did in this screencast ? Have you tried another installation of TYPO3, whether this bug also occurs there? It would be nice, if you would report the bug, if it's reproducible. Thanks Steffen Gebert TYPO3 Core Team Member P.S.: As Bob explained, the & has to be replaced or prepended with an ?
