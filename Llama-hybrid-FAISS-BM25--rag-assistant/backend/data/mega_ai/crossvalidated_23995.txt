Apply a lag operator on one time series, with the other fixed, and calculate the coherence of the cross-spectrum achieved against each lag. Find the lag that gives you the maximum coherence and interpret it. Coherence is computed at each frequency-and hence is a vector. Hence, a sum of a weighted coherence would be a good measure. You would typically want to weight the coherences at frequencies that have a high energy in the power spectral density. That way, you would be measuring the similarities at the frequencies that dominate the time series instead of weighting the coherence with a large weight, when the content of that frequency in the time series is negligible. http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/home/rebecka/Stat565/lab5-2007.pdf is a good link to look at to get started and http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/552_Notes_6c.pdf is an excellent introduction to cross-spectral analysis.
