Perhaps to answer this we could consider a hypothetical situation. Suppose you have also got average age for each country as well as individual age. Does it make sense to include either or both of these in your model. I would argue that it does. The effect of average age tells you the effect of living in a country which has an older population while individual age tells you the effect of being old. You could even have an interaction between them: does the effect of being old depend on whether you live in a country of old people. What would upset the apple cart would be trying to use country as a fixed effect and then adding country level covariates but that is not what you have done.
