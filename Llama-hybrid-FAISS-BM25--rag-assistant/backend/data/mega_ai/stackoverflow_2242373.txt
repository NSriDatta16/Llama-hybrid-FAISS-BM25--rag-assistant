I would start by using the grayscale image map. The darkest points are on the cross, so discriminating on the highest values is a starting point. After discrimination, set all the lower points to white and leave the rest as they are. This would maximize the contrast between points on the cross and points in the image. Next up is to come up with a filter for determining the position with the highest average values. I would step through the entire image with a NxM array and take the mean value at the center point. Create a new array of these means and you should have the highest mean at the intersection. I'm curious to see how someone else may try this!
