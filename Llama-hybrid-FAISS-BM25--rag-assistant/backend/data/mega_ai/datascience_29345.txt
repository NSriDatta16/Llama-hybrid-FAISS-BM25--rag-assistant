How to sort numbers using Convolutional Neural Network?

Recently, in an interview I got this question: Design a convnet that sorts numbers. Operators are ReLU, Conv, and Pooling. E.g. input: 5, 3, 6, 2; output: 2, 3, 5, 6 I am not sure how can you sort a list of numbers using CNN. I know it is possible using RNN. Is it even possible?
