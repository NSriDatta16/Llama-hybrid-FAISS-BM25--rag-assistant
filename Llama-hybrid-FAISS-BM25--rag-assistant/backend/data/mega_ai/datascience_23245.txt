Training set, validation set, and test set with Orange

Is it possible with Orange (only using its widgets, without writing Python code) to implement the following typical machine learning processes? Train a training set, Validating a validation set (e.g. using k-fold cross validation), and Testing the model with a test set. Using the 'Test & Score" widget, a single dataset is used. Does this mean that only validation is performed, and there is no actual test? Can in this case classification results (accuracy, AUC, etc.) considered reliable?
