How can I find colors in a sentence?

Given a sentence "I like blue jeans", the output should be "blue". I do not have any training data. I'll just be downloading a bunch of tweets related to a hashtag. How do I build a model for this? I haven't learnt word2vec but could that work? Pre-trained embeddings? I have not worked on them before yet but I want to know if it would work beforehand. I want to know what would be the best approach and any references to similar problems worked on before. Thanks.
