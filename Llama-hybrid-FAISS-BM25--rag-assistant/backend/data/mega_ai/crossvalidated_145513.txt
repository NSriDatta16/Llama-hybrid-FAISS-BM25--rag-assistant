What type of ANOVA should I use?

I'm currently conducting a study with two objectives. The primary objective is to assess the influence of using different recovery modalities on repeated sprint performance in youth footballers. To do this, I am analysing performance (%decrement, average sprint, and recovery duration) during repeated sprints under three conditions (lets just call them 1,2 and 3). For this alone I'm assuming I would use a repeated measures ANOVA. However, the secondary objective of the study is to assess the influence of stage of maturation on performance during repeated sprints under the same three conditions. To do this, I have split the participants up into a more and less mature group. Therefore, as well as assessing differences within the group as a whole (i.e. without splitting them up, condition 1 vs 2 vs 3), I am also to assess between group differences (i.e. more vs less mature), as well as within subject difference within the group (i.e. condition 1 vs 2 vs 3 in the more and less mature group). Would a mixed ANOVA be more appropriate to indicate differences within subject and between groups? Would I have to perform a separate ANOVA to assess within subject differences in the group as a whole?
