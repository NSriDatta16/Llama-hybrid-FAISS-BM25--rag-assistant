Javascript Code Coverage tool for IE

I've got a rather hideous and large javascript file that I've inherited from a dev I loathe. There is a lot of dead code, and I find I've spent a lot of time refactoring functions that aren't even called. Ideally, I just want something that can tie into the js engine and keep track of when and how many times functions are called. In FF, I can get a list of the functions by walking the window object, and dynamically wrap them all in a method that would log the call to them, and then call the function as normal. Unfortunately, in IE, I can't use this as I can't seem to find a way to get a list of all the functions that have been loaded. And I can't run this app in FF, as it's horribly browser specific. At last count there were 138 lines containing "new ActiveXObject(...)" Help, either with a tool that can do this, or at the very least, a way to get a list of the functions that IE7 has loaded from the user script. Thanks -c
