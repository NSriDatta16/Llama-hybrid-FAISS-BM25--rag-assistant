It’s fair to say that, but you might say 1.39 percentage points rather than 1.39%. The former makes it absolutely clear that we’re talking about differences in probabilities. The natural interpretations of the model coefficients are on the log odds scale. The reason they are on the log odds scale is so that the linear predictor is unbounded (unlike probabilities which are on the unit interval). There are some other reasons for example, effects are more likely to be linear on the log odds scale, but in general the use of odds and log odds is for mathematical convenience and not because they are more interpretable. EDIT: Your "loophole" is expected behaviour. The property you're wanting is called "linearity". Logistic regression is linear on the log odds scale, so log odds will have the property you seek. However, the sigmoid function is not linear, which explains the difference you've found.
