I just came across this post and this may be too late, but what you did was complete correct except that your formulae for calculating CIs was wrong. The correct formulae should be: gee_ub $coef[2, 1] + 1.96 * summary(gee_mod)$ coef[2, 2] gee_lb $coef[2, 1] - 1.96 * summary(gee_mod)$ coef[2, 2] and same for GLM. I tried your codes with above correction and got below: b1_gee b1_glm gee_cover glm_cover 0.120 0.120 0.948 0.998 It shows GEE is correct while GLM results in too small p values thus coverage rate too high, which should be the case as your simulated data is correlated.
