How is the output of a maxpool layer window size=1x2 and stride=2 calculated?

I'm looking at the architecture proposed in the following paper: Baoguang Shi et al, An End-to-End Trainable Neural Network for Image-based Sequence Recognition and Its Application to Scene Text Recognition . In the proposed architecture of the model, a MaxPooling Window:1 Ã— 2, s:2 layer is mentioned. I'm not sure what the size of the output of this layer would be. If i have an input of size (32 x 8), then the output would be: (32-1)/2 + 1 = 16.5, (8-2)/2 + 1 = 4 *ignoring depth and batch size here
