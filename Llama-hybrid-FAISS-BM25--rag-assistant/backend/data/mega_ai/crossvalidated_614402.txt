Negative RSquare Value but Good View on Chart for RNN Time Series

I'm fairly new on univariate time series forecasting and deep learning. My task is to forecast energy consumption values. May data looks like: I'm usin simple RNN, because I have tested with linear regression, xgboost, lstm and rnn, but rnn looks the best. I'm using Min-Max scaler to scale my data. and after predictions my actual vs prediction chart and training-loss chart looks like below: Epoch is 1000. But there is a big problem with the r2 metric. It's -14.617 By the way my data is stationary. I've checked with ADF test. When I check the chart it seems very well. But r2 is very bad. I couldn't find an understandable explanation to my problem. Is there anyone to help me to understand? Thanks.
