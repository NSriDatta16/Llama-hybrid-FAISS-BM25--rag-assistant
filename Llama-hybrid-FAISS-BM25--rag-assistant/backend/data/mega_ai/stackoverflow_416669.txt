I hope/expect we'll see something more comprehensive soon; a SQL history lesson on the subject would be useful and informative. Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? In the meantime, I can observe the following: SQL predates the DRY principle, at least as far as it it was documented in The Pragmatic Programmer . Not all DBs require the full list: Sybase, for example, will happily execute queries like SELECT a, b, COUNT(*) FROM some_table GROUP BY a ... which (at least every time I accidentally ran such a monster) often leads to such enormous inadvertent recordsets that panic-stricken requests quickly ensue, begging the DBAs to bounce the server. The result is a sort of partial Cartesian product, but I think it may mostly be a failure on Sybase's part to implement the SQL standard properly.
