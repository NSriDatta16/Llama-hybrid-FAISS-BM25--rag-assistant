Iphone sdk - How to setup a 'template'

I've been working on a Cook Book App and I've been making each page individually which takes a really long time to do, I asked a question similar to this and it was brought to my attention that you can setup a way to automate the design process so all you need to do is input your data. Can someone please explain in as much detail as possible how you setup your xcode files/code to automate such a process So for example I would just enter the page text and it would automatically put my standard background picture in and add a scroll view and appropriate buttons etc. Thanks
