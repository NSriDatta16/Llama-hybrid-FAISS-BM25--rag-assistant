I've always just used \raggedright for this, but I've never done that for an entire paper. This FAQ (which is one of my go-to LaTeX resources) recommends the ragged2e package. Oh, and a side note: I never pay attention to bad boxes unless I can see them in the output. This is probably dumb, but LaTeX is much pickier than I am.
