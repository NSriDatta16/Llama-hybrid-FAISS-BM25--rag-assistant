After taking a step back and doing a bit more digging, I came up with the answer. High Level Explanation. ViewControllerY needs to be of class UIViewController, not UITableViewController. The ViewControllerY : UIViewController definition in the .h file should include the Table View Delegate and the Data Source protocols. A member of the ViewControllerY has to hold the UITableView* - call it mTableView and should be defined as an IBOutlet. The table view delegate methods should then use self.mTableView to access the table. In Interface Builder, the UIView Object needs to have an Outlet "view" hooked up to the File's Owner and the Table View inside the UIView needs to have the dataSounce and the Delegate set to File's Owner and the mTableView Outlet also needs to be hooked to the File's Owner. Low Level Explanation. in ViewControllerY.h do the following: @interface ViewControllerY : UIViewController { UITableView* mTableView; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITableView* mTableView; In ViewControllerY.m, in the Table View Delegate methods, access the mTableView like so: myNewCell = (UITableViewCell*)[self.mTableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:myCellIdentifier]; (obviously you need to define and handle all the other Table View Methods in the normal way. ViewControllerY.xib should have the following in it: File's Owner ViewControllerY First Responder UIResponder View UIView Image View UIImageView Table View UITableView Control Drag from the File's Owner to the View and select "view". Control Drag from the Table View to the File's Owner and select Data Source. Control Drag from the Table View to the File's Owner and select Deligate. Control Drag from the File's Owner to the Table View and select mTableView. That's it! You can then add other UI objects inside the UIView and hook them up as appropriate in the normal way. I'm not sure if this is the only or best solution but is works and I'm happy with it. Hope this helps someone with the same or similar problems. It's a bit confusing til you get the hang of it.
