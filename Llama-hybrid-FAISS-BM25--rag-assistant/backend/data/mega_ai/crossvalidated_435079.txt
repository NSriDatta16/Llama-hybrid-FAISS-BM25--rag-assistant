The question is meaningless. Yes, some organizations publish "benchmarks" for forecast accuracy, but these are completely useless, because achievable forecast accuracy depends on your data generating process, on the quality of your data, on your aggregation granularity (along multiple dimensions, including product, location, time and others) and on other factors. For instance, slow movers are harder to forecast than fast movers, so if two firms in the same industry have different proportions of slow and fast movers, their best achievable accuracy will differ widely - even if they are identical on all other attributes described above (which they will never be). Better: look at internal benchmarks, e.g., simple forecasts. See also Kolassa (2008, Foresight ), "Can We Obtain Valid Benchmarks from Published Surveys of Forecast Accuracy?" Or take a look at How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
