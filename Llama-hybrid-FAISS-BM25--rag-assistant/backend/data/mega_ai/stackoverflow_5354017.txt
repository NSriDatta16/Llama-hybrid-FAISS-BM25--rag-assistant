Infragistics provide a tool called " Project Upgrade Utility " that does precisely what you want. All you have to do is start the app and select a solution file (.sln) or a project (.vbproj or .csproj) file, the app let you select to what version of infragistics you want to upgrade and it will do the rest of the job. I used this method in numerous occasions to upgrade to the new releases of infragistics and it works without problems, and if the tool finds any problem it creates a report. Remember that every infragistics dll has a line on the corresponding licences.licx file of the project with information regarding version, culture and public key, so if you go for a manual update you must update these lines too.
