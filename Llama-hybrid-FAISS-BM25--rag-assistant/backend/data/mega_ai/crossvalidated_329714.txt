How to Train LSTM across Multiple Time Series datasets

I believe there are generalizable mapping rules that can be extracted from multiple time series data-sets I have. Each data-set represents a specific company, and while I am able to train on each company individually, I'm having trouble finding literature or conceptualizing how to train across all my datasets (which have multiple features and one output), to glean the generalized mapping of features to output instead of the individual mapping for each company. I have looked into transfer learning, but that seems to simply be freezing of certain layers of the neural network while letting others train, but this method seems difficult to extend to the 4000+ companies/datasets I have. If it matters, I am using keras with tensoflow backend, and all my time series data-sets are the same size. Thanks for your thoughts.
