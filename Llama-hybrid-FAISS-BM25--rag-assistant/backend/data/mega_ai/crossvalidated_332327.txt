Dynamic Time Warp compares the realized data points, which may or may not work. A more rigorous approach is to compare the distribution of the time series by way of a metric called telescope distance . The cool thing about this metric is that the empirical calculation is done by fitting a series of binary classifiers such as SVM. For a brief explanation, see this . For clustering time series, it's been shown to outperform DTW; see Table 1 in the original paper[1]. [1] Ryabko, D., & Mary, J. (2013). A binary-classification-based metric between time-series distributions and its use in statistical and learning problems. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 14(1), 2837-2856.
