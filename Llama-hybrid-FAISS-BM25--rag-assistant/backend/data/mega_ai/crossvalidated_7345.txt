The answer depends on the characteristics of $f$. Regardless, its average (by definition) is $\frac{1}{100}\int_0^{100}{f(x)dx}$, so your problem is one of estimating that integral from values at a discrete set of points. For a highly discontinuous function you can use any Riemann sum ; for a differentiable function use the Trapezoidal Rule , for which you can estimate the error in terms of derivatives of $f$; for a thrice differentiable function use Simpson's Rule , etc. If necessary, you can combine the error estimates of these rules with statistical estimates of the error in computing each value of $f$ to obtain an estimate of the error in the average.
