Elegant Algorithm for conversational date strings?

Possible Duplicate: How do I calculate relative time? Given a DateTime object, what's the most elegant way you've found of converting it to a human friendly string. Something like this: (Future) "Tomorrow" "[1|2|3|4|5|6] days from now." "Next week" "Next month" (Past) "[1|2|3|4|5|6] days ago." "Last week" "Last month" Thanks.
