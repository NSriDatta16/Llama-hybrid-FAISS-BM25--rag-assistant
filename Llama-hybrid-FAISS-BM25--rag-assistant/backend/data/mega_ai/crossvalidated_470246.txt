How does repeated cross validation go about 'averaging' model coefficients?

No matter how much I google, I cannot find the answer to this simple question. Say you do 10-fold, repeated (5x) CV logistic regression with elastic net regularization. For alpha you try seq(0,1,length=10) , and for lambda you try seq(0.1, 0.5, length = 5) It tries lots of combinations of alpha and lambda to find the best combination, and the corresponding model coefficients. My question is: how does the "repeated 5x" part come into play? Each repeat has its own coefficient estimates. So did it just literally average the 5 to give you final "best model"?
