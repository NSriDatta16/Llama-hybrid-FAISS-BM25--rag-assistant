If you are developing worker roles, then you can reuse the dynamic assembly loading system that comes with the execution framework of Lokad.Cloud. Basically, you just have to upload a ZIP archive containing all your DLLs toward the Blob Storage and the framework takes care of the rest. Extra Bonus: worker restart takes about 10s (vs +10min for a classical deployment) A similar behavior could be obtained with web roles too, but this part hasn't been implemented in Lokad.Cloud yet.
