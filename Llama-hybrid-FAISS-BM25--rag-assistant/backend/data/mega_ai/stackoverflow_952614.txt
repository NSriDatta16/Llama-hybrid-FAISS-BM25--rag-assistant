Help on a better way to parses digits from a String in Java

I have a string which contains digits and letters. I wish to split the string into contiguous chunks of digits and contiguous chunks of letters. Consider the String "34A312O5M444123A". I would like to output: ["34", "A", "312", "O", "5", "M", "444123", "A"] I have code which works and looks like: List digitsAsElements(String str){ StringBuilder digitCollector = new StringBuilder(); List output = new ArrayList (); for (int i = 0; i I considered splitting str twice to get an array containing all the numbers chunks and an array containing the all letters chunks. Then merging the results. I shied away from this as it would harm readability. I have intentionally avoided solving this with a regex pattern as I find regex patterns to be a major impediment to readability. Debuggers don't handle them well. They interrupt the flow of someone reading source code. Overtime regex's grow organically and become monsters. They are deeply non intuitive. My questions are: How could I improve the readability of the above code? Is there a better way to do this? A Util class that solves this problem elegantly. Where do you draw the line between using a regEx and coding something simpilar to what I've written above? How do you increase the readability/maintainability of regExes?
