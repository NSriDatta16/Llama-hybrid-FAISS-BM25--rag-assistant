What is the difference between PCA and asymptotic PCA?

In two papers in 1986 and 1988 , Connor and Korajczyk proposed an approach to modeling asset returns. Since these time series have usually more assets than time period observations, they proposed to perform a PCA on cross-sectional covariances of asset returns. They call this method Asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA, which is rather confusing, since the audience thinks immediately of asymptotic properties of PCA). I have worked out the equations, and the two approaches seem numerically equivalent. The asymptotics of course differ, since convergence is proved for $N \rightarrow \infty$ rather than $T \rightarrow \infty$. My question is: has anyone used APCA and compared to PCA? Are there concrete differences? If so, which ones?
