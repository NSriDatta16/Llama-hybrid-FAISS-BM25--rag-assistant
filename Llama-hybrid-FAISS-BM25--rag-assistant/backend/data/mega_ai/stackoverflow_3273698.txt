The obvious way to do this is, run one test and dump the test coverage data. (In fact, this is the only way to do this). Our SD Java Test Coverage Tool has explicit DumpVectors and ResetVectors procedures that can be called anytime. By adjusting the unit test framework to just call these two procedures between tests, you can get one test coverage vector per unit test. The display tool will display any individual test coverage vector. It can also give you the union of the entire set (as if you had run all the tests) or compute how one test overlaps with another.
