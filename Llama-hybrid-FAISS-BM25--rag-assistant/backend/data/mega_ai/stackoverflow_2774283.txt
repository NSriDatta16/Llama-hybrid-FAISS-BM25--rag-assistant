A role typically defines a business function (or set of functions) performed by one or more users. Examples would be 'customer service agent' or 'business analyst'. A user is an individual person who is included in the role - Bob, Nancy, and Steve might be assigned to the customer service agent role. This makes is easier to assign permissions to database objects. You can assign permissions to the role, and any user who belongs to that role inherits the same set of permissions.
