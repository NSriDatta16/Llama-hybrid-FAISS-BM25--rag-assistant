Embedding latest youtube video into wordpress

I'm working on a WP theme, which was working last I check and has since stopped. Maybe it's something little but it's driving me nuts right now. I'm taking a youtube username and grabbing the latest video and embedding into the page. Seems to be pretty simple, but I may be attacking it wrong. Here is my code(any suggestions?): get_item_quantity(1); // Build an array of all the items, starting with element 0 (first element). $rss_itemsy = $youtube->get_items(0, $maxitemsy); } ?> YouTube No Video? Check out our YouTube Channel '; else // Loop through each feed item and display each item as a hyperlink. foreach ( $rss_itemsy as $item ) { $link = $item->get_item_tags('http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/', 'player'); $useThis = $link[0]['attribs']['']['url']; ?> "> " type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="230" height="172.5"> get_content();?> Anyways, I keep getting the "No video, check out our..." output instead of the youtube embed (which was showing up before). Help!
