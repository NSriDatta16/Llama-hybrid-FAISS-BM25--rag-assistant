Dynamics CRM 4.0 workflow performance question

I have developed a workflow for automatically closing appointments that are 28 days past the start date. To do this I have created a organisation scoped workflow using a Workflow timeout activity to wait until 28 days after the start date before closing. I am concerned that this may place an increasingly large load on the CRM implementation as the number of appointments increases (thousands could be open with waiting workflows attached). How can I check this? does anyone know how often the async service will poll to check whether the timeout has been reached, and does it make a lot of difference on the number of open activities?
