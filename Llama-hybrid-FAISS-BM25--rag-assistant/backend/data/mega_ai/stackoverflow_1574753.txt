Basically Mike Koval's answer will do the job, that is setting wmode="transparent" . All other HTML/CSS/JS things will remain the same from your own link . Full embedding code HTML version (by swfObject's generator ) will be: --> --> It will be always better to use swfObject in JS, something like: var flashvars = {}; var params = {}; params.wmode = "transparent"; var attributes = {}; swfobject.embedSWF("path/to/flash.swf", "id-of-the-div-the-flash-will-go", "800", "600", "9.0.0", false, flashvars, params, attributes);
