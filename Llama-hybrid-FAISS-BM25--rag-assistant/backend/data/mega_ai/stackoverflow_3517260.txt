How do I move zip file to blob column in Java?

I have a Java program that creates a number of xml file and then zips them up and saves them to the file system. Later in the program I want to put that same zip file into a blob column of my oracle database. Problem is I'm not sure how to do that. I don't need to read it or do anything with the data, just move it to the database for persistent, central storage. Thanks!
