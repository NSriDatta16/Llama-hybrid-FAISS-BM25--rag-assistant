Starting with Google Spreadsheets

I've never used spreadsheets for anything more than a quick graph. I'd like to learn how to use spreadsheet formulas to their full extent and have been playing around on Google Spreadsheets. There do not seem to be any thorough tutorials on Google Spreadsheets and even Google's documentation often makes references to Excel functionality without explaining it. My question is, should I first learn to use 'advanced' formulas (say vlookups or ARRAYFORMULA on Google) spreadsheets on Excel and then move to Google spreadsheets? I'm not doing anything extraordinarily complicated, but I'd like to know some of the best practices when pulling information across sheets and reorganizing and filtering it using formulas (not macros). -- EDITED to clarify my wish to use formulas, not macros
