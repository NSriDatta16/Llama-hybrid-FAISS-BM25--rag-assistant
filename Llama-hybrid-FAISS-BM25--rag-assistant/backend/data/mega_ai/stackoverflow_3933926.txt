How can I block Alexa Toolbar users?

Any ideas how I can block Alexa Toolbar users? I don't want to appear in the rankings while we are in beta ... I see you can block their search engine with User-agent: ia_archiver Disallow: / but I can't find any documentation on how to pull your self from actually being ranked.. I read earlier someone tried to email them and they rufused.. So I guess I'm forced to block them? Any better ideas, or way ideas on how to block them access?
