I did something like this a while back. After some experimentation I arrived at a solution that worked sufficiently well in my case. I used the rate of change in the cube of the running average over about 120ms. When there is silence (only noise that is) the expression should be hovering around zero. As soon as the rate starts increasing over a couple of runs, you probably have some action going on. rate = cur_avg^3 - prev_avg^3 I used a cube because the square just wasn't agressive enough. If the cube is to slow for you, try using the square and a bitshift instead. Hope this helps.
