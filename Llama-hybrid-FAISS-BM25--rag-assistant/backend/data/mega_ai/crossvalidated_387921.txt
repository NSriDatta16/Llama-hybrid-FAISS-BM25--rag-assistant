As has already been mentioned by Karolis Konceviƒçius, in general you should either regularize within-class covariance or find a non-degenerated subspace. for the former, an easy way to do it is to toggle the "shrinkage" option in LDA or Matlab LDA package. Giving it a close-to-zero value will make it equivalent to applying Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse. Another option is to use "auto" shrinkage, of which the optimality is given by Ledoit-Wolf estimation. for the latter, besides applying PCA before LDA, you can also select features by their Variational Inflation Factor, which excludes multicollinearity/singularity. But to be honest, for the case where sample size is smaller than the number of features, you should better use Naive Bayes rather than LDA.
