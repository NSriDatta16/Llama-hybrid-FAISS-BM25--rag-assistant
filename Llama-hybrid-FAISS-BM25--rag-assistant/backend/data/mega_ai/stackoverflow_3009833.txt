I think paragraph 8.5.1.2 of the manual might be enlightening. It states that by default time is assumed to be without timezone and if one is given it is silently ignored. In order to make things clear I think it is best to explicitely cast the time : pti=> select timestamp with time zone '20100610T180000-5'; timestamptz ------------------------ 2010-06-11 01:00:00+02 (1 row) pti=> select timestamp with time zone '20100610T180000PST'; timestamptz ------------------------ 2010-06-11 04:00:00+02 (1 row) As is evident the time with time zone is properly converted from localtime to server time.
