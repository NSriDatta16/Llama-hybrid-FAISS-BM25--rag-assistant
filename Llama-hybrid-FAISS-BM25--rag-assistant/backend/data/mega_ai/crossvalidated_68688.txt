This might be rather simplistic, but you might get some insight by doing an eigenvalue analysis on each of your clusters. What I would try is to take all points assigned to a cluster and fit them with a multivariate Gaussian. Then you can compute the eigenvalues of the fitted covariance matrix and plot them. There are many ways to do this ; perhaps the most well-known and widely used is called principal component analysis or PCA . Once you have the eigenvalues (also called a spectrum), you can examine their relative sizes to determine how "stretched out" the cluster is in certain dimensions. The less uniform the spectrum, the more "cigar-shaped" the cluster is, and the more uniform the spectrum, the more spherical the cluster is. You could even define some sort of metric for indicating how non-uniform the eigenvalues are (spectral entropy ?) ; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_flatness . As a side benefit, you can examine the principal components (the eigenvectors associated with large eigenvalues) to see "where" the "cigar-shaped" clusters are pointing in your data space. Naturally this is a crude approximation for an arbitrary cluster, as it only models the points in the cluster as a single ellipsoid. But, like I said, it might give you some insight.
