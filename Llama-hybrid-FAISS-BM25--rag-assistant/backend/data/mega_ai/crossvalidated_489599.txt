Negation is a tough problem in NLP. If you search on Google Scholar for negation in sentiment analysis there are dozens of papers that suggest some solutions. The relatively simple things you can is: Detect such cases in your training data and upsample them. Generate synthetic training data by negating some of the training sentences that are simple enough for some rule-based editing after you do some NLP analysis over them (I would do it in spaCy ).
