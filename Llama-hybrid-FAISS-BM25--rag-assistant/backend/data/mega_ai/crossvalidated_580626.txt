Usually I explain it this way: when you have p-value 0.05 it basically means you are wrong 1 in 20 times. On the other hand, our main consideration with hypothesis is to accept or reject them, not probability. Hence, when you have 20 p-vals 0.05 "on average" you'll accept 1 false positive. This is why you introduce correction. You lose some accepted hypothesis, but you get more accurate results. This is really also about how you read results. Sometimes (ie. while struggling with results) people will say that due to explanatory characteristics of analysis they omitted correction or they would give both values. This kind of results should be treated with caution. Mostly, while testing multiple hypothesis, you should use correction.
