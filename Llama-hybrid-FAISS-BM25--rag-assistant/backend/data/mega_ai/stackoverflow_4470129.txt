MySQL and PHP: Searching for rows through a field in an undefined number of joined tables

There is an example table, 'main_table' with the fields 'ID', 'some_data'. There is an aggregate table, 'agg' with the fields 'id', 'main_table_id', 'joinee_id'. And then there is the final table, 'joinee', with the fields 'id', 'email'. The tables 'main_table' and 'joinee' are in a many:many relationship, through 'agg'. I would like to be able to search all the 'main_table' entries by 'email' from 'joinee', without doing a left join and then group by 'main_table'.'id'. The final result needs to list all the 'main_table' entries, once per entry. Imagine it like this - I would like 'main_table' to get a temporary field "participants" which would contain all the 'emails' - I would then perform a LIKE match on this field in the same query that does this, in order to find the 'main_table' entries that have anything to do with the email I entered. Is this possible? Mind you, this is only a fragment of a much larger query. 'main_table' is already joined with 5 other tables, and their fields are already used as filters. Thing is, I know there can be only one joined table in each of those cases - with 'joinee', the number of connected entries varies. Thank you.
