I think the point that I was missing is that PCA does not tell us about the bare number of degrees of freedom, but rather the variance-weighted number of degrees of freedom. In my first example all ten variables had equal variance (barring sampling noise), and so the PCA shows each successive principal component adding a roughly equal amount of variance. In the second example the variables I'm working with have a wide range of variances: $y_1$ has a much larger variance than $y_{10}$. The PCA therefore correctly tells me that fewer principal components are required to capture most of the variance, because the higher indexed $y$'s contribute increasingly little to the total variance of the system.
