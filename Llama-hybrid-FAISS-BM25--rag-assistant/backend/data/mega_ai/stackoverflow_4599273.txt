"Add another item" form functionality

I have a form that lets a user enter their career history - it's a very simple form with only 3 fields - type (dropdown), details (textfield) and year (dropdown). Basically I want to include some dynamic functionality whereby the user can enter multiple items on the same page and then submit them all in one go. I had a search on Google and found some examples but they were all based on tables - my markup is based on DIV tags: Type Work Details Year 2010 So basically the 3 DIV tags with class "row" need to be duplicated, or to simplify things - the div "form-fields" could just be duplicated. I am also aware that the input names would have to converted to array format. Additionally each item will require a "remove" button. There will be a main submit button at the bottom which submits all the data. Anyone got an elegant solution for this?
