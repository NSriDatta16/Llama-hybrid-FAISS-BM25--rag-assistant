I think the best method for identifying sensor problems from time series data is to test for stationarity rather than outliers or anomalies alone. Outliers are individual data points that lie outside the expected or normal range. Anomolies are patterns of data points that are somehow distinct or "not typical", even though the might be inside the normal or expected range. In contrast, non-stationary time series is a time series where the generating distribution has changed or is changing over time. In other words, stationarity is concerned with the generating distribution and not with individual data points or groups of data points. As you said, the distributions associated with working sensors stays the same (i.e. is "stationary") over a month. Here are a few introductory references: http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~guy/Research/LSTS/TOS.html https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/2372/how-to-check-if-a-timeseries-is-stationary http://www.cas.usf.edu/~cconnor/geolsoc/html/chapter11.pdf The problem with outlier detection as a method is that there might be many causes of outliers not relate to faults in sensors. Same for anomalies. It might be true that some changes in stationarity might also be accompanied by either outliers or anomalies, but that is not necessarily the case. In contrast, changes in stationarity will almost always be related to faults or failures in sensors and related processes of data capture and transmission. The downside of stationarity tests is that it is hard to detect changes in stationarity quickly in real time, with high reliability (i.e. minimum of false positives). If you might combine several methods to get "early warning signals" of possible sensor problems, and then confirm them later (hours or days) after more data comes in.
