When dealing with longer texts, you can use a technique called " sliding window " to break the text into smaller segments. This involves taking a window of fixed size and sliding it along the text, one segment at a time. You can then concatenate the vectors of the individual segments together to form a single vector for the whole text. Another approach is to use a hierarchical model that first encodes the text into sentence-level embeddings, and then aggregates those embeddings into a single document-level embedding. You can also try using a transformer model that is specifically designed to handle longer sequences, such as the Longformer or the BigBird . These models are able to process sequences of up to tens of thousands of tokens, allowing you to encode entire documents in one go.
