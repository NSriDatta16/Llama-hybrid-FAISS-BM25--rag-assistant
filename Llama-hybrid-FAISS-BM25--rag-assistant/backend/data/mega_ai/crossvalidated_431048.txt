Standardization of your dummies is not a problem technically, though, if you want to interpret your model, it's always better to stay with 0 and 1 but it's quiet impossible to say if standardization will improve or not the model. It's always better to standardize before doing the PCA (because you directly have correlation coefficient for the matrix) and doing it on the whole population to have std and mean closer to the "real population". Basically std > pca > sampling is the best option for me just by theory, not necessarily based on your accuracy results.
