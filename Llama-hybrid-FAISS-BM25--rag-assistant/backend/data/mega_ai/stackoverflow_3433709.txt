Some architectures have hardware support for vector arithmetic, such that a single instruction will sum all the elements of an array of doubles. However, the first thing you must do to speed up a program is measure it. Have you timed your program to see where the slowdown occurs? For example, one thing you appear to be doing in a for loop is lots of heap allocation, which tends to be slow. You could combine all your arrays into one array for greater speed. You are currently doing the logical equivalent of this: I3 = I1 - I2; If you did this: I1 -= I2; Now I1 would be storing the result. This would destroy the original value of I1 , but would avoid allocating a new array-of-arrays. Also the intention of C++ is that you define classes to represent a data type and the operations on it. So you could write a class to represent your dynamic array storage. Or use an existing one - check out the uBLAS library .
