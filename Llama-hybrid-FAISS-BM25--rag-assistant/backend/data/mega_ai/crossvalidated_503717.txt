Linear vs Nonlinear Machine Learning Algorithms

Three linear machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Five nonlinear algorithms: Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Learning Vector Quantization and Support Vector Machines. Can someone please explain for each of these algorithms specifically why are they linear or nonlinear? Also what would a neural network be and why?
