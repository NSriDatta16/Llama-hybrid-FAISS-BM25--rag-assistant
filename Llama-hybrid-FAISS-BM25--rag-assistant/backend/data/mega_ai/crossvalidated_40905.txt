ARIMA model interpretation

I have a question about ARIMA models. Let's say I have a time series $Y_t$ that I would like to forecast and an $\text{ARIMA}(2,2)$ model seems like a good way to conduct the forecasting exercise. $$ \Delta Y_t = \alpha_1 \Delta Y_{t-1} + \alpha_2 \Delta Y_{t-2} + \nu_{t} + \theta_1 \nu_{t-1} + \theta_2 \nu_{t-2} $$ Now the lagged $Y$'s imply that my series today is influenced by prior events. This makes sense. But what is the interpretation of the errors? My prior residual (how off I was in my calculation) is influencing the value of my series today? How are the lagged residuals calculated in this regression as it is the product / remainder of the regression?
