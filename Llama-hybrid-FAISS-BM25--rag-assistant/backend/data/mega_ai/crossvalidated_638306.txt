How to choose reference category of predictors in logistic regression?

I am struggling to decide which reference category I should define in my logistic regression model. When I define "mandatory school" as a reference in the variable education the results seem different compared to when I define "High school" (the significance disappears). Anova test (likelihood ratio test) of models with and without education was significant. I am aware that similar posts exist but I did not find a sufficient answer. My aim is to identify if education has an effect on the outcome. As education is an ordinal variable it is naturally ordered from lowest to highest education - but which education level should be the reference? I know that there are some strategies, e.g., using the category that is most frequent in the data. However, as my significance values for the different education levels vary depending on which reference level, I do not just want to use the level that brings the most significant levels ...
