Explanation of GAN optimization with game theory perspective Since these two networks shoot information at each other, it could be portrayed as a game where one guesses if the input is real or not. The GAN framework is a non-convex, two-player, non-cooperative game with continuous, high-dimensional parameters, in which each player wants to minimize its cost function. The optimum of this process takes the name of Nash Equilibrium - where each player will not perform any better by changing a strategy, given the fact that the other player doesn't change their strategy. However, GANs are typically trained using gradient-descent techniques that are designed to find the low value of a cost function and not find the Nash Equilibrium of a game. Source
