How do I get csv file to download on IE? Works on firefox

I'm struggling with an odd error. I have a simple web app that grabs stuff from a DB then outputs it as a downloadable csv file. It works on firefox and chrome, but IE fails to recognize it as a csv file (thinking it is a html fle) and when I click save I get the error, "Unable to download {name of file} from {name of site}. Unable to open this internet site. ..." Code: session_start(); //some logic goes here... //generate csv header header("Content-type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=exportevent.csv"); header("Pragma: no-cache"); header("Expires: 0"); echo "Event: " . $event_title . "\n"; //print the column names echo "Last Name, First Name, Company \n"; while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { echo $row['atlname'] . ',' . $row['atfname'] . ',' . $row['atcompany'] . "\n"; } I've played around with the content-type a whole bunch, but that had no effect. Update: I've tried text/csv, application/vnd.ms-excel (and variations of this), text/plain, and some others that I now forget with no luck. This is IE8 btw. Update 2: The connection is over SSL.
