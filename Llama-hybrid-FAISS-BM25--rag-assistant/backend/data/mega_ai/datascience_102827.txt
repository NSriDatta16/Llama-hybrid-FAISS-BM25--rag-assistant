How to predict the winner of a future sports match?

I am trying to create a machine learning model to predict the winner of an upcoming cricket tournament (winners of all matches in the tournament). I have couple of questions here: What kind of input data can I use for training? I can't use information like who won the toss, how much did the teams score in each innings, etc because I wouldn't be having those data for the final prediction dataset What kind of algorithms should I be looking at? The prediction should be having one of the two teams participating in the match. How do I tell this to the model? Or should I build a multiclass model which predicts one of the all possible teams? Any inputs on how to proceed further will be very useful for me because I have never worked on sports based data/models earlier.
