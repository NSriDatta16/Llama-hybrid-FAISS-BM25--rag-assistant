This may not be the most elegant solution, but you could set a property in the parent control panel (subclass panel) that is a bool value like "bool selected". Then when the MouseEnter for the panel fires set it to true...then stop the mouseleave logic from firing unless it is set to false. example bool selected; MouseEnter(..,..) { if (!selected) selected = true; else selected = false; if (selected) /.. Logic Here ../ } MouseLeave() { if (selected) return; /.. Logic Here ../ } In reality I would just have the MouseLeave event of the child set the parameter. Example: Parent: bool doLeave; MouseLeave(..,..) { if (doLeave) { /.. Logic ../ doLeave = false; } Child: MouseLeave(..., ...) { DerivedPanel parent = this.Parent as DerivedPanel; if (parent != null) parent.doLeave = true; } Neither are elegant but it will work.
