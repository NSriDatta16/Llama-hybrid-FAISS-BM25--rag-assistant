Regarding the paid apps, you should be able to manage this through iTunes without downloading or buying again. For example, I've developed an application for my iPhone. I removed it off the device when 1.0 was released and downloaded it using a promo code. When I was coding/testing version 1.1 I would push it onto the phone through Xcode, essentially 'stepping' on the paid app. Whenever I wanted to go back to the 1.0-officially-downloaded-version, I would uncheck the app in iTunes, sync, then recheck. I could also have removed the dev version through XCode organizer and then used iTunes to put the purchased app back on. Hope that makes sense.
