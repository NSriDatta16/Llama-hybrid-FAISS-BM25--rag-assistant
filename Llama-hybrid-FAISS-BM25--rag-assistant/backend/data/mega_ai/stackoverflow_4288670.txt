How to transmit UIEvent to UIResponders below

I have many small UIButtons and a large one that covers them all. The small UIButtons should all react to UIControlEventTouchDownRepeat and call a selector. The big UIButton only has to react to UIControlEventTouchDragInside. The big UIButton however, consumes all touches, and the UIControlEventTouchDownRepeat event doesn't reach the small buttons underneath. How can I solve this?
