I really like AlbertoPL's time-based approach, but he doesn't factor in the clicks. Its easy to demonstrate pathological cases where clicks are relevant: Client A offers $1000 for 1 click or 10,000 impressions Client B offers $1000 for 5000 clicks or 10,000 impressions. Any reasonable person would give the 1-click guy higher priority. The calculation is actually pretty trivial: assume your click-through is 100 impressions per click. Client A wants 10,000 impressions or 1 click, so we require a bare minimum of 100 impressions to get paid. At a cost of $1000 per 100 impressions, you can figure that your client is willing to pay $10/impression. Client B wants 10,000 impressions or 5000 clicks. 5000 clicks requires 500,000 impressions, we'll clearly meet the 10,000 impression mark before then, so we assume the client is really offering to pay $1000 for 10,000 impressions, or $0.10/impression. We maximize revenue by maximizing our $$$$$/impression, so client A takes priority. Let's use the figures provided in the OP: Client 1: 10,000 impressions in the next 10 days for $10,000 dollars = minimum of 10,000 impressions * $1/impression / 10 days = $1000/day Client 2: 1,000 impressions for $100 dollars = minimum of 1,000 impressions * $.01/impression / 365 days = $0.27/day. Client 3: 1,000 clicks or 10,000 impressions for $5000 = min(100,000 impressions to get 1,000 clicks, 10,000 impressions) = 10,000 impressions for $5000 = minimum of 10,000 impressions * $0.5/impression / 365 = $13.7/day. Clients take priority based on how much they pay per day.
