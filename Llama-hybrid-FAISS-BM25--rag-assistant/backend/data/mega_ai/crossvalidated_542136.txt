Local linear trend model versus ARIMA

I was told that the local linear trend model also called 'basic structural model': $\mu_t=\mu_{t-1}+\beta_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ $\beta_t=\beta_{t-1}+\xi_t$ Is 'equivalent' to an ARIMA(0,1,1) That's not obvious to me, Can anyone give me some references on the equivalence between structural time series models and arima models ?
