Methods for analyzing food diary (time series CSV) to correlate foods to symptoms

Background The doctor recommended that I keep a food diary to try and figure out what foods are correlated to the symptoms I experience. However, they didn't have a recommendation for a method to analyze the collected data (apparently normal people don't do that!) ... so I figured, I can do statistics using python, right? While I'm very familiar with python, unfortunately my statistics background is weak. As a starting point, I would like to know which foods are more correlated with which symptoms. Knowing what statistical method(s) to use to analyze this type of data would be a great starting point, python code would be even better. The data I have transcribed my food diary into CSV similar to this form: time,event 2018-07-12 16:30:00,food1 2018-07-12 16:35:00,food2 2018-07-12 17:00:00,symptom1 2018-07-12 17:05:00,symptom2 2018-07-12 18:10:00,food1 ... etc, etc It was trivial to load the data into jupyter+pandas+matplotlib and make scatterplots showing the data (which is cool, but not super helpful yet). I've been reading about various ways to one could analyze time series data, but a lot of that doesn't quite fit what I'm trying to do. My specific question Given data of the form shown above, how does one determine that particular named items are correlated with other named items? For example, "86% of the time food1 occurs 90 minutes before symptom1" A subproblem: My google searches for time series data analysis seems to yield answers that all involve numbers, whereas this data is just a list of things and isn't very numerical (other than that it's a time series). If I load the data into pandas and call data.corr() , it gives me an empty dataframe. How does one typically overcome that?
