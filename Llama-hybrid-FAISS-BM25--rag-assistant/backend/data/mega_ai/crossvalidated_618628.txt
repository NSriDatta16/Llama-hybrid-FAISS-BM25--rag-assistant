Compare regression coefficients among subgroups

I have a following issue. Suppose that I would like to know, how age of a marathon runner impacts his or her final marathon time. I run two separated regressions (for men and women): Men: $time = \alpha_{0}^{M} + \beta_{1}^{M} \cdot age$ Women: $time = \alpha_{0}^{W} + \beta_{1}^{W} \cdot age$ Of course, men are faster than women. Based on my summary statistics I know that average marathon runners time is $men = \dfrac{2}{3} women$ . My goal is to see if age variable more affects men' or women' time. Is it statistically correct to test if $\beta_{1}^{M} \cdot \dfrac{2}{3} = \beta_{1}^{W} $ ? And the same for the standard error of $\beta_{1}^{M}$ and $\beta_{1}^{W}$ ?
