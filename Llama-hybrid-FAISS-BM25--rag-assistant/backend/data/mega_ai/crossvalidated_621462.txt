distributions in "A Note on the Inception Score"

I'm reading the following paper A Note on the Inception Score . IS is a evaluation metric for GAN. While reading the paper I got very confused about the notation of so called distributions. I will first list a few other questions that seem to relevant but do not completely answer my questions. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66058029/probability-distribution-and-data-distribution-in-ml https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/54346/data-generating-probability-distribution-probability-distribution-of-a-dataset https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26009/what-does-it-mean-for-the-training-data-to-be-generated-by-a-probability-distrib/54342#54342 In section 3 we can find this statement Suppose we are trying to evaluate a trained generative model G that encodes a distribution $p_g$ over images x. We can sample from $p_g$ as many times as we would like, but do not assume that we can directly evaluate $p_g$ . And then in section 3.2 where x âˆ¼ $p_g$ indicates that x is an image sampled from $p_g$ , $D_{KL}(p ||q)$ is the KL-divergence between the distributions $p$ and $q$ , $p(y|x)$ is the conditional class distribution, and $p(y) =\int_x p(y|x)p_g(x)$ is the marginal class distribution. 1. The first question picks up a question from https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/54346/data-generating-probability-distribution-probability-distribution-of-a-dataset : What does $p_g(x)$ mean in plain english? I get that it is a data distribution, and we can sample from it . And given that x is a generated image by G, how does it fit together with $p_g(x)$ Can it also be "What is the probability that the generated sample x does indeed came from $p_g$ " or is it the likelihood that x was produced by $p_g$ etc. 2. Then we have conditional class distribution $p(y|x)$ . I have a hard time visualizing this in my head. My guess is that is probably means $p(Y=y|X=x)$ , so we have 2 random variables and $y$ is the class label and $x$ is an image. How would I plot such information? If I just have $p(Y=y)$ where y is the class information one can easily visualize this distribution. Is the same possible for $p(y|x)$ ? 3. The formula for $p(y)$ is given by $p(y) =\int_x p(y|x)p_g(x)$ . Earlier it is said that we but do not assume that we can directly evaluate $p_g$ So what does $p_g(x)$ refers to in this case? And what does $\int_x$ refers to in this case? Can you give an example?(maybe the probability of class $2$ )
