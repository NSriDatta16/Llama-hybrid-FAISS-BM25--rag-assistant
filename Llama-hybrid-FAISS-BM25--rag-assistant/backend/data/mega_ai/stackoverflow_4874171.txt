Get config data to javascript file - magento

I have a really simple requirement but cant find a good solution to it. How do I get config data into javascript files within magento. I need to load some config data from a module and make it available from within some javascript code. Without loading this data onto hidden fields on the page or using ajax to fetch them from a controller - how do i do this? Thank you in advance for any help.
