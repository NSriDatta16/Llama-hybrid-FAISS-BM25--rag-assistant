This doesn't work and it isn't doing quite what you think it is. Your use of the c-style cast: (Foo*) bar is incorrect in this case. What you are trying to do is upcast the Bar* to a Foo* (i.e., perform a static_cast from a pointer to a dervied class to a pointer to a base class). Since the definition of Bar is not available at this point, however, the compiler does not know that Foo is a base class of Bar . Thus, the static_cast fails and the compiler falls back and uses a reinterpret_cast , which is not at all the same thing.
