CHARs are still faster for processing than VARCHARs in the DBMS I know well. Their fixed size allow for optimizations that aren't possible with VARCHARs. In addition, the storage requirements are slightly less for CHARS since no length has to be stored, assuming most of the rows need to fully, or near-fully, populate the CHAR column. This is less of an impact (in terms of percentage) with a CHAR(30) than a CHAR(4). As to usage, I tend to use CHARs when either: the fields will generally always be close to or at their maximum length (stock codes, employee IDs, etc); or the lengths are short (less than 10). Anywhere else, I use VARCHARs.
