Rails: " Draggable_elements" not working inside table elements

We are trying to implement a functionality in our ROR application such that we are able to drag and drop rows between different tables. We tried using Scriptaculous Drag and Drop method but it does not works inside the table tags. Can you point us to other alternatives like JQuery etc which might be useful. Thanks Supreet
