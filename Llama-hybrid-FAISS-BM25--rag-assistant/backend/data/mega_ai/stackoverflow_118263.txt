Yes you can, and some of the reasons you make makes perfect sense. I did a talk on the HTML bridge at CodeCampNZ some weeks back, and have a good collection of resources up on my blog. I also recommend checking out Wilco Bauwers blog for lots of detail on the HTML bridge. Some other scenarios for non visual Silverlight: Writing new code in a managed language (C#, Ruby, JScript.NET, whatever) instead of native (interpreted) JavaScript. Using OpenFileDialog to read files on the client, without round-tripping to the server. Storing transient data securely on the client in isolated storage. Improving responsiveness and performance by executing work in the background through a BackgroundWorker or by using ordinary threads. Accessing cross-domain data via the networking APIs. Retrieving real-time data from the server via sockets. Binding data by re-using WPF's data-binding engine.
