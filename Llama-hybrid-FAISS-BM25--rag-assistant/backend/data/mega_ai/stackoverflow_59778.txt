Would something like this work? from random import randint mcworks = [] for n in xrange(NUM_ITERATIONS): mctest = [randint(0, 100) for i in xrange(5)] if sum(mctest[:3])/3 == mcavg[2]: mcworks.append(mctest) # mcavg is real data In the end, you are left with a list of valid mctest lists. What I changed: Used a list comprehension to build the data instead of a for loop Used random.randint to get random integers Used slices and sum to calculate the average of the first three items (To answer your actual question :-) ) Put the results in a list mcworks , instead of creating a new variable for every iteration
