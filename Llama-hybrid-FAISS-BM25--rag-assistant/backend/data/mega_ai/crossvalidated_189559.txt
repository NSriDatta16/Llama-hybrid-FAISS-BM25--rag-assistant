logistic regression model when the correlation is insignificant

I'm new to statistics. I want to ask if i have two continuous variables with insignificant correlation between them, but when I converted one of them into binary outcome (according to its cutoff point) and it was entered to logistic regression model as a dependent variable and the other variable as independent variable (continuous) the P value was significant. is it possible? or in other words is it meaningful?
