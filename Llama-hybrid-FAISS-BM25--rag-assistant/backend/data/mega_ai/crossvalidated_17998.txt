Just to rephrase this: this appears to merely involve fitting GLMs over local partitions, with partitioning granularity essentially already defined. There is a maximum granularity (i.e. the white boxes) and the path from the minimum granularity of partitioning to the maximum is defined by splits that produce the boxes (i.e. somewhat less granular than every box would be a combination of local boxes). Is that correct? If this is correct, then you can define a decision tree with logistic regression performed on leaf nodes. Partitioning splits involve membership in a box or an aggregate of boxes. If the number of boxes is small, you can decide whether to do bottom-up aggregation or top-down splitting. Within each region, just do logistic regression. FWIW, this is an interesting problem, with the possibility of extensions to spatial modeling.
