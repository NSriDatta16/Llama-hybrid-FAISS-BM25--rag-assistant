What are the assumptions for checking the stationarity of a time series?

I am checking stationarity or non-stationarity of a time series with R and I am using adf.test and kpss.test in tseries package. What are the assumptions for these tests? Is following a Gaussian distribution by the data set one of the assumption? If yes, what can we do for non-Gaussian time series? Also, is using the default options for lag order in ADF which is $k = \text{trunc}((\text{length}(x)-1)^{1/3})$ a safe assumption? Thank you
