A weighted average is what an ARIMA model is Seeking certain type of ARIMA explanation . It is the answer to ...the double question ...1) how many values should I include AND 2) how do I weight/leverage them in order to get a "representative value". Thus it is BOTH a smoother and a forecaster .. When you specify a 3 period equally-weighted average for either smoothing or forecasting ...you are specifying an arima model (3,0,0)(0,0,0) with coefficients = 1/3 , 1/3 and 1/3 WITHOUT a constant. Obviously one might specify a 3 period weighted aveage where the weights are optimized ... as is often the case. What you may be looking for is a way for your software to determine both "how many" and "how important" the previous values are and not just assume some form of a model like ets. Also see Identifying Early Indicators Time Series Analysis for an example of a 3 period autoregressive ( really 3 period moving average in common parlance ) in practice. One final distinction is that smoothing "centers" the result by using the value 1 period before , the current value and the value 1 period in the future period after the current period whereas forecasting uses the value 3 periods before , 2 periods before and 1 period before to predict the next value.
