As a first step you should try logistic regression on your tf-idf vectors. It is simple to implement and would provide a good baseline for comparison. You can find an implementation in whatever language you're using. You could also try some kind of ( perhaps supervised ) topic modeling to create a better feature space, but that would be more involved.
