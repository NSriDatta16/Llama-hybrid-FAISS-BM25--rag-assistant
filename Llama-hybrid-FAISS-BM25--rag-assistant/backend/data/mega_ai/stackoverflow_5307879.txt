images in no cache pages

I have this code in my secure aspx pages Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(false); Questions: 1. What happens to the images in these pages? Will the images be downloaded for each request? 2. If the images are downloaded everytime, is there a way to cache only the images, while rest of the content is not cached? My only concern is the time consumed for each request to these pages. If the images are downloaded each time, the pages will take time to load for slower internet connections.
