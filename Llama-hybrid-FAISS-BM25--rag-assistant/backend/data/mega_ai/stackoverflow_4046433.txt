Subversion, maybe other [d]vcs as well, supports symbolic links. The idea is to store raw data 'well organized' on a filesystem, while tracking the relation between 'script' and 'generated date' with symbolic links under version control. data -> data-1.2.3 All your scripts will call load data to retrieve a given dataset, being linked through versioned symbolic link to a given dataset. Using this approach, code and calculated datasets are tracked within one tool, without bloating your repository with binary data.
