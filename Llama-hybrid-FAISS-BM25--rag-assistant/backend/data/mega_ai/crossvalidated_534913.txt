How to improve Gaussian Process Regression fit: reducing oscillations and narrowing confidence interval

I’m trying to fit a model y=f(x1, x2) to some measurements using GPR. For each instance (x1i, x2i) there are two measurements of y. I’m using the following kernel: WhiteKernel + ConstantKernel * RBF The result is adequate but not quite right yet, there are mainly two problems: The average predicted value does pass through the measured values but there is some “oscillations” overshoot/undershoot between some points. This is shown with the red arrow in the images below. The 90% confidence intervals increase too much between some measurement points. This is shown with the black arrows in the images below. How should I specify the kernel to get better results? Do you have any tips for me?
