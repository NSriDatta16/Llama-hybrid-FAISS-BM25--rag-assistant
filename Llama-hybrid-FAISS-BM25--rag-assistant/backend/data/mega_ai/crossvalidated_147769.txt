I assume you mean things like likelihood to purchase, percentage of respondent above 18 year age, percentage of women in segment etc. by your line I need to be able to explain either the PCAs or the segments with other data If this is the case, lets say you have 500 responses from survey and you get 2 clusters from survey. Further if cluster 1 has a size of 200 respondents(40%) and cluster 2 has 300 respondents(60%). Lets say in cluster 1, likelihood to purchase is 15% Now i believe you have calculated "Error Margin" by using sample size, population size at 95 percent confidence level. Lets imagine your Error Margin is 1.96 If we repeat this exercise 100 times over with random respondents, 95 times likelihood to purchase with people who might fall into cluster 1 with similar behavioral characteristics (gender, age level or income level proportion), will be in the range of 13.04% and 16.96%
