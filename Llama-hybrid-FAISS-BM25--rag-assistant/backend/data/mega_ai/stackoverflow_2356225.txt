I am aware this is quite an old post, but if you are still interested, this is how I'd go about doing it: Add a script or jar that containing a function / method that would convert a number to a textual representation. To do this, for example, create a server-side-utilities.js file and in the 'Resource Explorer' tab add the resource. Then, in the 'properties editor' for the report itself, click the 'resources' tab and add that JS file. Then edit the JS file to include a function that converts a number to text and save it. Then in your dataset dialog add a computed column, name it, set data type to string, and set the expression to invoke the defined function, passing to the function the value of the relevant column, e.g. convertNumberToText(row["NUMERIC_COL"]) . A partial implementation of convertNumberToText() might be: function convertNumberToText(number) { var text; switch (number) { case 1: { text = "One"; break; } default: text = "Unsupported number"; } return text; }
