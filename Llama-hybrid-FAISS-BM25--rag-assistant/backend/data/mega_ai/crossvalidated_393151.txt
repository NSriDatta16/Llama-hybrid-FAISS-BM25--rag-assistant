Forecasting in R - really short time-series

Complete noob on forecasting and time-series here. I'm doing my PhD and my group did previous research on the prevalence of the disease we're studying. We only have prevalence data of 5 years and would like to forecast it to following years - so 5 datapoints and respective CIs. We already calculated the moving average to try and estimate the prevalence of the following years but would like to compare different models/methods to find the most robust one. I have ran a couple of simple forecasting methods in R (found on Rob Hyndman's book) but cannot tell if what I'm doing is actually feasible. I'm guessing it is not due to the sample size. Would much appreciate your wisdom. Thank you!
