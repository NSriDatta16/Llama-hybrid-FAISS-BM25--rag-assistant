If you're not ashamed of monkeypatching and abusing syntax, this would work: class String def | x if empty? then x else self end end end Then you can say word.infinitive | word , which actually scans fairly naturally, if you ask me. However, I think a better idea would be to modify the infinitive method, or add a version of it that returns the word unchanged. Edit: Here's a possibly more elegant solution: [word.infinitive, word].find {|x| not x.empty?}
