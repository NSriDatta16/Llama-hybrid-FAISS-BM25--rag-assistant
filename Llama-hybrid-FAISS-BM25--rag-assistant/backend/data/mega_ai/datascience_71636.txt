Standardizing features by one specific feature

I am working on a project with a dataset that looks something like the following: velocity accel_amp f_vert tau_vert f_pitch_filt tau 0 3.778595 -5.796777 2.400000 32.753227 1.600000 27.844535 1 1.970611 -6.087134 2.272727 32.638705 1.704545 30.639998 2 3.581163 -6.241817 2.400000 32.850969 1.600000 30.449256 3 4.735210 -6.109532 1.400000 28.809865 1.000000 127.749313 4 5.340568 -6.614317 1.400000 20.249699 1.000000 124.549628 I was suggested to standardize the last 5 features by velocity in order to improve my PCA. Does this simply mean to take each element in these last 5 columns, subtract the mean of the velocity column, and then divide by the standard deviation of the velocity column? That is how I interpreted this suggestion. Is there a functionality in Python for doing this? Any suggestions or clarification would be appreciated. Thanks.
