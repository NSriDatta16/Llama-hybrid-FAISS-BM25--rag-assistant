How to NSKeyedUnarchive subclasses of NSManagedObject to import into Core Data?

An existing document based application that saves and loads it's data using NSKeyedArchiver / NSKeyedUnarchiver is currently transformed to use Core Data as it's storage backend. Now I am trying to have a kind of import of files saved using the former application. The object structure didn't change, but I changed all objects to be NSManagedObject s. Now the initWithCoder: calls [super initWithCoder:] and doesn't create the object using NSEntityDescription . That failes epically (as expected). My question is: what is the best practice / a good advice to have such an import functionality?
