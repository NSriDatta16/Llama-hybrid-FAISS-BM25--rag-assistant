Using `relu` as activation function for regression with only positive values

I'm building a deep learning model to predict times of arrival. By definition, the time of arrival is always positive. I'm wondering if I can use a relu as the activation function of my last layer to force the predictions to be always non-negative. On one hand, seems intuitive that this should work, but I'm not sure if there's some effect that I'm not considering. Thank you for your help!
