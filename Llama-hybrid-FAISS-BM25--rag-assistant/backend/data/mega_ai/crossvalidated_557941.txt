You do not give enough information for a definitive answer. Ordinarily, 'users' would be experimental units. Depending on what response you record for each uses. If Yes/No to 'conversion', then you'd compare proportions of 'Yes's; if dollar amount or size of order, then maybe compare using a t or Wilcoxon test. Also, you give no clue whether there is pairing between recipients of Algorithms A and B; if so, you'd have to use a paired test. In the examples below, I am assuming that data are not paired. Example 1 (Yes/No): If there were 87 'Yes's out of 1000 users from A, and 73 out of 950 users from B, then a prop.test in R would give results as shown below. At the 5% level, there is no significant difference between proportions $0.087$ and $0.077$ of 'Yes's; the P-value is $0.415 > 0.05 = 5\%.$ prop.test(c(87, 73), c(1000, 950), cor=F) 2-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: c(87, 73) out of c(1000, 950) X-squared = 0.66741, df = 1, p-value = 0.414 alternative hypothesis: two.sided 95 percent confidence interval: -0.01417267 0.03448846 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.08700000 0.07684211 Example 2 (normally distributed dollar amounts): Suppose you have the following fictitious data. At the 5% level, a Welch 2-sample t test finds a significant difference between observed average dollar amounts \$300.64 and \$326.93. The P-value (very near 0) is less than 5%. set.seed(2021) a = rnorm(1000, 300, 50) # NORM(mean 300, sd 50) b = rnorm( 950, 325, 40) # NORM(mean 326, sd 40) t.test(a, b) # test null means =, vs not = Welch Two Sample t-test data: a and b t = -12.652, df = 1888.6, p-value Example 3 (non-normal ordinal data): We use the same data as in Example 2, but ignore that they are normally distributed. Thus, we use a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test to see if 'locations' of responses from A and B are equal. Again here, there is a significant difference in population locations (some would say population medians) because of the P-value very near 0. wilcox.test(a, b) Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: a and b W = 325030, p-value These are only three of many types of examples that might have been provided. If you have data or can give more information about what kind of data you anticipate, maybe the clues above will help you to provide what is needed for a specific answer. Addendum on chi-squared per Comment: Using a $2\times 2$ table with chisq.test (omitting the Yates correction) gives the same result as prop.test . A = c(87,913); B = c(73, 877) TBL = rbind(A,B) TBL [,1] [,2] A 87 913 B 73 877 chisq.test(TBL, cor=F) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: TBL X-squared = 0.66741, df = 1, p-value = 0.414
