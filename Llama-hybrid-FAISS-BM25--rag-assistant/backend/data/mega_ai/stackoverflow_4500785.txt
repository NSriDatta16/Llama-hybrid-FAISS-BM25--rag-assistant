How can I exclude South migrations from coverage reports using coverage.py

I use coverage.py to check the test coverage of my django application. However since I use South for my database migrations, all those files show up with 0% and mess up the overall percentage. I already tried using --omit=*migrations* in both run and report (and both) but that didn't work. I tried versions 3.4 and latest revision from Bitbucket as of Dec 20th 2010 with the same result. Any ideas how I can get coverage.py to actually ignore the migrations folders?
