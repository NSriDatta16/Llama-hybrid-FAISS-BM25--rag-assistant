tadman (Thanks!) pointed me towards the right solution: All I had to do was change the value from tempfile to to_tempfile. This prabably won't happen to too many people, but I thought I'd mention as there has been a similar discussion around that due to a recent change in stable rails 3.0.3 by tenderlove, which is philisophically absolutely correct - but threw off some people... So here is the changed fragment of fix_params.rb ... if value.has_key?(:to_tempfile) upload = value[:to_tempfile] ... Cheers, Val
