Interpreting output from cross correlation function in R

I am working with two time series and I am interested in understanding the relationship between them. As a first step, I checked the cross correlation function (using ccf() in R). The output of my code is shown below, where I'm running ccf(x,y) . As I understand it, the conclusion here is that x at time t+k is negatively correlated with y at time t , where the lag, k = 2,3,4,5,6 . I'm really surprised by this because my hypothesis was that x would lead to negative changes in y , and therefore I expected to see the negative correlation at negative values of the lag, k . In fact, I can't think of how changes in y might induce a change in x at some point in the future, despite what I see here. Is my interpretation of the output correct? I assume so after running some tests of the form: x But given how surprised by the result I feel, I want to double check. Assuming that my interpretation is correct, could there any other explanation for this almost sinusoidal shape I see in the results? (I'm thinking that perhaps there is some feature to my data that could artificially cause these shapes - I've no intuition around this!). I've got multiple independent experiments featuring these time series and I see a sinusoidal pattern in a majority of them (although the 'sine wave' has a different amplitude and frequency from plot to plot). I'd also love to hear of alternative approaches to quantifying the relationship between two time-series.
