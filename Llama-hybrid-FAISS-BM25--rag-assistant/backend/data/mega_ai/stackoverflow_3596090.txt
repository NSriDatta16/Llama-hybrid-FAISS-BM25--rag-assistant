@All: I added following to user.js file ( link text ) and it helped. Now neither my FF browser nor OS type never recognised by any website even by those showed through iframe like adsence. user_pref("general.useragent.appName", "replacement string for appNameCode"); user_pref("general.appname.override", "replacement string for appName"); user_pref("general.useragent.override", "replacement string for userAgent"); user_pref("general.appversion.override", "replacement string for appVersion"); user_pref("general.platform.override", "replacement string for Platform"); Now it is left to override following screen.width, screen.heigh, screen.colorDepth but these objects seems unable to be overridden via user.js file. So far only one idea: ... most likely FireFox JS engine retrieves these values from OS, hence I need to know which file in Linux (Ubuntu) stores these values and temporary change it when I need. With any WIN OS it would be mush harder to do since it stores everything in damn registries. Am I right ? Any more ideas ? Regards
