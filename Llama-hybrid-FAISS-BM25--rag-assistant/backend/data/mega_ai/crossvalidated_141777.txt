The Hadri Lagrange test for unit root is implemented within Stata, but, as you undoubtedly know already, requires strongly balanced data. You might wish to explore using multiple imputation appropriate to cross-sectional time series in multiple populations along the lines of King and Honaker's R software Amelia II: A Program for Missing Data . You can produce multiple data sets (say, 10) using a multiple imputation technique appropriate for your kind of data, calculate Hadri's z test statistic for each, and determine whether each imputated data set comes to the same conclusion. Agreement (either rejection or failure to reject) might be reasonable support for evidence of/lack of evidence of unit root. Lack of agreement across the data, would suggest that stationarity your data may depend strongly on the values of the missing observations. Honaker, J. and King, G. (2010).
