Creating a morphology tagging/labeling model

I had an idea of building a model using machine learning or deep learning in order to perform morphological tagging/labeling on untagged/unlabeled data. I have a lot of tagged/labeled data (about 30,000-40,000 entries), so I thought of creating this model to help the ones that are responsible for it to avoid this task in the future. The problem is I don't know where to start and when I searched the web about it I found almost nothing helpful, I want to do it in a Semitic language . How can I accomplish such a task? I've searched the web a lot about it but I mostly get stuff that is not Semitic language and not morphological way.
