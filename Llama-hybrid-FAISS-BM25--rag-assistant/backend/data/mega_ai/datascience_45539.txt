Any special considerations on learning based on a cyclic timeseries using LSTM?

I have a time-serie over one year. For each 15 minutes in daylight hours, there is a data point. So basically, a sequence for each day. I would like to benefit this information if possible, I mean resemblance in day sequences. Logically, and without a special knowledge, using RNN blindly on the whole year sequence, might or might not learn from days hypes, although, In the best scenario, the network will learn it all. In other words, How could I tell the LSTM network, for the next 62 data points, it is a sequence, that goes relatively up and down in the same way. If it changes anything, I'm using Tensorflow and Keras, and still a n00b.
