Arimax modelling with R

I have four independent time series variables data of which two are stationary and one is l(1) stationary and other one is I(2) stationary.the dependent time series data is stationary. Can someone tell me how to do an arimax modelling in R as I am very new to R I tried to use auto.arima as my dataset is very small or only 40observations..but it is not working. A sample R command would be highly useful
