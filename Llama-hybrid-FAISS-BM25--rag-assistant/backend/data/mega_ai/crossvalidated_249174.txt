How to evaluate the model performance under multiclass random forest fitting?

I just use the code to run random forest for multiclass response. I binarize the output to apply the ROC score for model performance. Could someone can advice other methods for the performance validation? cheers rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1000,oob_score=True,class_weight = 'balanced') results=rf.fit(X_train,np.ravel(y_train)) roc_auc_score(y_test,results.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1])
