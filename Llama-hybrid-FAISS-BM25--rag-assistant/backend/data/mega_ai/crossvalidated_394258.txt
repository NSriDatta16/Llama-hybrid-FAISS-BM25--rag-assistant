One major aspect that I don't see in current answers is evolution . A child's brain does not learn from scratch. It's similar to asking how deer and giraffe babies can walk a few minutes after birth. Because they are born with their brains already wired for this task. There is some fine-tuning needed of course, but the baby deer doesn't learn to walk from "random initialization". Similarly, the fact that big moving objects exist and are important to keep track of is something we are born with. So I think the presupposition of this question is simply false. Human neural networks had the opportunity to see tons of - maybe not cars but - moving, rotating 3D objects with difficult textures and shapes etc., but this happened through lots of generations and the learning took place by evolutionary algorithms, i.e. the ones whose brain was better structured for this task, could live to reproduce with higher chance, leaving the next generation with better and better brain wiring from the start.
