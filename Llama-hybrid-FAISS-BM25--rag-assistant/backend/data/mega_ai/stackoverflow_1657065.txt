Modern C++ is a beautiful language . There, I said it. A lot of people really hate C++, but honestly, I find modern C++ with STL/Boost style programming to be a very expressive, elegant, and incredibly productive language most of the time. I think most people who hate C++ are basing that on bad experiences with OO. C++ doesn't do OO very well because polymorphism often depends on heap-allocated objects, and C++ doesn't have automatic garbage collection. But C++ really shines when it comes to generic libraries and functional-programming techniques which make it possible to build incredibly large, highly-maintainable systems. A lot of people say C++ tries to do everything, but ends up doing nothing very well. I'd probably agree that it doesn't do OO as well as other languages, but it does generic programming and functional programming better than any other mainstream C-based language. (C++0x will only further underscore this truth.) I also appreciate how C++ lets me get low-level if necessary, and provides full access to the operating system. Plus RAII. Seriously. I really miss destructors when I program in other C-based languages. (And no, garbage collection does not make destructors useless.)
