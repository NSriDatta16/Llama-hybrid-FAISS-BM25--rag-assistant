how to graphically represent the variance of a multidimensional variable

I would know which is the best way to plot in 2D the variance of an 8-dimensional variable. I have tried to do an average (for each vector) of each one of the 8 vector's values, therefore I have performed an 8 to 1 reduction, but I'm not sure whether this kind of procedure is correct.
