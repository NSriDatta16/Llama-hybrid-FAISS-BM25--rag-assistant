Positive-Only Training Classification in Spark ML in Scala

I've been reading the Spark ML documentation, but I can't seem to find any insights into how best to deal with training data that only has positives. In my use-case, I'm attempting to use a list of donors as my training set in order to determine likelihood that another list of people will donate. From all the examples I've found, training needs both positive and negative training in order effectively classify results. Is there an ideal way of accomplishing this in Spark machine learning?
