You should use IsolatedStorage for your file operations. What Is Isolated Storage? Running code with limited privileges has many benefits given the presence of predators who are foisting viruses and spyware on your users. The .NET Framework has several mechanisms for dealing with running as least-privileged users. Because most applications have to deal with storing some of their state in a persistent way (without resorting to databases or other means), it would be nice to have a place to store information that was safe to use without having to test whether the application has enough rights to save data to the hard drive. That solution is what isolated storage is designed to provide. By using isolated storage to save your data, you will have access to a safe place to store information without needing to resort to having users grant access to specific files or folders in the file system. The main benefit of using isolated storage is that your application will run regardless of whether it is running under partial, limited, or full-trust. You can refer to IsolatedStorageFileStream
