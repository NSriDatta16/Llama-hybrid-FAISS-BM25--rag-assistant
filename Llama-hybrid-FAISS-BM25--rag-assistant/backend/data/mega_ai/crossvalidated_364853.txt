How to interpret low loadings all over PC 1?

My PCA with prcomp in R results in very low "loadings" (i.e. eigenvectors, see figure below). I've tried a rotation with rotated_PCA = varimax(PCA_result$rotation) like suggested here , but it didn't help. Does that mean my scores don't relate to the original variables? The following PC loadings are low, too. I couldn't find any explanation in literature for interpreting low loadings. And it is still the same PC analysis like this one .
