Your 22 values suggest two diametrically opposed viewpoints/approaches. You have 11 values per cyscle. The first approach is to detect latent deterministic structure (i.e. unspecified causals ) ... in this case 7 of the 11 time points are statistically significant . 7 seasonal dummies reflecting 7 of the 11 periods were statistically significant . The augmented data set is here . The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here . This approach identifies and augments the observed data with 10 dummies and finds three of them to be not-significant. An alternate approach id to use the pure rear-window approach (arima) which simply believes that the past should be the basis for the forecast ignoring the fact that the past never causes the future and is only a proxy for omitted causal variables. Using this approach the "found model" is here where the value 11 periods is the best estimate of a future value. Since the observed series is DETERMINISTIC , the resulting forecasts (BUT NOT INTERPRETATION) are identical. My rational mind leaning on "causes" rather than simple memory strongly suggests that in this case approach 1 is not only the better strategy but it is sufficient , if not parsimonious. My seasoned/general approach to time series modelling encompasses studying both approaches and seamlessly integrating both kinds of components when necessary along with any user-specified causal series. I hope that this brings some clarity to your question although I couldn't exactly answer or duplicate you results.
