If you want to create a new type at runtime, you'll need to use Reflection.Emit. Reflection.Emit allows you to emit Intermediate Language directly into the current AppDomain (or an assembly if you prefer.) You probably want to use the type in memory, so you may not want to create an actual assembly. Creating new type is done with the TypeBuilder class. Codeproject has an excellent introduction: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Creating_Dynamic_Types.aspx UPDATE: It has been brought to my attention that the goal is to add a C# code file to an existing project. You would still need to reflect into the assembly and emit IL, but then you'd have to "dissasemble" the IL into C#. Reflector is the #1 recommended tool for this , though I'm not sure it can be automated in the way you want.
