Java Large database inserts

I have a database in which I need to insert batches of data (around 500k records at a time). I was testing with derby and was seeing insert times of about 10-15minutes for this many records (I was doing a batch insert in Java). Does this time seem slow (working on your average laptop)? And are there approaches to speeding it up? thanks, Jeff
