ASP.NET provides extensive membership and role management APIs that are pretty easy to work with since version 2.0. They are available in ASP.NET MVC. Probably they do not require much more work than you would do anyway for styling or other stuff. But since you don't want to do it anyway, you can use a simple Web form with a Login control in your MVC app and make routing ignore that path with: routes.IgnoreRoute("SignIn.aspx"); Just drag a login control to SignIn.aspx as you would in any Web form app.
