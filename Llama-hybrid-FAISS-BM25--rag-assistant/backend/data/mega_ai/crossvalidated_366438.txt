Is it always a requirement to declare a distribution model first before applying MCMC models/bayesian analysis?

I've read lot of articles that is using pymc python module to apply MCMC algorithms into solving real life problems. I found that all the examples are about to assume various kinds of distribution models first e.g. Poisson, Normal, Beta distributions, to the variables. This seems like a "must have" requirement to use Bayesian analysis. My question is, how do we know in advance that what distribution model we should use that best applies on the usecase? Is it going to change the results a lot if we used a "wrong" distribution model? If this is a requirement, it seems it's a lot of more experience-related requirement. As a newbie, i really don't know too much more than very common distributions, how dare we could try some other distributions which require tons of more statistical knowledge before i use it? Saying that, if i know not enough distribution models in advance, is that implying that i cannot build well a MCMC model to real life problems?
