Without any context on the language that would near impossible to do. With only that the least you could do is using levenshtein distance and compute clusters based on that. Think of it like this supposed a normal people without prior knowledge of software engineering, I don't think people would even be able to do the task you asked. How people could know if pytorch and tensorflow is related without prior context. One other way you could do this is to do unsupervised training it using texts from StackOverflow, and after training extract the embedding for those words, compute similarity/distances and use clustering methods to generate clusters.
