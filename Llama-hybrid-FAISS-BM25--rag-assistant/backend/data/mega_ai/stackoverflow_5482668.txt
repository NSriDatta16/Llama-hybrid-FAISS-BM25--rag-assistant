MODE_PRIVATE will create the file (or replace a file of the same name) and make it private to your application. String FILENAME = "hello_file"; String string = "hello world!"; FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE); fos.write(string.getBytes()); fos.close(); But this will store the file on the phone storage. You can't make private file on the sd card because every application has access to the sd card will the same privileges.
