The lottery aspect seems fair. It is not transparent how the draw_numbers are generated, but if they are random then it doesn't matter whether or not the final draw for the starting position seems more or less beneficial for different people. The draw_numbers being random make that anybody could have had this beneficial position. However, the matching system does not need to be fair. These problems have to balance several aspects and none of them are fully optimised in any algorithm (see for an example the stable marriage problem an for a more in-depth treatment this article: "The Performance of School Assignment Mechanisms in Practice" ). The systems have aspect like stability Whether or not there can be people that would like to change after the matching is over (people that somehow end up with each others preference) strategy proof Whether or not the applicants can fill in a different order of preferences than their true preferences in order to gain some advantage in the matching. E.g. if your second choice is a school with a lot of places free then you might not choose this (and choose a school with few places) if this can increase your chances for your first option. efficiency Do most applicants reach their most preferred places? (This is a vague expression, and can be quantified in different ways. But the point is whether you get in average students in the best place.) fairness/envy-free Do students get in a place with equal probability? Is the placement of students fair. Example of envy: Your lottery system seems almost like this. Without the rule, Someone with a lower score in first choice gets preference over another with higher score but second choice. , then there is a single tie-breaking lottery for all students. Say if the starting position is 191, then it seems like you are through because draw_number 190 has bad luck and you with draw_number 163 are in. However, it can be the case that the applicant with draw number 162 is missing out on their first, second, third, etc choice, because those schools are already full. Then, if their last choice is your first choice school, then they get in instead of you. Is it fair that somebody with a school on their last place of choice kicks out somebody with that school on the first place of their list of choices? Example of strategy behaviour: With the rule, Someone with a lower score in first choice gets preference over another with higher score but second choice. it means that the system creates an incentive for strategic behaviour. People might fear to give their first choice if this is a popular school with few places, because it might disadvantage them in their second choice.
