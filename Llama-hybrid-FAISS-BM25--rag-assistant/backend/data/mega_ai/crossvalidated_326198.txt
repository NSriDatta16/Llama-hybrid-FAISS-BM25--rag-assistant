XGBClassifier and XGBRegressor

I am a newbie to Xgboost and I would like to use it for regression, in particular, car prices prediction. I started following a tutorial on XGboost which uses XGBClassifier and objective= 'binary:logistic' for classification and even though I am predicting prices, there is an option for objective = 'reg:linear' in XGBClassifier. 1) Should XGBClassifier and XGBRegressor always be used for classification and regression respectively? 2) Why does objective ='reg:linear' option even exist for XGBClassifier? Shouldn't it be only available in XGBRegressor? 3) Is "explained variance" the best metric for regression model evaluation? or perhaps RMSE?
