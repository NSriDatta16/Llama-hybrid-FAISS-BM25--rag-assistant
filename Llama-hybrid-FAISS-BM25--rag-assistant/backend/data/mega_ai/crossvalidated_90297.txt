If this is all the data you have, and it isn't organized by patient, then you could do two chi-square tests. However, you say you are doing a chart review. In that case, for each patient I would have an outcome: Completely recovered, partly recovered, not recovered. Then I would do an ordinal logistic regression. The independent variables would include the drug (X, Y, none) and sensible covariates for the disease you are considering (drawn from the literature). I would also strongly consider combining these into a propensity score, as @Charles suggested (+1 to him)
