Specific question about the effect of an omitted variable on a regression model

Suppose an independent variable that is influential in the data generating process for some dependent variable is omitted. The omitted variable has the following characteristics: It is NOT correlated with any of the included independent variables It is correlated with the dependent variable (implied by the fact that it is influential in the data generating process) What effect do we expect this omission to have on the model? My intuition tells me that it should not significantly impact the coefficients of the included independent variables. Instead, the influence that would have been described by its coefficient is instead captured in the error term. Is my understanding correct? Can this be proven? Does the answer differ if considering bayesian regression instead of classical regression?
