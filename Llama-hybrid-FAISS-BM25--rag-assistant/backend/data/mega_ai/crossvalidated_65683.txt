How to select the optimal combination of input variables for supervised learning model?

While working on a specific assignment, where the goal was to predict the outcome class, I tried several models (neural networks, logistic regression and my custom prediction model) with several combinations of 3 available input variables. What I found interesting is that the models with two variables outperformed the models with 3 input variables and I would be glad to find some theoretical explanation for such outcome. Does anyone know, whether there are any sistematic approaches to select the optimal set of input variables? If the input variables are correlated among themself, does this reduce the accuracy of prediction model? Thank you.
