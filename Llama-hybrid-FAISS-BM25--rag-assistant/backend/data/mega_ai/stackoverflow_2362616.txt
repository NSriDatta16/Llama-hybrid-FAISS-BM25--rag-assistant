Please could you explain why it is you need two URI patterns pointing to the same controller. A better solution might be to use a separate controller for each of the two patterns and move any shared logic into your model. Forcing a unique controller for each routing pattern was an intentional design decision, so I'd be interested to hear more detail about your use case where you feel this isn't appropriate. I thought it was a waste creating another almost identical controller when I could've used the same controller and just checked if a parameter "filter" was present. Personally, I think it is cleaner to move the shared logic into the model and to keep your controllers skinny. To me it's not wasteful, it's just more organised - it will make your code easier to manage over time. If you really need to use the same controller you could always use a query parameter instead, that would work fine: api/resource/foo?filter=true That URI would be taken care of by the first route ('api/resource/:id' => 'custom') for free. But please consider using two controllers, I think that is a better approach.
