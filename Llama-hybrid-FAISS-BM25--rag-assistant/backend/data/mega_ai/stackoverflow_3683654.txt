If whatever is telling you (Pellet?) than an ontology is "OWL2" when it could otherwise state one of the profiles such as EL, QL or RL, then perhaps the ontology it is reporting about includes constructs that sit outside the expressivity of each of the profiles, but is otherwise included in the OWL2 specification. As I understand it, each of the profiles are based on different description logics (DLs) that are geared towards different purposes: OWL2 (DL) is based on the description logic SROIQ , and is geared towards ontologies with a high degree of expressivity in the language. Reasoning tasks can be relatively expensive in this language. OWL2-EL is based on EL++ , which is geared towards scalable reasoning in the TBox (i.e., polynomial-time reasoning for most inference tasks such as classification). OWL2-QL is based on DL-Lite , which is geared towards scalable query answering in the ABox (when dealing with lots of instance data and a relatively simple TBox). OWL2-RL is based on Description Logic Programs (DLP) , which has an expressivity that subsets that of OWL2 DL (the fragment that can be handled using logic programs). As far as I can tell, the catalogue you've linked to is up-to-date, but is a bit hard to use if you aren't familiar with logics and can identify the constructs covered by each language. The W3C OWL2 profiles page summarises the language expressivity of each of the profiles in OWL syntax. You could possibly refer to this to determine the intersecting expressivity of each of the OWL2 language profiles without having to interpret their semantics (in terms of DLs, which is hard to grasp unless you're comfortable with description logics, and in the case of OWL2-RL, description logic programs). Lastly, note that the OWL1 'profiles' of Full, DL and Lite each correspond to yet other description logics: OWL1 DL corresponds to the description logic SHOIN . OWL1 Lite corresponds to the description logic SHIF . OWL1 Full corresponds to an undecidable logic that at least supersets SHOIN (though, I'm not quite sure what this is exactly! :-)
