U-Net convolutional neural network

I am currently trying to understand how exactly the U-Net ( https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/ ) works and so far failed to understand some key points, which are the following: What is the purpose of using two convolutional layers in a row? Why does the max pooling operation double the number of feature channels? What is the purpose of merging the feature maps from the contracting and expanding path? Could somebody please elaborate these points above?
