I have had this happen to me and it seems that the server decides to randomly clean up PHP sessions. I think it does this when it is having memory issues...which is why its random and having nothing to do with timeout settings. When this happens to you , can you associate it with a high load that may have happened on the webserver between the time you were logged in last ( or last held a session) ? Anyway, Since its all javascript there is no reason why you can't use PHP to output your js that gets and sets data to localstorage.
