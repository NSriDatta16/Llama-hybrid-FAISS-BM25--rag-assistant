Comparing player percentages effectiveness with different sample sizes

I have a spreadsheet of player data. One of the categories of player data is pass percentage. Pass percentage is calculated as follows: AccuratePasses/TotalPasses In total I have around 400 players to compare, however the sample size of passes between each player is very different. For example on player may have executed 1592 passes (1426 of which were accurate), and another may have executed only 7 passes (of which all were accurate). How can I use the data I have to extrapolate a score or ranking based on the player effectiveness or likelihood of being effective. At the moment I have a formula to do this as follows: PlayerAccuratePasses-(PlayerTotalPasses*(AverageAccuratePasses/AverageTotalPasses) I did not pull this formula together and want to be sure that this makes sense mathematically to produce a score of who is the most effective passer.
