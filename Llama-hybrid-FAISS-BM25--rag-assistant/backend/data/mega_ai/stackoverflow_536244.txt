Does it really matter? If a user doesn't care whether their name is all upper case or all lower case then I'd suggest that you don't need to worry about that either. Users who do care about how their name is capitalised will presumably enter their name with care. If you start to mess around with capitalisation then there's the risk of getting it wrong and offending a user. Surely there are other aspects of the system that warrant more attention...
