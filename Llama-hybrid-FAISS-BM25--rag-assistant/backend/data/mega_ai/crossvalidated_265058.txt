If I can design a neural network to output Y given X, and I can convert Y back to X, is there any way to learn from this?

Consider a scenario in which I use a deep neural network to output Y given X (this can also be an encoder-decoder pair: X->Y). If I have a method to convert Y->X (known technique, let's call the output X'), can I learn from this by comparing X' with X? That is, without any additional data, can I tune my neural network to better predict Y for the given X.
