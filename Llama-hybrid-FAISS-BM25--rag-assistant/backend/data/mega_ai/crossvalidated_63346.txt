The notion that someone watched 'Lord of the Rings' because it was popular, and not because he likes those kind of movies is very relevant to the topic of recommender systems. It shows that there are several other facets of recommendation, than just the interest-type of the user. Some of them are: Popularity - as you mentioned, someone might watch a movie because a lot of people have watched it. Freshness - occasionally, a user might want to try out a different type of movie than those he watches regularly. Diversity - while recommending a set of movies to watch to a user, it makes sense to give him choices which are slightly different from each other, for example, suggesting 'Lord of the Rings: Part One', 'Stardust', and 'Harry Potter: Part One', might be more useful to the user to decide what to watch than suggesting the three 'Lord of the Rings' movies. One possible way of dealing with popular items specifically is this. To start with, popular items will be incorporated in everyone's interest profile. This is usually done by subtracting the movie rating average from all ratings entries as a preprocessing step to the modelling. Hence if 'Lord of the Rings' has an average rating of 4/5, the predicted rating for a 'neutral' user will be 4**. Only if he is particularly averse to fantasy, the predicted rating will reduce. This goes by the logic: If I don't know anything about a user, I might as well suggest 'Lord of the Rings', since it's so popular. Once in a while, the system will try out 'fresh' recommendations to users - these might be new movies, or genres the user doesn't usually watch, so as to discover changes of the user's tastes. The system will also monitor the user's response to the recommendations. If a user repeatedly ignores a particular recommendation, then the system will reduce the importance of that recommendation, in effect, incorporating the user feedback to the recommendations. The system can thus 'learn' about the user better. Maybe this particular user doesn't want to watch 'Lord of the Rings' or maybe he has already watched it. In your example, however much 'sense' it makes to show socks ads to people, if they repeatedly ignore it for some reason, it is better to stop showing them. ** For simplicity, I have assumed that popular items have a high average rating, but this need not be so. In general the preprocessing can proceed in a similar way with some modifications.
