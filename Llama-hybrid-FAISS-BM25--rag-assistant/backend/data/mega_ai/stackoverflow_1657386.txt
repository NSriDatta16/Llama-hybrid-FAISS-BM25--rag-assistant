How to monitor the changes in the url (Fragment identifier - the anchor portion of a URL )

I'm making a website that tend to handle all the request in one page (Ajax). so i thought that I could trap every user's click on a link and check IF it's on my website i do something on JavaScript like an ajax request for example, ELSE it would open the link like usual! doing a watch on window.location did not work! and moreover I don't know if there is anyway to get the url part that is after the # sign. Note: both GMail, and Facebook does that I guess!, they use something like this: http://mail.google.com/mail/ #inbox http://www.facebook.com/home.php #/inbox/?ref=mb Kindly Consider: that I love to use jQuery in my projects, so any solution using it is preferred. Any ideas?
