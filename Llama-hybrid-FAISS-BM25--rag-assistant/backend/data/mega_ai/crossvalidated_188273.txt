Principal component analysis with group data

In my experiment I have used 30 different accessions of a species. One group is challenged drought and the other group is control. I have collected data on 6 different parameters. I want to know which accession is more tolerant or susceptible, which accession is more affected by which variable (parameter), and which variable is most critical etc. Can I use principal component analysis? Should I combine data during PCA analysis or subtract treatment data from control group? or how can I do PCR with both group data?
