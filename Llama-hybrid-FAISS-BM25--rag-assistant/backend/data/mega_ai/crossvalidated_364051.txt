Pro and cons between Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) vs difference-in-differences?

Google's paper markets BSTS's benefits over DID such that "In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates, i.e., synthetic controls." What are other pro-and-cons of the methods?
