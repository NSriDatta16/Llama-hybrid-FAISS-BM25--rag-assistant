Power to detect significant correlation given measurement uncertainty

First of all, apologies if some of the technical terminology in here is not accurate - my experience with statistics is fairly limited. To illustrate my problem, let's say I wanted to design a study to calculate a linear correlation between IQ and head circumference (HC) as measured with a tape. The human makes a measurement error of 0.1 cm on average, and errors are randomly distributed. How do I determine how many subjects need to be enrolled in the study in order for me to detect a statistically significant correlation between IQ and HC? Is it possible to determine this a priori, or is this dependent on how strong the correlation turns out to be? Thanks for clearing this up!
