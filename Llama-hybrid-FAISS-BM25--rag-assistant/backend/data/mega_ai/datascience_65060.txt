1) I will cite Noah Weber's answer The fit time scales at least quadratically with the number of samples and may be impractical beyond tens of thousands of samples. 2) There is nothing wrong but you are entirely searching a space that is 7 * 5 * 3 * 1 * 5(fold) = 525 which is pretty big. 3) To boost your training you can do the training in a subsample or just reducing the search space, I normally use the following function: def fit_cv_subsample (pipe_cv, X, y, n_max = 10_000): ''' This function fits a CV in a subsample of the first n_max rows returns the trained pipe and the best estimator ''' X_sub = X[0:n_max] y_sub = y[0:n_max] pipe_cv.fit(X_sub,y_sub) #pipe_cv.best_estimator_.fit(X,y) return pipe_cv, pipe_cv.best_estimator_ results, best_model = fit_cv_subsample(svm_c, X, y)
