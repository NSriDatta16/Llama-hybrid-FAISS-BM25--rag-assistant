Is it possible with jquery to use the nth-child() selector on an 'a' or an 'a:hover', not just 'li'?

Ive created a navigation bar where the hover state of each link has be a different color so im trying to select the a:hover states with jquerys nth-child() selector. i can get it to select the li element but not the a or the a:hover. Currently all the hovers are blue. here is the jquery code im trying to use: jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('#leftbar li:nth-child(3)').css('border-bottom', '#000000 5px solid'); }); Hi the navigation is generated with php, here it is: "; echo " $displayname \n"; }} } else { echo " No Navigation - Please Login to your Admin System and set the Page Order "; } ?> here is the site im working on: http://entourageuk.com/ Cheers!
