Comparing model performance. What model should I run for this? Confused between Randomized block or Repeated measures

I am trying to analyze some results I have generated from multiple different models. I have 21 models which are all used on the same 9 sets (years) of data. The response variable is the result of the running the model given the specified year. No randomization was used and all models were run for all years. The models are independent of each other and reset after each run, so running one model will have no effect on running the next. This is a sample of how my data is formatted: YEAR V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 etc... year 1 2 2 3 10 2 4 11 2 2 2 year 2 5 3 2 2 2 2 2 10 2 9 year 3 3 9 4 1 2 2 7 4 3 3 year 4 5 10 2 4 5 10 2 2 2 2 year 5 7 5 2 9 2 2 2 2 4 7 year 6 2 5 7 2 8 9 8 3 7 7 year 7 9 5 3 1 2 2 8 2 2 4 year 8 5 7 4 2 7 5 2 2 2 1 year 9 2 8 9 5 2 5 7 2 3 2 I want to average the results for the 9 years for each model and determine if any models are significantly different from each other. What test would I run to determine this?
