What does that mean that two time series are colinear?

I am familiar with the concept of cointegration. But I hear sometimes people talking about colinearity (or collinearity) for time series. A set of points is collinear if they are on the same line. But what does that mean for time series? Is it exactly the same as cointegration of order 1? Or is there something stronger/different in the concept of collinearity?
