Button Application- iPhone Application

I am a meganoob in iPhone Application programming. All I want to do is make an application with a single button. When you press the button, it plays an audio file. The button is just two images, one for the normal state and one for the pressed state. I have no clue how to get from point A to point B, it seems so straightforward in web design, why can't it be like that for this too? Anyone out there willing to drop some hints?
