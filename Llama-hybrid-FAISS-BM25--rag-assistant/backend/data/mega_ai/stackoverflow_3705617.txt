You don't need to wait for everything to download before releasing memory. You could just pass each image or small batch of images to the main thread using performSelectorOnMainThread, and let the main thread release memory as it caches the data in storage or uses the data. Then continue on in the background thread until done and pass a "done" message, again using performSelectorOnMainThread.
