average of the list in Python

I have a problem: i need to find an average of the list using this scheme: First of all, we find an average of two elements, three elements..... len(list) elements and form a new list using averages. The use .pop() and find all averages again. Function should stop when len(list) == 2 . Recursion should be used. Example: list: [-1, 4, 8, 1] 1 step: find an average of [-1, 4], [-1, 4, 8], [-1, 4, 8, 1] Then we form a new list: [1.5, 3.66..., 3] (averages) Then find averages of new list: [1.5, 3.66...], [1.5, 3.66..., 3] Then we form a new list: [2.5833.., 7.222...] (averages) When len(list) == 2 , find an average of this two elements. Answer is 2.652777 . What should i write: jada = [] while True: print 'Lst elements:' a = input() if (a == ''): break jada.append(a) print 'Lst is:' + str(Jada) def keskmine(Jada): for i in range(len(Jada) - 1): ... jada.pop() return keskmine(Jada) Actually, this is a part of a homework, but i don't know how to solve it.
