This is actually really irritating as GetCharIndexFromPosition (obviously) is missing one caret position, as there is one extra caret position than there are characters (an extra one at the end). I use this to set SelectionStart on DragOver and Insert on DragDrop. private int GetCaretIndexFromPoint(TextBox tb, int x, int y) { Point p = tb.PointToClient(new Point(x, y)); int i = tb.GetCharIndexFromPosition(p); if (i == tb.Text.Length - 1) { Point c = tb.GetPositionFromCharIndex(i); if (p.X > c.X) i++; } return i; } Not quite perfect, but it does the job. If anyone finds a native version please let me know :)
