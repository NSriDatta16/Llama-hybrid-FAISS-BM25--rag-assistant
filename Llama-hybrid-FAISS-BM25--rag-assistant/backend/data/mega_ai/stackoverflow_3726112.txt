mario nailed it (copied from the comments) Access modifiers make sense in Java/C++ and compiled code in general, where they are enforceable. In uncompiled scripting languages they can easily be ripped out. Hence they should be considered just decorators, and thus pragmatically could just be implemented as coding convention. (See underscoritis in Python, and pretty much any other scripting language. PHP is pretty alone with its purposeless access decorators.) You won't have much success convincing your teammates about the advantage of useful APIs over encapsulation by restrictiveness. The use of syntax-enforced access decorators is often cargo cult driven.
