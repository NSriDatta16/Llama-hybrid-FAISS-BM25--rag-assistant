The first thing I would do is specify the exact columns I want, and see if the problems persists. I doubt you would need all the columns from all three tables. It sounds like it has trouble getting all the rows out of the result table. How big is a row? Look at how big all the data in the table is and divide it by the number of rows. Right click on the table -> properties..., Storage tab. Try putting where clause into a subquery to force it to do that first? SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM sample WHERE sampled_date BETWEEN '2010-03-17 09:00' AND '2010-03-17 12:00') s INNER JOIN test ON s.sample_number = test.sample_number INNER JOIN result ON test.test_number = result.test_number OR this might work better if you expect a small number of samples SELECT * FROM sample INNER JOIN test ON sample.sample_number = test.sample_number INNER JOIN result ON test.test_number = result.test_number WHERE sample.sample_ID in ( SELECT sample_ID FROM sample WHERE sampled_date BETWEEN '2010-03-17 09:00' AND '2010-03-17 12:00' )
