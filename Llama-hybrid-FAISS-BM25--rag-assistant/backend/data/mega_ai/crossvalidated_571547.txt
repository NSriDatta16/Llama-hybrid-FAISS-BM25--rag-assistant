The theoretical ESS of a Markov kernel is measures the modification in the asymptotic variance due to autocorrelation is unknown in most cases, thus need be estimated varies with the parameterisation of the chain, ie the ESS for the chain $X_t$ is different from the ESS for the chain $g(X_t)$ Vehtari (2021) offers a very nice entry on the performances of four different ESS estimates and on the dependence on the parameterisation. The Markov chain under study is an AR(1) sequence. His conclusion is that In our experiments, Geyer’s (1992) truncation had superior stability compared to flat-top (Doss et al., 2014) and slug-sail (Vats and Knudson, 2021) lag window approaches. Ref.
