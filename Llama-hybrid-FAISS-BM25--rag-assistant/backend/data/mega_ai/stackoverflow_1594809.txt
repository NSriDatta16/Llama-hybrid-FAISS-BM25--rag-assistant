Convert float array image to a format usable for opencv

i wonder if there is a easy way to convert my float array image to iplimage, which can be handled by opencv. Of course i could create an empty iplimage with the same size and just copy ever pixel from my float array image to the emplty iplimage, but is there more elegant solution to this. Maybe a faster less memory consuming method, since the source images are pretty large and the copy process would take a while. Best regards, Zhengtonic
