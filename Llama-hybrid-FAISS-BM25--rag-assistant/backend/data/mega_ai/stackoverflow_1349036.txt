existing application, can I just start using linq-to-sql? any tips on integration?

I have an existing web app that has a data layer and a bll that calls the data layer. The data layer is ado.net that calls stored procedures. I created another project in vs.net for linq-to-sql, dragged all my tables over. Would it be wise to just start using linq or should I spend the time and re-write all the db logic in linq just so I don't have any issues having 2 data layers!
