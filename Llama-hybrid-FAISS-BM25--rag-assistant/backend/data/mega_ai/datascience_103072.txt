Hidden Markov Model (HMM) assumes the state space of the hidden variables is discrete. If extra medication buffer is your state space, it would make more sense to model it as continuous. Then one option would be linear dynamical system modeling. Also, HMM are designed to predict a sequence based on latent state (extra medication buffer). Probability of "misdose" is not a sequence. It might be more useful to frame it as time series problem. Given a collection of observed features, what is the probability of "misdose"? No need to explicitly model any latent state.
