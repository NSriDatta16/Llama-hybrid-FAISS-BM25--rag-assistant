After some experiments I've come up with the following fix. But I'm less than happy with it as it seems a bit messy and it doesn't work in IE7. edit also tried "ev.stop" and "return false" as alternatives to ev.preventDefault. All give the same result, working in every browser except IE. un-commenting the alert proves that the preventDefault is being executed even in IE changed onEnd handler to onDrag handler to avoid potential problems with call order of handlers. $$( ".thumbnail a img" ).each( function( img ) { new Draggable( img, {revert:true} ); } ); var drag_occurred = false; $$( ".thumbnail a" ).each( function( tag ) { tag.onclick = function( ev ) { if ( drag_occurred ) { // alert( "!" ); ev.preventDefault(); } drag_occurred = false; } } ); Draggables.addObserver({ onDrag:function( eventName, draggable, event ) { drag_occurred = true; } });
