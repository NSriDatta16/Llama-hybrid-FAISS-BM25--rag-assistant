How to calculate optimal zero padding for convolutional neural networks?

So formula for calculating the number of zero padding according to cs231n blog is : P = (F-1)/2 where P is number of zero padding , F is the filter size and the number of stride is 1 . But I don't understand what happens if the number of strides is not 1 or if F is an even number. Let's consider the number of strides is 4 and F is 7 or stride is 1 and F is 4. So according to the formula, in both these cases zero padding is in fraction: 1) P = (7-4)/2 = 3/2 2) P = (4-1)/2 = 3/2 How can the number of zero padding be in fraction ?
