It has to do with which side the request comes from (amongst other things): the Client issues a "request" and the Server responds. The terminology Client-Server is often associated with a discipline called "System Design Engineering" (there are other attributions for sure but that's one). Of course, an Agent could be composed of different sub-systems, each having different roles (i.e. S1 has a Client role whilst S2 has a Server role). One should note that the terminology Client-Server can also be found outside of Computer Sciences. A good example is in the networking field: A Client protocol layer interfaces with a Server protocol layer e.g. IP (Client) uses the services of an Ethernet protocol layer (the Server in this case).
