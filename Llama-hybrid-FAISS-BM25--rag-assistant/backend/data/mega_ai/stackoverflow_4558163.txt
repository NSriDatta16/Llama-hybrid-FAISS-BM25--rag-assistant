Trying to change img src if another element is visible with jQuery

I have a div ("panel" class) on my page that toggles open/closed on the click of a paragraph element ("flip" class), which has an image inside of it. Here's the HTML: Contact info Expand And the jQuery: $(".flip").click(function(){ $(".panel").slideToggle("slow"); }); Everything works fine so far, but I want the image src to change to "contactCollapse.png" when the panel div is visible. This doesn't seem to do anything (image just stays the same): if ($(".panel").is(":visible") == true) { $(".flip img").attr("src","../images/contactCollapse.png") } else { $(".flip img").attr("src","../images/contactExpand.png") } Am I missing something? Thanks for any help!
