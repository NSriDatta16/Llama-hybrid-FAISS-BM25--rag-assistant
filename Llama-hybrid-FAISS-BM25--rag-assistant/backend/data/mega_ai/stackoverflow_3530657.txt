Just use the appropriate architecture and you'll be able to host thousands of concurrent users on a single Web role without even noticing the load or stressing the underlying persistence (whether it is RDB or full event storage). If the numbers of concurrent users go higher, problem of scaling will be just merely about adding another web role or command processor (depending on the type of the load). I recommend to start looking towards CQRS architectures that go really well with the cloud computing and notion of almost-infinitely scalable solutions.
