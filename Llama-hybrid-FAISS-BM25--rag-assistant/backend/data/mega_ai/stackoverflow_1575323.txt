How to deal with seniors' bad coding style/practices?

I am new to work but the company I work in hires a lot of non-comp-science people who are smart enough to get the work done (complex) but lack the style and practices that should help other people read their code. For example they adopt C++ but still use C-like 3 page functions which drives new folks nuts when they try to read that. Also we feel very risky changing it as it's never easy to be sure we are not breaking something. Now, I am involved in the project with these guys and I can't change the entire code base myself or design so that code looks good, what can I do in this situation? PS> we actually have 3 page functions & because we do not have a concept of design, all we can do is assume what they might have thought as there is no way to know why is it designed the way it is. I am not complaining.I am asking for suggestion,already reading some books to solve the issues Pragmatic Programmer ; Design portion from B.Stroustrup ; Programming and principles by B.Stroustrup ;
