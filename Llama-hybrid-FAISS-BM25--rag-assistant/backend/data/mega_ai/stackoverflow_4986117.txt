It depends upon how much control you have over the drag mechanism. It sounds like you wrote it. If so, you're doing it backwards. Instead of blocking the area you don't want draggable, you need to enable the area you do want draggable - or put another way, you need to place a div in the draggable area to act as a "drag handle". I don't really know what else you can do. You can put event handlers on the surrounding DOM or even the document.body itself, but that won't help you determine between the drag-area and non-drag area. If my solution doesn't work for you, you have to check the mouse x/y location. Yes it's a hassle and slightly expensive, but you occasionally have to do such things when working with external foreign code that you have no control over such as Flash.
