Why is deep learning used in recommender systems?

I am currently reading a lot about recommender systems (RS) and came across that many RS are based on deep learning. However, I never find a good scientific article why deep learning is used in RS and why it is more successful compared to other methods. Now my question is: Why is deep learning used in RS? Why would it be better to use deep learning in RS? How does deep learning work in RS? I would be very happy if you could help me to answer my unanswered questions. I would be very happy if you would add a source (that is scientific, no medium etc.) that I can read more about it.
