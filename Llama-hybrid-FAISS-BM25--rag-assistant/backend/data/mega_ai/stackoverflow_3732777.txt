You should use the jQuery selectors page as your reference. There are a lot of selectors to choose from. Try out each one. Here's the two you reference in your question with 2 others: $("#myElement") // select and element with the ID "myElement" $(myElement) // use the variable myElement as your jQuery selector $(document) // The selector can also a DOM OBJECT // document, window ... $("body") // To select a DOM element use this form For example this will hide all the paragraphs on a page. Since the variable myElement is "p" , $(myElement) will select all paragraphs on the page into a jQuery object. var myElement = "p"; $(myElement).hide(); jsFiddle example This will alert the visible width of the window: alert($(window).width()); This will alert the contents of the DIV with an ID of myElement alert($("#myElement").html()); All of this means that $("#myElement") will only select the same thing as $(myElement) if the variable myElement is "#myElement" or functions in an equivalent manner.
