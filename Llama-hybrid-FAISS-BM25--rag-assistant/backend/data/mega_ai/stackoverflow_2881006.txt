The click event means the mouse buttons is pressed down and released. The mouseDown is only pushed down. For example if you do drag and drop, the mouseDown event is fired, then any number of mouseMove , and finally mouseUp . So yes, mouseDown is fired before click . And as others said they are different events so they don't affect each other.
