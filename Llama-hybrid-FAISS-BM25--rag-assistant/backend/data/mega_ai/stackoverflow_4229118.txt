The first question you need to answer is whether you will store the files in the database or on the file system. Given the amount of data in question, I would store the file on the file system and keep meta data about the files including their location in the database. The catch to this approach is that you have to keep the two in sync with each other. It is not particularly difficult to build that system. The second question relates to where you store the files. You could store the at the same place where you host the site or you could use a cloud storage option like Amazon's S3 (or DreamHOst mentioned by J_B). One advantage of using cloud storage is that the site can hosted anywhere without affecting the location of the files.
