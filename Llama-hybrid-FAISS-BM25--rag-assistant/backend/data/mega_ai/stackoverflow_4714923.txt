Convert a sequence of strings to integers (Clojure)

I currently am having an issue where I have to read a text file from the command line containing at least one integer. I'm reading the file, doing a regular-expression match to ignore whitespace. (re-seq #"[0-9]+" (slurp (first *command-line-args*))) After this I have to write a whole function just to convert this sequence of strings into a sequence of integers. Apparently I cannot map Integer. to the sequence (unless I am using map incorrectly). Is there some elegant way of handling this, something similar to map? Or do I have to go through recursively popping off first and casting it to Integer. to get this to work? I am currently learning Clojure, and as I learn bits I am going back and doing little programmer quizzes I used to pick up other languages.
