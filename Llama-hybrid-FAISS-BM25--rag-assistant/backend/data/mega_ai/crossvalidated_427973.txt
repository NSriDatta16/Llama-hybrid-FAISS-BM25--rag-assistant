What does it means when MSE almost equal with labels' variance?

I did a training for my dataset of 6000 images. running np.var(train_data), I get 2435. After training of enough epochs, my MSE is nearly 2415+-. Is this means, that the model is unable to find any meaningful relationship between the features? Thanks. UPDATE: My problem is actually try to measure the straight line in a image, in pixel. This is the sample: And length: 153.2220610747682201 Training: 375/375 [==============================] - 8s 21ms/step - loss: 2458.0092 - mean_absolute_error: 41.0948 - mean_squared_error: 2458.0095 - val_loss: 2440.2387 - val_mean_absolute_error: 40.7302 - val_mean_squared_error: 2440.2383 model.predict(): As you see, the predicted values are flat at 110+- What could possibly causing this? Can CNN not a right approach to solve this?
