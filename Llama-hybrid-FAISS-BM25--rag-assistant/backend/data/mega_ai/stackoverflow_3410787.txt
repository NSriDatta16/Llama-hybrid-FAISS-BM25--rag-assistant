I'm unclear why you think Wordnet is inappropriate. I think what you're calling "postive/negative extremities" and "sister words" are what linguists call hypernyms (more general synonyms) and hyponyms (more specific synonyms). Wordnet includes a reasonably good model of these. To use Wordnet, you'd find "sister" words by "going up" a few levels using the hypernyms('beer') relation. So if you started with "beer", going up 3 levels would give you "beverage". Then, you use the hyponyms('beverage') relation to "go down" several levels, to get types of beverages with the same amount of specificity as beer. This is an example of Wordnet's interface as accessed through Nodebox Linguistics . I believe PHP has an equivalent Wordnet interface, although I've never used it. >>> import en >>> noun = 'beer' >>> generalization_depth = 3 >>> sister_words = en.noun.hyponym(en.noun.hypernyms(noun)[generalization_depth][0]) >>> for word in reduce(lambda a,b: a+b, sister_words, []): ... print word ... milk wish-wash potion alcohol alcoholic beverage intoxicant inebriant hydromel oenomel near beer ginger beer mixer cooler refresher smoothie fizz cider cyder cocoa chocolate hot chocolate drinking chocolate fruit juice fruit crush fruit drink ade mate soft drink coffee java tea tea-like drink drinking water
