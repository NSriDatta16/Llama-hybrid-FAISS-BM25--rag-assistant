I'm not sure if it's the most elegant solution in the world, but I think this would probably do what you're after: Changed1 Changed2 Changed3 Changed1 Changed2 Changed3 Anything which isn't explicitly matched should just copy across untouched. Of course, if the values are constant (that is, element1, element2 and element3 will always have the same values regardless of whether they're new or updated) then you can have something simpler: Changed1 Changed2 Changed3 Which essentially removes the original "element" nodes and puts yours in in their place.
