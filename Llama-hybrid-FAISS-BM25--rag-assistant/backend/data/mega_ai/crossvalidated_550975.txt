Power Analysis result weird for multiple regression in R

I have a glmer model: glmer(kept ~ agent_liking*.loneliness + (1|participant_id),family = "binomial", data = d) We collected 150 participants for study 1 and the model was significant. Here's the result of the model: Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: kept ~ agent_liking * .loneliness + (1 | participant_id) Data: d AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 36433.8 36474.6 -18211.9 36423.8 26275 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.08217 -1.00014 0.00108 0.99979 1.08470 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. participant_id (Intercept) 4.118e-17 6.417e-09 Number of obs: 26280, groups: participant_id, 146 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.

However, the power analysis showed that we need about 300 samples to reach 80% power. PowerModel = extend(PowerModel, along = "participant_id", n = 300) powerCurve(PowerModel,test = fixed("agent_liking:.loneliness"),nsim = 200, along = "participant_id") Power for predictor 'agent_liking:.loneliness', (95% confidence interval), by number of levels in participant_id: 3: 3.50% ( 1.42, 7.08) - 540 rows 36: 13.50% ( 9.09, 19.03) - 6480 rows 69: 25.00% (19.16, 31.60) - 12420 rows 102: 40.00% (33.15, 47.15) - 18360 rows 135: 47.50% (40.41, 54.66) - 24300 rows 168: 62.00% (54.89, 68.75) - 30240 rows 201: 72.00% (65.23, 78.10) - 36180 rows 234: 77.00% (70.54, 82.64) - 42120 rows 267: 80.50% (74.32, 85.75) - 48060 rows 300: 83.00% (77.06, 87.93) - 54000 rows I have never had a situation in which a significant effect could not lead to any power. Has anyone experienced this before? Any ideas on what might be the reason? Thanks!
