You can download a zip file like any files with the Webclient class, look at the details and examples in the msdn documentation for downloading content on demand it even talks about how to download and get a specific file from a zip archive. However if you want to list the files, check out this blogpost , I've not actually tried it but it shows how to get all the files in a zip archive. Edit: I also found this discussion which offers some ideas, it among other things mentions this Small unzip utility for Silverlight, which seems a bit more robust. Then use the IsolatedStorageFile class to save the files. Good Luck! Ola
