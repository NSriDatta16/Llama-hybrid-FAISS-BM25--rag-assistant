Most webdesign graphic artists work this way. Many programmers simply find it a waste of time. It has advantages, and disadvantages. Advantages: Many graphic artists grok photoshop/illustrator more than they do dreamweaver. Customer gets a preview of the final product that works everywhere : mac, pc, firefox, ie, safari, whatever. Sending an html preview in early stages of production with developers using firefox and customer using MSIE always stirs up trouble. And don't think to be on the smart side, scribbling MSIE driven html. Starting with non-standard html and converting to standard is more painful than doing it the other way. There's one more catch: many web site customers tend to have a Mac and use Safari . Web committents tend to have a stronger taste for graphics than the average, so the chance to bump into Mac maniacs is higher in this sector than in others. More design alternatives can be prepared spending less time on each one. This could be a dramatic advantage while dealing with murky clouds of executives with no designated decision-makers on the customer side. Alternative mockups will be passing hand-to-hand until general consensus is reached on one design or the other. Disadvantages: "Cutting" the graphic design into html becomes an additional work and it's not clear who's gonna pay for that extra time. It favours graphic-centric, and rigid, design workflows . Customers agree pre-emptively on a given preview and that's what they get by contract. Every graphic modification means money, behaviour and programming instead tend not to be well defined, or worst, ill defined by the mockup. The quest for pixel perfect cross-browser adherence to the mockup may drive you insane. If you agreed on a given rigid design with the customer, that could become a dire issue to pursue. Dirty CSS tricks shoe in into your design. Using an HTML mockup, the customer would have approved a design driven by code with less tricks in place. Anyway, I wouldn't suggest photoshop for a mockup, but inkscape . (or illustrator, if you worship adobe by burning piles of money into magic circles at midnight) A scribbling stage is good too, while discussing the contract live with the customer. I prefer pencil and paper to felt-tips, and I webcam shoot ideas for archiving and email forwarding. When it comes to scribbling, anyone does what feels more natural . Not doing any and rely onto sample site examples and screenshots for graphical reference is always an option.
