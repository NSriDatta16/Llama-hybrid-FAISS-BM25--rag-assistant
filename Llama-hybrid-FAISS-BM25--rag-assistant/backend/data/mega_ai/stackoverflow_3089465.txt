The time taken to create the hash is not important, and as long as your database is properly indexed, the storage method should not be a major factor either. However, the hash has to be transmitted with the client's request every time, frequently as a cookie. Large cookies can add a small amount of additional time to each request. See Yahoo!'s page performance best practices for more information. Smaller cookies, thus a smaller hash, have benefits. Overall, large hash functions are probably not justified. For their limited scope, good old md5 and sha1 are probably just fine as the source behind a session token.
