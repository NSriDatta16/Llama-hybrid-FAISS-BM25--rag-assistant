Well, the SVN book has a basic overview of the .svn metadata, at least in terms of what's in there, but it's not byte-for-byte specification. Whether such a thing actually exists anywhere (aside from in the Subversion source code), I don't know. However, the book goes on to mention that, "Developers are encouraged to use Subversion's public APIs, or the tools that Subversion provides, to access and manipulate the working copy data, instead of directly reading or modifying those files." Is this an option? You might be able to use tools such as svn info , svn stat , svn diff , or svnlook to see what's going on and manipulate working copies.
