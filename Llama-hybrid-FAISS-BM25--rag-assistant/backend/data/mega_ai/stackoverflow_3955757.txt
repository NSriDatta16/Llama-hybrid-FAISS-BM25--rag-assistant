No certain answer here, but I believe it's just an internal magento team coding convention. I'm sure you're aware of the underscore prefix's history in programming in general. It's not too much of a stretch to think that local variables used in a view script that are loosely coupled with an object are similar to private or protected variables In other words, the underscore serves as a warning that hey, the contents of this variable doesn't just belong to this view, it's owned by something else Part of the problem is there's no "official" recommendations from Zend, or anyone else, what sort of naming conventions should be used in phtml files.
