Matrices and databases

I went through the topic and found out this link quite useful and simple at the same time. Storing matrices in a relational database But can you please let me know if the way mentioned as A B C D E F G H I J K L [A B C D E F G H I J K L] is the best and simple or even reliable way of storing the matrix elements in the database. Moreover I need to multiply two matrices and make the operation dynamic. So will the storage of data this create any problems for the task?
