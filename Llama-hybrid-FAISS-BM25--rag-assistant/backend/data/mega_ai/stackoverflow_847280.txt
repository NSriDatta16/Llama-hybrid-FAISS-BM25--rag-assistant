You don't look to check the return value from runJobWrapper anywhere - is this intentional? It is not obvious what the return value actually means anyway. Also you really shouldn't catch each any every exception that OpenExisiting could possibly throw - Out of memory? Stack overflow? etc. etc. Just catch the one you mean to handle correctly. Also your code looks to be somewhat fragile - I wouldn't be surprised if you have race conditions.
