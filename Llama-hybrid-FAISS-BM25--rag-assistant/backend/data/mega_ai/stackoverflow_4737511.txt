Continuous time-dependent signal prediction

Which type of artificial neural network would you suggest to be able to make continuous time-dependant signal predictions ? It should predict smallscale steps over very few signals up to very large scale steps with very many signals, possibly with less precision (abstraction by some kind of hierarchy?). See: Actually the system should learn and predict simultaneously.
