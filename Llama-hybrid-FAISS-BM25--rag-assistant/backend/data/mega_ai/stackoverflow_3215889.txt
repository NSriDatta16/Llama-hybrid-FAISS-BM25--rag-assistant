onTouch event sometimes not firing ACTION_POINTER_DOWN

I'm trying to implement pinch-zoom in an app I'm making and am having issues with the onTouch event. It appears that the pointer up & down actions do not fire immediately, like you won't get a pointer up or down until an action move occurs. So what happens if both fingers hit the screen nearly simultaneously is that the 2nd finger (should be pointer(1)) gets a move action before pointer down is called, making the code think it's a DRAG not a pinch zoom. Anyone else seen this? Anyway around it? Thanks.
