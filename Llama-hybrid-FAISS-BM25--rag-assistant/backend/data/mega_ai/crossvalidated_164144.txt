What are some tests for the predictability of time-series?

I have 2500 time series which I want to test the predictability and based on that, choose the best one to forecast. Ideally I want to use a simple model like ARMA-GARCH for forecasting. Are there any tests for forecasting abilities which I can assess the time-series?
