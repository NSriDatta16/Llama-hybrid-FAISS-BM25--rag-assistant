I think your question is what is a good way to run a Go web application? Running it in the terminal is fine, as long as you persist your terminal sessions. Programs like screen can do this. Another way is to leverage your operating system's startup scripts. Most Linux systems, for instance, let you add scripts to /etc/init.d which spawn the web application. This is how apache starts. The best way, in my opinion, is to use software like monit or daemontools . After some initial configuration, these constantly monitor the web application, and restarts the application if it goes down. This is how most production environments operate. If you want to run multiple Go web applications on the same server, you could use apache or lighttpd as the gateway, and use a protocol like fastcgi or scgi to serve requests.
