I need to download into internal, not accesible memory by user, because of security reasons. This is complete nonsense. A user will still be able to get at your downloaded file, particularly if you install it. Your problem is that the installer cannot read the file. Either store it in external storage, or you will need to use openFileOutput() with MODE_WORLD_READABLE instead of new FileOutputStream to get your OutputStream .
