Cut -Tags from String end

I am currently developing a Web-Application using Java EE where I'm using a Rich-Javascript-Editor (http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/editor.jsf). As the user can easily add too many linebreaks that will be convertet to linebreak-tags, I need to remove all these Tags from the end of a String. Is there an elegant way of using Regex to accomplish this? An example String would be: "This is a test bold " Where obviously the last two tags have to be removed. Thank you in advance for any help Best Regards, Robert
