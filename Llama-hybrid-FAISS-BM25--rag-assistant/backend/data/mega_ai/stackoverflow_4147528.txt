mysqldumpslow query time difference

I am a new user to mysqldumpslow and I am trying to understand the following: a) What is the difference between Query time and average query time ? b) For a query like this : Count: 12 Time=363.73s (4364s) Lock=0.00s (0s) Rows=0.0 (0), ekb[ekb]@localhost delete from sys_temp_random What does this time value represent - (4364s) ?
