If you get the same background in your program and Paint, then that tells me this is something to do with Firefox, and thus it is not necessarily your problem to solve. Since you're concerned about the background color, I guess the image you're copying has transparent elements to it. So tell me: What color should be there? A JPEG image can't have transparent parts, so every pixel must have some color. Firefox apparently chooses to put black there; how is that not a correct choice and Internet Explorer's is? I wonder what color background you get when you paste into a more capable graphics program than Paint, such as Gimp or Photoshop. I would expect those programs to consider multiple clipboard formats and choose the most appropriate format, so they might choose a format that accommodates transparency when it's available. Your program and Paint, on the other hand, probably just use the cf_Bitmap format, which of course can't have transparent pixels, so they get whatever the copying program opted to use to fill in the blank space. By the way, both Firefox and Internet Explorer allow you to drag an image directly from the browser to the desktop or other folder window to save the original image. Maybe that makes your program unnecessary?
