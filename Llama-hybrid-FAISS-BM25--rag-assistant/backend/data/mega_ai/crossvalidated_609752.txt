I would add that LPM are perfectly fine when the variable of interest is a binary variable as it will not create predicted values outside the 0-1 range. In this specific case, LPM should even be prefered. In randomized experiments for instance, LPM are always preferred as they are known to perform better than logistic regression both in terms of bias and precision, especially when the outcome variable has high prevalence (close to 1). Of note: I believe your second assumption (0CM) should be written conditional to the Xs
