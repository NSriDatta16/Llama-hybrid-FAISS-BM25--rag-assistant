Make DIV accept and handle drop via JavaScript possible?

I've been googling and trying this for a good while now, but comes nowhere. So here goes: What I want to do is to drop text on a DIV tag and handle that with JavaScript. Something along these lines: function handleDrop(sender, args) { $('#theDiv').html(args.textfromdrop); } This is some simple text. Draggable? So, on this page I want to be able to drag contents from the paragraph for example to the div and it would handle the drop and change it's appearance accordingly (Or maybe just display that text, as long as it would handle it!). I've been trying with jQuery, but it seems to be a whole other model, and I can't set all my potential draggables as such because they should be able to come from everywhere. Is this even possible? EDIT: Please correct me if I'm wrong, but these droppables all require a draggable to be dropped at it, right? What I would want is that you can drop text, pure text, from a page that you don't have any control of. This might sound weird, but it's for a firefox extension where you can drag content from a page to another page that resides in the side bar.
