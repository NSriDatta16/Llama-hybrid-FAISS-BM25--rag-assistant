How to proof that RandomSearch is better than GridSearch with mathematics?

I read this link Bergstra-Bengio in which it is discussed why 60 parameters randomly chosen are enough. But I do not fully understand the formula used $$1−(1−0.05)n>0.95$$ $$n⩾60$$ I have read the paper of Bergstra and Bengio; but I have not found anything about that formula. Also, I was wondering if RandomSearch is only good for Neural Networks; as I am using RandomForest, XGBoost and SVM. Thank you
