"Transfer learning" is not really straight forward. For example, you can reuse your encodings such n-grams. This is done by making the dictionary of your previous encoder the vocabulary input for your new encoding. You can see however, that for TF-IDF, if you add more sentences it will change the frequency of words in the corpus. Reusing the vocabulary makes a TF-IDF no longer a true TF-IDF. The same is the case for linear or logistic regression. If you add new data, the standard deviation, standard errors, and mean has to be recalculated for every point. All this is to say, that if you want perform transfer learning use a deep learning model such as a recurrent neural net or LSTM. If you want to use machine learning tools, merge your data with the new data set, re-encode your data and rerun your pipeline from scratch.
