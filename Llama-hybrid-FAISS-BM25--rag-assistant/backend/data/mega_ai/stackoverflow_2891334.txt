XML generation with java, trying to copy the whole node

I've got an xml document that filled with people (parent node is "students", and there are 25+ "student" nodes). Each student looks like this: Basically, what I want to do ('ve been asked to do) is to make a program that would get 3 students with the best average. While parsing the document and getting three best students isn't too difficult, the XML generation is a pain in the ass. Right now, what I'm doing is getting every single node from student and recreating it to a new file. Is there a way to copy the whole student node with everything that's in it? Regards, Paul
