Example of a SAML LoginModule for JAAS

Has anyone had any experience creating a JAAS LoginModule that uses SAML to authenticate and authorize a user? As I understand JAAS, this would likely require a custom CallbackHandler that understand and can parse a SAML message. In my case, the authorization is defined as a set of roles in a database, but like your typical Database Login Module. There are, however, no passwords stored in this system. Instead users are authenticated on another site and a SAML exchange is used to pass that authentication event to our system. My hope is to enable our application code to not have to deal with SAML directly and to be able to leverage standards JAAS techniques for managing permissions/roles/etc. An example would be most welcome, but any links you may have found would also be wonderful.
