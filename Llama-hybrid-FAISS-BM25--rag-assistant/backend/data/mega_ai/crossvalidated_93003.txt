T test assumptions

I'm performing a t-test on a time series with a sliding window (i.e. every N samples, perform a t test). I know that overall, the samples are roughly normally distributed, however adjacent samples are correlated, so the N samples (taken for the t test) may not be normally distributed. Are the t test assumptions violated in this case?
