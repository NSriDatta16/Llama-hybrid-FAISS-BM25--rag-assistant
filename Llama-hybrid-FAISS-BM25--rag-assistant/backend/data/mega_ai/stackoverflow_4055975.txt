What you need to do is set the context of your selector. See this reference: http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#selector-context In your case, when you do the selection to replace the link, set the context as the HTML fragment that you are modifying. Here's an example: $(function() { //create snippet var mySnippet = $(' &nbsp; Hello '); //remove the link, using the snippet as the context $('a[href="#"]', mySnippet).replaceWith($('a[href="#"]', mySnippet).html()); //insert the modified snippet $('body').append(mySnippet); }); And here's a demo of that in action (not very exciting, but shows that it works): http://jsfiddle.net/Ender/dQ32B/
