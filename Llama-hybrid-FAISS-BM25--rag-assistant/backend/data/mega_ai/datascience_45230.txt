what is fuzzy svm?

I have to solve this question for my homework but I don't get how to formulate svm to FSVM. can someone please guide me? What is your idea to have a model of SVM classifier in which instances can belong to both classes with associated membership values? Model it in both primal and dual problem. Model an unsupervised version of SVM and solve it!
