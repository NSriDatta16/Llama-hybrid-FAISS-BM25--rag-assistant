Full credit to Jonathan for pointing me in the right direction on this. I weighted each Site's rate by its denominator value and then looked at the differences between these values across months. Embarrassingly easy now I think about it! So: Site A in May has a wastage rate of 50% and a denominator of 40. This denomination value equates to 10% of the organisation's total denominator for that month. This means that if the organisation had a wastage rate of 30% then 5% (50% x 10%) of this is directly contributed to by Site A. What I've done is calculate this by month and by site and then calculate differences across months. The sites ranked highest are the ones which may require investigating.
