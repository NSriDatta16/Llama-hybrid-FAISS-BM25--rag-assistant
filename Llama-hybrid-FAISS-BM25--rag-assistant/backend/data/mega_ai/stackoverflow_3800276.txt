How can I listen for the drag/drop event in CKeditor?

I'm building an application that requires the user to drag and drop html elements onto a CKeditor instance. I need to listen for the drop event so I can take action to remove the element that was dropped onto the editor. I see that there's a 'paste' event, but it's not triggered by the drop. Here's my simple test, using the CKeditor jquery adapter: // set up instance $('#editor1').ckeditor(); var editor = $('#editor1').ckeditorGet(); // this gets a list of all events that you can listen for console.log(editor._.events); // here's how you listen for an event editor.on("someEvent", function(e) { console.log(e); }); I can't find anything in the documentation to shed light on this. Any ideas?
