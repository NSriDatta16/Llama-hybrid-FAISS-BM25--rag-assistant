I think you may benefit from thinking more about your question. You say that you are looking for a general answer comparing the rents of People X and Y, but go on to say that you also believe that a general answer is undesirable because there are important differences between neighborhoods. So which is it? Do you ignore the effect of neighborhoods, and push for a "general" answer, or do you incorporate the effect of neighborhoods, and go for an answer that is "better"? In my opinion: 1) You should have started with a "general" or "omnibus" test comparing the 10 X to the 250 Y. Based on those results, you might then go on to perform specific tests on different neighborhoods. Currently, you worked backwards: you ran multiple tests (with no adjustment for multiple comparisons such as a Bonferroni correction) and are now asking if you can aggregate back up. This is an odd question because a) neighborhoods either matter or they don't--if they do, why ignore them by taking a general approach? and b) If you found differences between neighborhoods, would you really believe a result that indicated no general difference? How could that be true, given what you've already learned?* Also, you have some serious sample-size issues that may need to be looked at. You say that you ran ten different statistical tests comparing the median of a single (N=1) observation with N = 250 others? I strongly suggest enlisting the help of a statistician who is familiar with your data and research questions. EDIT I wanted to come back to address this question (and my response) because I did not fully understand your data at the time. 1) Although the data/example you've provided is helpful for people like me to understand the structure of your data, certain specific questions are unclear. For example, in your data you sample from a uniform distribution to create the rents in the "Y" population. Is this similar to the distribution in your actual data? 2) Supposing that your actual data are normally distributed (meaning a wilcoxon test is not needed), I though that the best way to illustrate an analysis like this would be to fit a linear model: my.data_X $id_neighborhood id_neighborhood) #Fit a model and review the coefficients summary(lm(rent ~ pop + id_neighborhood, data = my.data_all)) From the output of the model you can see that there is some evidence of a difference between the populations "X" and "Y" after accounting for the different neighborhoods. However, none of the 10 neighborhoods appears to have a significant effect on average rent. This is probably because 25 of the 26 data points from each neighborhood were randomly sampled from between 6-30. Does something like this help point you in the direction you need? It's still unclear what you would like to show with your statistical analysis.
