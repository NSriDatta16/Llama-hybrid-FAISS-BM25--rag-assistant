Can I include year as an independent variable in this nested logistic regression design?

I want to make a nested logistic regression in R with the package mlogit . I would like to test how producer's decision to enter organisations (14 organisations) or not is affected by different factors. Producer can be in specific organisation and other according to year. I was advised to use year as separate variables in columns. This is OK. But for my different organizations will it be the same? So if my producer appear in my database several times (6 times) in row, isn't it redundant? Have you an Idea of the struture of database that I can adopt? Here is how my data looks like in R: Year Organisation Member AGE.Member ... 1 2005 Organisation 1 Member 1 37 2 2005 Organisation 1 Member 2 32 3 2005 Organisation 3 Member 3 32 4 2005 Organisation 4 Member 4 35 5 2005 Organisation 2 Member 5 33 6 2005 Organisation 3 Member 6 33 'data.frame': 18 obs. of 4 variables: $ ANNEE : int 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2005 2006 2006 2006... $ Organisation: Factor w/ 4 levels "Organisation 1",..: 1 1 3 4 2 3 2 3 3 2 ... $ Member : Factor w/ 9 levels "Member 1","Member 2",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 ... $ AGE.Member : int 37 32 32 35 33 33 32 32 33 37 ...
