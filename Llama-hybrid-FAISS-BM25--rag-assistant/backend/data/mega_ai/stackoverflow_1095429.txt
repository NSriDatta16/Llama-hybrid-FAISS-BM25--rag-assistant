Forever is the beauty of the electronic medium. That's one of the most attractive aspects for me. But, the keeping of it depends on your coding style, and what you do with it. I'd suggest tossing your code if you're the type that... Never looks back. Would rather re-write from your memory to improve your craft. Isn't very organized. Is bothered by latent storage to no end. Likes to live on the edge. Worships efficiency of memory. Logical reasons for tossing could would be... It bothers you. It disrupts your workflow by getting in your way. You're ashamed of it. It confuses you and distracts you. Like anything that takes up physical space in life, it's value is weighed against it's usefulness. All my code is kept indefinitely, with plans to return to it at some point, reflect, and refactor. I do that because it's fun to see my progress, and provides very accessible learning experiences. Furthermore, the incorporation of all my code into a consolidated framework is something I work towards all the time.
