Assuming I understand what you want correctly... This query will constrain the results from table5 to one row per combination of the join criteria, returning average city/hwy mpg. SELECT a.*, e.citympg, e.hwympg FROM table1 a JOIN table2 b on a.makeid=b.makeid JOIN table3 c on a.modelid=c.modelid JOIN table4 d on a.catid=d.catid LEFT JOIN (SELECT year, make, model, AVG(citympg) as citympg, AVG(hwympg) as hwympg FROM table5 GROUP BY year, make, model) e on b.makename = e.make and c.modelname = e.model and a.caryear = e.year WHERE a.carid = $carid; Note that it will return NULL mpg values when no record in table5 exists.
