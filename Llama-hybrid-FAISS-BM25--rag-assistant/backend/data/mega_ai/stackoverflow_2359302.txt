How to debug Java Web Start applications?

I have a Java Web Start Application that I launch from live site by downloading a tailored JNLP file. The problem is that once the Java Web Start application has loaded, the application quits without any warning. I know that the certificate is OK since when I enable "Show site certificate from server even if it is valid" option from Java settings, it displays a message correspondigly. I have tried enabling all debugging settings from Java settings ("Enable tracing", "Enable logging", "show applet lifecycle exceptions") and also Java console, but with no luck caching the problem. Could anyone with more experience on Java Web Start development/debugging give any tips?
