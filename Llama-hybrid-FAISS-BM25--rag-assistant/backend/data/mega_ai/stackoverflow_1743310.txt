PHP - Mulilingual application design

There are many ways to design a multilingual application in PHP. Some language file based, others database based. I am looking to use it for mostly small amounts of text e.g errors - at most a paragraph. I guess I will need twenty or so languages. Really I am looking for recommendations rather than a definitive answer. What have you used before, what is fastest, easiest to update etc. Many thanks,
