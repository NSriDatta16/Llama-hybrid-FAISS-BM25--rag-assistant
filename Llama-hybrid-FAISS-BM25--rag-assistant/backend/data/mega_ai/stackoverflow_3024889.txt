SQL to get distinct statistics

Suppose I have data in table X: id assign team ---------------------- 1 hunkim A 1 ygg A 2 hun B 2 gw B 2 david B 3 haha A I want to know how many assigns for each id. I can get using: select id, count(distinct assign) from X group by id order by count(distinct assign)desc; It will give me something: 1 2 2 3 3 1 My question is how can I get the average of the all assign counts? In addition, now I want to know the everage per team. So I want to get something like: team assign_avg ------------------- A 1.5 B 3 Thanks in advance!
