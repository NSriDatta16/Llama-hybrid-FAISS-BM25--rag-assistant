Applying XSLT to XML on ASP.NET

I am following the tutorial here: http://www.aspfree.com/c/a/XML/Applying-XSLT-to-XML-Using-ASP.NET/2/ The tutorial shows how one converts xml to html via xslt. Unfortunately, one of the first steps is to "Drag an XML control from toolbox on to the webform". Which section of tools is this and which control are they talking about?
