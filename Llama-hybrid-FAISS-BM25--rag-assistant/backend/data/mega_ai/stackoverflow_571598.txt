Most of your code seems sound however I wanted to make sure that div object being dropped on is Droppable. The Draggable class doesn't have an onDrop callback function. If you look at the documentation it has an onStart, onDrag, change, and onEnd. Try using onEnd instead. http://wiki.github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/draggable http://wiki.github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/droppables
