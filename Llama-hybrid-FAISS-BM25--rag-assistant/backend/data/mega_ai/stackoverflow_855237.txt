Best match between two strings when the order or number of times a word appears is not important?

What is the best algorithm to match or compute the distance between two strings in C# when the order or number of times a word appears is not important? Best means: Would mostly agree with a human match Elegant Efficient Scalable, so that an input string could be matched to a potentially large collection of other strings Related questions: Approximate string matching algorithms Efficient string matching algorithm Some notes: Because of the order and occurrence independence, the inputs can be thought of as sets of unique words, not strings in the sense of arrays of characters Not specifically looking for a database solution, although one would be interesting I'm way too old for this to be a homework problem ;)
