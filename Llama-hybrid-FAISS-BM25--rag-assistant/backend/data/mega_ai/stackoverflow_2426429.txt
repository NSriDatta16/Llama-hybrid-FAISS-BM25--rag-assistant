According to this page on HTTP headers and MobileSafari , you can tell if the user has launched your site from their home screen by testing to see whether the string Safari is found in the HTTP_USER_AGENT header. If it's missing, they are browsing from the home screen. This seems awfully fragile (and doesn't appear to be documented outside of a couple of non-Apple blog posts), so it might not be the best thing to rely on.
