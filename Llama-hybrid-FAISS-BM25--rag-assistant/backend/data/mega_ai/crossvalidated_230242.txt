Threshold Based Classification Using a Single Continuous Variable

I have multiple records containing a single continuous variable as feature and the corresponding binary label (1, 0). I've to determine a threshold which maximally separates these two classes. Now in the attached histogram you can visually determine that the value would be somewhere between 0.4 and 0.6 (classes are in blue and red) but is there a simple way to do it mathematically? Perhaps logistic regression or SVM would be an overkill.
