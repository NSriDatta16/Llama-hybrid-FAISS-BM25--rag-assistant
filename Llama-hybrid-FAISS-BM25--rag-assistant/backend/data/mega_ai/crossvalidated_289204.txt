Biplot computation in SVD

I'm trying to implement PCA biplot. I've got much of the concepts nailed down specially thanks to: Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA? and Positioning the arrows on a PCA biplot There is one last detail I just can't wrap my head around. Given: $X=USV^t$ I should be able to get the coordinates of my variable vectors from the columns of $V$ What I dont understand is to what variable each coordinate comes from. X is a n sample by p variable matrix, but V is a nxn matrix
