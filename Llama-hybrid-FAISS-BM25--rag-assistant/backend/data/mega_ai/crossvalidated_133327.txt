Prior on sum of bernoulli variables

I wish to model my data as follows: $$ y\sim\mathcal{N}(X\beta,\sigma^2)\\ \beta_i\sim\mathcal{N}(5,1)^{z_i}\mathcal{N}(0,1)^{1-z_i}\\ z_i\sim logit(\gamma_i)\\ \gamma_i\sim\mathcal{N}(\gamma_{i-1},1) $$ I wish have to far more of $z_i=1$ than $z_i=0$ (90% to be more accurate). Question is How can I encode this information in a Bayesian way. What I've thought so far is to do something like $p(z_i)\propto logit(\gamma_i)\exp(-(\sum z_i-90)^2)$ but this would be a nightmare for the inference algorithm (variational Bayes) that I am using since $q(z_i)\propto \exp(-C_1z_i^2-C_2z_i)$. Ideas: Is there a smarter way of doing something similar by maybe even introducing another latent variable, and another level to the hierarchical probability structure?
