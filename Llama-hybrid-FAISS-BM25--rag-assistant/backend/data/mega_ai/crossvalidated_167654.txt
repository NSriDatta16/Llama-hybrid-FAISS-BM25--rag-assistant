I'd expect most tutorials to start and end with descriptive time series analysis in an ARIMA framework, but it might also be interesting to look at tutorial treatments of structural time series analysis in a Bayesian framework with a focus on causal inference. If that's your bag, my current go-to resources are the following, all of which conveniently treat the same policy impact question. Books and papers Commandeur and Koopman is a gentle introduction to the model building and checking this class of models. The original paper Durbin and Harvey, 1986 is also worth a read. For a causal inference focus, the paper Brodersen et al. 2015 is good too. Data and code Most of the materials above make some use of the Seatbelts data that comes with R. See also the packages CausalImpact (plus vignette), bsts (sadly without vignette), and the structTS function built into R.
