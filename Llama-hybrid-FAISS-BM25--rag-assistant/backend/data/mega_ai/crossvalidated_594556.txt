As @Pablo Bernabeu says, ordinal principle components analysis (PCA) is one option. Though, there are other methods you could use to look for "two broad categories" underlying your 50 items. The first is exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with ordinal data, and the second is item factor analysis (IFA, which factor analysis for item level data). See Wirth & Edwards (2007) for more information on these methods. References Wirth, R. J., & Edwards, M. C. (2007). Item factor analysis: current approaches and future directions. Psychological methods, 12(1), 58.
