Selecting an appropriate control time series in the R CausalImpact package

I am new to the CausalImpact package in R and wanted to test the effect of a marketing intervention. Now, if we assume that a specific intervention only took place in 2013, is it possible to use time series from 2012, 2011 and 2010 to serve as the control time series? Or would it be better to use specific portions of the time series (let's say +/- 8 weeks from the intervention) and to control for any differences during other years?
