This may not be the "right" answer, but it's a working answer ... I successfully overcame this issue under the following circumstances... Built and Archived my app as usual on my MacBook Pro, with XCode 3.2.5. Saved that archive (in the Organizer utility) to my Desktop Copied that archive to my Mac Mini that has XCode 3.2.4 installed. On the Mac Mini, I used the Application Loader (Version 1.3.1) to successfully submit the archive. I don't know what changed or what's wrong with the 3.2.5 installation on my MacBook, I'm currently downloading a fresh dmg to reinstall that, but at the very least, the slightly older Application Loader on a different machine worked fine.
