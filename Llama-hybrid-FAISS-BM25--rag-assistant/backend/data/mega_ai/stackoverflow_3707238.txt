One reason I can think of is that quicksort has a worst case time complexity of O( n^2 ) while mergesort retains worst case time of O( n log n ). For object arrays there is a fair expectation that there will be multiple duplicate object references which is one case where quicksort does worst. There is a decent visual comparison of various algorithms , pay particular attention to the right-most graph for different algorithms.
