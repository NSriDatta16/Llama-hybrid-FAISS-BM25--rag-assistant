Simulate probabilistic state machine

I have the following probabilistic state machine (psm): I need to simulate this psm, example of simulation can be: am, am. , do, ... Is it possible to use markov chain to simulate this psm? Col sums in the transition matrix are not equal to one. Is there another alternative to markov chain to simulate this psm? The transition matrix is shown below:
