simple_format and embed's

I've tried searching the web for a solution for this but havent been able to find any way of combining this. Im printing html from a wysiwyg editor and found the simple_format helper to print the HTML with paragraphs etc. The problem is that it strips embed tags from the code aswell. Do any of you know a way to print content from a WYSIWYG that adds paragraphs, br's, strong/bold and keeps all media such as images, embed's, etc. Thanks!
