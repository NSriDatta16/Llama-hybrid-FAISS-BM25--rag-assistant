You need to use ordinal logistic regression . This is a generalization of regular (binary) logistic regression in which you fit a model predicting the probability the response is $1$ vs. $>1$, and $1$ or $2$ vs. $>2$, etc., simultaneously. All slopes are assumed to be the same, but you will have $k-1$ intercepts (thresholds) for $k$ categories. You can find some tutorials for OLR for various software on UCLA's statistics help site .
