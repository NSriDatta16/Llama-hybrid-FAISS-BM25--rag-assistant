Drag & drop with .ui files

I'm having big troubles with drag & drop. I've created a new Qt Designer Form Class in which I have one QListWidget and one QWidget. Now I want to enable dragging & dropping between these two widgets. The problem is, where can I add dragEnterEven(...), dragMoveEvent(...) etc. functions? I only have these class.h, class.cpp and class.ui files. Any help is much appreciated! -Samuli
