This answer applies to Netbeans 6.1 circa September 2008: It sounds as if you need to explore the "Libraries" dialog. Select "Tools" from the menu bar and "Libraries" from the menu. If you select "JSF" on the left, you'll see an association of jar files, sources (currently none in my Netbeans 6.1) and javadoc (which shows javaee5-doc-api.zip in my Netbeans). What you need to do is add a new zip or jar of source files under the "Sources" tag. An example of a fully populated library is the "Swing Layout Extensions" which has a jar file, sources and javadoc.
