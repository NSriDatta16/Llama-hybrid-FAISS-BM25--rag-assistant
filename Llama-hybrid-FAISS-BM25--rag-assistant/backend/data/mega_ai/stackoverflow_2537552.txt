According to django's documentation, the default behavior for FileField is uploading files to MEDIA_ROOT. If you just want to keep the uploaded files private, you could separate the MEDIA_ROOT dir and the dir contains your site media files. And write a custom view to serve files from MEDIA_ROOT. If you have more complex needs, you can implement your own file storage. Check http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-file-storage/ for more information. With the custom file storage, you have full control of how the file is stored and how the file is served.
