If you are using Linq to SQL you need another table to contain product status: Table Name: Product Status Fields: ProductStatusID int Indentity Primary Key ProductStatus nvarchar(50) Add a field to your Products Table: Field to Add: ProductStatusID int Add some statuses to your new table, and set the ProductStatusID of each product to an appropriate status id. Add a constraint that connects the two ProductStatusID fields together. The easiest way do this is to create a diagram in SQL Server Management Studio Express, drag both tables onto the diagram, and then drag the ProductStatusID field from the ProductStatus table to the Products table, and click OK on the dialog that opens. Rebuild your Linq to SQL data classes. You do this by deleting and recreating the DBML file, and dragging your tables into the designer again. When you get a products object (p) from your dataContext object, you should now see this: p.ProductStatus Linq to SQL will reach into your ProductStatus table, and lookup the appropriate status description.
