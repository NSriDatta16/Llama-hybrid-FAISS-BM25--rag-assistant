If you are adding up the occurrences of positive or negative words to predict sentiment, there is no reason to build a machine learning model. In order to build a logistic regression model, you need labeled data. It is not clear what the labels you are using for your problem. The initial weights for a model depend on the optimization technique. Logistic regression is often optimized with gradient descent. If gradient descent is used, the initial weights are random. Then the model learns how to adjust the weight to minimize errors on the target.
