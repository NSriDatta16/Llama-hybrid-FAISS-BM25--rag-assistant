Meaning of Baseline Before Sum to Zero

I am trying to specify a Bayesian hierarchical split-plot model in JAGS. I have been following Doing Bayesian Data Analysis by John K. Kruschke, however the model I am attempting is not included in his book. It is a split-plot longitudinal design with one three-level, between-Subjects categorical predictor XGroup and one continuous repeated measures predictor XTime , measured at four time points. I have attempted the equivalent of a random-slopes hierarchical regression model. The model works without sum-to-zero constraints placed on the variables, however I would like to respect this requirement as it seems to be important. While I can follow it for Kruschke's examples in the book, when it comes to doing it myself I am lost. As you can see below I have tried to impose this constraint on the between-subjects intercepts. But I don't know whether this is correct and how much further I need to go. My model string is included below. I have taken Krsuchke's approach of specifying the parameters in the link function as a and then changing this to b for the sum to zero parameters. Any advice about how much further I need to go and how to go about it would be most welcome. "model { # start with the likelihood function. This is the equivalent of a random slopes hierarchical regression, with a between-Ss predictor, a within-Ss predictor, and a subject level predictor (which is the random intercept), as well as the interaction between between- and within-Ss predictor, and the interaction between the within-Ss and subject-level predictor (the random slope). for (r in 1:nTotal) { y[r] ~ dt(mu[r], 1/ySigma^2, nu) mu[r] The model compiles and runs, and bB1 + bB2 + bB3 sum to zero. a0 , the grand mean prior to the sum-to-zero procedure is 31.57 and b0 , the grand mean after the sum-to-zero procedure, is 31.68, an increase of 0.1095. bB1-aB1 , bB2-aB2 , and bB3-aB3 all equal -0.1095. Thus the estimated intercept for group 1 will be exactly the same if you calculate it as a0 + aB1 or b0 + bB1 (and the same for intercept estimates for groups 2 and 3). Furthermore the estimated difference between group intercepts will be exactly the same before the sum-to-zero as after. All that changes is the 'grand intercept' a0 (and, I presume, its meaning). So my questions are: (1) 'what is a0 ?' What does it represent? b0 is obviously the average of the group intercepts. But what is a0 ? (2) What other parameters in my model should I be performing the sum-to-zero procedure for? I suspect it will be necessary for the group x time parameter aBxW ? If so, do I do this in the same manner as I have for the intercept, except with reference to the within-subjects parameter aW instead of the intercept a0 ?
