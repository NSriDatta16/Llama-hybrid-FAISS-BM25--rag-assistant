Why is LDA considered to be a classifier?

I am new to machine learning and I was reading about dimensional reduction algorithms like LDA(linear discriminant analysis) and PCA. Currently I am using LDA to find the optimal dimensions that separate my classes. But once I do that and get some new data to classify, I reproject it using LDA and then use KNN to define to which cluster my data corresponds to the most. So how Classification can be done with LDA alone?
