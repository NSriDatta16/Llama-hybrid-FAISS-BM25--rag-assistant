extern struct foo* pfoo; in a header file and struct foo* pfoo; in one of the .c files outside of any function will get you static storage for the pointer and thus automatic initialization to zero. extern qualifier is key here. It tells the compiler not to allocate storage for the pointer in every translation unit .
