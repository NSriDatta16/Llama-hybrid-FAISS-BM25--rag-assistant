How to create a distribution table of Fisher $\xi$?

I am not sure if this type of question is appropriate but I am hoping for some feedback in any case. I am trying figure out how to create a distribution table myself. The table I am looking for is based on Fisher as seen in the book Fuller's Introduction to Statistical Time Series (1996) - please see Table 7.1.2 on p. 364 in this book. The $\xi$ distribution is given by the following (taken from p. 363 in same book): $$ P\{m^{-1} \xi>g\} = \sum_{j=1}^k\left(-1\right)^{j-1}\left(\begin{matrix} m \\ j \end{matrix}\right)\left(1-jg\right)^{m-1} $$ The reason why I want to create the table myself is because I am testing on sample sizes larger than 1000 and the distribution table in the book is capped at 1000. I have searched Google Scholar and Wiki but I have not been able to find the distribution anywhere except in the mentioned book. Can anybody demonstrate how to create distribution table in a simple spreadsheet? Thanks
