Custom 404 Page with element does not seem to function in IIS 7

I'm testing an IIS 7.5 site with Managed Pipeline Mode = 'Integrated' My site targets mobile devices and leverages well formed URLs to pass parameters with a minimum of typing. For example 'mysite.com/bob1234' in this case 'bob1234' is actually parameter. In the Application.BeginRequest, I process the Request.Url.AbsolutePath using a regular expression to determine if the URL is well formed. I wanted to add a Custom 404 page, if a user mistypes the URL i.e. mysite.com/boob1234. And while this catches errors when the extension is '.aspx', it does not catch 404(s) when no handler is mapped, for example '/mysite.com/boob1234'. I followed the instructions and also added a element to my system.webserver But no iteration of this seems to work. When I uncomment the block, I get a 500 error. And no, there doesn't seem to be any problem with my code. I get a 500 error, even when I just forward to an plain HTML Page. I did implement failed request tracing to see what I could see. I get the expected: 404 thrown by IIS Web Core. Then a few steps later the CustomerErrorModule starts, but it fails with a 500 error. The detailed message is ConfigExceptionInfo: \?\C:.....\MyApp\web.config ( 89) :This configuration section cannot be used at this path. This happens when the section is locked at a parent level. Locking is either by default (overrideModeDefault="Deny"), or set explicitly by a location tag with overrideMode="Deny" or the legacy allowOverride="false". I've tried walking up the '.config' stack, and haven't found any references to overrideMode="Deny" Any help would be awesome. Totally stuck now. Thanks: Dylan
