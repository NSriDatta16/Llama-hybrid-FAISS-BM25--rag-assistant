How can I handle global variables that are common between two projects?

I have two projects written in C: a client side and a server side, both of which contain lots of common global variables. I want to write a class (clientbot and serverbot using a interface Transaction) which will call the main function of each project. I have moved all the common global variables in a header file and included it in both project. But on building it is throwing me linking error. Error 3 error LNK2005: "int g_nBytestoSend" (?g_nBytestoSend@@3HA) already defined in transimpl.obj agentBot.obj Can anyone suggest what I should do?
