Conditional logistic regression: within subject matching instead of McNemar

I'm trying to compare the prevalence of a specific lesion (binary) at the symptomatic side to the asymptomatic side within a group of patients. I've already performed a McNemar test to compare the prevalence at the symptomatic versus asymptomatic side within patients. However, I'm asked to also perform a conditional logistic regression. I'm not sure if my syntax is correct with respect to the stratification: summary(clogit(ds$symp ~ ds$asymp, strata(ds$ID), data=ds, method = "exact")) Question: Does R compare both sides of the patient (symptomatic vs asymptomatic) within the patient(s)? Or do I have to duplicate manually the patient ID (one ID for the symptomatic side AND one ID for the asymptomatic side)? An example: ID symp asymp 1 0 0 2 1 0 3 0 0 4 0 0 5 1 0 6 1 1 7 0 0 8 0 0 9 0 1 10 0 0 As an example: patient 2 has a lesion at the symptomatic side and patient 9 only at the asymptomatic side. Patients 6 at both sides. A Exact McNemar test shows: test However, a conditional logistic regression model shows: > summary(clogit(df$symp ~ df$asymp, strata(df$ID), data=df, method = "exact")) Call: coxph(formula = Surv(rep(1, 10L), df$symp) ~ df$asymp, data = df, method = "exact") n= 10, number of events= 3 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) df$symp 0.973 2.646 1.524 0.638 0.523 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 df$asymp 2.646 0.378 0.1334 52.46 Rsquare= 0.039 (max possible= 0.616 ) Likelihood ratio test= 0.4 on 1 df, p=0.528 Wald test = 0.41 on 1 df, p=0.5232 Score (logrank) test = 0.43 on 1 df, p=0.5127 Or should I duplicate patients and use the syntax as described above? ID side lesion 1 symp 0 1 asymp 1 2 symp 0 2 asymp 0 3 symp 1 3 asymp 0 4 symp 0 4 asymp 0 5 symp 1 5 asymp 1 6 symp 1 6 asymp 0
