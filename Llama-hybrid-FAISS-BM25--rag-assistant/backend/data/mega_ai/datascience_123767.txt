Interpreting ROC Scores for non-binary data

I have been handed a random-forest based machine learning model that is predicting a rate rather than a binary category (e.g. the rate of road quality deterioration in a city for planning repaving requirements) and I need to understand how to evaluate the results. Most intro examples I can find rely on binary or multiple classes. How would you apply these concepts to a continuous rate? E.g. if the actual rate of deterioration is 2.78%/year and the model predicts 2.69%/yr vs 2.85%/yr? How would you construct a confusion matrix for continuous data? How would you interpret a ROC curve?
