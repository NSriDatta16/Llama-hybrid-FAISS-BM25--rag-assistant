You can probably get away with the typical $$ \bar{x} \pm z_{1-\alpha/2} \dfrac{\widehat{s}}{\sqrt{n}} \>. $$ The poisson with $\lambda\approx 20$ is very nearly normal (see below) so you can approximate the Skellam as a normal with $\mu= 2$ and $\sigma^2 = 38$ . The coverage should be very good due to the reasonable approximation library(tidyverse) r % mutate(covered = (ymin 2)) }) r %>% mutate(i = seq_along(xbar)) %>% ggplot(aes(i, xbar, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax, color=covered)) + geom_pointrange() + geom_hline(aes(yintercept=2))
