In my job we were designing network and serial protocols to control embedded hardware. I also got tired of reading dumps wrong, and writing scripts for each protocol, so I wrote a library to do exactly what you describe. You could give it a text file description of the protocol, and it had a gui supporting check boxes for setting single bits, radio buttons for choosing between the valid combinations of bits, and drop-down lists when there were a lot of choices. You could edit the hex view of the data, the binary view of each field, or even point and click at the fields, and all the other views would update. It saved us a ton of time. It's a little quick and dirty, but I'd post it if it wasn't owned by my employer. The point is, it wasn't very hard to write, and once I went away from scripts for each protocol and to one program that could understand a description of the protocol, things were great. We stopped screw ups relating to misreading a dump, and adding new protocols became trivial. Plus the textual description of the protocol went straight into the development specs so the software guys would know what to do with the hardware. I encourage you to take a crack at it.
