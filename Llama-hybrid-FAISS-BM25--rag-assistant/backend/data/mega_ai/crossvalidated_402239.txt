How the zero concentration should be treated depends on what zero values mean. Is a concentration of zero theoretically possible or does it indicate that something went wrong at that measurement? If the latter is the case I would suggest replacing those values with missings since they show some mistake in the measurement and not the actual concentration. Assuming zero values make theoretically sense you could use a one sample t test. If you doubt the assumptions of the t test to be met you can alternatively use the one sample sign test. Since your data is really small it is difficult to acually check the assumptions of the t test because tests for normality depend on sample size and I further I would argue that in small sample sizes like yours values easily appear as outliers. Thus I would go with the one sample sign test that uses the median rather than the mean which is a more robust parameter. For this you would need the median concentration of the dutch sample. If zero is a valid value the R code would be t.test(vector, mu = 110) # t(9)= -4.3708, p=.002 library(BSDA) # assuming that he dutch sample is normally distributed and thus mean= median (or you provide median of dutch data) SIGN.test(vector, md = 110) # s= 1, p=.021 EDIT There has been some discussion and this is why I want to make an update. It was suggested in the comments that in this case where human and environmental safety is important the mean is to be used and not the median. I would argue that the opposite can be true and this is why. Assume country A has 100 soil-samples with all of them being just right under some cutoff for some risky chemicals in the soil. On the other hand, country B has 99 chemical-free samples while only one soil-sample contains a massive concentration. So in average country B could have a significantly higher mean concentration although only a few people are at risk in this country. But in country A are all people at risk and may all suffer in the long term. Thus to me it is not obvious why the median would be inappropriate here and the mean would be the better measure.
