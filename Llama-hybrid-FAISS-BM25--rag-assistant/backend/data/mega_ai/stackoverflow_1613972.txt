If your using a .NET language, you might be able to accomplish what your trying to do with Microsoft's XML Diff and Patch tool/library. I've used it to correctly identify that there were changes between different xml fragments. This was important for our scenario as the XML we had on disk would differ after being stored in a Sql Server XML column because of insignificant whitespace being removed, and/or re-arranging attributes ( Infoset ). Just comparing the text blobs would always detect a difference, when actually the XML elements/values were the same. I've not used the patching ability of the tool, only XmlDiff. There are several nice commercial XML diff tools on the market, but I don't know of any that provide a code, or scripting, API. That would be a nice feature for value add!
