Predicting a parameter using the estimates of a series of studies, using study location and year as random effects

I would like to ask whether my analysis design is correct. I gathered all the trials on a series of drugs for a certain condition (second line therapy for advanced/metastatic lung cancer), published in the last 5 years. For each drug used in the studies, I take the progression free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS). I want to predict the same outcomes in a specific country for each drug. (I know it's quite far fetched to have a realistic prediction, but I am more interested in the methodology). For the analysis I run a mixed effect model (lme4::lmer in R) with the drugs as fixed effect and location of the trial and year of publication as random effect, weighting for the number of subjects in every study: lmer(Val ~ Drug + (1 | Geo) + (1 | Year), data = Data, weights = Data$Num) Then I would predict the effect for my country (in which some of those trial have been made) for the last 5 years and average the estimates by years, in order to have a predicted OS and PFS for each drug. Is it a correct approach? Thanks
