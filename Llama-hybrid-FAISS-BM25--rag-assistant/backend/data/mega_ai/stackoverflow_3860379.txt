If you are willing to write this in PHP, I'd say you are looking at the wrong technology. There is 2 major problem with PHP and real-time. When you run a PHP application, it is not persistant like Servlet with Java. It is hard and not really adapted to do communication between each connection. You have to use database storage, stream or file to send data between each instance. All of these methods are not very efficient. It is using blocking I/O and this is where it hurts in term of performance and scalability. You should look at non-blocking I/O technology for web server. They are all event-driven server which is something different from the PHP approach. Here are few example : JBoss + Netty (Java) Node.js (Javascript) - Google Tech Talk about it Twisted (Python)
