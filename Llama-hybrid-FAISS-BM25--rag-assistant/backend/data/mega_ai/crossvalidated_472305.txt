Custom threshold in logistic regression and interpretation of probabilities

Let's say I choose threshold in logistic regression equals to $0.8$ . If it is lower then class is $0$ else is $1$ . Then, how do I interpret the outcome on test point $x$ , $h(x)=0.6$ , where $h$ is my logistic regression model. I think I cannot say that with probability equals $0.6$ class of $x$ is $1$ ? Is there any way to interpret this? Should I just scale appropriate intervals so in that case the outcome $0.6$ I can interpret as probability of $0.375$ that point is in class $1$ ?
