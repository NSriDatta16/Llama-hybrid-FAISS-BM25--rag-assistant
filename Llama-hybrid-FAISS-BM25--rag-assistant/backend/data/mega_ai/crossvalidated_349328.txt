feature engineering for auto encoder anomaly detection

I am working on an unsupervised problem: to take a set of transactional data, and identify anomalous transactions. I am using h2o's auto encoder to train a model which then scores transactions based on MSE / reconstruction error. I am able to achieve good results, in terms of the highest scoring transactions being genuinely anomalous in a business context. However, I think I can do more on the feature engineering side. Are there any general principles which apply to feature engineering on this kind of problem as opposed to a more conventional supervised machine learning problem?
