Simple shopping carts are just arrays of products that are maintained through sessions and cookies. You can do anything you want. Just make sure users can't do anything they want such as change prices through the url. But most of all make it very, very, very easy for the user to checkout. Most developers will create an array with product objects so if any changes are made to a product shopping carts will reflect this change. However, if you change your prices then obvious you will have a problem if a user clicks on on price but then you change it and the uses doesn't see this change until after they paid or become confused why the price went up mid shopping experience. In terms of maintaining the line item if you have users sign in before they can add things to a cart then you don't need to worry about creating a cookie/session to store the array of the line items until they do checkout and the line items are saved with their information for later reference. In this case what you will want to do is create a line item which is associated to the object so you can get all the products information but at the same time store the price in that actual LineItem model so if you do update your price it will not affect shoppers mid buying experience. And if you want users to pay higher prices because you change your mind and want to use the line item model you can just do what is sated in the last paragraph and check the price right before a user decides to checkout. If it is different then let them no that this product is now x amount to purchase and don't forget to apologize.
