UTC is Coordinated Universal Time, not a character set (I didn't find any charset called UTC). For internal representation, you may want to use wchar_t for each character, and std::wstring for strings. They use exactly 2 bytes for each character, so seeking and random access will be fast. For storage, if most of the data are not ASCII (i.e. code >= 128), you may want to use UTF-16 which is almost the same as serialized wstring and wchar_t . Since UTF-16 can be little endian or big endian, for wire transport, try to convert it to UTF-8, which is architecture-independent.
