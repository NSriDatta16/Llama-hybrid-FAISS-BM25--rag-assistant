I think with the new for-each loop, the label can be really clear. For example: sentence: for(Sentence sentence: paragraph) { for(String word: sentence) { // do something if(isDone()) { continue sentence; } } } I think that looks really clear by having your label the same as your variable in the new for-each. In fact, maybe Java should be evil and add implicit labels for-each variables heh
