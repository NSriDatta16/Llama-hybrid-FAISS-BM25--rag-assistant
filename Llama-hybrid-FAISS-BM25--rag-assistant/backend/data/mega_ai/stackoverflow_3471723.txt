You shouldn't use Drupal if you care about database structure. CCK is the method of defining content types, used on 60% of all Drupal sites and the basis of fields in Drupal 7 core. That said, you may want to question a few of your assumptions. First, there are a lot of modules that add new field types to CCK, e.g. FileField , so it may not be as simple as you think. Second, do you really need to worry about how the database is organized, or is that just a means to some other end, e.g. reporting. If it's reporting you're after, you can generally handle that with Views , the only module used more than CCK. If you really do need to worry about the database structure and really do need more complex relations than CCK can handle, I'd suggest you're not looking for a CMS so much as a framework. Those kinds of details are generally handled automatically in a CMS.
