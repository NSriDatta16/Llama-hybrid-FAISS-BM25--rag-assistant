In my opinion, never. Macros are effectively text substitution tools that work at the compiler level, not while executing your code. This is useful for defining constants and such, but not good for more complex things. Function-like macros seem to be used when there is a lot of repetition in the code, so you don't have to maintain the same routine in thirteen different places. However, if you can successfully use a macro in such a way, your code is poorly organized - you'd likely be better off refactoring it, and creating a single method to implement it.
