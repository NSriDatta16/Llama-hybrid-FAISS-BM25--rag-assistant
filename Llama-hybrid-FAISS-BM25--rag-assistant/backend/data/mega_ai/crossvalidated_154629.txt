What statistical test should I use between two scenarios?

Scenario: I have a test data of response time of two websites in two different servers. Let's say website A and website B are tested on server A and server B not respectively but website A and website B in server A and again website A and website B in Server B. I have got a result for server A for two websites and for server B. Now let's say I want to compare the response time between these two websites by looking at the data collected from both server A and server B. I mean to say: can I combine data from server A and server B so that I can analyse the combined data for these two websites? Example: Server A: For website A Thread # response time 100 1.9 200 3.8 300 5.7 400 7.4 500 9.50 600 7.60 700 13.30 800 1.60 900 1.80 1000 20.0 For website B Thread # response time 100 5.5 200 9.8 300 1.7 400 3.4 500 1.50 600 3.60 700 6.30 800 11.60 900 2.80 1000 2.0 Server B: For website A Thread # response time 100 1.9 200 3.8 300 4.7 400 3.4 500 6.50 600 6.60 700 5.30 800 13.60 900 11.80 1000 20.0 For website B Thread # response time 100 2.5 200 3.8 300 7.7 400 7.4 500 5.50 600 7.60 700 3.30 800 11.60 900 12.80 1000 3.0 So here what I want to do is rather than saying is there a difference in response time between website A and website B in server A or server B, I want to combine data from server A and server B so that I want to test this hypothesis - Is there a difference in response time for website A and website B. Threads are the users. There are 10 iterations carried out for each websites and in every successive iteration 100 users are added. So the response time is the average response time for each iteration. What should I do in this case, what kind of statistical analysis shall I do in order to find differences between these two websites? Is there any possibility where I can find the significant diffence by looking at both server A an server B? Note: since the data is very small, i cannot do a frequency analysis and convert these data into frequency table. Many thanks
