Ruby On Rails html5 storage offline CRUD application with or without ActiveScaffold

I am currently building a web application using Ruby On Rails with ActiveScaffold. And I would like to know whether there is any plugin/library which would make possible to enable my Rails application to work offline e.g. the user can browse some of the data and make changes while the user is disconnected, after the user gets online again the data would be simply synced.
