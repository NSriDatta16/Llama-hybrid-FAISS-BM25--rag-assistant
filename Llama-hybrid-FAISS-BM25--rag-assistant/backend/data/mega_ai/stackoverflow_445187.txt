To check in, or not check in, the entire Eclipse project?

I'm soon going to check in the very first commit of a new Java project. I work with Eclipse Ganymede and a bunch of plug ins are making things a little bit easier. Previously I've been part of projects where the entire Eclipse project was checked in. It's quite convenient to get the project settings after a check out. However this approach still was not problem free: I strongly suspect that some Eclipse configuration files would change without user interaction (from when I used Eclipse Europa), making them appear as changed (as they were changed, but not interactively) when it's time to do a commit. There are settings unique to each development machine as well as settings global for all developers on a project. Keeping these apart was hard. Sometime if the Eclipse version was different from others Eclipse would get angry and mess up the project configuration. Another case is that it change the format so it gets updated, and if commited messes up the configuration for others. For this specific project I have another reason not to commit the project files: There might be developers who prefer NetBeans which will join the project later. However they won't join within the coming months. How do you organize this? What do you check into versioning control and what do you keep outside? What do you consider best practice in this kind of situation?
