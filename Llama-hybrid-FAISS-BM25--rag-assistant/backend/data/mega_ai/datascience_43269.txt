What are the introductory mathematics courses that are most pertinent to machine learning?

To provide more context to this question, I have found the following list of courses in order to learn calculus: Course | 18.01.1x | edX Course | 18.01.2x | edX Course | 18.01.3x | edX I also have found the following specialisation on coursera: Mathematics for Machine Learning | Coursera I am wondering which of the two sets of courses is better suited to machine learning. I have already started the ones on edx but I am unsure as to whether the ones on edx are suitable as an introduction to calculus for machine learning.
