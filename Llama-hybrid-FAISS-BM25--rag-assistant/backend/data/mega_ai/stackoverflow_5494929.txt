How do I embed a .swf file into my Google App Engine app?

First off i'm new here so if I made any mistakes please point them out. I am working on an app engine project in python were i want to be able to upload and play games in a .swf format. I am having trouble getting app engine to send(deliver, render, display,...not sure what the correct term is) files with a .swf ending. What am i doing wrong? I've tried embedding a picture in my object tag to make sure my html and Django template isn't what is causing th problem, and it works fine. This is my app.yaml file application: flashstealer version: 1 runtime: python api_version: 1 handlers: - url: /stylesheets static_dir: stylesheets - url: /images static_dir: images - url: /flashgames static_dir: flashgames - url: .* script: main.py ...and my main.py import wsgiref.handlers from google.appengine.ext import db from google.appengine.ext import webapp from google.appengine.ext.webapp import template class Game(db.Model): name = db.StringProperty() description = db.StringProperty() tags = db.StringListProperty() playcount = db.IntegerProperty() location = db.StringProperty() originallocation = db.StringProperty() class MyHandler(webapp.RequestHandler): def get(self): games = db.GqlQuery('SELECT * FROM Game LIMIT 20') self.response.out.write(template.render('main.html',{'games': games})) def post(self): game = Game( name = self.request.get('name'), description = self.request.get('description'), #tags = self.request.get('tags'), #playcount = self.request.get('playcount'), location = self.request.get('location'), originallocation = self.request.get('originallocation')) game.put() self.redirect("/") def main(): app = webapp.WSGIApplication([(r'.*', MyHandler)],debug=True) wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler().run(app) if __name__ == '__main__': main() ...and my main.html Emporium by Free Css Templates The Arcade &raquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just a fondation for now Homepage Blogs Photos About Contact {% for game in games %} {{game.name}} {{game.description}} Read full article | Play Count ({{game.playcount}}) {% endfor %} Submit Games Here Name: Descrition: Original Location: Playcount: Location: Tags: Read full article | Comments (32) Search To Do make a list of games in db &nbsp; Because i'm new i cant post photos directly the way the browser shows it This is the way it shows up when i view the rendered(again whatever it's called) html Emporium by Free Css Templates The Arcade &raquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just a fondation for now Homepage Blogs Photos About Contact Test with .swf This is were the problem starts because it leaves a spot where the game should be but there's no game.
