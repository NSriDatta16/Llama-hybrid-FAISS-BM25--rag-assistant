I'm guessing you're checking to see if jQuery was loaded from the Google Libraries API ? Your browser will cache jQuery whether it's from the CDN or from your LAN. If it's already in the cache from a previous retrieval from the CDN, it'll load faster than from your LAN. If it's not already in your cache from either a previous visit to your site, or another site using the same CDN, it'll only need to load once: subsequent visits will load from the cache. Splitting the URL for jQuery between the CDN and your LAN will just cause two copies to get cached. Let the browser cache do what it was meant to do. :)
