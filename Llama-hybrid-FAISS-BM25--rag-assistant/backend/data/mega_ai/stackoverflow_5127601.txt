The easiest way is to declare a LinqDataSource , bind the GridView to the data source in the markup, and then override the Selecting event of the LinqDataSource to specify your custom data retrieval logic: The code-behind: Protected Sub MyDataSource_Selecting(sender As Object, _ e As LinqDataSourceSelectingEventArgs) Dim dataContext As New MyDataContext e.Result = ' Put LINQ-to-SQL code here End Sub
