Group time series examples

I am looking for group time series examples. I am working on two hierarchies and interested in interactions also. Couple of challenges I am facing I have 36 months data and many of the series has leading NAs as not for all the series data is observed from the beginning I am working on hierarchical time series data and interested in interactions also. Just to elaborate more - The 2 hierarchies are Geo hierarchy - Area -> Subregion -> Subsidiary and Business Hierarchy - Business sector -> Business Sub-sector Requirement is to do the predictions at area level, sector level and also wants to know how the sector A is likely to perform in Area1 After reading the couple of posts on hierarchical time series I got to know that group time series can solve this problem. But I couldn't get any examples with code (R) on this, if any sample code is available that would help. Also, I tried implementing but faced few challenges - I have 36 months data starting from Jan-2014 and many of the series data is not observed from Jan-2014 i.e it starts from Aug-2014, July-2015 so I have leading NAs for these series how to handle it as I am getting error in gts function while executing By default it supports only ("ets","arima") models for future predictions - what if I have to use other methods? while using the accuracy.gts function getting the error - Error in colnames ( *tmp* , value = unlist(labels[levels])) : length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent r-code -------------------------- library(hts) data 30, -c(1,na_cols)] h Sample data set
