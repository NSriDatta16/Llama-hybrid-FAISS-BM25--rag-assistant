Assign all numbers equal probabilities, while currentAverage not equal to intendedAverage (whithin possible margin) pickedNumber = pick one of the possible numbers (at random, uniform probability, if you pick intendedAverage pick again) if (pickedNumber is greater than intendedAverage and currentAverage intendedAverage) increase pickedNumber's probability by delta at the expense of all others, conserving sum=100% else decrease pickedNumber's probability by delta to the benefit of all others, conserving sum=100% end if delta=0.98*delta (the rate of decrease of delta should probably be experimented with) end while
