There's a good example of a popup above the taskbar here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/taskbarnotifier.aspx If the user is dragging the window, you'll need to override the OnPaint event. The key is calling SetBounds() on the form, calculating the bounds from the form size and Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea , which excludes the taskbar from its height. HTH, James
