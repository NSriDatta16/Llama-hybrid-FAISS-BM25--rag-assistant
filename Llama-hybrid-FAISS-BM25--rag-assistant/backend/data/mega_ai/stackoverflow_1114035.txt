You can use the KeyFactory to convert to keytoString, stringToKey as follows URL Google App Engine : the ID that I believe that it was an unique id for the data storage in Google App Engine. Key instances can be converted to and from the encoded string representation using the KeyFactory methods keyToString() and stringToKey(). When using encoded key strings, you can provide access to an object's string or numeric ID with an additional fields. I hope it helps. Tiger.
