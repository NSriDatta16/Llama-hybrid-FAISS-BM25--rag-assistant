Where to start with Magento?

I am very new to Magento and I have a few questions. Where is the best place to start when theming? Would you recommend copying the default theme: fontend/base/default and going from there? I've read that copying: frontend/default/default and renaming it is the best place to start, but that doesn't make much sense considering there are no real files there. I've also noticed that the "blank" theme uses widget.xml to build its theme. Ohhhh, I am so confused. I would like to get a theme that utilizes all of Magento's layouts/block/pages and change it from there. Therefore, back to my previous question: would it behoove me to just copy the "frontend/base/default" folder and go from there? Your advice would be greatly appreciated.
