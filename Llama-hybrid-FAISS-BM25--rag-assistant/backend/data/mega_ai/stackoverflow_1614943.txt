(jQuery) Appending an absolute positiooned element to a list item

I have the following list item that I want to append an 'Edit Settings' button to: HTML Content I use jQuery to append a span to the list item: $('#bucketItem75').append(' Edit Settings '); The list item is statically positioned, and when I output the page and manually include the span in the list item, it is properly positioned. But when I add it with jQuery, it shows up in the top right corner of the page, outside the list item. I'm obviously missing something here, so if anyone has ideas, that would be much appreciated. Thank you, Chris Hampton Web Coordinator Colorado State University EDIT: I thought this would do it (and it still might), but I'm still having issues. I went the 'combine the inner html' route, and when I write the list item's html to the console, it looks correct (it matches what is outputted from my server code when the page loads): HTML Content Edit Settings Here's the CSS of the item .draggableBucketItem span.spnEditModule{position: absolute; top: 3px; right: 3px; font-weight: bold; color: #fff;} The .draggableBucketItem class has position: static; applied to it.
