How to use logistic regression on time series data?

My question is more theoretical and hope someone can help me. I have socio-demographic data for 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2020 years from the statistical office. All of variables are categorical, while the Dependent variable is binary. I want to explain dependence and think about using logistic regression. However I have some doubts, should I treat this data as time series or I can just use it as usual?
