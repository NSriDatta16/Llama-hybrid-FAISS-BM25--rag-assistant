GANs: What does the pdf of the sample data p(x) mean?

In the context of GANs, the concept of a probability distribution comes up as the generator tries to emulate the "distribution" of the data: $p_{data}(x)$ . For me, the use of "distribution" here seems a little fuzzy. How should one interpret what $p_{data}(x)$ means, say for GANs operating on the MNIST dataset, where each pixel value in a given $28 \times 28$ image is normalized to fall within [0,1]?
