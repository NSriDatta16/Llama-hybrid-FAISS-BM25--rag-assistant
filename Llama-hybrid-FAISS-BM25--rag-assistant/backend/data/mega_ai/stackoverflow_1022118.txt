Rails user-conditional statement in model

I'm working on a Rails app using attachment_ fu and Amazon S3 storage. Is it possible to make the :s3_ access (a part of the has_attachment options) conditional based on a user input when creating the object. I would like the user to be able if to select if the attachment is authenticated-read or public-read. Is this possible and how would you setup the conditional statement? My model looks like this: has_attachment :content_type => :image, :storage => :s3, :size => 0.kilobytes..6144.kilobytes, :processor => 'Rmagick', :resize_to => '650x500>', :thumbnails => { :thumb => '75x75!' }, :s3_access => ( [[conditional]] ? 'authenticated-read' : 'public-read' ) Obviously [[conditional]] is what I'm looking to replace, but I don't know how to correctly setup a conditional for the item based off user action in the model. Maybe this is the wrong time of conditional for this type statement. Any suggestions?
