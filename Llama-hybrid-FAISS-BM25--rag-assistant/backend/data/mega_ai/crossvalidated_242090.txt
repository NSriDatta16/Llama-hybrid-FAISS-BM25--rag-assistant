Explaining regression coefficients

It may be a rather silly question that a first-year econometrics student could answer, but I got my brain stuck with it. Assume that I run a regression of log(wages) on education, i.e. lm(lwage) ~ education) , where education is a dummy variable with "0" representing High School, and "1" standing for the Bachelor's degree. In the regression with education dummy alone, the Bachelor's degree coefficient is estimated to be 0.65; this can be interpreted that students with the BS degree will have on average exp(0.65)-1= 0.9155 = 92% higher wages than high-school graduates. Now, assume I introduce years of work experience as another (continuous) variable into the regression. Then the coefficient on Bachelor's dummy drops to 0.4 or exp(0.4)-1= 0.491 = 49% . Now, can I say that work experience variable is responsible for explaining the variation in wages for the amount by which education coefficient has changed? That is, is it safe to state that an average individual will be making 49% higher average wage if he has a BS degree, while another extra (92%-49%)= 43% of his higher wage is attributed to his work experience? Or it is not possible to directly interpret regression coefficients like this, because the explained sum of squares (SSE) will be different between two models, etc?
