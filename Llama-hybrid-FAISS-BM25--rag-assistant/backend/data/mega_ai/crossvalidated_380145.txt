Pandas isn't that well suited to analyze autocorrelation, that might be a source of problems in your data. The Statsmodels library in Python has better options. Try: statsmodels.tsa.stattools.acf and statsmodels.tsa.stattools.pacf You're also looking at the mean of every 3 days of data, when it is likely that your data has 24 hour seasonality and 7 days seasonality, and both will get muddied by averaging over 3 days.
