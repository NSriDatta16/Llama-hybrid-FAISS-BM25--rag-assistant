Latent factors are the same in both decomposed matrices?

This question is in the context of recommendation systems. We can use matrix factorization techniques to decompose a user-product explicit/implicit matrix(R) into two matrices(U, P). Let's say R is a n*m matrix, U is a n*k matrix and P is a k*m matrix. U is considered as a user embedding matrix with k latent factors. P is considered as a product embedding matrix with k latent factors. Are these two sets of k latent factors considered to be the same latent factors? If so, what is the intuitive explanation for this?
