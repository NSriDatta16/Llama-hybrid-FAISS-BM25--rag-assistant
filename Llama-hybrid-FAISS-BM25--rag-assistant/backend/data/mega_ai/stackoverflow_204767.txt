A few years ago many people suggested using tinytext instead of varchar in MySQL for performance, since row by row search was supposedly faster with constant row data size. Surely MySQL's query, storage and index handling algorithms evolved since then and it may not have that much of an impact now. But you're probably optimizing too soon and shouldn't be worried about performance at this level.
