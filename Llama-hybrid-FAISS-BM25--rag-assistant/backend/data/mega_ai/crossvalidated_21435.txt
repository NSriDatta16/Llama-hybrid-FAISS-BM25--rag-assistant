Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't see any definitive statistical solution to your problem. There's no glorious trick that can determine where truth lies and which of your systems is closer to it. So what can you do? Obtain multiple measurements from each system and average them... Average the measurements you have and treat those averages as best estimates... Devise additional systems, making your problem potentially better and potentially worse.
