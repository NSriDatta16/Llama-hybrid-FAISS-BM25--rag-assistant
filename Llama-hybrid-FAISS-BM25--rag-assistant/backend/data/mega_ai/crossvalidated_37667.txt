If you have both recall and recognition data from a word list, you may be able to use a multinomial processing tree model, specifically the Chechile-Meyer model. But this depends on your exact design. The Chechile-Meyer Task separates storage and retrieval processes in an elegant way. See the following publications: Chechile, R. A. (2004). New multinomial models for the Chechile–Meyer task . Journal of Mathematical Psychology , 48(6), 364–384. doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2004.09.002 Chechile, R. A. (2010). Modeling storage and retrieval processes with clinical populations with applications examining alcohol-induced amnesia and Korsakoff amnesia. Journal of Mathematical Psychology , 54(1), 150–166. doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2009.03.006 To fit the model, you could use our R package MPTinR (on CRAN), see: Singmann, H., & Kellen, D. (in press).
