Can I reconstruct the original data from a dimensionality reduced data using t-SNE?

I have implemented dimensionality reduction using PCA, AE, and t-SNE! I am trying to compare the output of the three methods by finding the reconstruction error. I have managed to reconstruct the data from PCA and AE with no issues. however, I couldn't figure out how to reconstruct it from t-SNE. I have looked through the literature and can't yet find any straightforward answer. My question has two parts: Can i reconstruct the data from the output by t-SNE? If so, how is it done? (any references or implementations would be great)
