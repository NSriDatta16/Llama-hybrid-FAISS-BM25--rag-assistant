From various research articles I have read, this is the main purpose/difference between text classification and intent detection/classification Text Classification It's the activity of labelling natural language texts with relevant categories from a predefined set. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content. Some common use cases can be for language detection sentiment analysis(positive or negative feedback) topic detection Intent Classification Using ML & NLP, an intent classifier automatically analyzes texts and categorizes them into intents. Its basically used to find the purpose behind the text in hand. Highly utilized in chatbots
