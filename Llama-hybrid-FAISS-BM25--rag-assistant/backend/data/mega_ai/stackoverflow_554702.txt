In the jquery tutorial you have a nice example you can use to do this. In the live examples (example C) you have $("div.contentToChange p:not(.alert)") .append(" This text was just appended to this paragraph ")}); Why instead of the " As it is a string you're appending you can pretty much with javascript change the name, so you can control it easily. Like .append(" ..... I would do it that way :) This way you'll avoid having to refresh your webpage everytime you add a row. Also you can detect on the php side after the submit how many rows you have, by parsing the "row_id" Hope it helps Edit: Answer to the comment and to the rest of the question I would put all HTML being generated by append, it would make you a bit less load on your server (although not that much) and things would be simple to organize. Oh and you would avoid having the refresh :) (This for the add row) For rows added that you're loading from the database, then that must be server side.
