I agree with much of what Vilas Jagannath says. Using the Eclipse debugger Additional points: 1) The Display view. This view allows you to run code in the context of the current stack frame. This allows you to inspect arbitrary bits of code. In some ways it is a little primitive, but it works great as a scratch pad. 4) If you want to go into some method call in a line with a complex expression, you can navigate to that function and then "Run to Line" (Ctrl + R) 5) You can also use step filters to filter classes you don't care about. Right click on the stack frame you don't care about and hit "Filter Type". Make sure you have "Use Step Filters" on. It is the icon with two arrows just to the right of the drop to frame button on the Debug view.
