Automatic Timeout Web Client Use

One of the problems I have come across having complex tasks on the browser is with automatic timeouts. Currently our site has a sliding expiration of 30 minutes. Normally, this isn't a problem because we use asp.net and most of the time the users update one or two fields and then submit the form. This obviously keeps the session active. I have struggled with how to handle this with significantly more complex forms/user interaction where there are few if no round trips to the server. Now users can view reports, type emails etc. on our site, and I am struggling with how to keep their session active while they're actually using browser but they are not actively posting information back. I would dispense with the sliding expiration, but it's a requirement, so I am stuck with it. Most of our users are outside of the organization, so I can't use any form of SSO . Does anyone have an elegant solution (I'll even go for an ugly one if it works), or am I out of luck?
