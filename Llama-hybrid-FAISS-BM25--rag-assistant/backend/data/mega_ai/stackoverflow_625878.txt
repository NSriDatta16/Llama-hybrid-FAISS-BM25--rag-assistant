Temporary storage for cleaned data in Integration Services

I have an Excel file that I need to process three times in integration services, once for projects, once for persons and once for time tracking data. At each step I have the excel source and I do need to do some data clean up and type conversions (same in all three steps). Is there an easy way of creating a step that does all this and that allows me to use the output as input to the other "real" steps? I am starting to think about importing it into SQL server in a temp table, which is by all means ok, but it would be nice if I could skip that step.
