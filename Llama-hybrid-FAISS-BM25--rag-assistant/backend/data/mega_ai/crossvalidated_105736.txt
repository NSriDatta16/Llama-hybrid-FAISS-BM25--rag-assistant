I don't want to sound rude here but I think you'd be better off getting a firm background in Intro. Statistics before you start trying to implement any of the techniques of machine learning . Not only will this answer your question but also it will teach you the basic terminology, which will help you word your questions in the future. But, to clarify a few things that you may have mistyped in your question (as it reads currently, at least) and also hopefully point you in the right direction: The X 's are the Independent variables (also called the "Explanatory variables"), the " y " that you're trying to "explain" is the Dependent variable . If you want to know if two Independent variables are correlated, the easiest thing to do is just to calculate their Correlation. [Note: Even if they aren't totally independent you can often still run your regression without any problems.] It's the regular, run-of-the-mill regression ( OLS ) that chooses the "weights" for you, in effect (in the form of estimated slope coefficients). [Note: If you're still fairly new to Statistics then don't bother with anything more complicated than OLS (such as Generalized Least Squares )]. The issue of Multicollinearity may be what you're referring to in your question. To explain it imprecisely, Multicollinearity is when 2 or more X 's are correlated enough to screw up your OLS regression. Basically, if you run your regression and you end up with a high R^2 but none of the t-values of the individual coefficients are statistically significant, then you probably have Multicollinearity. Also, it sounds like you're looking to calculate a run-of-the-mill ANOVA table--have you tried that yet? Hopefully some of this will be helpful to you. I can add more pointers if it is--I going to wait for some feedback from you before I continued, however. If these bullet points are totally off then I apologize. Also, it would help if you continue to edit your post accordingly since it's kind of hard to parse as it is (for me, at least). Good luck! -- Last thing: What are you using to calculate all this? (e.g. Excel, R, TI-83)
