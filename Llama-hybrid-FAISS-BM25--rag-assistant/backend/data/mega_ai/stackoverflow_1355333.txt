Check out our SD C++ Test Coverage tool. It can be obtained for GCC, and for MSVC6. It has low overhead probe data collection, a nice display of coverage data overlayed on your code, and complete report generation with rollups on coverage across the method/class/file/directory levels. EDIT: Aug 2015: Now supports GCC5 and various MS dialects through Visual Studio 2015. To use these tools under Linux, you need Wine, but there the tools provide Linux-native sh scripting and a Linux/Java based UI, so the tool feels like a native Linux tool there.
