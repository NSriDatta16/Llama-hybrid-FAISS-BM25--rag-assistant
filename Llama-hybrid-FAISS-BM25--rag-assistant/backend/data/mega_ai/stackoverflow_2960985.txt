From DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC . I'm not sure that's exactly the problem, but it may serve as a starting point to you. KNOWN ACCESS PROBLEMS ^ Invalid precision value This error message is received when trying to store more than 255 characters in a MEMO field. The problem is (to my knowledge) an error in the MS Access ODBC driver. The problem is fixed by setting the data_type of the column to SQL_LONGVARCHAR in add_columns. SQL_LONGVARCHAR is a constant in the DBI module
