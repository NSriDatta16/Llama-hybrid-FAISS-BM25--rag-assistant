I wouldn't bother with modifying Magento to work with 5.3, as the changes will definitely will be more complex than your source assumes. PHP 5.3 comes with namespaces and the autoloading mechanism will change for sure. This means that a lot of stuff will change internally. Long classes name like : // Mage_Sales_Model_Order Mage::getModel('sales/order'); will be called only as order in its own namespace instead of: // maybe something like this Mage::getModel('order'); // or like this $order = new Order(); // it depends on how Magento team will implement namespaces
