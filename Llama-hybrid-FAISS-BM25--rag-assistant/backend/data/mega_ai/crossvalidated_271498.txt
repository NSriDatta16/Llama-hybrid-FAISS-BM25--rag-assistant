Is Median the right average to be used in this scenario?

I have a large dataset in Excel relating to expenditures made by guests in a hotel over a calendar year (say, 2016). The data is by Month of Expenditure and at the granular level of each booking at the hotel for that period. In this dataset, the columns that are of interest to me are: Month, Total Expenditure, Guest Night, Meal Plan and Market. My aim is to calculate the average Total Expenditure Per GN by Market and for All Markets. My logic is that "expenditure" behaves a lot like "Income" and hence, the best average to be used to summarize the data would be the Median. Thus,to get the average for a specific Month (say, March 2016), I have created a calculated column to compute the "Total Expenditure Per Guest Night" (Total Expenditure/Guest Night) for EACH booking for the month of March 2016. I then computed a the Median of the calculated column to obtain the "Median Total Expenditure Per Guest Night". Am I on the right track? Or am I missing something critical in my process? The final aim is also to be able to use those Medians for forecasting future Total Expenditure based on Guest Nights in the books.
