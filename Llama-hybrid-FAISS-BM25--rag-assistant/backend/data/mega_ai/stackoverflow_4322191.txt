How many bytes do we need to store an arabic character

I'm a little confused about the storage needed for representing an arabic character. Please let me know if this is true: in ISO/IEC 8859-6 encoding it takes 2 bytes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-6) in UNICODE it takes 4 bytes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Unicode) What are the advantages of each encoding? When should we prefer one over another one?
