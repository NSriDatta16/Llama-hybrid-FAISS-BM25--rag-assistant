Skip Checkout in Magento for a downloadable product

I am using Magento to build an eBooks site. For the release, we plan to have a number of free downloadable books. We were hoping that it would be possible to use the normal Magento 'catalog' functionality to add categories with products underneath. However, since these are free downloadable products, it doesn't really make sense to send users through the checkout when they try to download. Does anyone know of a way to create a free downloadable product which bypasses the checkout altogether? I have noticed that there is a 'free sample' option for downloadable products, but I would prefer not to use this if I can as I plan to use this field for its intended purpose when I add paid products. [EDIT] I have noticed that some of you have voted this question down for 'lack of question clarity'. For clarity, I want: to know if it is possible to create a downloadable product in Magento which doesn't require users to go through the usual checkout process (since it is free) and which is not the 'Free Sample' field of a downloadable product Unfortunately I don't think I can ask this any more eloquently. [/EDIT]
