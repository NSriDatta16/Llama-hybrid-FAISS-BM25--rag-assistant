How to visualise data where one variable is continuous and the other is categorical?

This question is very simple but I have been struggling in getting the right script for this. My data set goes as follows: HZ Condition 5 A 6 A 3 A 4 A 10 B 8 B 11 B 13 B I want to build a scatter plot to visualize the correlation between HZ in A and Hz in B. I thought it should be represented as x being "HZ" interacting with "Condition_A" and y being "HZ" interacting with "Condition_B", and grouping being "Condition". Perhaps I am not tidying up my data properly, but I wonder if there is a way to make this directly, without adding more columns (as this is part of a data set with many other variables). Thank you all for your replies. The reason why I was not using boxplot is that, as Nick Cox pointed out, I want to show the distribution of HZ data points. I should have explained it better in my original post, but the aim is to check if HZ is increasing or decreasing in each condition, and that is why at first I thought having x-axis with "HZxA" and y-axis with "HZ$B". I will be using this variable to control for effect size another variable. So I will try to use Nick Cox visual representation example, thank you! I also did not mention that I am using R, so the scripts are very appreciated indeed, thank you Robert Long and Cdalitz.
