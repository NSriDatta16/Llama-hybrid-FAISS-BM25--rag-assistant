Using PHP script to fill in XML

we are all familiar with "embedding" PHP scripts in HTML pages to do tasks like displaying form results, but how can that be done in a way that displays XML ? For example, if I wrote: Your number is: $fromPh, and you typed: $body. " ?> I get a message that states "parse error, unexpected T_STRING on line 1" . Any help or tutorials would be appreciated.
