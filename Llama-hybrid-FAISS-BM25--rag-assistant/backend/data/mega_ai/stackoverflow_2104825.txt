Optimizing vector/matrix operations via mathematical reduction is possible, but tricky. You can find some information on the topic here , here , and here . Now, this may not be quite what you're looking for, but... You can use the machine GPU (graphics card processor) to vastly increase the computation performance of vector/matrix operations. Many operations can be increased by several orders of magnitude by taking advantage of SIMD processing available on the GPU. There are two reasonably good libraries available for C# developers for GPGPU programming: Microsoft's Accelerator Library , documentation available here . Brahma - an open source GPU library for C# developers that leverages LINQ.
