To communicate between pages, you would have to store the collection of controls in Session, Cache, or something else so that the other page could use it. That's probably not going to be viable. What you need to do is recreate the UI on the other page. So give the page the number of textboxes and values, and have that second page recreate it. Putting this building logic in a user control would help tremendously, or figure out a way to keep them on the same page to leverage both features.
