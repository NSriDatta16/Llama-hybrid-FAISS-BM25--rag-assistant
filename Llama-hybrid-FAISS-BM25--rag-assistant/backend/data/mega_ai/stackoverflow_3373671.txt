The string consists of a small object containing a pointer to the storage for the string data, whose lifetime is managed by the object. There's usually no need to worry about the memory taken up by the object itself, but if the string is large then you might want to free the storage without destroying the object. Calling clear() , or assigning from an emptry string, might not free the storage. The way to make sure that it is freed is to swap the string with a newly-constructed temporary; the temporary's destructor will free it. string().swap(a); // replaces `a` with an empty string You can also do this to any of the standard containers.
