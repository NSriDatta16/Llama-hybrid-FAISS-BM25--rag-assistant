How to access url hash/fragment from a Django Request object

As in the title: How can I access the URL hash/fragment (the part following the hash # , or 'pound symbol' in US English) from a Django view and so, I suppose, from a Django Request object? I've not found enough information on the documentation here available: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/ P.S. Assume the fragment is included in the URL sent to the server. (I have verified this in my case, where I'm not actually using a browser.)
