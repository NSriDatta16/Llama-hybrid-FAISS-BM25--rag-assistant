Aggregating multiple distributed MySQL databases

I have a project that requires us to maintain several MySQL databases on multiple computers. They will have identical schemas. Periodically, each of those databases must send their contents to a master server, which will aggregate all of the incoming data. The contents should be dumped to a file that can be carried via flash drive to an internet-enabled computer to send. Keys will be namespace'd, so there shouldn't be any conflict there, but I'm not totally sure of an elegant way to design this. I'm thinking of timestamping every row and running the query "SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE timestamp > last_backup_time" on each table, then dumping this to a file and bulk-loading it at the master server. The distributed computers will NOT have internet access. We're in a very rural part of a 3rd-world country. Any suggestions?
