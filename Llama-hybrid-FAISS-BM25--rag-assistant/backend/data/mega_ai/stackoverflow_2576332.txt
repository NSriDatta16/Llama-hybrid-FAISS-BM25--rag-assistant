I use Blend when I'm doing visual tweaking or setting up Storyboards. I'll sometimes use it when first laying out a window, as well, but I've found that it's often easier to just hand-code the XAML rather than relying on Blend to guess the layout I want. I use Visual Studio when I'm doing XAML editing by hand, as it has better Intellisense and automatic formatting than Blend. I never use the visual editor for WPF in VS. Part of the challenge here is that XAML layout is much more sophisticated than WinForms, so simple drag and drop doesn't quite cut it anymore. Blend does a pretty good job of guessing what I want, but if I really want to clarify how the visuals should be laid out, it's easier to express by typing the XAML, now that I'm familiar with it. My typical workflow: Create the initial layout by entering XAML in Visual Studio for the Grids, StackPanels, DockPanels and what have you that will lay out the window or control. I may also drop in some of the other controls as well, if the layout is simple. Open up Blend and use it to place smaller controls, edit control properties and create/associate any styles I need. If I need custom control or data templates, I'll create them from Blend and then repeat the VS/Blend process on those templates. Go back to VS and edit the XAML to set up my designer data context and manually code the data bindings. Use Blend to verify the look of the finished window or control with the designer data context, tweaking and styling as needed to polish the UI. I go back and forth a lot, but I'm typically also approaching it from a different mindset with each tool. If I was working with a larger company, I suspect most of what I do in Blend would be handled by a graphical designer, which is I think the intention. I don't mind wearing both hats, though and I've become accustomed to using both tools, as needed.
