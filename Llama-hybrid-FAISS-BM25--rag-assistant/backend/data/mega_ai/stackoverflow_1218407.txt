Organizing Classes in Action Script 3

I am using Flex Builder 3 to develop my first application that will communicate with a server that has many operations, so many in fact it is overwhelming and I am grouping them together into classes that will expose the operations and also manage some client side meta data. I am calling these classes "server proxies" because they are technically similar to a proxy class in WCF. I would want to organize these classes where I can do things like the below where Authentication is a class, and ServerProxies is some feature of the language that allows me to group that class with other classes in the ServerProxies category, or subcatagories such as the Geography subcategory: ServerProxies.Authentication.AddLoginSuccesfulListener(onLoginSuccessful); ServerProxies.Authentication.SubmitCredentials(someParaemetersHere); ServerProxies.Geography.Querying.GetAllTiles(someMoreParameters); ServerProxies.Geography.Querying.MeasureTwoPoints(pointA,pointB); ServerProxies.Geography.Display.RenderMapExtent(topLeftPoint,bottomRightPoint); This example is kind of trivialized because some of these operations probably wouldn't go through a server, but that is not the topic at hand. (just had to say that before someone gets off on a tangent and flames me over some imaginary code) *So my question is, what language feature of Action Script 3 would allow me to create such categories? In C# it would have been a namespace, but namespaces in Action Script seem to be more like custom access modifiers that apply to methods and properties, rather than entire classes.
