Sinatra/Rails: Persisting custom class instances during app lifetime

Can I assert rails/sinatra apps are initialized only once and all requests share the same app instance? or do new requests spawn new app instances? Is it possible to instance custom classes and persist them during app lifetime without using sessions, database storages or third party services? If so, what are the implications from a thread-safeness point of view? I'm trying to figure how to implement a web-based download manager and I'm currently evaluating ruby-based frameworks.
