Your initial sample size is relatively small for machine learning. That is going to result in high variance estimates, different versions of the datasets might have different results on the evaluation metric. As far as evaluation metric performance going down as you increase sample size, that again is a high variance with small sample size issue. Your initial small sample happens to more amendable to modeling (probably due to randomness). As you increase sample size, it lowers the variance and in this case also lowers the bias. Be cautious about resampling and resplitting your data repeatedly and looking for the best solution. It can be tempting to mistakenly drawn conclusions about the data, the best model, and machine learning in general.
