The random variables $Y$ (response), $T_1$ and $T_2$ are vectors of Bernoulli-distributed random variables. That is the $i$th element of each has a Bernoulli distribution whose probability parameter depends on the $i$th element of $X$ in the indicated fashion. The $\text{logit}$ function is simply $\text{logit}(p)=\log(\frac{p}{1-p})$. It looks like it is setting up simulated data for some kind of logistic regression type of situation but there's not a lot of context here.
