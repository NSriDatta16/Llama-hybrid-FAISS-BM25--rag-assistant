I use DBIx::Simple instead of plain DBI, the interface is, well, simpler and more regular. Also, of course, XML::Twig for XML processing. Then Getopt::Std for (simple) options, and YAML::Syck for temporary storage that doesn't require a DB, as well as debugging, instead of Data::Dumper. And, like you, Text::Template for most complex output.
