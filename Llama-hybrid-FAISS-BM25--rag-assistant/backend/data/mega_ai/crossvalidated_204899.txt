Minimum amount of explained variance after Principal Component Analysis

I am running a PCA against two datasets of biological data (gene expression data). The first has 20K genes (dimensions) x 450 samples, while the second has 11K genes (dimensions) x 185 samples. Running PCA on these two datasets I get a very low amount of explained variance by the first principal components. Specifically, in the case of the first dataset I get PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 Standard deviation 1.175e+05 1.132e+05 9.022e+04 8.412e+04 7.002e+04 Proportion of Variance 1.396e-01 1.296e-01 8.236e-02 7.161e-02 4.961e-02 Cumulative Proportion 1.396e-01 2.692e-01 3.516e-01 4.232e-01 4.728e-01 PC6 PC7 PC8 PC9 PC10 Standard deviation 6.857e+04 6.816e+04 6.147e+04 5.796e+04 4.940e+04 Proportion of Variance 4.758e-02 4.701e-02 3.823e-02 3.399e-02 2.470e-02 Cumulative Proportion 5.204e-01 5.674e-01 6.056e-01 6.396e-01 6.643e-01 PC11 PC12 PC13 PC14 PC15 Standard deviation 4.434e+04 4.196e+04 3.953e+04 3.667e+04 3.374e+04 Proportion of Variance 1.989e-02 1.782e-02 1.581e-02 1.361e-02 1.152e-02 Cumulative Proportion 6.842e-01 7.020e-01 7.178e-01 7.315e-01 7.430e-01 PC16 PC17 PC18 PC19 PC20 Standard deviation 3.324e+04 3.237e+04 3.155e+04 3.080e+04 2.955e+04 Proportion of Variance 1.118e-02 1.060e-02 1.007e-02 9.600e-03 8.830e-03 Cumulative Proportion 7.541e-01 7.648e-01 7.748e-01 7.844e-01 7.933e-01 In this case, the first principal component amounts for the $13.96$% of total variance. For the second dataset, which is smaller in size, the first principal component amount for the $41.71$% of total variance, the second for the $10.56$%. In particular: in the first dataset, cumulative explained variance for the first $10$ principal component is $66.43$% in the second dataset, cumulative explained variance for the first $10$ principal component is $78.43$% I have two questions: Could it be that the amount of explained variance is this low because of the high number of dimensions? Could the result of this PCAs be used for subsequent analysis, even if the amount of variance is very low?
