Draggable div - what's the point?

I've seen many implementations of draggable divs in jQuery, .Net Ajax, and plain old javascript. While they are all novel, and solve the problem with varying ease, I've never understood what the point was. What is the value of a draggable div? What use case does a draggable div implement? Are there places where draggable divs improve the user experience, or are they the web 2.0 version of the tag?
