Mixed effects model adding covariate vs adding random effect

I am currently looking into mixed effect models and I am trying to understand the difference between adding a random effect and adding a covariate to a linear model. Consider this example: library(lme4) df % filter(State %in% c("SC","CT","CA")) model1 As you can see, I am trying to predict the BirthRate using the AverageAgeofMother . I see that there are differences depending on the state (different intercepts). If I now use model1 to predict new data, does the model account for these differences in state? If so, how is the done on a mathematical level (if possible, please explain it rather simple). Using a very simple linear model gives a different intercept and slope, so I guess something more complex than just averaging the intercepts/slope is going on. Lastly, can somebody point out to me what the difference is between using a mixed model like I did and using multiple regression ( lm(BirthRate ~ AverageAgeofMother + State ). If I am not mistaken, in this case I am also considering the effect the State has on the BirthRate Any insights are appreciated! Cheers!
