Please note that this question is similar to "Can I get rid of Windows and let my Windows program run on the bare metal without an operating system"? Java programs expect a large set of classes to be readily available, which is what the JRE provides, and that any compiler or emulator will have to provide too. What you can do however is to look at a launcher which will allow you to bring your own JRE with your application - this will only work at the platform of the JRE, but you are already willing to be platform specific. Several exist - I encourage you to look at the many questions already on Stack Overflow about how to do that.
