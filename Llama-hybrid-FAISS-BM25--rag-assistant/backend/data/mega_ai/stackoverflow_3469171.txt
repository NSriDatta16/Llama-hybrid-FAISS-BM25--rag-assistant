During drag drop, how to show a popup with text(or a cursor with text) that follows the mouse cursor in WPF

I need to show a popup to the user when he is dragging files or items onto my control. The popup basically informs him why dragging is disabled by giving him a message. I would like the popup to follow the mouse cursor whilst he is still in dragging mode. OR is there a way to change the mouse cursor while dragging and displaying a text alongside the cursor? If there are any other designs that you guys can suggest.. that would be nice too. Thanks for your suggestions!
