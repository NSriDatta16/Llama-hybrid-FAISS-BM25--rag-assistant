How do I make iPhone SpringBoard show two or more icons for one application bundle?

It seems like Info.plist file has an ability to declare different roles for the same application bundle through the UIRoleInfo key. SpringBoard can recognize these roles after installing an app and may display separate icons for each application role. For instance, iPhone shows MobileSlideShow.app as 2 different programs: Photos and Camera . Unfortunately, there is no official Apple documentation about the subject at the moment. Would anybody advise how to organize the same behavior in a custom app? This feature is going to be used in the Enterprise product for ad hoc distribution.
