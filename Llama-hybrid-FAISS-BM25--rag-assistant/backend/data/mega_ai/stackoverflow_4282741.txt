I would bind post to the location at creation time so that for each location I can get (through a repository) a list of associated posts. It would look like this: Creation: var p = new Post(latitude, longitude); var locations = locationRepository.FindByCoordinates(latitude, longitude); foreach (var l in locations) { l.AssociatePost(p); } session.Save(p); Retrieval: var associatedPosts = postRepository.FindByLocation(locationId); foreach (var p in associatedPosts) { Display(p); } Under the hood, the association between posts and location would be implemented as a many-to-many table relationship. There is one problem with this solution: adding a new location requires to scan all the posts and assign them to the new location (if applicable). Hope that helps.
