Which hypothesis test should I use for this given situation?

Let's say I have lot of users who spend money on various items. Considering Item A: For this item, I want to find whether there is a statistical difference in average spending in the month of October and September. I am confused between ANOVA and Two Sample T-Test. I read somewhere that if you have one categorical variable and one continuous variable use T-test. Here, in this situation since I am only considering two months can I fit my situation in this case. Whereas back of my mind, the month is a categorical variable with more than 2 categories. It was suggested to use the ANOVA test where you have one continuous variable and one categorical variable with more than 2 categories. Please suggest the best hypothesis test which I should use in my scenario. Mean spending in October: 4.35 Std Dev of October: 1.95 Var of October: 3.81 Number of records october: 395 Mean spending in Nov: 4.49 Std Dev of Nov: 1.96 Var of Nov: 3.85 Number of records Nov: 383
