What neural network loss function to use for multi-class, multi-label classification tasks where labels refer to counts?

I would like to train a neural network to detect which of N classes is present, and in what amounts. In other words each example x has label vector y where y_i >= 0 . For example, this could be an image classifier that detects not only whether a given object is present, but how many instances of that object are in the image. For example a classifier trained to detect trucks, dogs, and trees might be given an image with 1 truck, 2 dogs, and 0 trees, and I'd like the prediction to reflect the actual counts. Binary Cross Entropy is close, but only accounts for detecting the presence of a class, not counting it.
