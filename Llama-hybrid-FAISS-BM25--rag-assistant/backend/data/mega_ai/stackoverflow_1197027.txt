There is Net-SSH-Perl Some notes on usage . If you are discouraged with the module and need an easy way out, you could directly invoke SSH on the shell. perl -e {`ssh user@server "command"`} should work... I hope you intend to let the SSH use its passwords and not implement 'security' some yourself. Could also consider public key authentication .
