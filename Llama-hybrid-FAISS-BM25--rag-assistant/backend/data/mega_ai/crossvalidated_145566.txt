How to calculate Area Under the Curve (AUC), or the c-statistic, by hand

I am interested in calculating area under the curve (AUC), or the c-statistic, by hand for a binary logistic regression model. For example, in the validation dataset, I have the true value for the dependent variable, retention (1 = retained; 0 = not retained), as well as a predicted retention status for each observation generated by my regression analysis using a model that was built using the training set (this will range from 0 to 1). My initial thoughts were to identify the "correct" number of model classifications and simply divide the number of "correct" observations by the number of total observations to calculate the c-statistic. By "correct", if the true retention status of an observation = 1 and the predicted retention status is > 0.5 then that is a "correct" classification. Additionally, if the true retention status of an observation = 0 and the predicted retention status is 0.5. I am aware of TP, FP, FN, TN, but not aware of how to calculate the c-statistic given this information.
