Although not exactly an answer to your question, I think we should mention here Rational class, suitable for keeping rational numbers without the loss implied with storage of float-point numbers, i.e. in form of fractions: n = 3 #=> 3 r = Rational(1,3) #=> 13 # don't let this confuse you, this is 1/3 in fact r.to_s #=> "1/3" You can perform usual rational arithmetic on such numbers, keeping the fractions' accuracy: r = r * r #=> 19 r.to_s #=> "1/9" And, eventually, you can convert these numbers to ordinary floats: r.to_f #=> 0.111111111111111
