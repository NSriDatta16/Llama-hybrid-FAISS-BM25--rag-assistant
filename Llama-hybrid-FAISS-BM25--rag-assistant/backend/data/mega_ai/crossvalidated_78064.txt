The traditional approach for handling outliers is to simply remove them such that your model is trained only on "good" data. Keep in mind that the mean value is affected by the presence of those outliers. If you replace outliers with the mean calculated after the outliers were removed from your dataset , it will make no difference since the regression line (from simple linear regression) will pass through the mean of your training data anyway (this will reduce the variance of your estimates though, which is probably the opposite of what you want given that you know there are outliers). The effect your approach will have on the model depends on the influence (leverage) of the outlier. I'd recommend against the approach you suggest in lieu of just removing the point entirely.
