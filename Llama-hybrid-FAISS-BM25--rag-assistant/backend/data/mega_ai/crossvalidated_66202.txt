The first major issue is whether the allocation of students to test-format conditions is independent of factors relevant to confidence ratings or test accuracy. Random allocation of participants to conditions would ensure this. In the absence of random-allocation, you would want to think about whether you have reasons to expect any systematic differences. In the absence of random-allocation, any observed group differences could readily be attributed to changes in the two groups of students. In particular, from a theoretical perspective, I think that merely asking a confidence question would not influence the accuracy of responses. If you can assume independence as per above, then you could start by examining whether the means of the average confidence ratings or average accuracy difference between the two groups. Independent groups t-tests would be the standard choice. More generally, there are a wide range of ways that the multivariate distribution composed of 20 confidence ratings and 20 accuracy ratings could vary. You would probably want to focus on the most relevant or theoretically like characteristics of interest. For example, a few statistics that come to mind include mean confidence, mean accuracy, standard deviation of confidence, and the within-person correlation between confidence and accuracy. For means differences you could use independent groups t-tests; for standard deviations, you could use Leven's test. For average within-person correlations you could also use independent groups t-tests.
