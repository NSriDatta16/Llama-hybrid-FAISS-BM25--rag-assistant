Replication - Issues with turning on SQL Agent on Local Machine

I want to learn more about replication and want to turn it on for my local copy of SQL2008. I watched one video that said I can create a publication on my local machine and then replicate to a different database on the same machine. Their example works and I want to try it. Is there anything I should be concerned about regarding turning on SQL Agent? Thanks in advance, Randy
