Which fragment will execute faster / generate fewer lines of code? (C++ / JavaScript)

Which of these is more efficient in terms of speed (number of lines of code generated). var x=obj.mem; x.do1(); x.do2(); or obj.mem.do1(); obj.mem.do2(); I just wrote those in a generic pattern. Specifically, if I have to access a member( or a member of a member ) , is it better to assign the common part to a variable and then use that variable or to call it directly as shown in the second case. I'm concerned mainly about C++ and JavaScript (if it matters). Thank You. EDIT-> PS.I did not ask a common answer. I understand that Javascript is an interpreter language while C++ is compiler based. The little knowledge I have of JavaScript is self taught and we learned C++ for 2 years at school (and that too Turbo C++) and the rest is again self taught. So, forgive me for the confusion. I was expecting a general result assuming that the constructs are valid and considering any possible variations. Anyway, my major doubts were cleared. Thanks. Conclusion: JS is faster with local variables (though negligible) and C++ will probably optimise to get almost equal results. Thank You for all the input.
