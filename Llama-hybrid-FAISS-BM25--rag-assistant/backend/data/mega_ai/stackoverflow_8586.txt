I actually quite liked Spring.. It was a fresh breeze of air in your average J2EE Java Beans.. I recommend implementing the example Spring provides: http://static.springframework.org/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/ Also, I decided to go full monty and added Hibernate to my Spring application ;), because Spring provides excellent support for Hibernate... :) I do have a DON'T however, which I learned the hard way (product in production)... If you only implement the Controller interface, and return a ModelAndView object with some data as provided with the interface, Spring does garbadge collect those resources, for tries to cache those data. So be careful to put large data in those ModelAndView objects, because they will hog up your server memory for as long as the server is in the air as soon as that page has been viewed...
