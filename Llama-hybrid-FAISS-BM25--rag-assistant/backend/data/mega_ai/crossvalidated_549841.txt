In that bayesian model, $\gamma_0$ posterior depends on $\vec\mu$ , while $\vec\mu$ posterior depends on data (you may think of it as in a DAG). $\gamma_0$ is conditionally independent on data (conditioned on $\vec\mu$ ). In particular, drafted $\gamma_0$ will vary around $\bar\mu$ , and this variation is independent on data, so it just sums up to $\bar\mu$ 's variance. You may think it this way: information streams up from data to $\vec\mu$ (low variance), and then to $\gamma_0$ (higher variance), because you set a low informative prior. If you set a prior more informative than data, $\gamma_0$ would have been less variable than $\bar\mu$ .
