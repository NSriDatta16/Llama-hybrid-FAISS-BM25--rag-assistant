SSH "Login monitor" for Linux

I'm trying to write a script that informs the user when someone has logged in on the machine via ssh. My current idea is to parse the output of "w" using grep in intervals. But that's neither elegant nor performant. Has anyone got a better idea how to implement such a program? Any help would really be appreciated!
