IFRAMEs and the Safari on the iPad, how can the user scroll the content?

According to the Apple iOS mantra it should be possible to scroll the contents of an IFRAME by dragging it with two fingers. Unfortunately running the latest version of iOS on the iPad I have yet to find a single website with an IFRAME that scrolls using this method - no scrollbars appear either. Does anyone know how a user is supposed to scroll the contents of an IFRAME with the mobile Safari?
