Using client authentication is generally a Bad Idea(TM). That's because you now rely on machines that you may not control for authentication. If I wanted to subvert your system, I could create a new user locally, say, db2inst1 or VIRTUALUSR01 or Administrator, with a password I know, and then, use that to wreak havoc on the database. If, however, no one in your organisation has root/administrator authority over their own machines, client authentication can be made to work. But all it takes is someone plugging in their own personal laptop, and your database could be at risk. Instead, check the permissions of the files. If you've installed as root, ~db2inst1/sqllib/security/db2c[hk]pw (assuming instance ID of db2inst1) should be setuid root. If not, run db2iupdt against your instance ( ./db2iupdt db2inst1 ) which should fix the permissions. If you've installed without root authority ("non-root install"), which I doubt, since you seem to have had this working, you would need to read the DB2 documentation on non-root installations and their limitations - I don't use non-root installs myself, so I'm not so familiar with them. However, there should be a set-root script that you can use to enable setuid root which, of course, you have to run as root .
