Is there a GUI that I can use to create XML documents based on my schema?

I want to create a simple graphical user interface to allow non-technical users to create an XML file without having to manually edit the XML source. Ideally I'd like a drag and drop interface, but failing that, anything really. The contents of the XML file are similar to an encoded flow chart of a binary tree, so maybe something like Visio, with a save as xml option? Here's a quick sample of the XML output that is required: Welcome. 1.1 Do you have what you need? 1.2 1.1.1 ... Are there any existing tools out there that you can recommend for this purpose? Ideally open-source or with a free personal license, but I'm interested in hearing about all options. Thanks, David
