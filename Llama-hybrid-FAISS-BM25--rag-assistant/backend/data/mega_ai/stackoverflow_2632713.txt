All stored procs will recompile automatically. This will happen anyway when stats change and after index maintenance anyway. At some point, you have to reorganise 478 million rows (drop/create indexes) or move (new table). Neither way is better then the other, unfortunately. I feel your pain though: we have similarly large tables with pending new columns and an index changes. Saying that, you should do it step 2-1-4-3 to avoid unnecessary non-clustered index maintenance when you drop/create the clustered index. And drop the unique constraint. The clustered index could be unique and clustered. A unique constrint is just another index that would be unnecessary. As for the performance benefit, perhaps ask the vendor why.
