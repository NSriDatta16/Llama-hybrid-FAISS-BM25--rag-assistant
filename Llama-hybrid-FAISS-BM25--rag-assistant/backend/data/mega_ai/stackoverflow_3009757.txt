Simple answer: One conditional jump is going to be more efficient than two subtractions, one addition, a bitwise and, and a shift operation combined. I've been sufficiently schooled on this point (see the comments) that I'm no longer even confident enough to say that it's usually more efficient. Pragmatic answer: Either way, you're not paying nearly as much for the extra CPU cycles as you are for the time it takes a programmer to figure out what that second example is doing. Program for readability first, efficiency second.
