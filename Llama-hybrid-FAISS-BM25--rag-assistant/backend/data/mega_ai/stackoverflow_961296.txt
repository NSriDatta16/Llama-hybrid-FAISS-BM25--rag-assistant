Storing Videos in Web Application or Otherwise

I'm looking to let users of my web application upload videos to my site, however i believe i will be constrained by how much storage i will actually have. Is there any alternatives such as being able to store videos on Youtube via the api and recall them when needed. Any help for the design of how videos should be stored would be great. Thanks, Adam
