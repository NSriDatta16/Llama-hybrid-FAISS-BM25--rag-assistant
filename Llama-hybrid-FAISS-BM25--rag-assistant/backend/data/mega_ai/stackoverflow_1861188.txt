Could multiple changes happen (and queue up) before the operator has time to respond? The boilerplate solution to similar problems is to highlight the element that changed by making it glow, light up, or change to a special color, and only change back to its usual state when the user touches or clicks on the item or an nearby acknowledge button. However this may not be the best angle for you. It sounds like a constantly visible list of items would be a good solution. That way, the operator can constantly check the list of items and work through them in an orderly fashion if new items appear. New items could be color coded and decorated with icons to indicate the estimated magnitude of change or impact. List items older than a predefined threshold could blink to catch the operators attention. Following this route, you could add a history list (below the current items) detailing what happened when. This would allow an operator to go back and check what happened as a reference if they forgot or were distracted.
