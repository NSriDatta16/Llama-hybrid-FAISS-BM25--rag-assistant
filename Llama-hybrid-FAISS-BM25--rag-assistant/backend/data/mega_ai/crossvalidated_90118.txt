ar.ols() or arima() for modeling time series

When trying to fit a AR(p) model to a time series in R, it seems that both ar.ols() and arima() will work. Is there some consideration of when to use which then? ar.ols() seems to use least square estimation, while arima() uses maximum likelihood or minimize conditional sum-of-squares (default method). Is minimizing conditional sum-of-squares equivalent to conditional MLE for Gaussian stationary process? So is arima() essentially MLE or conditional MLE?
