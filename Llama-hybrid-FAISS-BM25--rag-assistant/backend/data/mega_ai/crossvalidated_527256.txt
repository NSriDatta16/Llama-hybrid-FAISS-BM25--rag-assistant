Hotelling's point is that both these features not only happened but should have been expected to happen: leading stores in 1916 more often than not became closer to the average in 1922 than they had been in 1916 leading stores in 1922 more often than not had been closer to the average in 1916 than they became in 1922 so regression to the mean happened forward in time for the 1916 leading stores but backward in time for the 1922 leading stores. There was nothing new in this: Galton's original studies had shown that the children of extremely tall parents tended to be closer to the average height than their parents were, leading to the use of the word "regression" for the analysis which showed this; Galton then showed with the same data that the parents of extremely tall children tended to be closer to the average height than their children were. One of his 1875 charts, copied from Wikipedia , looked like this
