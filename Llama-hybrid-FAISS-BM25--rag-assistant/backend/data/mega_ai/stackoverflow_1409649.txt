How to change the height of a ?

I have a big paragraph of text that is divided into subparagraphs with 's: Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. I want to widen the gap between these subparagraphs, like there is two 's or something like that. I know that the right way to do this is to use , but right now I cannot change this layout, so I am looking for CSS-only solution. I've tried setting 's line-height and height with display: block , I also Googled and Stack Overflow-ed briefly, but did not find any solution. Is this even possible without changing the layout?
