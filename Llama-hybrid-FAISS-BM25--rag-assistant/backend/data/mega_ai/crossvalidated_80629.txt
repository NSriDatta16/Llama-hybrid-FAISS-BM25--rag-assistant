Here's some papers on the subject: http://vbn.aau.dk/files/18915270/Corrected_Dec072009_ARIMA_Based_Time_Series_Model_of_Stochastic_Wind_Power_Generation.pdf http://www.academia.edu/1258592/Short_Term_Wind_Speed_Forecasting_Using_Time_Series_Models Just about any textbook on weather forecasting also covers this material, however as you'll see it does require background knowledge of physics / atmospheric sciences to properly understand why these things are modelled this way. Economic applications are far more accessible, hence the reason they're included in general purpose time series textbooks.
