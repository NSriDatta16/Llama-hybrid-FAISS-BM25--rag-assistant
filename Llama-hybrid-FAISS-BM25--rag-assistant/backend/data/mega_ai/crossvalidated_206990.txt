Is it OK to use an original variable & another variable constructed from it in a regression model if there is no multicollinearity?

I'm doing binary logistic regression. I want to predict the chance of being in an advanced class. There no multicollinearity among my variables. I have three predictors: If you passed the test or not (a binary variable >60 or The number of correct answers you had on the test (a continuous variable between 0 and 100), The number of times you did a practice test before taking the test officially (a continuous variable). There is no multicollinearity, but I'm wondering, can use variables 1 and 2 since 1 is created from 2? (That is, if you had more than 60 good answers on variable 2, your code on variable 1 would be >60.) I'm wondering if I'm not using the same concept twice.
