While not exactly K-means (see below), I ran across several clustering approaches (in addition to the EM clustering , already mentioned by @Anony-Mousse), which might be helpful. They include: weighted hierarchical clustering (search for WPGMA and WPGMC here ); Dirichlet distribution-based clustering ( Dirichlet mixture models and Bayesian-based hierarchical Dirichlet process models ); latent class (LC) clustering (see this page and this paper ; LC clustering can be viewed as K-means generalization or, using the authors' terminology, "probabilistic extension").
