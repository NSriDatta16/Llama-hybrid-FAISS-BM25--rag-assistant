The OS kernel will close all your open filehandles, sockets, allocated memory, and so forth. It can't flush buffered IO internal to the program, and it'll just tear down your TCP sockets without saying BYE to the remote peer, but there isn't much you can (or need) to do when the OS reaps your process. But you might need to do some cleanup at next startup, if your application crashed while leaving inconsistent data on the persistent storage.
