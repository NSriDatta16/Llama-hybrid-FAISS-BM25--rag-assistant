What are some techniques to calculate the highsest average when the number of data points is important?

A very simple example here would be restaurants with online reviews. On a platform where every resturant might have a different number of reviews with a vote ranging from 1 to 5, which restaurant is the best? Obviously one resturant might have an average vote of 4.9 but only 10 reviews while another one might have an average vote of 4.7 but 10k reviews and most people would probably assume the second one is "better". What I am asking is, what are the possible ways to formalize this intuition? How can we calculate if an average vote is "robust"? One idea I would use for example would be to calculate a new average with some additional 1 and 5 votes and the more the new average gets close to 3, the more we know the average was actually not robust but I'm pretty sure there are much better ways to handle this. Any idea?
