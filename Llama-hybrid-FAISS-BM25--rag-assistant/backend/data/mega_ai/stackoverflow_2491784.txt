1 - Should value types be real 'value types' if the language supports it? I think the answer to that will depend on usage and other factors within your application, but the pattern you're probably looking for is "Data Transfer Object" which has properties, getters, and setters, but nothing else. It can be either a struct or an object, and objects will probably simplify memory management issues, especially with regard to boxing. 2- Is there any feature in C# that makes clearer the association between the language and the model (for instance, this is an entity, this is an aggregate etc.) I would go with naming conventions, e.g., "CustomerEntity", "OrderAggregate", etc. Good question; I'm looking forward to seeing responses.
