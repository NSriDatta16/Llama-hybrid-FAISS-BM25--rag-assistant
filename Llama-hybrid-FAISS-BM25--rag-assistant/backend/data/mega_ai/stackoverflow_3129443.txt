WPF 4 Drag and Drop with visual element as cursor

I have a WPF 4 app which I want to enable drag and drop with, currently I have it working with a basic drag and drop implementation, but I have found that it would be much better if, instead of the mouse cursor changing over to represent the move operation, I could use an image underneath my finger. My drag and drop operation is initiated inside a custom user control, so I will need to insert a visual element into the visual tree and have it follow my finger around, perhaps I should enable the ManipulationDelta event on my main window, check for a boolean then move the item around?
