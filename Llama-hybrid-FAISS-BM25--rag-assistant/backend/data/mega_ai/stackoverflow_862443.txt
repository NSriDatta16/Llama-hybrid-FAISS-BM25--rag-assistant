Accessing MP3 Player / USB Storage device

I'm trying to access a USB Storage device, however the device although appearing in the computer / Drives section, is not allocated a Drive letter, thus when I iterate through the attached drives as described in How to discover USB storage devices and writable CD/DVD drives (C#) , it does not appear. I've taken the "Location" from a file on the drive (properties) and it comes up as COMPUTER/Q1/Datacasts but this doesn't work when I pass it to the FileInfo Object (network drive cannot be found), and I'm at a bit of a loss at which way to proceed
