Configuration storage for a desktop application

What are the benefits of choosing either: a file in the user's home directory, e.g. ~/.myapp/config using the user's gconf database I already know a couple of things; storing data in the user's gconf database makes it a little harder for the user to copy those settings out and onto another account or computer. On the other hand, is it true that using gconf would be easier as the underlying data storage facilities are already sorted out, without you having to write your own configuration file handler?
