How to test a linear regression against a NULL expectation?

I need to test if y1 (in blue) and y2 (in green) are significantly different from an estimated null NULL.y (orange) in this simple example here? If the intercept is different, one way I know to test against the null is mod1 if say you are testing if it's significantly different from 1. Here, I am testing if values above the line NULL.y is significantly different. My guess is that y2 will be but perhaps not y1 . Question: How do I compare the data with the null? set.seed(111) library(truncnorm) x $y.key y.key) ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y.vals, color = y.key), data = df) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm", formula = y ~ x) EDIT: For those interested in what the actual plots are-- y1 and y2 are the index of mean crowding of the patch (J) = (Variance/(mean)^2) - (1/mean) where variance is the variance in the abundance of #trees in a patch and mean is the mean abundance of the trees. The x-axis x is the mean number of trees. Since Y is calculated from X, I calculated the null by shuffling X from the original sample, calculate Y, the slope between them. Repeat 1000 times. Find the average slope. Use the equation of the slope to calculate NULL.y from the original x value. The NULL.y turns out to be a negative correlation. Now, I want to test if the slope for yi are different from the null. In my study I actually have two nulls one corresponding to y1 and another to y2. For simplicity here, I just represented it as one null.
