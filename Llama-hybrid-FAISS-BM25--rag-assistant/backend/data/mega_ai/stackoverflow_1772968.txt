How do I properly create and manipulate checkboxes via javascript in Internet Explorer?

I'm writing a web app. Based on certain choices the user selects, it dynamically creates a number of checkbox input elements. For the sake of usability, they should be created in a checked state, and the user would uncheck the ones they don't want. I have the code working fine in Firefox. Unfortunately, I have to target IE 7.0. There, I'm having no luck. Here are the relevant parts. This creates a checkbox in the DIV box with CboxBlock for the ID. function InsertCheckBox(name, appfk) { // Create the text box node. var tbox = document.createElement('input'); // Set all the values. tbox.type = "checkbox"; tbox.checked = "checked"; tbox.name = "cbox"; tbox.value = appfk; // Next, we need a paragraph element to place it in. var para = document.createElement('p'); // Text to place inside P para.appendChild( document.createTextNode(name) ); // Append text box para.appendChild(tbox); // Attach to the CboxBlock block = document.getElementById("CboxBlock"); block.appendChild( para ); } In Firefox, this works right off the bat. The checkboxes are checked. In IE, they are not. So I added another function to fire after creation: function SetCheckboxes() { block = document.getElementById("CboxBlock") //cboxes = document.getElementsByName("cbox"); cboxes = block.childNodes; for (ind in cboxes) { box = cboxes[ind]; box.checked = "checked"; } } I found the stupid bug where getElementsByName wasn't returning anything, but this still changes nothing. The text boxes are unchanged. I even tried changing it to box.checked = true, like I've seen in a few places, but that still didn't change it. Can anyone see where I might be making a mistake? Is there some other way I'm supposed to manipulate checkboxes in IE? Thanks for any info you can provide.
