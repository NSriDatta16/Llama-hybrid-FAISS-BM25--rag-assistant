Use Flash E4X with Bing

I'm using Action Script 3.0, and am using E4X to parse some XML files. It was working fine, until I began using Bing's xml result file. Here's a sample of Bing's XML result: 85700000 0 HELLO! - The place for celebrity news - hellomagazine.com I need to get info from the WebResult node, but the colon in the web:WebResult is throwing me off. I've tried the following: var title:String = xml..Results.WebResult[0].text(); to get the first title from the Web Results, but it doesn't work. I think that it can't find the WebResult node because this returns 0 var results:int = xml..Results.WebResult.length(); Any suggestions on how to get information from this kind of XML file using E4X? Thanks!
