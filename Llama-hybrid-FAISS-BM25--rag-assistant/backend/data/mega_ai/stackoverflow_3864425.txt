When you update a form, would save and replace text, or avoid updating the text?

I have a form in jQuery where I update all the images via a simple ajax call to reload the entire page. Unfortunately the captions are included in that form as well, and as I start writing, my captions are overwritten. What then would you do to keep them? Would you.. Save them before the ajax call and replace them after it? Avoid updating the captions all together? The latter seems like the best choice, I'm just not entirely sure how I would implement calling an AJAX call but just updating the images . My sweet updater $.extend({ PhotoUpdater: { startUpdate: function(organization, gallery){ url = "/organizations/" + organization + "/media/galleries/" + gallery + "/edit_photo_captions" timer = window.setTimeout(function(){ $.PhotoUpdater.doUpdate(url) }, 5000) }, stopUpdate: function(){ clearTimeout(timer); timer = 0; }, doUpdate: function(url){ $.ajax({type: "GET", url: url, dataType: "script"}); }, resetValues: function(){ setTimeout(function(){ $("body").data("edit_photos_closed", "false"); $.PhotoUpdater.stopUpdate(); }, 3000 ); } } }); my html Caption edit crop remove crop
