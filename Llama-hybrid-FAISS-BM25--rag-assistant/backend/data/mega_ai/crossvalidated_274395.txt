The question is not clear to me. But if you want to use formula instead of matrix input. You can use caret pacakge, which provide universal interface to many packages including glmnet . Or you can use model.matrix to convert formula to matrix form. If you want to fit a logistic regression with $\lambda=0$, you can directly use traditional glm . If you want to manually implement it, my answer here has the code to to calculate the objective function and gradient of logistic loss and use BFGS to optimize. For the revised question: projected gradient descent may work well, since the "box constraints" is easy to solve. My answer here gives some details on projected gradient descent. (I believe projected gradient descent is used by glmnet ). Solving constrained optimization problem: projected gradient vs. dual? Additional reference for projected gradient descent, book from the author of glmnet: Statistical Learning with Sparsity page 120
