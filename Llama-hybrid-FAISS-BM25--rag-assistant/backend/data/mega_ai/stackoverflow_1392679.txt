There are couple of things that bother me. The terminology. ViewModel is this case is a simple view data that is populated and later consumed by controller. View knows nothing about controller as ASP.NET MVC infrastructure is responsible for selecting controllers and appropriate actions. Controller handles user interaction. I think it looks more like Passive View than ViewModel (I assume that by ViewModel you mean Model-View-ViewModel pattern). The details. The controller that populates view data is not supposed to know the details of how the view is implemented. However OrganisationViewModel.Country discloses unnecessary details (SelectListItem is pure view implementation detail). Thus making controller dependent on view implementation details. I think it should be changed to avoid it. Consider using some object that will hold the data for a country. Hope this helps.
