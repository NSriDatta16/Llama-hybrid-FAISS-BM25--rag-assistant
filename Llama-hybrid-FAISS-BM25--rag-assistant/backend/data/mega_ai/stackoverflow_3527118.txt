Flash turned out to achieve what Applets tried to, and has done very well so. Small initial download, programs starts fast and run inside a web page. That said, the abilities to launch applets were enhanced with the Java 6 update 10 revamping of the JNLP specification of Java WebStart, but I have not given it a closer look (we use Java WebSTart extensively for applications, not applets), and I suspect others haven't either.
