How to retrieve a PDF using WebBrowser or WebClient in .NET?

I am trying to automate the daily retrieving of a web file using .NET. The file is a PDF located at an address similar to: http://www.example.com/?s=doc20101022 and these are the headers of HTTP request registered for debug using IE HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS) Vary: User-Agent,Accept-Encoding Expires: 0 Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: public Last-Modified: Mon, 22 Nov 2010 22:45:12 GMT Cache-Control: private Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="doc20101022.pdf" Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary Content-Type: application/force-download Date: Tue, 23 Nov 2010 10:41:43 GMT X-Varnish: 2155914052 Via: 1.1 varnish Content-Length: 6596997 Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Connection: Keep-Alive Age: 2 Can you please suggest me a way to get it and save it locally using WebClient, WebBrowser or other VB.NET (Framework 4.0) components?
