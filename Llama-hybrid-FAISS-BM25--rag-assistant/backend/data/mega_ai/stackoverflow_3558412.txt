Randomness within a circle is known paradoxical problem (see Bertrand's paradox). So you need to consider how to randomly distribute the points. Choosing a random distance ranging from 0 to the specified radius, and going in a random direction from the the circle's center (the grid's center) is probably not what you want, since you will have an uneven distribution across the area (more clustering towards the center). I would figure out the AREA of the circle (that is: the cells that are within the circle with the specified radius), maybe store them in a temp array, and choose n (e.g., 20) of them at random. I am not sure that was entirely helpful, but the main idea: DO consider what you mean by random.
