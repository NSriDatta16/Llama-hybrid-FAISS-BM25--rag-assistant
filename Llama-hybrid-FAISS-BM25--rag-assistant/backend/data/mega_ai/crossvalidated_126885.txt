Methods to compute factor scores, and what is the "score coefficient" matrix in PCA or factor analysis?

As per my understanding, in PCA based on correlations we get factor (= principal component in this instance) loadings which are nothing but the correlations between variables and factors. Now when I need to generate factor scores in SPSS, I can directly get factor scores of each respondent for each factor. I also observed that if I multiply " component score coefficient matrix " (as produced by SPSS) with standardized original variables, I get the same factor scores as obtained from SPSS. Can someone please help me understand how "component score coefficient matrix" or "factor score coefficient matrix" - with which I can compute factor or component scores - is calculated? How do different methods of computation factor scores differ on this matrix?
