I don't know what your answer is, but I just learned this technology a few days ago also. It was that, in the touchesBegan method of the view, I called [self.nextResponder touchesBegan: touches withEvent: event]; and then wrote the touches began event in the view controller to which this passed the event. Seems like no solution could be simpler. John Doner
