A memory leak is a situation when a block of memory is marked as occupied exists in the program memory and there's no pointer variable in the program storing the address if that block. Task Manager and similar utilities show the total volume of occupied memory (plus overhead, plus fragmentation) and they have no idea about pointers - they can't inspect the program memory. This is why leaked memory and just occupied memory the program stores pointers to is indistinguishable for such utilities. So leaking memory "silently" - in a covert way such that memory consumption of the program doesn't increase - is impossible.
