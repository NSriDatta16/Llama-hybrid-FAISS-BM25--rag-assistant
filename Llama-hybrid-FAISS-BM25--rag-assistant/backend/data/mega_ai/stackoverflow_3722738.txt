You can check the support for long doubles at runtime with the Config module. Here is sample code from perldoc that shows the use: use Config; if ($Config{uselongdouble} eq "define") { print "long doubles by default\n"; } This example is from the section on sprintf (which I just happened to be reading...) and there are other examples there. With respect to casting or promoting, I do not think you can. Perl uses its longest double for all math, including integer math. (unless you invoke the pragma use integer )
