Running a shopping cart application

If I run a shopping cart application, does the web server need to be PCI compliant? The reason I ask because of the fact that I don't process the payments on the site anyway. The main payment method will be through Paypal. I have not decided yet which shopping cart application that I will use: it could be one of the followings: opencart, magento, zen-cart Thank you for your input.
