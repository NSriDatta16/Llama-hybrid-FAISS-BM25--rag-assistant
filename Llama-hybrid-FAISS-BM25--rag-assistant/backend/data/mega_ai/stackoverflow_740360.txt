If you do end up going with a custom data structure, I would suggest using containment rather than derivation. It's much better to define the necessary interface as part of a new class, and keep the storage details internal. If you were instead to derive from List, it would be much harder to enforce proper usage of the class, and if you changed your mind later, it would be harder to change things.
