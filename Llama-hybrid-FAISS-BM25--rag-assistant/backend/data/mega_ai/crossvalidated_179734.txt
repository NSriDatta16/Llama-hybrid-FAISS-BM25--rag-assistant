If you literally used the code from that post you linked to, then it's fairly clear what happened. You shouldn't expect that your posterior will be bimodal. It will be unimodal because of the likelihood which you chose. Doing the Bayesian analysis will essentially give you the same answer as running a linear regression using lm , and you can see that fitting a line through this set of points with least squares will yield the sort of result that you got! The only way you could get a bimodel posterior is if you used a strongly bimodal prior with peaks around $1$ and $10$. Or alternatively, you should use a different likelihood (which I think is what you want to do.)
