Example: Consider $n = 100$ observations from a population with success probability $\theta = 1/4.$ Suppose the results are as sampled in R below, with $X = 29$ Successes. Frequentist confidence interval. Then a frequentist Agresti-Coull 95% CI for $\theta$ is $(0.210, 0.386).$ set.seed(1015) x = rbinom(1, 100, 1/4); x [1] 29 th.est = (x+2)/(100+4); pm = c(-1,1) th.est + pm*1.96*sqrt(th.est*(1-th.est)/104) [1] 0.2101649 0.3859890 Bayestian credible interval from informative prior. Suppose the Bayesian prior distribution is $\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(10, 30),$ which puts 95% of its probability in $(0.130,0.393).$ qbeta(c(.025,.975),10,30) [1] 0.1303768 0.3932615 Then with the given prior distribution and a binomial likelihood function based on $x = 29$ successes in $n = 100,$ the Bayesian posterior distribution is $\mathsf{Beta}(10+x, 30+n-x) = \mathsf{Beta}(49, 101)$ and the Bayesian 95% posterior interval estimate is $(0.254, 0.404),$ which is somewhat shorter than the frequentist Agresti-Coull interval above. qbeta(c(.025,.975), 49, 101) [1] 0.2541815 0.4035301 Bayes credible interval from Jeffreys prior. By contrast, if the Bayesian analysis had begun with the non-informative Jeffreys prior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(0.5,0.5),$ then the Bayesian credible interval would have been $(0.208, 0.384),$ much the same as the frequentist Agresti interval. qbeta(c(.025, .975), 29.5, 71.5) [1] 0.2079839 0.3839729
