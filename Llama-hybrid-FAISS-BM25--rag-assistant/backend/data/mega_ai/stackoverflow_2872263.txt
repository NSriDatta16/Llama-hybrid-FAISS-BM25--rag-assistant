One of the advantage of XML over other serialization formats is the number of tools available. The other is the ability to formalize the description of you data (XML Schema). The availability of tools lets you use XML editors, transformers, visualizers, ... For example, where I work, we have the communication team using an XML editor to edit content and metadata. They are not technical enough to write JSON by hand (or XML), but it is very easy to give them a template with a nice generic frontend to edit the needed documents. Having a way to describe the format (XSD, DTD, Relax NG, ...) means that you can also automagically validate your documents. It also serves as a pretty good documentation of what is allowed and what is not in your documents.
