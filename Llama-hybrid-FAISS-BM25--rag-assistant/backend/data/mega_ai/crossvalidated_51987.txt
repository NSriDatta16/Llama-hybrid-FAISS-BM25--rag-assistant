Lewandowski algorithm demand forecasting

I came across the Lewandowski method of demand forecasting in JDA Demand. Please help me understand at a high level the methodology it uses. I found a paper by Robert Hyndman titled "A state space framework for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods" and it uses this method as one of methods they compare their algorithm to in the paper. Currently for us this is a black box, we want to get some high level understanding so that we can better fine tune the parameters they have provided as part of the software. It would be great if you can share some thoughts about the Lewandowski algorithm and point to some references that I could use for further research.
