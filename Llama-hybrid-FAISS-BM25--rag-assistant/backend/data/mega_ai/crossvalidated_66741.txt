There are a number of generic options. You could compress the text. You could go binary on the text, not write in ascii Great compression is data dependent. My guess (and you didn't specify so I must guess) is that you are looking to store spreadsheet-like data in something other than csv (comma-delimited). One of my favorite formats (I love MatLab) is hdf. Here is R-related information about HDF: accessed through packages hdf5, h5r, Bioconductor's rhdf5, RNetCDF, ncdf and ncdf4 http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/whatishdf5.html It is a high-density supercomputing data storage format. It can be very fast and efficient. It is also (unsurprisingly) denser than zipped text.
