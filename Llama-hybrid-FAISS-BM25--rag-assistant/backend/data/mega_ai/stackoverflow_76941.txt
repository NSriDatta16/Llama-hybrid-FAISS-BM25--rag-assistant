This may sound stupid, but just hear me out. Check all the indexes and primary keys involved in your query. Do they exist? Are they fragmented? I've had a problem where, so some reason, running the script outright worked just find, but then when I did it through the application, it was slow as dirt. The reader's basically act like cursors, so indexing is extremely important. It might not be this, but it's always the first thing that I check.
