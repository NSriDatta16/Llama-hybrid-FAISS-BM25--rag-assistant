A disadvantage of inner classes is that they can not be static. This means that will hold a reference to the outer class that contains them. Non-static inner classes can be an issue. For example we recently had an inner class being serialised, but the outer class was not serializeable. The hidden reference meant that the outer class would also be serialised, which of course failed, but it took a while to find out why. Where I work, static inner classes are encouraged in our coding best practices (where possible) as they carry less hidden baggage and are leaner.
