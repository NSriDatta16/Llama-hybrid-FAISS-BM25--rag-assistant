Try using a URL with a nonsense query string tacked onto it: setInterval(function() { $("#webCamStageImage").attr({'src': "http://picture.jpg?foo=" + new Date().getTime()}); }, 5000); The browser treats the whole URL as the name of a cacheable entity, so by doing this you make it think that you're asking the server for something different (which indeed you might be). The server won't pay any attention to the query string (unless you know otherwise ...).
