Breusch-Pagan / Cook-Weisberg tests the null hypothesis that the error variances are all equal versus the alternative that the error variances are a multiplicative function of one or more variables. For example, in the default form of the hettest command shown above, the alternative hypothesis states that the error variances increase (or decrease) as the predicted values of Y increase, e.g. the bigger the predicted value of Y, the bigger the error variance is. A large chi-square would indicate that heteroscedasticity was present. In your example, the chi-square value was large and the p-value is small, indicating heteroskedasticity was present.
