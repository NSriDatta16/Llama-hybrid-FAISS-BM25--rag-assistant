Can I convert a frequentist p-value into a Bayesian Posterior Probability

I am drafting a teaching session for fellow clinicians to try and provide a somewhat intuitive understanding on how Bayesian statistics differs from the frequentist methods we are taught at medical school. In the session I propose an implausible intervention that is studied and happens to find a difference in sample means with a p-value of 0.048. We then go through comparing the 'oddness' of the results with the 'oddness' of the implausible intervention working. I describe Bayes method of comparing these oddities to try and find which is the least implausible. I turn to this calculator because it uses more concrete inputs than other formulations that need more abstract inputs such as p(data). I then go on to fiddle around with some of the inputs to help build an intuitive sense of what very low p-values achieve. In my example I use it as follows: Calculate the probability of: H 0 Based on the probability of: p-value P( H 0 ): 0.999 (I use an average of the class's priors) P( p-value | H 0 ): 0.048 (this is the outcome p-value) P( p-value | ¬H 0 ): 0.8 (I have assumed this is the same as study power) Questions: Is P( p-value | ¬H 0 ) the same as a study power? Or is it only it only the same as the study power if the p-value = the "cut-off p-value". I.e, it varies with the observed p-value? If not, what is it and how could I estimate it and explain it? Is my methodology valid?
