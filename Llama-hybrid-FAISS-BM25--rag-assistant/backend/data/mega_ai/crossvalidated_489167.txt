A realistic example of a one sample mean test for a hypothesized population mean

One sample mean tests are used to test whether the sample mean is statistically different from a known or hypothesized population mean. Real life examples given for the latter type (hypothesized population mean) does not seem to be realistic examples. Here is such an example: testing whether the average waiting time in a doctorâ€™s office is greater than one hour. Why does anyone ever want to make such a test? The more reasonable thing to do, in my view, is to try to estimate the average waiting time by giving a confidence interval. But this is something different from trying to reject a hypothesis which claims that the average waiting time is longer than a specific value. My question is, can you give a real life case where we want to do one sample mean test for a hypothesized population mean?
