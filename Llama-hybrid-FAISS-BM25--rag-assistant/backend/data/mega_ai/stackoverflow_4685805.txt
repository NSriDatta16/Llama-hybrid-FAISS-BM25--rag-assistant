I unfortunately finally had to switch to VS 2010 from VS6 because VS6 doesn't work any more on Windows 7. And this was driving me crazy, I don't understand how people can work with this crap interface, it took me an hour of customizing to get it close to VS6 and there are still windows and tabs of worthless info everywhere and GUI space is wasted all over the screen with borders. I have also done some benchmarking on my standard work flow of editing a source file, compiling it, and running my game, what a sorry POS this IDE is, after upgrading from a 2006 system to a CPU that is nearly 4 times faster, a faster SSD, and triple the memory, VS 2010 is an average of 47% slower in my tests!
