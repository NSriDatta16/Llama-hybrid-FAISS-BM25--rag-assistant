Resumee matching algorithm

I am building a job site -- yes, there isn't enough of those yet. One of the problems I came across in my research is how to match the relevant resumes to the interested recruiters. The most boring solution I thought of is to use textual analysis to parse the resumes for tags recruiters specify -- which has a drawback: the resume might be packed with hidden keywords or buzzwords. Then it's interesting to figure out how to get around that. What would be a more interesting way of solving this problem? (Maybe some kind of machine learning algorithm? Then you have to train this beast, too.) So I don't know how I'll do it yet. I'd welcome any suggestions you could offer.
