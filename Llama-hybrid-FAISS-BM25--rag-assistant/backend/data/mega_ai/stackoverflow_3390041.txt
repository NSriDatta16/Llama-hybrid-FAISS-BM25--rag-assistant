Regex HTTP header parsing

I'm trying to use Regex to get a bit if HTTP header parsing done. I'd like to use groups to organize some of the information: Let's say I have this: Content-Disposition: form-data; name="item1" I'd like the result of my regex to create two groups: contentdisposition : form-data name : item1 I've tried several methods, but I can't seem to figure out how to do this. If name= doesn't exist then only one group should be created, but the regex should not error out. Any ideas?
