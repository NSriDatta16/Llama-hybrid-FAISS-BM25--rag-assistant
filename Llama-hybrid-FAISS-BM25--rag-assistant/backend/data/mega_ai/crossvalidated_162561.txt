I agree with the other posts. You cannot utilise logistic regression when your dependent variable is continuous. Your dependent variable definitely needs to be a categorical (i.e. a 0-1) variable in order to utilise logistic regression in the way this statistical approach is intended. Specifically, logistic regression is designed to predict the probability that a particular scenario or outcome will occur, i.e. it is designed to ask questions like: "What is the probability of a consumer purchase?" (purchase versus no purchase) or "What is the probability that a merger will be approved by the shareholders?" (approval versus withdrawal) ... and so forth. As some of the other posts point out, you will probably want to go ahead with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). But you can easily use multiple regression as well if you're more comfortortable with this approach. To many people, regression is easier to understand than ANOVA, and it is also perfectly possible to perform a categorical analysis with the regression (I assume this is what you're interested in). However, the choice will also, in part, depend on the typical approach to a research question of your type. For example, within my field of expertise (finance), ANOVA is a very rare thing, so the reader is probably going to be uncomfortable with an ANOVA. So you should definitely also consider who is going to read your article/report/etc.
