Is there a way to explain a prediction from a random forest model?

Say I've got a predictive classification model based on a random forest (using the randomForest package in R). I'd like to set it up so that end-users can specify an item to generate a prediction for, and it'll output a classification likelihood. So far, no problem. But it would be useful/cool to be able to output something like a variable importance graph, but for the specific item being predicted, not for the training set. Something like: Item X is predicted to be a Dog (73% likely) Because: Legs=4 Breath=bad Fur=short Food=nasty You get the point. Is there a standard, or at least justifiable, way of extracting this information from a trained random forest? If so, does anyone have code that will do this for the randomForest package?
