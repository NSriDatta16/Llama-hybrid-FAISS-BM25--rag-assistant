The only way to secure the URL to the user is to require a login, which is something you don't want to do. (Obviously as long as the session is open via a cookie or whatever you are using, the person could access it.) But keep in mind that once a person as the link to the PDF, they can download it and give it to somebody else. So in my opinion, you should simply focus on making it impossible for the average person to guess the URL. In other words, simply putting the PDF on a URL that is not guessable is sufficient security given that a person can easily duplicate the PDF. That said, if you want to lock it down a bit, you could give each user his own unique URL for the PDF. Thus if somebody does copy the URL around, you know who did it. Also, you could have URLs expire after a certain time. That URL could be stored in the database as a url -> pdf lookup. No authentication would be required to access it.
