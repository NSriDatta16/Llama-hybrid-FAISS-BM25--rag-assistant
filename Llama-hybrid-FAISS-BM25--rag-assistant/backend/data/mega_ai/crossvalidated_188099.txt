I took the 500 values into AUTOBOX ( a piece of commercial software that I have helped develop) and received the following advisory based upon the Chow Test for constancy of parameters. A very basic mistake that is made in the study of a time series is to assume that the data is driven by a particular model with constant parameters. AUTOBOX detected a break point at period 246 which might reflect a simulation that had not been "warmed up". When simulating data good practice is to delete the first "n" values and to then study the remaining ones. I took the data and segmented it into two sections ; the first 245 and the remaining 255 . Here are the two very dissimilar acf plots . Returning to the analysis: Here is the model that was identified for the last 246 values and here with the following statistics . The Actual/Fit and Forecast is here with residual plot here . The ACF of the residuals suggests sufficiency . Note that the 5 pulses that were identified had a very small effect and could easily be disregarded ( in this case ! ). In summary the lesson learned here is that sometimes we have too much data and we need to consider time changing coefficients. In this case we are identifying a change in parameters which (apparently) doesnâ€™t have a major impact on the resultant model/parameters but it points out a generally needed process improvement in time series analysis. My experience with auto.arima suggests that since it explicitely doesn't treat/remedy gaussian violations it tends to over-model by leaning too much on historical values rather than extracting structure from the data. In this case since it was a tightly controlled simulation without gaussian violations it worked but I would be generally suspect of such a bandwith limited and single step approach to ARIMA model identification. Trust but Verify !
