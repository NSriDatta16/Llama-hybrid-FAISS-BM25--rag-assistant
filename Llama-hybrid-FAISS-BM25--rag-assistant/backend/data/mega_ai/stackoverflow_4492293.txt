Some random comments that may help: You could use tr.clicked td as your css selector then apply the "clicked" class to the row instead of each individual table cell... It would probably be much faster than needing to query all of the cells in the table. Here is a jsFiddle example of how much cleaner it can be when you rely upon the CSS to handle the "children" portion that for you. Also, instead of .siblings().children() try .parent().find('td').not($this.children()) -- that would end up using getElementsByTagName as opposed to having to call childNodes on all the tr and then append those lists to each other... Also - anytime you are working on performance issues like this, try running some sample code through jsperf - it will help you test two different methods .parent().find('td') vs .siblings().children() for instance this test shows that the siblings().children() method is ~ 78% slower than .parent().find('td').not() when using chrome, 38% slower in safari. I don't have IE8, but I imagine you would see significant improvement using that method. There are a few good tips on this blog post about performance of selectors, etc. Pay very close attention to the Bonus Tip â€“ Storing jQuery results for later section.
