Well, I found a solution to my problem, not quite as graceful as a clean string of parameters but until I figure something else out it'll do. Before pushing the state, use jQuery bbqs param.fragment.noEscape function to unescape some unimporant characters (sadly trying to escape & and = stops the state functionality from working), then replace '=' and '&' characters in the string being pushed into the state. Then when getting the state, before pushing it to a function to update the page re-replace the delimiters with '=' and '&' and everything passes through just fine.
