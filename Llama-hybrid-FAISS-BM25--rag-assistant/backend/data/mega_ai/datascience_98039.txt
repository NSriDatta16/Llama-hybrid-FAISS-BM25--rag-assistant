Evaluating optimal values for depth of tree

I'm studying the performance of an AdaBoost model and I wonder how it performs in regard to the depth of the trees. Here's the accuracy for the model with a depth of 1 and here with a depth of 3 From my point of view, I would say the lower one looks better but somehow I guess the upper one is better as the training accuracy doesn't vanish (overfitting?)? The question resp. answer from Hyperparameter tunning for Random Forest- choose the best max depth underlines my assumption, though.
