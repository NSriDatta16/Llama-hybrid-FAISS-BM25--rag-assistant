This is kind of a hack, but the way I got it to work was to change what happens on the keystroke config. I set it to 'blur'. keystrokes: [ [ 13, 'blur'], [ CKEDITOR.SHIFT + 13, 'blur' ], [ CKEDITOR.CTRL + 90, 'undo' ], [ CKEDITOR.CTRL + 89, 'redo' ], [ CKEDITOR.CTRL + CKEDITOR.SHIFT + 90, 'redo' ], [ CKEDITOR.CTRL + 66, 'bold' ], [ CKEDITOR.CTRL + 73, 'italic' ], [ CKEDITOR.CTRL + 85 , 'underline' ], [ CKEDITOR.ALT + 109, 'toolbarCollapse' ] ] Also, before the data is posted, I remove any of the paragraph tags.
