Some guys tells in discussion like this the EJB become useful in EJB3 not before that, and that is not ture. right it became more powerful specially with the JPA, but EJB1.0 and EJB2.1 still did a lot. maybe they didn't use it in large applications so they say that. for example POJO can't deal with a Transaction, so in EJB you can specify the transaction type for a specific method is it require a new transaction or it not from the transaction . in my organization we have ERP build from scratch using and we use the EJB in the Business Logic, it was from 2000 and the EJB was Version 1.0 . and it's not only separate the business tier from the other thiers but it's also separate the system from each other, for Example: finance module is separate from HR module. and if they want to add a new module they can add it without restarting the system and it will integrate with the system in perfect way.. and remember this in the EJB: what you see in the code is nothing and what the EJB container is doing for you is every thing :) .
