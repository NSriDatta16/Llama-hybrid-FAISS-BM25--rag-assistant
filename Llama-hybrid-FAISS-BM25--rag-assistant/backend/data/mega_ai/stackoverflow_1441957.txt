Hey, use JavaScript. Have an image with a play button on it, when the image is clicked, have it insert the flash video. That way, only the same image is loaded for each video until play is clicked, only then is the video inserted into the DOM. http://robertnyman.com/2007/04/19/flashreplace-a-light-weight-javascript-to-insert-flash-movies-into-your-web-page/ here's some documentation on a class that does it http://code.google.com/p/flashreplace/ and there's the code hosted on google.
