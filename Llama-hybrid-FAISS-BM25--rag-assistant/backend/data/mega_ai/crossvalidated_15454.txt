Formula for comparing the youth of different groups?

For purely personal reasons, I recently tried to write a Ruby script that pulled information about various school rosters, counting the numbers of freshmen...seniors on the team and using that data to spit out some information about the teams relative youth based on the amount of eligibility left. As far as I am concerned, actual age is not an issue here. The forumla I used was something simple: eligibility = (FR * 4) + (SO * 3) + (JR * 2) + SR average = eligibility / (FR + SO + JR + SR) Anyway, this is obviously a really simple formula. It doesn't put any weight on any one factor and the total eligibility number really doesn't tell me anything. I was wondering if anyone had any better ideas when it came to realizing a formula for this issue. I'm not sure if this is the forum for this kind of question, but I became interested in the solution the other day and thought this might be a good place to look for an answer.
