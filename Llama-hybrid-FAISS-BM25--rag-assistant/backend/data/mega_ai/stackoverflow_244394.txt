How can I browse the local network from a web client using C#?

Our web client needs a way to browse the local network and select location for file storage. This will then be returned to the webpage as a UNC name. On a native client this easily accomplished by using Shell32 functions. I've looked at ASP FileUpload, but that returns the file vs. a specific directory. EDIT: Another option would be to execute this on the clientside using javascript.
