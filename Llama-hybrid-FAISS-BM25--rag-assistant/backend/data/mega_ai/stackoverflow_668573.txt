What are the benefits of using Oracle Designer?

Why would I want to use Oracle Designer as opposed to simply maintaining SQL scripts and storing them in a version control system such as Subversion ? I need to decide if it is worth the effort to reverse-engineer an existing database into Designer . It seems like it would be easier to store DDL scripts along with the application source code in subversion . The policy of my organization is to manage all database schemas using Designer . I'm all for compliance if there is some sort of ROI , but I am not able to see how there would be any ROI by reverse-engineering an existing database into Designer .
