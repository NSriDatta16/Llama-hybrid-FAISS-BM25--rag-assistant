This is a rather broad question, but databases are well suited for managing relational data . Alternatives would almost always imply to design your own data storage and retrieval engine, which for most standard/small applications is not worth the effort. A typical scenario that is not well suited for a database is the storage of large amounts of data which are organized as a relatively small amount of logical files, in this case a simple filesystem-like system can be enough.
