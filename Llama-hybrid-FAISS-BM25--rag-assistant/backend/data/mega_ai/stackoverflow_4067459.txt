How do I copy GMail's drag and drop labeling function?

In a web application I am making I want to create the same effect that GMail has for dragging and dropping labels and conversations. Basically I want to be able to make an ondrag function that attaches a "new" html element to the cursor, and upon releasing it over certain elements I want to execute my given functionality that is aware of both the dragged element and the element over which the drop occured. I don't want to move any elements around. I want to make a function that let's the original elements stay in place and only react to the dragging of some new element. How can this be done?
