Bootstrap PCA with varimax rotation

I have microfossil data from across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, 20 species (=variables) and 27 samples (=observations). I have run a PCA with varimax rotation on these data using the rgr package. I now want to determine the significance of the PC loadings using bootstrap BCa confidence intervals from package boot, but I can't get it to work. I have found using Krzanowski cross-validation that 5 PCs appear to be significant (NRETAIN in the script below is thus equal to 5). The script I have been attempting looks like this (the data matrix is called “x”): BS.vmax This script returns a BS.vmax.boot value that looks like this: ORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP Call: boot(data = x, statistic = BS.vmax, R = 99) Bootstrap Statistics : original bias std. error t1* -0.745596283 0 0 t2* -0.902044503 0 0 ... lines removed here ... t99* -0.144587913 0 0 t100* 0.076592734 0 0 which doesn't make any sense (because all biases and SEs are zero)! I will later on increase the number of bootstrap replicates to 2000; this is just for testing.
