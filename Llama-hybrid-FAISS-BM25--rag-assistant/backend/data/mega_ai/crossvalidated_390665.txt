Confusing terminology of TimeSeries: "Smoothing" and "Differencing"

I studied MA, AR, ARIMA, SARIMA to forecast products demand using python , but recently I encountered the smoothing , using moving average (by python pd.rolling.mean() ) and following things especially made me confused: Does "moving average" for smoothing indicate MA model? if I need to do difference, is it correct I apply ARIMA model to that TimeSeries? Why does people use rolling.mean() , std() , pd.diff() when dealing with timeseries data with trend and seasonality, not SARIMA model?
