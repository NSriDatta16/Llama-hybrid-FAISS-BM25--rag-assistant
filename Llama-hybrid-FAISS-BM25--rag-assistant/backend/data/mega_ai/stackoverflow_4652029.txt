renderEvent fails after call to removeEvents - FullCalendar

I am fairly certain that this is a bug. Once I call remove "removeEvents", no subsequent adds ("renderEvent") work, and the ones that do act like they have no "stickiness". If I do the following: Initialize calendar. Add event A using $("#calendar").fullCalendar( 'renderEvent', newEvent, true); Remove this event using $("#calendar").fullCalendar( 'removeEvents', 12345); Add event B using $("##calendar").fullCalendar( 'renderEvent', newEvent2, true); Neither event A or B appears! Both events have different IDs, and what should happen is event A is deleted, but event should B appear. If I take this single "removeEvent" out, then both events A and B appear (even though the remove is only targeting the ID of event A). Even if I rerender the events after step 4 using $("#calendar").fullCalendar( 'rerenderEvents' ); , still event B doesn't show. What's more interesting is that this doesn't seem like simply a "rendering" issue since if I pull all events using $("#calendar").fullCalendar( 'clientEvents', ...); , it doesn't show event A or B in the array of returned events, where as removing the "removeEvent" will allow both events A and B to appear in the array. The solution would SEEM to be do the remove AFTER all of the adds: Add event A Add event B Remove event A Which DOES keep event B, but in my app, I have drag-drop functionality, and the user can "add" new events at any time! So I am finding that as I call "removeEvent" then dragging a new event into the calendar makes the "stickiness" of the event go away, so change a month will not retain that added event. Here is my code: $('#calendar').fullCalendar({ theme: true, header: { left: "prev,next today", center: 'title', right: "today prev,next" }, height: 400, selectable: true, selectHelper: true, unselectAuto: false, select: calendarSelect, droppable: true, drop: calendarDrop, events:getCalendarData, eventClick:calendarEventClicked }); var newEvent = { id: 12345, period: "Full-day", title: "Full-day", start: new Date(2010, 11, 02), type: "Regular", billable: true, className: "", changedThisSession: true }; $("#calendar").fullCalendar( 'renderEvent', newEvent, true); $("#calendar").fullCalendar( 'removeEvents', 12345); var newEvent2 = { id: 4433, period: "Full-day", title: "Full-day", start: new Date(2010, 11, 03), type: "Regular", billable: true, className: "", changedThisSession: true }; $("#calendar").fullCalendar( 'renderEvent', newEvent2, true); Even though this code deletes event with ID 12345, the OTHER event (id 4433) is also not shown. Removing the line ..."removeEvents"... causes both events to show. Again, I can add new events, drag them, etc, and it works great. As soon as "removeEvents" is called once, then things start acting weird. Help would be appreciated! -Brian
