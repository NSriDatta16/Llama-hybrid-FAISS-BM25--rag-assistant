I would make life easy on myself and use the Versionable behavior . Specification: actAs: Versionable: versionColumn: version className: %CLASS%Version auditLog: true columns: #your columns here That said this should work out of the box if you are using SpecificationForm as the main form and embedding RevisionForm into it. Please post your code for the embedding process, and your schema definitions.
