Why my training Precision and Recall is higher than Validation Precision and Recall?

I am training a deep learning model for binary image classification using Keras and TensorFlow . My model gave the highest acc and lower loss . The other metrics I used also have higher values like precision and recall . As I used the generator and I mentioned the validation set during fitting the model. So the precision and recall on validation data are just 50% . But the Confusion metric is not that much worse on test data. What should I assume that my model is overfitting? Here is my few epochs logs: Epoch 00042: LearningRateScheduler setting learning rate to 8.28633770088062e-06. 595/595 [==============================] - 1871s 3s/step - loss: 0.0162 - accuracy: 0.9952 - precision_m: 0.9958 - recall_m: 0.9936 - f1_m: 0.9942 - val_loss: 0.1693 - val_accuracy: 0.9637 - val_precision_m: 0.5000 - val_recall_m: 0.4797 - val_f1_m: 0.4891 Epoch 00042: saving model to /home/ali/Desktop/pneumonia classification/Final Dataset/RSNA/model_training_512_finetune_3.h5 Epoch 43/50 Epoch 00043: LearningRateScheduler setting learning rate to 7.497788410238852e-06. 595/595 [==============================] - 2167s 4s/step - loss: 0.0147 - accuracy: 0.9952 - precision_m: 0.9968 - recall_m: 0.9944 - f1_m: 0.9953 - val_loss: 0.1673 - val_accuracy: 0.9645 - val_precision_m: 0.5000 - val_recall_m: 0.4823 - val_f1_m: 0.4904 Epoch 00043: saving model to /home/ali/Desktop/pneumonia classification/Final Dataset/RSNA/model_training_512_finetune_3.h5 Epoch 44/50 Epoch 00044: LearningRateScheduler setting learning rate to 6.784279506100467e-06. 595/595 [==============================] - 2405s 4s/step - loss: 0.0125 - accuracy: 0.9967 - precision_m: 0.9982 - recall_m: 0.9958 - f1_m: 0.9968 - val_loss: 0.1676 - val_accuracy: 0.9671 - val_precision_m: 0.5000 - val_recall_m: 0.4831 - val_f1_m: 0.4909 ```
