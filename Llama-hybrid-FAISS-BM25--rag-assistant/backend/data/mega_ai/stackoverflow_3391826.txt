Logic seems sound to me. I would suggest extending it to use the mod_status module on your apache servers. After doing your head check, also try to grab /server-status and use that to double check that your server is healthy. I'm thinking something like this: statusRequest = http.get('/server-status') if(statusRequest == 200) { // Make sure you don't have insane load averages, etc } else { /* Check something IIS specific, or just be happy the head check worked */ } Another technique I've used in the past is to also do a check for something that I know should give a 404. That way you have a better chance of knowing if the server is just handing out 200's to anyone that asks. (I saw it once due to a bad config)
