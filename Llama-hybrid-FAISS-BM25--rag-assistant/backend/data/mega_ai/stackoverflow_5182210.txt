Personally, if I delete all the rows I call it " blatting " the database. If I manually force data into it then (just in my head) I call it " shoe-horning " the data into the database. I think I need a cool term for updating it though. I used to say I was munging it, but that's been stolen by the deployment applications meaning token replacement, so I need a new term, otherwise I'm in danger of being understood outside my organisation.
