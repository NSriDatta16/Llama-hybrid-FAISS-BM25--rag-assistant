Linear Regression: Multiplying the coefficient by the mean

I have a coefficient that represents per minute of watching videos. I am measuring against the dependent variable of exam scores. I also have the mean of the minutes of watching videos from descriptives. What might be the problem if I multiply the coefficient by the mean? I am hoping to be able to report an 'average' benefit/impact. aka x% decrease or improvement in exam scores If someone has examples would be great too!
