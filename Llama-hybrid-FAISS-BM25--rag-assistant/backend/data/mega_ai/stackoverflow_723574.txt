Why are these sites receiving network timeouts for me, but not for others?

I've kind of ran into an ugly snag. I developed a website for a client a few years back, and since then they've transferred their site to a different domain name provider and host. Now they want some updates, but when I try to access their site I get a Network Timeout (the page just tries to load for a few minutes, then firefox shows a Network Timeout error). I can access the site via a proxy, but proxies kinda suck and don't support everything, plus I'm a little paranoid about sending sensitive data through a proxy, not to mention I don't see how that would help me with FTP access and what not. I'm not exactly sure where along the line this problem is occurring... is my ISP blocking it, is the webserver blocking me, is it my router, or what's going on? I know of two sites that do this, and I think they're hosted by the same people. The sites are http://fvringette.com/ and http://damngoodtimes.com/ @MarkusQ: traceroute for fvringette.com (which turns out to be the same as with damngoodtimes.com) traceroute: Warning: Multiple interfaces found; using 134.117.14.35 @ hme0 traceroute to 76.74.225.90 (76.74.225.90), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets 1 unix-gate.physics.carleton.ca (134.117.14.1) 0.973 ms 0.513 ms 0.514 ms 2 10.50.254.3 (10.50.254.3) 0.437 ms 0.385 ms 0.351 ms 3 10.30.33.1 (10.30.33.1) 0.488 ms 0.394 ms 0.370 ms 4 10.30.55.1 (10.30.55.1) 0.396 ms 0.416 ms 0.391 ms 5 134.117.254.242 (134.117.254.242) 0.708 ms 0.720 ms 0.704 ms 6 10.30.57.1 (10.30.57.1) 1.338 ms 1.221 ms 1.237 ms 7 kolker.fcican.com (207.34.252.249) 1.464 ms 1.544 ms 1.459 ms 8 * * * 9 154.11.3.17 (154.11.3.17) 7.355 ms 7.393 ms 7.426 ms 10 oc48.so-2-0-3.van-hc21e-cor-1.peer1.net (216.187.114.137) 62.762 ms 62.838 ms 62.625 ms 11 oc48.pos4-0.van-hc21e-dis-1.peer1.net (216.187.89.253) 62.795 ms 63.238 ms 62.893 ms 12 64.69.91.245 (64.69.91.245) 64.103 ms 62.908 ms 63.266 ms 13 64.69.91.245 (64.69.91.245) 63.094 ms !H 63.072 ms !H 63.173 ms !H 64.69.91.245 - Geo Information IP Address 64.69.91.245 Host 64.69.91.245 Location CA CA, Canada City Vancouver, BC v6b4n5 Organization Peer1 Internet Bandwidth & Server Co-Location Faci ISP Peer 1 Network AS Number AS13768 Latitude 49°25'00" North Longitude 123°13'33" West Distance 9281.29 km (5767.13 miles) 64.69.91.245 - Whois Information OrgName: Peer 1 Network Inc.

It occured to me that it may be more useful if I do a trace from my home computer, to fvringette.com rather than from some random computer which may actually be able to connect.

After this all requests just keep timing out. It's the same IP, 64.69.91.245 that seems to be causing the problem... does this mean that I'm just unlucky and got a dead server that won't forward my request? I have no idea how these things work. I can ping 64.69.91.245, but not telnet 64.69.91.245. It says 'connect failed', not 'connection refused'... I can't think of why it would fail for me, but no one else?
