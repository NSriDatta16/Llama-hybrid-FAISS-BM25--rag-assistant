What if a seasonal naive model is the best model?

I ran 10 years worth of monthly data (first 7 years train, next 3 test), through 8 forecasting algorithms: SARIMA, ETS, HW, Seasonal Naive, NNETAR, Prophet, TBATS, and VAR. For most of these, where there was an option to automatically tune a parameter I took it, the reason is that I am dealing with 10 separate time series. The results were somewhat disappointing. I think I wanted one of the more complex models to win out, but it didn't happen. Does this happen in practice often? Should I be concerned? Below are my MAPE scores for each of the 8 models. Note that this MAPE score was the mean MAPE of the 10 time series. Naive wins by a small margin.
