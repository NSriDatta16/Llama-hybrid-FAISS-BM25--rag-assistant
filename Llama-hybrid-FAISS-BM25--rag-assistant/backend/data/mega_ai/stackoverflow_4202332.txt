What should a C# developer know before using WPF

I'am more a sysadmin and a webmaster than a developer, but sometime I develop, including C# principally using Winform (and optionally GTK+). I've started few weeks ago a WPF project, and it seem really powerful, but at start I feel like a hen who found a knife! There is so many difference! stackoverflow abounds about topic like that, and I've read carefully some who are similar like: Hidden features of WPF and XAML? What all should an expert C#/.Net/WPF developer know? But, when somebody start with WPF from Winform, What are the differences to which he must pay attention? [EDIT] What about some advices/links for LINQ with WPF? What about some advices/links WPF Navigation?
