It depends on your problem. If the PCA is part of preprocessing for regression / machine learning, then you should treat the number of PCA components as a hyper parameter and pick the number that optimizes the cross validated score. If you are not using it in a regression pipeline, then you often select the number of components where the sum of the explained variance sum to 75% / 90 % or similar values that suit your needs.
