Poisson rate $\lambda$ for number $B$ of purchases each day. Conditionally, on $B = b$ purchases in a day, the number of returns is $R \sim \mathsf{Binom}(b, p),$ where $p$ is the probability an item will be returned. Suppose we have data for $250$ days, $\lambda = 5,\; p = 0.1.$ Here is a simulation of purchases and returns: set.seed(2020) b = rpois(250, 5) r = rbinom(250, b, .1) summary(r) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.52 1.00 3.00 MAT = rbind(b,r); MAT[,1:10] # first ten days [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] b 6 4 6 5 3 2 3 4 0 6 r 1 3 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 hist(r, prob=T, br=(-1:5)+.5, col="skyblue2", main="Simulated Dist'n of Returns") points(0:5, dpois(0:5, .5), col="red") I will leave it to you to show that $R \sim\mathsf{Pois}(\lambda_r = p\lambda),$ as roughly illustrated in the plot above of simulated returns for 250 days. You can estimate $\lambda$ by the average number of purchases per day, and $p$ as the overall fraction of returned items.
