I think you can stick with XML which allows for a cleaner design. I would go further and take advantage of the xml:lang attribute which is designed for this usage : Detta Ã¤r ett namn This is a name One step further, you could select the localized resource in your query via a XPath query (as suggested in the comments) to avoid any client side treatment. This would give something like this (untested) : SELECT Name.value('(l10n/text[lang()="en"])[1]', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)') FROM Product WHERE Product.ID=10; Note that this solution would be an elegant but less efficient solution than the separate table one. Which may be OK for some application.
