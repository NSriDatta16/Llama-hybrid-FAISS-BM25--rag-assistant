kNN is a lazy eval problem, and at production will take some time to predict. The classifier depends on the problem really For imbalance, you can do the following: undersample, oversample. You can also go with class_weight parameter while building the classifier Do check https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html
