Advice about modeling visit data retrospectively

I have retrospective patient level data on number of emergency department visits in a given year for a large urban ED - mostly 1's and 2's but range up to over 20 (data were collected at an ED visit so no zeroes). 40% have 1 visit, 55% have A transformation of the outcome to normalize it was somewhat successful (e.g., to perform multiple regression or ANOVA), but I have the feeling that the underlying phenomenon is not in fact a continuous phenomenon. Logistic regression is a possibility, but the categorization of the outcome as binary would be arbitrary. I'm not sure where to set the cut point, etc. I've thought about cluster analysis but it loses the ability to really directly interpret the significance of the predictors. Multinomial logistic regression is just hard to interpret Thoughts or references?
