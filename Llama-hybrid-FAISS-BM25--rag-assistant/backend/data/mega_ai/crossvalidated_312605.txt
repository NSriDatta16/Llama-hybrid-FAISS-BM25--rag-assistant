Can I treat the mean of a set of z-scores as a z-score?

I have a set of z-scores corresponding to different tests taken by the same subjects. Can i take the average of the z-scores for each subject and compare the average z-scores as it was actual z-scores? (i.e. can I calculate a percentile for each subject based on the average of the set of z-scores?) EDIT: My goal is to calculate percentiles for a subject based on a set of z-scores for that subject. So far my approach has been to take the average of the z-scores of a subject, and then treat that average as a z-score and calculate the percentile based on that. I wonder if there is any problem with that approach?
