A home-grown parser is easily written. For example, this ANTLR grammar takes care of your example input without much trouble: parse : line* ; line : Quoted ( ',' Quoted )* ( '\r'? '\n' | EOF ) ; Quoted : '"' ( Atom )* '"' ; fragment Atom : Parentheses | ~( '"' | '\r' | '\n' | '(' | ')' ) ; fragment Parentheses : '(' ~( '(' | ')' | '\r' | '\n' )* ')' ; Space : ( ' ' | '\t' ) {skip();} ; and it would be easy to extend this to take escaped quotes or parenthesis into account. When feeding the parser generated by that grammar to following two lines of input: "Thanks,", "in advance,", "for("the", "help")" "and(,some,more)","data , here" it gets parsed like this: If you consider to use ANTLR for this, I can post a little HOW-TO to get a parser from that grammar I posted, if you want.
