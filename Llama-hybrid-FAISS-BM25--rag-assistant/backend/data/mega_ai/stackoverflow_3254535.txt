Why is this XML being output by this XSLT? I'm using the XslCompiledTransform

Could someone tell me why this is happening, please? My XML is: some text goes here a top elem today a subnode more content another subnode even more content My XSL is: My output XML is: some text goes here a top elem today an attribute another attribute And the code which executes this (slightly trimmed) is: // create the xsl transformer XslCompiledTransform t = new XslCompiledTransform(true); t.Load(reader); // create the writer which will output the transformed xml StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); //XmlWriterSettings tt = new XmlWriterSettings(); //tt.Encoding = new UTF8Encoding(false); XmlWriter results = XmlWriter.Create(new StringWriter(sb));//, tt); // write the transformed xml out to a stringbuilder t.Transform(input, null, results); As you can probably guess, I really don't want the xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" attributes being copied to every child element, but I don't know how to stop it. Thanks for any and all help and info, Matt.
