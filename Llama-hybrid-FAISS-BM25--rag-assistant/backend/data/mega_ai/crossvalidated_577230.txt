Neural network when not to shuffle?

So for the MLP regressor in sklearn there is the option to shuffle. And I assume it means that before dividing into batches the data is shuffled and thus at each iteration the batches are different from the batches in the previous iteration? Now, I did read about why to shuffle but are there also instances when not to shuffle? I thought probably with time-series data? Because you destroy the temporal ordering?
