Test for significance of variation in time series data

Suppose a DMV office runs driving tests. Every week a number of people take the driving test, some pass and some fail. Looking at this data set, we notice that the pass rate varies from week to week. How do I test whether this is random variation, or whether there is some change over time in the population of drivers who are taking the test? It seems that if I suggest a specific hypothesis (drivers who take the test on weekends are better than drivers who take the test on weekdays), then I can use a $t$-test (assuming driving skill is normally distributed). But what if I don't have a specific hypothesis, but just want to know the probability that chance alone explains the variation in the rate over time? Is this a well-formed question? What approach makes the most sense here?
