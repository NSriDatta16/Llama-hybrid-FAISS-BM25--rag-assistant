T-SQL: what COLUMNS have changed after an update?

OK. I'm doing an update on a single row in a table. All fields will be overwritten with new data except for the primary key. However, not all values will change b/c of the update. For example, if my table is as follows: TABLE (id int ident, foo varchar(50), bar varchar(50)) The initial value is: id foo bar ----------------- 1 hi there I then execute UPDATE tbl SET foo = 'hi', bar = 'something else' WHERE id = 1 What I want to know is what column has had its value changed and what was its original value and what is its new value. In the above example, I would want to see that the column "bar" was changed from "there" to "something else". Possible without doing a column by column comparison? Is there some elegant SQL statement like EXCEPT that will be more fine-grained than just the row? Thanks.
