You have 15 variables, but not all of them are equally significant for discrimination of your dependent variable (some of them might even be nearly-irrelevant). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) recomputes a linear basis of those 15 variables, and orders them, in such a way that the first few components typically explain most of the variance. So this allows you reduce a 15-dimensional problem to (say) a 2,3,4, or 5-dimensional problem. Hence it makes plotting more intuitive; typically you can use two or three axes for numeric (or high-cardinality ordinal) variables, then use marker color, shape, and size for three extra dimensions (maybe more if you can combine low-cardinality ordinals). So plotting with the 6 most important PC's should give you a clearer visualization of your decision surface.
