// Without labels, k-fold validation is not possible, right? // Correct, you cannot measure accuracy. The only thing you can do is manually analyse the output to see if it seems correct-ish, so you may take 1000 examples and manually label them yourself in the hope your human powers of classification are quite accurate. Of course manual classification to build a test set is very very boring, so you might want to get in some interns! hehehe Seriously though, some applications of machine learning work like this. Outlier detection, fraud detection, etc, can often be done quite well by humans, but not at scale. So companies use both machine learning and humans, when an algorithm tends to agree with the humans most of the time, they fade out use of the humans. So if your problem is easy for humans to do at a small scale, like, say, "does this picture have an apple in it" you can generate a small test set to get an idea of accuracy.
