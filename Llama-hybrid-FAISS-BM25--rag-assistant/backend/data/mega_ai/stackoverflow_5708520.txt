General Entity Framework confusion

So I've run into something and was wondering if you could help me out. I am very new (this is my first project in these languages) to MS MVC 2 and Entity Framework 4.0. I've drawn up a model using the Model First approach and the graphical designer. I didn't have a SQL database for it yet and I figured it was just working disconnected, but maybe I just forget that I had specified a connection string somewhere. So I go about my business getting the MVC components up and running using the newly created types from EF. I am attempting to using the Repository pattern as well as Ninject for dependency injection. So I had a lot of time before I had to worry about actual data storage. Which brings me to my issue: I'm now at that point. I thought it was attaching to a .mdf file and running that off a SQLExpress instance, but I couldn't really find anything to support that. I didn't have SSMS installed so I couldn't figure out how to properly check. Eventually got that up and running and no db. So now I'm confused as to where this is actually wired, if at all. I decided that it's too weird and want to start over a bit. I generated the SQL script for the Model and create a new db in SSMS to run the script against. Run the script and all is well. Then I go into VS and run a Database First scenario. So the Model now shows all my tables and effectively screws up a few fields by specifying them as keys when they shouldn't have been. Fixed that up and now I'm back to figuring out the issue that frustrated me in the first place. I have a User table that has a userId field that is supposed to be a Guid, but during the original modeling I missed it and it was a varchar field. I've not been able to fix the mapping underneath it to change the underlying ( not sure the actual terminology for it ) field to a Guid. I changed the Model's type but nothing updated the database. This has basically put me in an odd position. I believe I'm supposed to allow EF to manage the SQL for me without my involvement, but if this is true how can I push a change like that. Am I restricted to dropping the entire database everytime I need to make a change to the schema? Sorry if this is the noobest of noob questions, but I am trying to figure all this stuff out and could really use some input. Last language set I used was ASP.Net 2.0 with ADO.Net typed datasets. Am I better off switching to a Code First approach? If I were to do that do I have to start managing the SQL myself again? I believe this is my first question here so, my apologies if I violated anything; I think I'm clear though.
