Abstracting storage data structures within XPath

I have a collection of data stored in XDocuments and DataTables, and I'd like to address both as a single unified data space with XPath queries. So, for example, "/Root/Tables/Orders/FirstName" would fetch the value of the Firstname column in every row of the DataTable named "Orders". Is there a way to do this without copying all of the records in the DataTable into the XDocument? I'm using .Net 3.5
