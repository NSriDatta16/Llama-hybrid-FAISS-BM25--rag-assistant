Infix Operator I got this from http://sandersn.com/blog//index.php/2009/10/22/infix-function-trick-for-f go to that page for more details. If you know Haskell, you might find yourself missing infix sugar in F#: // standard Haskell call has function first, then args just like F#. So obviously // here there is a function that takes two strings: string -> string -> string startsWith "kevin" "k" //Haskell infix operator via backQuotes. Sometimes makes a function read better. "kevin" `startsWith` "K" While F# doesn't have a true 'infix' operator, the same thing can be accomplished almost as elegantly via a pipeline and a 'backpipeline' (who knew of such a thing??) // F# 'infix' trick via pipelines "kevin" |> startsWith
