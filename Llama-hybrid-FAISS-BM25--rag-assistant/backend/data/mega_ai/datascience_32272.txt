How would knowing spammers email address improve spam detection algorithms?

I am new into Artificial Intelligence field and I am working on the classic example of Spam detection using classification. I am using Naive Bayes algorithm as well as SVM. While working on them it came to my mind that having the email addresses of who has sent the emails as an extra feature would improve the accuracy of my algoithm as we will have some extra info besides the content of the email itself. Would it be true? And how could I use this extra feature? Should I just add it to my email content?
