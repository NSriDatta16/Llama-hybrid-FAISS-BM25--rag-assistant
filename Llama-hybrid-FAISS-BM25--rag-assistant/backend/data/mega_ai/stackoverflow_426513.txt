How best to get the user's browser information and settings for debugging purposes?

My problem is that I have a user that is having a problem displaying a portion of website I am creating, but I am unable to reproduce it on any of my browsers, even with the same version of the browser. What I'm looking for is probably a website that I can send the user to which will tell me what version of the browser they are running along with the plugs installed and any other information that might affect the display of a page. Any one know of anything like this? Edit: The problem is related to CSS. They want some special image around all the text inputs, but on the users computer the text input displays partially outside of the image which is setup as a background. I need more user specific information than Google Analytics as you can't separate out a specific user. I also suspect that it's more complicated than just the user agent. I also can put the website out there publicly because they want to keep their idea private until it's released...grr.
