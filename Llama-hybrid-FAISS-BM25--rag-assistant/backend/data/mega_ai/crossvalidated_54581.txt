Is there a multivariate version of logistic regression?

Based on readings with logistic regression, it appears that you could use this analysis to make predictions about categorical variables. Does logistic regression allow you to predict multiple dependent variables with one independent variable, or just one? For example, if I were looking at predicting the gender of someone based on their emotional intelligence scores, could I also predict gender and race at the same time? How does this work?
