Purely from the data / visuals shown here it's possible it's a random walk as acf/pacf don't show any clear patterns. However see Stephan Kolassa comment on better ways to quantify/test data for white noise than just looking at acf/pacf. Having said that, based on your comment that the original data represents "he series depicts the hourly height of waves from 2017 to 2019" the answer to your question if this is potentially a random walk is - has to be - a clear 'Definitely not!'. Otherwise humanity would have been wiped out by now :) I always recommend to do a sanity check on whether a dynamic system observed over time is stationary, trend stationary, or stochastic non stationary (ie a random walk) before looking at any data. Based on the physics / economics / ( domain knowledge) you can often rule out at least one option . In your case, based on the variable you measure, most likely you expect to see a data generating process that consists of Trend stationary $ f(t) /approx \alpha \cdot t$ for this short time period (relevant climate question/hypothesis: is $\alpha$ zero or not?) Multiple seasonalities (12hr tidal patterns, 24hr day/ night - temperature changes, lunar cycle, annual seasons) Stationary arma / garch like signal, where variance of garch has also similar seasonal patterns ( see also here for a good primer on time series decomposition) The garch like patterns you can see on the difference graph with higher, clustered variance in the hurricane season. ( Was this data recorded in gulf of Mexico / carribean? Or California ?) Lastly, any chance you could share this data here ( then we can test model setup above) ? Or at least plot it ( plot a month of data + full range for comparison). Unrelated note : we are seeing record wave heights now, Dec 30 2023, in California. Is this post inspired by it?
