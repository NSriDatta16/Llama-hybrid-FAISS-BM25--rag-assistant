I'm a Java programmer who creates a lot of reports. I would recommend starting with both a programming language (naturally I would recommend Java) and SQL at the same time, because creating tables independent of any real use isn't very interesting. I work primarily with DB2 but to start I would recommend a free database such as MySQL. Once installed you can set up tables and learn about referential integrity, simple queries, joins, and all kinds of good stuff. Then you can create some simple programs that display data from and read data to the DB. There are many simple examples of this in Java which will be easy to follow if you understand the basics of your database. The needs of the application will drive you to create more complicated DB designs. After this the current direction in Java is moving to something called ORM (object relational mapping), sounds scary... but it isn't and what it works out to... more less... Is you can forget about SQL, all the tables are automatically transformed into Objects. Objects are the basic building blocks when working in Java. Long story short, you can use a database only knowing database theory and the Java language without specific knowledge of SQL (which is annoyingly different between the different databases). With all that said it is still way easier to learn if you know SQL. The advice to work with a scripting language such as Perl is good too. PHP also would be a good choice if you're a little interested in producing programs for the web. You might want to pursue a certification of some sort. There are many for all major databases and many languages. The subjects are large and even if you only look into certification requirements you would have guidance on what to study. I don't think you need much math for most applications. I only use average() and some math for dates... One of my passions is graphics programming so I certainly don't mind math just most databases are full of business data so I wouldn't worry too much.
