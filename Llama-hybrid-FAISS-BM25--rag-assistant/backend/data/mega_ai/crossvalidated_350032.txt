There are many good ideas here in other answers, but they don't exhaust the good solutions that are possible. The first graph in this answer takes it that different levels of death rate can be discussed and explained separately. In allowing each series to fill much of the space available, it focuses readers' attention on patterns of relative change. Alphabetical order by country is usually a dopey default, and is not insisted on here. Fortuitously, and fortunately, Germany as de is in the centre of this 3 x 3 display. A simple narrative -- Look! Germany's pattern is exceptional with an upturn from 1932 -- is made possible and plausible. Fortuitously, but fortunately, 9 countries are enough to justify trying separate panels, but not too many to make that design impracticable (with say 30 and certainly 300 panels, there could (would) be too many panels to scan, with each too small to scrutinize). Evidently, there is plenty of space here for fuller country names. (In some other answers, legends take up a large fraction of the available space, while remaining a little cryptic. In practice, people interested in such data would find the country abbreviations easy to decode, but how far the legend is needed is often a vexing issue in graphical design.)

The general idea is discussed within this related thread . There is loss as well as gain here. While each series can more easily be seen in the context of others, space is lost by repetition. Stata code for the record: (Code to input , reshape , rename as above in this answer) * type "ssc inst fabplot" to install fabplot line death year, by(country, compact note("countries highlighted in turn")) /// ytitle("death rate, yearly deaths per 1000") yla(8(2)18, ang(h)) /// xla(1927(5)1937, format(%tyY)) xtitle("") front(connected) fabplot is to be understood as f ront or f oreground a nd b ackdrop or b ackground plot, not as some echo of 1960s slang for "fabulous".
