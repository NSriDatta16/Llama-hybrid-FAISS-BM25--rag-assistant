I'm not seeing why there is a need for there to be any explicit dimensions; the required elements of a QR code are used to determine size, alignment, etc. As long as you're printing a actually valid QR code (border included, etc), the customer should be able to adjust the focal distance from the camera to the code. If you're really so inclined, just hold an average smartphone at average-person height, and roughly determine the size from the field of view.
