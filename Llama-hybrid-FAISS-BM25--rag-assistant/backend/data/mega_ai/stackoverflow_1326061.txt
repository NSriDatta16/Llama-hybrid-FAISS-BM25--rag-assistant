Are you trying to drag the entire UITableViewCell , or a UIView inside the cell? Either way, I don't think you'll be able to move the view outside the bounds of its parent, which would be the UITableView . I have another project where I have a icon or tile ( UIImageView ) that the user can drag around the screen. After it reaches a certain distance, it snaps back. Similarly, a possible solution might involve popping up a UIView (perhaps a UIImageView ) over top of the table cell when the cell is tapped. The user could drag that around the screen, and you could make it disappear when it's "dropped" on whatever target you have.
