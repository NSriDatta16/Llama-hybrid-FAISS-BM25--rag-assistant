Repeated measures with binary data

I've deigned an experiment in which participants read 24 narratives and guess if they are written by men or women and rate their own confidence. I thus have 24 binary repeated measures. I have the following predictors: participant gender and response to a scale about gender identity (participant based), and also 6 narrative content ratings of the narratives (vary by narrative but not by participants) and finally participants' confidence (varies by participant and by narrative). I've been using GEE in SPSS because my reading suggests this is the most accessible way for me to run what is effectively a repeated measures logistic regression. But I may have a mediation between confidence and some of the narrative variables. Should I be using a different approach? Is structural equation modelling appropriate here? I have access to STATA and AMOS, but no experience with either.
