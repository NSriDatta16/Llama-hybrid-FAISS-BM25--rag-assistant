How to use neural networks to learn a probability density function?

For example, if we want to learn the pdf or a normal distribution, we can let the network out the mean and variance parameters of the pdf function. However, for other general/unknown distribution, is it possible for the neural network to learn the conditional pdf of observed data? I found some reference such as here . However, I m not quite sure how their first step of creating a universe set from the observed data (page 59). Any help would be appreciated.
