You may or may not apply neural network to your problem. Neural network will give predictions for sure but it can't be said how much efficient will it be for this problem. You have to code and check it for yourself. Also, if you have all the above data in tabular form and you know the labels(which I guess is valid/inavlid ), I will say try it with xgboost. Neural networks are exceptional for unsupervised learning but in the case of supervised learning, there may be a model which may outperform a neural network.
