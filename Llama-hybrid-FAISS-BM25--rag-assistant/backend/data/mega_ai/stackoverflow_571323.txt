How does one specify a section-like entity without a title in a docbook article?

I have an article that I'm converting to Docbook format. The article contains small lightweight sections that group together a few (simple) paragraphs. The sections do not contain titles. I cannot find an element in Docbook that denotes this structure. All section-like elements I've found require a title. A close example of what I want to do is like how in a chapter or short story sometimes to denote a break in setting, two paragraphs will be separated by blank lines or ** * ** or some other visual cue connoting discontinuation. I looked at the book element to see how this would implemented in a book but couldn't find any suitable element there. Any ideas?
