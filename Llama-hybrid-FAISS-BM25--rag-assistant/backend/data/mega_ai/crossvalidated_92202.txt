Derive squared exponential covariance function

In Gaussian Processes, SVMs, kernels are used (as to my understanding) as similarity measure. However, they have the constraint that any kernel has to be represented as a dot product. i.e. $k(x_1,x_2)=\langle f(x_1), f(x_2)\rangle$. Note that $f(x)$ could map x to a higher dimension e.g. $f(x)=[x^2\,\,\,\, \sqrt{2}x]^T$ My question is how can you derive the square exponential function $k_{SE}=\exp(-(x_1-x_2)^2)$ as a dot product.
