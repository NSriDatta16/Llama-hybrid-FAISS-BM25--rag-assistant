So i figured out what was wrong. The problem was something else than what I initially expected. The reason why it didn't work was because I created my textbox controls in the Load_event. When I tried to set the value of the text property of the textbox controls they hadn't been created yet. The reason why I had created the user controls containing the textboxes this way was in order to make it easy to drag them into the screen in the Designer. I found this discussion 'UserControl' constructor with parameters in C# , which showed me another way of doing it and now it works.
