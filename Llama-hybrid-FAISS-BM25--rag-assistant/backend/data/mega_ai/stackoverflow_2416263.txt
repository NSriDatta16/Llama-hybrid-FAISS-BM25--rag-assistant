Rename several files in the BASH

I would like to rename files numbering: I have a files with '???' format I need to put them in '????'. myfile_100_asd_4 to myfile_0100_asd_4 Thanks Arman. Not so elegant SOLUTION: #/bin/bash snap=`ls -t *_???` c=26 for k in $snap do end=${k} echo mv $k ${k%_*}_0${k##*_}_asd_4 (( c=c-1 )) done This works for me because I have myfile_100 files as well.
