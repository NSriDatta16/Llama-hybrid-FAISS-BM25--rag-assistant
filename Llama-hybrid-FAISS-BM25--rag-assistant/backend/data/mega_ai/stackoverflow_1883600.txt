Really, if you are going to use Swing, your developers are going to face a learning curve. Groovy SwingBuilder and similar libraries are just DSLs that cut out a lot of boilerplate and repetitive code. SwingBuilder certainly saves time (and is more elegant than pure java), but really the complex part of using Swing is dealing with the underlying framework. The NetBeans Swing UI builder (Matisse) is really nice if you want drag-and-drop Swing development, but you still have to be pretty familiar with Swing if you want to understand how to hook everything together.
