No, there is no general count data regression model. (Just as there is no general regression model for continuous data. A linear model with normally distributed homoskedastic noise is most commonly assumed, and fitted using Ordinary Least Squares. However, gamma regression or exponential regression is often used to deal with different error distribution assumptions, or conditional heteroskedasticity models, like ARCH or GARCH in a time series context, to deal with heteroskedastic noise.) Common models include poisson-regression , as you write, or Negative Binomial Regression. These models are sufficiently widespread to find all kinds of software, tutorials or textbooks. I particularly like Hilbe's Negative Binomial Regression . This earlier question discusses how to choose between different count data models. If you have "many" zeros in your data, and especially if you suspect that zeros could be driven by a different data-generating process than non-zeros (or that some zeros come from one DGP, and other zeros and non-zeros come from a different DGP), zero-inflation models may be useful. The most common one is zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression. You could also skim through our previous questions tagged both "regression" and "count-data" . EDIT: @MichaelM raises a good point. This does look like time series of count data. (And the missing data for 1992 and 1994 suggest to me that there should be a zero in each of these years. If so, do include it. Zero is a valid number, and it does carry information.) In light of this, I'd also suggest looking through our previous questions tagged both "time-series" and "count-data" .
