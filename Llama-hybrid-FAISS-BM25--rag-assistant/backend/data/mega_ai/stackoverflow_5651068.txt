Can I use the same HTML5 browser storage, across different domains?

There are a couple of different approaches for choosing an HTML5 browser storage (IndexedDB, Web Storage), but from what I read in the spec, the "same origin policy applies". Is there a way to keep data inside the browser and have it available from both www.domain1.com/myapp1 and www.domain2.com/myapp2?
