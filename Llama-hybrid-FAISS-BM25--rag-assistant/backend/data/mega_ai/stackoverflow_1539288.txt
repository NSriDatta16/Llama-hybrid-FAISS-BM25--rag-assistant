Seeking iPhone App Architecture Advice: Managing Data

I've built a simple iPhone app that parses data from a remote XML feed, converts the information into objects (they're videos), and displays the videos in a standard table view->detail view->"Play Video" UI. There are hundreds of videos, each with about ten attributes. (The videos are never downloaded, only streamed, using MPMoviePlayerController.) I've relied on the Apple sample application SeismicXML for much of the app's behavior. Now I'm ready for the next step: saving the video metadata to the device, so that users aren't forced to wait for the XML retrieval and parsing every time they launch my app. I'm planning to use Core Data to save my Video objects (and their parent Channel objects), but it's all brand new to me. My question is: Can folks recommend any sample application or design pattern for managing this data? I want to have the app automatically download and parse the XML at launch, but then it should refresh the data only when the user taps a Refresh button, or if the data is older than, say, a day. Apps that model this behavior are NYTimes, AP, and many others. Besides the excellent documentation that Apple provides for Core Data, are there any resources out there for architecting an iPhone app that needs to download, save, and periodically refresh its data? Thanks. Update on 11/12/2009: Between the Apple sample code for TheElements, TopSongs, CoreDataBooks, PhotoLocations, iPhoneCoreDataRecipes, and XMLPerformance, I've got plenty of grist for the mill here. I'm currently analyzing the samples, and slowly piecing together what I need.
