Several of the machine learning algorithms in Statistics Toolbox provide explicit support for categorical inputs. For example, the "fitensemble" function supports an input argument named "CategoricalPredictors" http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/stats/fitensemble.html It's probably not a good idea to hand numerical values for categorical data. If you do need to do something like this it would be a good idea to code these using dummy variables.
