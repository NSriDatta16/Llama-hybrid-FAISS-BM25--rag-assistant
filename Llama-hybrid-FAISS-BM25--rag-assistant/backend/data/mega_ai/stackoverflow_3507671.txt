What's the difference between Data Modelling and Domain Modelling?

By the way - with reference to data modelling I'm referring to logical or conceptual data models - not physical ones. The question came up during a discussion at work; naturally I leapt to Wikipedia to get some basic definitions in place - hoping that they might clarify the difference - but they didn't... A conceptual schema or conceptual data model is a map of concepts and their relationships. Logical Data Modles seem very similar (from this definition): A logical data model (LDM) in systems engineering is a representation of an organization's data, organized in terms entities and relationships and is independent of any particular data management technology. Where-as... A domain model , or Domain Object Model (DOM) in problem solving and software engineering can be thought of as a conceptual model of a system which describes the various entities involved in that system and their relationships. The differences between domain model vs conceptual data model seems particularly murky. One of the things which adds to this confusion is that (from what I've seen) a domain model is usually modelled using a UML class diagram - the class entity in a UML class diagram supports methods - our colleague maintains that a domain model must not contain "operations". I can understand domain modellers using a sub-set of a UML class diagram - but isn't it dangerous to assume people will refrain from including "operations" if the tooling they are using supports it?
