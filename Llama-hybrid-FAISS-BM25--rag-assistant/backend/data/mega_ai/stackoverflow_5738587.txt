Like @conmulligan says Objective-C uses protocols to make classes talk to each other. Its one of many ways to communicate between classes. But protocols is necessarily a bad way. I use protocols if I was to create a re-usable object, that is usually used for many projects. So I create protocols to make my code easy to maintain.
