if an Alarm is registered (as a reminder) for a custom task, would the alarm be deleted if the task is removed?

I'm hoping to make [another] tasks list app, with ability to set reminders on each task. The tasks would be stored in a SQLite DB, but what about the alarms? Should they be (or can they be) stored in the DB too? If the app is uninstalled, with tasks which have reminders in the future, will these alarms still go off? The ability to modify an existing time/date of a reminder is important (and also offset the alarm (comparable to a snooze option on an alarm clock) by a user specified amount, though I guess I could reset a new alarm). My question pertains mostly to the storage (and management) of alarms, or am I thinking about alarms in an incorrect way? Thanks
