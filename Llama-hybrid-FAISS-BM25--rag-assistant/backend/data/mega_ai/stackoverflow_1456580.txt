Look deeply in all the code, its very likely that Me.ListBox1 is null. I once worked on an app built by a third party that code like this that was called only in a specific case and caused an exception during asp.net rendering code ... void ClearItems() { SomeField.Text = ""; ... AnotherField = null; ... } Also pay attention to the stack trace in the other failures, it would be different if it blows inside the control's method than if it blows in your code.
