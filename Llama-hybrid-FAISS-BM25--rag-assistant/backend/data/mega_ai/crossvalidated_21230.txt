I think that using a pseudo-number for each group is a really bad idea. Let's say your measuring minutes on the internet per day it is probable that people who sit only 1-15 min. actually just sit 1 minute on average since they only do a fast check on something insignificant. The assumption that the distribution is even seems daring to me. As you also point out the fact that 60+ doesn't have an upper bound the idea of getting a proper average. In general categorizing a continuous variable is a bad idea , the error is not smaller because you have categories, someone that sits 15 minutes per day will have a larger chance of getting misclassified. If you have to categorize you should do it after the collecting of data. My suggestion is that you try to just do a bar graph showing the mode of the data or even more simple a frequency table. You could analyze your data using a multinomial logit or ordered logit (since your data has an order) if it's your outcome variable. Edit after comments Reporting the data as a cumulative data also makes sense: more than 50 % spend at least 30 min where 10 % spent over 60 min. You should be able to do some calculations based on that assumption that will give you a minimum estimate.
