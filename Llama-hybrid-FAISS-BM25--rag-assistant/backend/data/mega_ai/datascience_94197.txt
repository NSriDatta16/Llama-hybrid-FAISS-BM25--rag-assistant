confusion about PCA algorithm matlab

I am given a data set with 500 features and I am told to apply PCA and find most important 2 features. I wrote some MATLAB code but I am very confused with all this PCA thing. mean(projectData) projectData = bsxfun(@minus,projectData,mean(projectData)); [coeff,score,latent] = pca(projectData); This what I wrote but I do not know what to do next. I think I must print latent and take 2 values which are highest and assume their index to be feature number. This is what I understand. Please help me.
