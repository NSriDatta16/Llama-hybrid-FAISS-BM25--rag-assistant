You can use a new Test and select type (VPXP_API) which allow script to run. The good thing there is that you'd have the function definition ready to be dragged from within QC instead of having to heavily rely on doc. I've done an implementation in Python running some script from within QC still using its API but via a QC test which is handy to retrieve directly the result (Output) etc.. going through some shell command which can then call any script on any server etc...
