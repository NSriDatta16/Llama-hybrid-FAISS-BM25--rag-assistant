1) Once you distribute software you automatically start leaving evidence of ownership around. Open Source software archives are mirrored, several organizations maintain archives of public mailing lists and other pieces of the Internet. Distributed version control means that the whole history of a project can be held by lots of people. Linus Torvalds joked that real men don't backup, they just upload their stuff and let the world mirror it. In practice, it's more likely that few people will use a piece of software, rather than anyone will care enough to pass it off as their own. 2) You must use a license that complies with the terms of the licenses of the software that you are reusing. This is why the GPL is called viral - if you write software that directly links to any piece of GPL software you must use the GPL for your code, or get an exemption from the copyright holder. If you have a free choice, I would suggest using the MIT license, because this is the standard license for Ruby code. It is very short and readable.
