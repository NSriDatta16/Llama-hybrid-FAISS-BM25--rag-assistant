There is a slide from John Resig (jQuery creator) where he says that jQuery does in fact use document fragments internally. On the following slides he explains briefly how to build up a lightweight document fragment and append it in one operation stating that this " ends up being really fast ". You might want to look into that, if you did not already (as you mention document fragments yourself). As for the process of creating new elements with $(' ') , the documentation says: But if the string appears to be an HTML snippet, jQuery attempts to create new DOM elements as described by the HTML. Then a jQuery object is created and returned that refers to these elements. jQuery uses "the native JavaScript createElement() function" if you provide a single tag and "the browser's innerHTML mechanism" for more complex html snippets.
