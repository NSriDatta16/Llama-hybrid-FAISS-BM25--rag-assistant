You could try: Reduce the number of hidden units, I know you said it already seems low, but given that the input layer only has 80 features, it actually can be that 128 is too much. A rule of thumb is to have the number of hidden units be in-between the number of input units (80) and output classes (5); Alternatively, you could increase the dimension of the input representation space to be more than 80 (however this may overfit as well if the representation is already too narrow for any given word). A good way to fit a network is too begin with an overfitting network and then reduce capacity (hidden units and embedding space) until it no longer overfits.
