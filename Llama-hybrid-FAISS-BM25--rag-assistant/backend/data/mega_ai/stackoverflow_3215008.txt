If you have 250,000 rows with only 3000 distinct results, each street is in the database 83 times on average. Perhaps it would be appropriate to separate your streets into a separate, normalized table, with each value occurring only once, then reference those streets from your address table by ID. Then for your TableView, you could pull back just the values from your Streets table. As was mentioned before, you may also have a UI paradigm issue. If you have a table with 3000 entries in it in the UI, that could potentially be very tedious for the user. (Imagine trying to scroll down one flick at a time to Yabar Street.) You may want to at least lazy load the table, as was suggested before. Or maybe you can allow the user to type a street name, and provide a Google-suggest-type interface, popping up potential matches as they type.
