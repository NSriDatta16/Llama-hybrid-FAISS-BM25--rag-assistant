For caching local files, you should look into the File System APIs that are now in Chrome. This gives you programmatic access to a virtual file system, letting you control what resources you store locally. The Application Cache can help you with static resources like the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required for the game. However, you need to run as an "installed web app" (via the Chrome Web Store, for example) to get unlimited storage. Browsers are building quota management systems to help make this easier. WebGL is great, and the libraries are emerging to help make it easier. There's no clear "winner" but lots of options. JavaScript is pretty fast these days, thanks to improvements like CrankShaft. For even better performance, you can use Native Client to run your C/C++ code and post messages back and forth to JavaScript. There are two big issues that I can see. One is helping the middleware companies port their work to JavaScript or Native Client. The second is improving the speed with which we can move data from JavaScript into WebGL.
