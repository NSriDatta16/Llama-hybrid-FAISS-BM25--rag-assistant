I think both compile time and interface/implementation separation are good reasons. Even if the former is not a problem right now, in most decent-sized projects, it does become a problem. But, since you asked for other reasons, I think a big one is that it reduces dependencies. The implementation of your class probably requires more #includes than the interface. But if you put the implementation in the header file, you drag along those dependencies with the header. Then every other file that includes that also has those dependencies. There is no one-size-fits-all rule, though. And some classes (especially "small" ones) are probably best placed entirely in a header.
