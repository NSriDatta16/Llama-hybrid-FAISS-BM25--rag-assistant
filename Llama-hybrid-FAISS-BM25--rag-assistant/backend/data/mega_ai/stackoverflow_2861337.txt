sys.traces has a record for every trace started on the server. Since SQL Express does not have Agent and cannot set up jobs, you'll need an external process or service to monitor these. You'll have to roll your own everything (monitoring, archiving, trace retention policy etc). If you have C2 audit in place, I assume you have policies in place that determine the duration audit has to be retained.
