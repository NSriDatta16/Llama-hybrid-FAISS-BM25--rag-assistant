I used ASP.NET for several years, and when I had a chance I switched to MVC for a new project even though I did not know MVC at all at that time. This is because I did not like ASP.NET. And because I do like clean design and other good stuff like DRY. If you like ASP.NET and like to code in terms of dragging user controls to canvas (i.e. quick and dirty), there's no reason to choose MVC. If you choose MVC, you would probably choose jQuery over UpdatePanel, or (Fluent)NHibernate over Linq-to-SQL/EntityFramework... etc. For me, this is more like tools-wizards-oriented development over code-oriented. P.S. I do not say that ASP.NET means "quick and dirty and no design".
