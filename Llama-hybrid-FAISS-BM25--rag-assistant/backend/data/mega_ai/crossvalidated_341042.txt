Dicky Fuller Test - why is it important that the CLT does not apply under assumption of non-stationarity?

I am trying to understand the Dicky-Fuller test (simple case, no augmentation or lags). I can get this far: For $X_t = \alpha + \rho X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$, $\alpha$ is the drift term, and $\epsilon_t$ is i.i.d noise. $H_0: \rho = 1$, i.e. non-stationary $H_1: \rho This is then rearranged to: $\Delta X_t = \alpha + (\rho - 1) X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ This is where I get stuck. Why can't we just use a standard t-test to test whether $\rho=1$ for $X_t = \alpha + \rho X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$? From my research I've seen the answer that "Because $X_t$ is non-stationary under the null, the Central Limit Theorem doesn't apply and therefore t-test doesn't hold." Can you please explain what this means? I've looked at the following resources but still don't understand: These slides: https://www.bauer.uh.edu/rsusmel/phd/ec2-5.pdf Ben Lambert's awesome YouTube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GxWgIumPTA
