No, Unfortuantly Eclipse 3.x and lower do not allow the editor window to be outside the application window. You can drag other windows outside the main window to give you more editor space, but you cannot for example drag an editor outside the main eclipse window onto a second monitor and to have another code window open on the main monitor. This feature seems to be scheduled for Eclipse 4. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8886 for this feature.
