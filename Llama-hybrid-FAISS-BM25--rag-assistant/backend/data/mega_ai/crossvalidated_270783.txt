Could we say that linear SVM and logistic regression are the exact same models optimized using different losses, respectively hinge loss and logistic loss? Yes and no at the same time. Both can be seen under an empirical risk minimization light, where one is interested in minimizing the following function with regards to the coefficients $w$: $$L(x,y,w)=\sum_i^n f(x_i,y_i,w)+R(w)$$ When $f \equiv \text{hinge loss}$ and $R(w) =w^Tw$ we have the SVM, and when $f \equiv \text{logistic loss}$ and $R(w) =0$ we have logistic regression. So you can treat the loss and regularization as parameters of a model, which is empirical risk minimization. Most, if not all, linear (kernelized/regularized) models can be put under this umbrella as well, it's a really broad definition. Of course, the SVM and logistic regression can be seen as different models, because they have different functional forms, having completely different specialized techniques for optimization.
