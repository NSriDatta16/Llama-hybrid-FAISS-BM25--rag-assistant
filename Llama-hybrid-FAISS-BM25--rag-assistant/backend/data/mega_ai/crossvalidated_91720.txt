Can effective sample size in MCMC simulation be greater than the actual sample size?

I used coda package's effectiveSize() to find the effective sample size of my MCMC simulation. My effective sample size is greater than the actual sample size, e.g. 9813.626 greater than 9501. I wonder if that makes sense? My understanding is that the effective sample size cannot be greater than the actual sample size, and will be smaller when there is more autocorrelation.
