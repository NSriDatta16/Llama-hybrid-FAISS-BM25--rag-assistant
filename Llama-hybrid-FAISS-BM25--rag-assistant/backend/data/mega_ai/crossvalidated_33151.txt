Adding 2nd level variable into Multi-level Modelling in R

I have a dataset ( data.mrsa ) about the MRSA prevalence of elderly in long term care facilities (LTCF) with the following information: mrsa_result: MRSA result of recruited elderly (positive VS negative) age: residents' age ltcf: UID for each LTCF (we sampled 30 out of 1000 LTCFs) ltcf_type: type of LTCF (private VS non-private) I have a multi-level logistic regression model like the one below: fit2 I know I am trying to find out the effect of age on the log-odds of mrsa_result , having the ltcf on the 2nd level gives me a wider CI on the lod-odds. Now I want to add the ltcf_type into the model, I think this should be a fixed effect, as there can only be private and non-private, but itcf_type should be considered as 2nd level data, right? As this describe the type of LTCF, not the type of elderly. I am puzzled on where should I put the term ltcf_type into my model, I wonder which of the following lines is correct: fit2a Thanks.
