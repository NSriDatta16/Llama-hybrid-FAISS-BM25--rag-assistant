 said they were not offered the opportunity for a public review of the plans nor were they provided with information for how their community could potentially benefit. The community is concerned about strain on the power grid as well. In November 2024, TVA approved xAI's request for access to more than 100 megawatts of power, enough electricity to power 100,000 homes, to Colossus which is supplied by MLGW. This fear is not unfounded, as the electric grid in Tennessee, including Memphis, has been strained during previous extreme weather events. In December 2022, MLGW imposed (then rescinded) rolling blackouts during several days of extreme cold that put a strain on the power grid. In a letter to the TVA, the SELC "urged the agency to 'prioritize Memphis families' access to reliable power over the 'secondary purpose' of serving xAI". Current progress In early December 2024, Ted Townsend detailed how the power of Colossus doubled in its processing capability. When it first went online in September 2024, it was using "100,000 Nvidia H100 processing chips". Still, this initial launch demonstrated Colossus to be the largest supercomputer globally. As of June 2025, the supercomputer consists of 150,000 H100 GPUs, 50,000 H200 GPUs and 30,000 GB200 GPUs. Another 110,000 GB200 GPUs are to be brought online at a second data center also in the Memphis area. The expansion of this supercomputer has already been discussed and will be the second phase of the project. It is stated that it will add 320 new jobs. Not only that, but in its expansion, xAI also plans to increase Colossus to 1 million graphics processing units. Since the current state of the supercomputer is using gas turbines for power, it is temporarily relying on them alongside Tesla Mega Packs. As part of this prospective expansion, xAI is also looking to add more Mega Packs, which could later allow the center to no longer depend on Memphis's gas and water grid. Townsend also mentioned how xAI "is [also] expected to act as a data hub for Musk's other companies, including X and SpaceX." The expansion continued in March 2025 when xAI purchased a 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) site in the Whitehaven area of Memphis. xAI employee Brent Mayo said that the addition of this property "...ensures [xAI] remain at the forefront of AI innovation...in Memphis." The property was purchased for almost $80 million, by CTC Property LLC, an affiliate of xAI. The Memphis City Council also approved xAI's wastewater recycling plant expansion. Plans for the expansion were initially revealed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation when preliminary plans for the facility were filed on September 18, 2024, for the project "...between xAI, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and Nucor Steel..." At the time, xAI representatives detailed its estimated cost to be $78 million, which was to be privately funded. In March 2025, approval was officially granted for this expansion, including "...the sale of 13 acres for a wastewater recycling plant near the supercomputer in southwest Memphis." The final cost of the project was revealed to be $80 million for construction.
