Website tactics: A question about how many SQL queries are enough

I've recently begun to unveil and slowly roll out a homemade CMS. The site allows a lot of customization with movement towards internationalization and customization onto a level that doesn't require source code. This is a personal project, and the entire intent was to see how far I can push my own programming limits (the question of distrubtion of a CMS that handles blog, webcomic, and a small forum isn't one that I'm willing to consider, not until I clean it up and work on it some more--as well, seeing as it's an amateur project, I doubt it has any gravity compared to other, more refined projects... but those are not topics that concern the topic at hand.) I've instituted a series of code that allows me to see how fast each page is generated and how many queries are ran; on average, I'm seeing 9-13, upwards to 12 MySQL queries performed per page. Average time to generate a page is somewhere between 10-20 ms. Now, not having any experience with professional design, what is the optimum that I should be striving for? What are ways to reduce generation time (or, with an average of 15 ms/page, is this not even a concern), or tactics on reducing the number of a queries on a page where most of the content is loaded FROM an MySQL database, including things like menu items. Mind you, this is a very broad question; it isn't my intent to ask a general question or spark conversation, but to find out ways of reducing the load (if any) on a server that such a system could create.
