The simplest approach would be the k-nearest neighbors classifier. Here we would take the euclidean distances of of the 5 variables or quantifiable skills that we have data on compared to our new test point (member of new band). The issue is if you have 4 members in the band what this algorithm will do is tell you the best spot for each individual player but not them as a band. So to determine the best as a band you would check every possible combination of that the members could make by choosing different instruments adding up the average euclidean distance of that band layout from the original data and go with the version of the band with the smallest distance. The euclidean distance is the magnitude of the difference of the components between the two points. So for a 2D example for points (2,5) and (1,9) the distance between the x components is 1 and the distance between the y components is 4. So the magnitude of the total distance is sqrt(1^2+4^2) or sqrt(17).
