TL;DR: if $p$ = 1/6 and you want to know how large $n$ needs to be 98% sure the dice is fair (to within 2%), $n$ needs to be at least $n$ â‰¥ 766 . Let $n$ be the number of rolls and $X$ the number of rolls that land on some specified side. Then $X$ follows a Binomial(n,p) distribution where $p$ is the probability of getting that specified side. By the central limit theorem, we know that $$\sqrt{n} (X/n - p) \to N(0,p(1-p))$$ Since $X/n$ is the sample mean of $n$ Bernoulli $(p)$ random variables. Hence for large $n$ , confidence intervals for $p$ can be constructed as $$\frac{X}{n} \pm Z \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$ Since $p$ is unknown, we can replace it with the sample average $\hat{p} = X/n$ , and by various convergence theorems, we know the resulting confidence interval will be asymptotically valid. So we get confidence intervals of the form $$\hat{p} \pm Z \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$ with $\hat{p} = X/n$ . I'm going to assume you know what $Z$ -scores are. For example, if you want a 95% confidence interval, you take $Z=1.96$ . So for a given confidence level $\alpha$ we have $$\hat{p} \pm Z_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$ Now let's say you want this confidence interval to be of length less than $C_\alpha$ , and want to know how big a sample we need to make this case. Well this is equivelant to asking what $n_\alpha$ satisfies $$Z_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_\alpha}} \leq \frac{C_\alpha}{2}$$ Which is then solved to obtain $$n_\alpha \geq \left(\frac{2 Z_\alpha}{C_\alpha}\right)^2 \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})$$ So plug in your values for $Z_\alpha$ , $C_\alpha$ , and estimated $\hat{p}$ to obtain an estimate for $n_\alpha$ . Note that since $p$ is unknown this is only an estimate, but asymptotically (as $n$ gets larger) it should be accurate.
