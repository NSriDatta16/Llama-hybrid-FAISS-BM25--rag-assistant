Setting max_depth greater than the number of features in a Random Forest

I was using random forest regression to predict the price of a house. There are only 3 features in data set. Initially when I had set max_depth=2 the result was highly biased. The performance improved with max_depth=8 , but my question is how can we set max_depth greater than the total number of features.
