I'll try to boil it down to 3-4 rules of thumb and provide some more examples of the Pythagorean means. The relationship between the 3 means is HM . They will be equal if and only if there's no variation at all in sample data. For data in levels, use the AM. Prices are a good example. For ratios, use the GM. Investment returns, relative prices, and the UN's Human Development Index are all examples. HM is appropriate when dealing with rates. Here's a non-automotive example courtesy of David Giles : For instance, consider data on "hours worked per week" (a rate). Suppose that we have four people (sample observations), each of whom work a total of 2,000 hours. However, they work for different numbers of hours per week, as follows: Person Total Hours Hours per Week Weeks Taken 1 2,000 40 50 2 2,000 45 44.4444 3 2,000 35 57.142857 4 2,000 50 40 Total: 8,000 191.587297 The Arithmetic Mean of the values in the third column is AM = 42.5 hours per week. However, notice what this value implies. Dividing the total number of weeks worked by the sample members (8,000) by this average value yields a value of 188.2353 as the total number of weeks worked by all four people. Now look at the last column in the table above. In fact the correct value for the total number of weeks worked by sample members is 191.5873 weeks. If we compute the Harmonic Mean for the values for Hours per Week in the third column of the table we get HM = 41.75642 hours ( David also discusses the weighted version of the 3 means, which come up in price indices used to measure inflation. I often find it hard to figure out if something is a rate or a ratio. Returns on an investment are usually treated as ratios when calculating means, but they are also a rate since they are usually denominated in "% per unit of time." I think a useful distinction is that ratios are usually unitless, so returns are ratios because \$ of current value over $ invested has the dollars signs cancel. Rates have different units in the numerator and the denominator. Thus if you wanted to summarize the Big Mac Index for Northern European countries, you would use the equally weighted HM, because it is a rate. Divided by the number countries, the HM would tell you how much currency you would need to afford a BM under the constraint that you had to have the same amount of each currency.
