Answer edited to implement encouraging and constructive comment by @Ferdi I would like to: provide an answer with a full contained script mention one can also test more general custom contrasts using the /TEST command argue this is necessary in some cases (ie the EMMEANS COMPARE combination is not enough) I assume to have a database with columns: depV, Group, F1, F2. I implement a 2x2x2 mixed design ANOVA where depV is the dependent variable, F1 and F2 are within subject factors and Group is a between subject factor. I further assume the F test has revealed that the interaction Group*F2 is significant. I therefore need to use post hoc t-tests to understand what drives the interaction. MIXED depV BY Group F1 F2 /FIXED=Group F1 F2 Group*F1 Group*F2 F1*F2 Group*F1*F2 | SSTYPE(3) /METHOD=REML /RANDOM=INTERCEPT | SUBJECT(Subject) COVTYPE(VC) /EMMEANS=TABLES(Group*F2) COMPARE(Group) ADJ(Bonferroni) /TEST(0) = 'depV(F2=1)-depV(F2=0) differs between groups' Group*F2 1/4 -1/4 -1/4 1/4 Group*F1*F2 1/8 -1/8 1/8 -1/8 -1/8 1/8 -1/8 1/8 /TEST(0) = 'depV(Group1, F2=1)-depV(Group2, F2=1)' Group 1 -1 Group*F1 1/2 1/2 -1/2 -1/2 Group*F2 1 0 -1 0 Group*F1*F2 1/2 0 1/2 0 -1/2 0 -1/2 0 . In particular the second t-test corresponds to the one performed by the EMMEANS command. The EMMEANS comparison could reveal for example that depV was bigger in Group 1 on the condition F2=1. However the interaction could also be driven by something else, which is verified by the first test: the difference depV(F2=1)-depV(F2=0) differs between groups, and this is a contrast you cannot verify with the EMMEANS command (at least I did not find an easy way). Now, in models with many factors it is a bit tricky to write down the /TEST line, the sequence of 1/2, 1/4 etc, called L matrix. Typically if you get the error message: "the L matrix is not estimable", you are forgetting some elements. One link that explains the receipt is this one: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/faq/how-can-i-test-contrasts-and-interaction-contrasts-in-a-mixed-model/
