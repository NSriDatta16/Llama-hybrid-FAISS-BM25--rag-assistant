"All models are wrong, but some are useful." - G.E.P. Box . If you wanted to have a realistic simulation of the universe, you would need to simulate each of its atoms, so you would need to have a computer larger than the universe itself. Every other simulation would be an approximation, making simplified assumptions. It would not be "correct" but would be doable. The point of statistical models is to approximate the observed phenomenons so that we can draw conclusions from the data, or make predictions. A model that would be too complicated would be impossible to interpret and hard to fit to the data. It is always about how realistic you need it to be and what simplifications are acceptable for the particular problem you are trying to solve. The big simplification statistics make is treating the unobserved factors as random noise. For example, if you toss a coin the result of a toss is a deterministic process guided by the laws of physics. The problem is that there is a lot of factors that lead to observing a particular result of a coin toss. Even a butterfly flying around might have changed the movement of air influencing the result. Hopefully, often all the unobserved factors taken together can be easily approximated using a probability distribution and we can use this to draw approximate conclusions about such phenomena. The point of i.i.d. assumption is to be able to treat all the data as being "of the same kind", otherwise you wouldn't be able to have a single model to explain them all, or the model would need to be overly complicated. As a side note, we often do not assume the samples being i.i.d., but only them being exchangable , that's a loser assumption. Again, it is about the "on average" conclusions, they wouldn't make sense for completely unrelated things, or things that heavily influence each other.
