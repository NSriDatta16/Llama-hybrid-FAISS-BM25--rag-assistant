A local sensitivity analysis method makes the assumption that a model is linear. There are alternative techniques which do not make this assumption. The Method of Morris, as implemented in the open-source Python package SALib , computes multiple finite differences at many points in the model input-space. These are then averaged to give a more complete (but still crude) understanding of the sensitivity of the model outputs to inputs. More comprehensive variance-based methods, such as those proposed by Saltelli and others (also implemented in the Python package mentioned earlier) are more computationally demanding, but give even more information about the sensitivity of a model to its inputs, including interactions between pairs of inputs.
