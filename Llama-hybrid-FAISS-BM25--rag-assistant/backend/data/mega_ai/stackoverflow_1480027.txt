Your sys.path is likely not pointing to your locally installed copy, or you're not running the Python 2.6.2 you think you are. If none of that is the case, you need the SQLite development headers (sqlite-dev or whatever), and then recompile Python. You need to pay attention at the end of the compile, because it complains about what it didn't build due to missing dependencies. EDIT: Reread question. EDIT 2: Also, please don't do this: from module import * Do this: from module import what_i_need import module2
