How can 8 dimensions be reduced to 3?

I can't seem to understand how PCA works. My (lack of) math knowledge don't help me either. I have read that the new set of variables has to be a linear combination of the old set. What does that mean exactly? That there should be a way to multiply numbers a, b, c, ... with dimensions/variables x, y, z... and get the old bigger(!) set? Can you answer my example: if I have 8 variables/dimension can they be reduced to 3? Or a vector of 3 components is not a linear combination of 8 and thus no?
