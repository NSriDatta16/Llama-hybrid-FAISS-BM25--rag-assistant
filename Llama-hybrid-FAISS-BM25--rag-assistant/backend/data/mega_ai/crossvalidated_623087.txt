Unlike summing or averaging two scores from a k-point ordinal scale, differencing between two such scores does not necessarily requests assuming the scale to be metrical, interval, for me. "3"-"1" = 2 can easily mean "3 is 2 runs (= 1 point) higher in rank than 1", rather than "the magnitude of 3 is greater than the magnitude of 1 by 2". Per the second way of thinking, the difference gets measured : there is a ruler with the origin 0 and the gauge implied. Per the first way, there is only an ordered sequence of k notches from smaller to bigger; the difference is the result of counting positions "from here" to the left or to the right. Such difference will still have a known size (say, "3"-"1" = "4"-"2" = 2). But that size is after counting positions from a given locus on the scale; it is not the gap which was measured. Possibly, ordinal rating scale can allow computing differences on it (the differeces of the position-counting nature) without becoming an interval scale. However direct summing of scores on it calls to assume it is interval. (My reasoning, sooner, intuition, may be flawed.)
