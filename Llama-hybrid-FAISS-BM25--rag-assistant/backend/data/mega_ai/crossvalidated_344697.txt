Bayesian Filtering for linear but non-Gaussian estimation problems

It seems that most optimal estimation literature is divided into either linear Gaussian problems, for which you use Kalman Filter, or non linear and non Gaussian problems for which you use EKF, UKF or Particle filters. How about a linear system with non Gaussian noise, is there a class of filters for that or one should use the non linear filters instead?
