Correlation of Sums of Time Series

If $x_{t+1} =a x_t + \epsilon$ , then what is $\text{cor}(x_t+x_{t+1},x_{t+2}+x_{t+3})$ ? I am getting, computationally, that it is equal to $\frac{a+a^2}{2}$ . The actual problem I'm working on is converting the autocorrelation of a quarterly variable into an annual one. My boss said that he had worked it out to be just the quarterly autocorrelation to the fourth power, but I did some simulations and discovered that wasn't right. I can figure out the correct value for the annual correlation, but I would appreciate some help figuring out what's going on mathematically. I tried this for the two period case: $E[(x_{t}+x_{t+1}) (x_{t+2}+x_{t+3})] = E[x_t x_{t+2}]+E[x_t x_{t+3}]+E[x_{t+1} x_{t+2}]+E[x_{t+1} x_{t+3}] = (a + 2a^2 +a^3)E[x]^2$ . I've obviously gone off the rails somewhere.
