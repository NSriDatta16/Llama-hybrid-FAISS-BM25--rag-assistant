Questions on ANOVA can be found here: ANOVA assumption normality/normal distribution of residuals I am guessing this is homework, so I will offer some advice on regression analysis. The first step is to run a summary statistics on your data (univariate analyses). This will give you important means, std, variance information that you can use to qualify the ANOVA assumptions (there are three that are found in the above link). Then, I would run a correlation study to see what variables are correlated and how much. After that, you can start thinking about ANOVA or a multiple linear regression (this should also provide you with an Analysis of Variance table that gives you a p-value and an F-statistic. I use SAS and mine looks like this: This is how I write it up. The number of observations in the study is 3987. There is a significant relationship between age and education (IVs) and wages (DV), {F (2, 3984) = 660.71, p 50%) to better explain the variance that each IV has on the DV, but this is still a good model fit with a high F-value. Edit: I wanted to add that if the distributions are not normal, then ANOVA does not apply. You can then think about PCA or Factor Analysis. Edit 2: I forgot to address your main concern, I apologize. You can run a 'between-groups' ANOVA if the two groups have no common participants because they meet the independence requirement 1 . If you are running a longitudinal study on a randomly selected group, you could use a repeated measures ANOVA [2]. 1 http://www.statisticssolutions.com/difference-between-random-selection-and-random-assignment/ [2] https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/repeated-measures-anova-statistical-guide.php Hope this helps!
