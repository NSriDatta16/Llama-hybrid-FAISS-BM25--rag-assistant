Your idea is to learn about the transfer rate for a school for which you as yet have no data from a collection of related schools for which you do have data. This is a great idea and the Bayesian approach is the right way to go. In the Bayesian framework, your "willingness to learn" amounts to an assertion of prior dependence among the transfer rates for all the schools --- the ones for which you have data and the one for which you don't. A natural and convenient way to structure such a prior is through a hierarchical setup. The transfer rates (which are parameters) are modeled as independent and identically distributed with respect to a common distribution which itself has one or more unknown hyperparameters. The hyperparameters provide the channel through which the information flows. However, you must first learn to walk before you can run. In other words, you need to understand how to learn about a single school's transfer rate before you can you can understand this more sophisticated problem. Take a single school with a transfer rate of .05 for example. Is that the "true" transfer rate or just an observation? Is that based on a school with 20 students with 1 transfer or 2000 students with 100 transfers. The amount of information is different in the two cases. This matters not only for learning the true transfer rate for this school but also for learning about the rate for another school. Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman (and others) is one place you can learn how to walk and then how to run. Chapter 5 (in the 3rd edition) is titled "Hierarchical Models." They have an example that has the same structure as your problem: Instead of transfer rates across schools, it's rat tumor rates across experiments. Their data includes the size of each experiment, which corresponds to the size of your schools. Although they do not emphasis the aspect of the problem you are interested in (i.e., "what have I learned about the next experiment/school?"), they do mention this in passing. Other introductory textbooks discuss hierarchical models as well, such as Doing Bayesian Data Analysis by Kruschke. This book may be more suitable depending upon your background and interests. (Don't let the cover of the book put you off. I call the book "Doggy Bayes.")
