Quick lightweight Shopping Cart with PayPal integration

I have built a couple of Shoppping Carts with Magento recently but I feel it is far too bulky for the shop I will be building next. I will be building a shop that sells only 4 DVDs for a seasonal promotion. Can anyone recommend a PHP Shopping Cart / Script with Back-end functionality that can be quickly built. What would you use in similar situation? Thanks, gemmes
