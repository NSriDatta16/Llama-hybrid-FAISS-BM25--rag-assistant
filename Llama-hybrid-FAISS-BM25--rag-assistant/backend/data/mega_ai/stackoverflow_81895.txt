Oracle doesn't require you to use nvarchar to store Unicode stringsâ€”the server can be configured to store varchar2 in UTF-8. If you only supported ASCII before, it should be transparent. That should prevent the need for all the application-side search-and-replace for ' to N' . As for Damien's point: it might not help you now, but you should really make it a priority to get rid of non-parameterized queries. They are nothing but a drag on your system from a maintenance, performance, and safety standpoint.
