Modeling Serial Values with Mixed-Effects Logistic Regression

My data has 264 subjects with their serial measurements. Event is death and sataset has 67 dead, 197 alive observations. I'm trying to model repeated x and y measurements along with age and gender characteristics via Mixed - Effects Logistic Regression Model. My R code is below: mel When I use this code, I encounter overfitting (I'm not sure this word is the best one to explain the situation). I mean, before modelling I have 67 events, after modelling, I have again 67 events, as predicted probabilities suggest. On the other hand, when I try to model these repeated values via this other code below, it gave me an error like this: mel Warning message: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), optpar,ctrl=controlpar,ctrl=controlcheckConv, : Model is nearly unidentifiable: very large eigenvalue - Rescale variables? I'd like to know, if I'm missing something or doing it wrong. Part of my data looks like this: id time age gender x y 1 0 61 1 3,814621015 1,961307217 1 1 61 1 3,63347795 2,044523568 1 2 61 1 3,421073664 2,037971697 1 5 61 1 3,148801558 2,359346485 2 0 60 1 4,180261483 3,695965805 2 3 60 1 3,421073664 1,758059625 2 4 60 1 4,363847995 0,827560091 2 5 60 1 5,335078126 2,799822309 3 0 61 0 2,988464864 -2,037793335 3 2 61 0 2,967471914 -1,722773861 3 3 61 0 2,410342633 -1,59529577 When I check the numeric and factor variables, R again gave another error: Warning messages: 1: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : unable to evaluate scaled gradient 2: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Model failed to converge: degenerate Hessian with 1 negative eigenvalues I got confused. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
