It doesn't seem too trivial to expect a full solution here, but... who knows :) Some thoughts: start with enabling dragging of tabs. When user drags a tab "enough" away from its original location you remove the tab from its origin and create a new window (or some other UI to show it being dragged) containing the contents of the tab. When the tab is dropped - create the new window (or use the "dragging" one) and set it up the way user expects it.
