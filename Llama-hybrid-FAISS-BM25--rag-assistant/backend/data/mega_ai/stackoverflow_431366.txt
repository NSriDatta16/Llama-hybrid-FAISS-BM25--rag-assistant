During my Symbolic AI module at university I was asked to give a small presentation to the class on a certain subject, my subject being AI Applications. My subject in this presentation was Quantum Computing in AI. If the information I write here is out-of-date/wrong/poor don't be too angry. I'm only a second-year CS student at a crappy university that is relying on his memory for most of these details. The power of Quantum Computing appears to be its ability to work on things incredibly fast (due to its perceived states if I remember correctly). This will obviously completely change security, as white and black-hat hackers will jump on the opportunity to develop and stress-test the various methods of secure systems. If you're interested in Physics then this is the subject for you! If you want to read more about how Quantum Computers can be used in security by using Algorithms to factorise large numbers read this paper by Peter Shor . Its power comes from the Qubit and a technique known as Quantum Interference . I could spend all day talking about it, but it'd be better for you to read about the double-slit experiment to see how quantum computing works. The conventional computer compromises of logic gates, whilst quantum computers have their own. As many of these computers have been built (hard-wired) to solve certain problems there are a multitude of different QLG (Quantum Logic Gates) proposed for different problems. Functionally, Quantum Networks are formed using these gates in a method known as Gate Arrays. If you require more information on this then the Ekert paper is the way to go. Please note that the traditional way to represent the super-positions is as unit contra-variant vectors (one per Qubit) in an 2^n-dimension Hilbert space (where n is the number of Qubits). The gates are defined as rotating these universes and inevitably transforming the Qubit. One such gate is the Hadamard Gate . Quantum AI has a bright future, but not for a long time. Many academics see Quantum Computing as the distant future of Computing, similarly to how Charles Babbage viewed his machine. Sorry if this answer got a bit out of hand.
