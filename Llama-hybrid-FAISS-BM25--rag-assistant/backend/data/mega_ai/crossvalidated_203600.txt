The Hartigan dip test (Hartigan and Hartigan, 1985 [1]) is for continuous distributions, or at most a mixed distribution with a single jump in the cdf at the mode. As they explain in the paper: A unimodal F may have an atom only at a unique mode As a result you would not expect it to work for a distribution with multiple atoms, as the one from which your sample was (at least notionally) drawn must be. In particular it wouldn't be expected to work well for discrete distributions. [1] J. A. Hartigan and P. M. Hartigan (1985), "The Dip Test of Unimodality" Ann.
