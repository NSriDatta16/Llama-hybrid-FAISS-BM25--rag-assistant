I had a similar problem until I figured out that some fonts just will not display 'foreign' (to them) signs. I would suggest you to try using the same font as in a program (probably a notepad or something like that) where the text is displayed properly. It worked perfect for me. I opened the file first in notepad and there in Format-> Font... you see the font which was used to open it. Then you will have to find the location of the font, create the font object and give it to e.g. a paragraph before writing it to a document and it will work, at least I hope so. Good luck. :)
