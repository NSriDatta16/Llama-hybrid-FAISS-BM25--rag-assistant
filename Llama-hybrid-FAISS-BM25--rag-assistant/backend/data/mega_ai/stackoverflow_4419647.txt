The postfix ++ has a result and a side effect . The result is the current value of the operand. The side effect is that the operand gets incremented by one. Where the problem comes in is that the side effect doesn't have to be applied immediately after the expression has been evaluated; it only has to be applied before the next sequence point. From the C language standard ( n1256 ): 6.5 Expressions ... 2 Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. 72) Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be stored. 73) ... 72) A floating-point status flag is not an object and can be set more than once within an expression. 73) This paragraph renders undefined statement expressions such as i = ++i + 1; a[i++] = i; while allowing i = i + 1; a[i] = i;
