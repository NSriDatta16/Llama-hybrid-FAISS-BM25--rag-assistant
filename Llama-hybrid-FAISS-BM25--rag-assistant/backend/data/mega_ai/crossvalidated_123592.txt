I find this contradictory because they said that a sample mean averages together all values in the sample, but a population mean also averages together all the values. The excerpt never says anything about the population mean. since the population has the widest range doesn't the same thing apply even more? Absolutely. If you took the mean of the entire population then it would have even less variability. But that has nothing to do with what the excerpt is talking about. So, why is the sample mean's standard deviation less than the population? This is explained in the exerpt.
