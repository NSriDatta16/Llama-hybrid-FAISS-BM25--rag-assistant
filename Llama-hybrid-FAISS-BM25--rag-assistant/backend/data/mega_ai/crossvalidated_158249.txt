This sounds like a homework question? I'll point you into the direction, but not give an exact answer. The question asks to sample from a normally distributed variable, with known average k_n and standard deviation std_n. The size of your sample is n. The answer involves the application of the central limit theorem. This theorem states that a sample average of size n is distributed with average k_n and standard deviation std_n/sqrt(n). With this information you can: - find the 90% confidence interval of the sample mean using a two sided interval (hint: 1.65) - from the lower and higher value calculate the total time instead of the average time for the tasks HTH
