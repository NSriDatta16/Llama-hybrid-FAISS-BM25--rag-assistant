JBossCache isn't really suitable as a directory medium for lucene, because it has no facility for file locking, and its atomicity is fuzzy at best. None of this makes for a good consistent index. You may be interested to know what the Compass Project does (Compass does for Lucene what Hibernate does for JDBC). Compass supports the storage of the index using a number of 3rd party distribution technologies , but JBoss Cache isn't one of them. I believe it was tried, and abandoned because it just didn't work.
