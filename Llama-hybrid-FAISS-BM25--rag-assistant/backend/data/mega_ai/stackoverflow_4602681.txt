Executables in general contain a code segment and at least one data segment. I guess each of these has a standard minimum size, which may be 8K. And unused space is filled up with zeros. Note also that an EXE written in a higher level (than assembly) language contains some extra stuff on top of the direct translation of your own code and data: startup and termination code (in C and its successors, this handles the input arguments, calls main() , then cleans up after exiting from main() ) stub code and data (e.g. Windows executables contain a small DOS program stub whose only purpose is to display the message "This program is not executable under DOS"). Still, since executables are usually supposed to do something (i.e. their code and data segment(s) do contain useful stuff), and storage is cheap, by default noone optimizes for your case :-) However, I believe most of the compilers have command line parameters with which you can force them to optimize for space - you may want to check the results with that setting. Here is more details on the EXE file formats .
