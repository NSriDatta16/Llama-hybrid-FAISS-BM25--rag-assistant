0xff is an odd choice since it has an implicit assumption that 8 bits is your minimum storage unit. But it's not that uncommon to want to store boolean values more compactly than that. Perhaps you want to rephrase by thinking about whether boolean operators produce something that is just one 0 or 1 bit (which works regardless of sign extension), or is all-zeroes or all-ones (and depends on sign extension of signed two's-complement quantities to maintain all-ones at any length). I think your life is simpler with 0 and 1.
