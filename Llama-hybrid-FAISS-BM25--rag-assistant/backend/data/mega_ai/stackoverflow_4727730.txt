Bubbling events in WPF? Simple Question

This is probably a really easy fix, but I am inexperienced in working with events so I am just going to ask it. I have a ListBox with ListBoxItems in it. These ListBoxItems will be binded to a data source so they will change. I need a MouseDown event to be raised when a MouseDown action is performed on any of these ListBoxItem (because I am doing drag and drop). Since the values are changing, I cannot expect to wire the events together in the XAML like the following Item A Item B Item C This would be easy if I had static values, but since the values in the ListBox will change, I would prefer to write the following XAML //Binded Values Then, when the ListBoxItem is selected, it would Bubble the event up to this MouseDownEventName, and I can grab ListBox1.SelectedItem at that time, the problem is, I am trying this right now, but it is not working. I have the following Code to handle the MouseDown, which is only rewriting label content at the moment to signify that the item has been MouseDown'ed. public partial class UserControl1 : UserControl { public UserControl1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void ListBox_MouseDown(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { ListBox box = (ListBox)sender; if (box != null && box.SelectedItem != null) { DragDrop.DoDragDrop(box, ItemListBox.SelectedItem, DragDropEffects.Move); label1.Content = "MouseDown Event Fired"; } } }
