The main content of a word document is stored in the body element. At the simplest level, paragraphs can be located using Linq queries performed on the document: using(WordprocessingDocument document = WordprocessingDocument.Open(documentStream, true)){ foreach(Paragraph p in document.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body.Descendants ().Where (p => p.InnerText.Equals("SOME TEXT")){ // Do something with the Paragraphs. } } However I would advise that the problem is a little more complicated than this. As under each paragraph there may be more than one Run (essentially a sentence) containing a string of words. It is quite likely that where the user entered the word "SOME TEXT" also contains other runs. But this should be able to point you in the correct direction.
