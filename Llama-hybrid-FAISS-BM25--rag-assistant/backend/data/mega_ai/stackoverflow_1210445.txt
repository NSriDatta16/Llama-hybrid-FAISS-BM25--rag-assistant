Depending on your server load should determine the number of physical layers. The number of logical layers is really more of a personal choice. In our organization we use the CSLA framework . It is a business object framework that strives to make rich, databound UIs simple to use and maintain, while giving flexibility in the data layer. I wont go into too much depth here as it would be better for you to determine for yourself if the framework is worth it for you to use, but needless to say, it has its own SafeDataReader class which accounts for nulls, eliminating the need to use datasets. Its " dataportal " (article is older but still relevant) allows you to easily move the data access to its own layer with very little effort, and no change of code. DNRtv has a few video pod casts in which the designer of CSLA, Rockford Lhotka, shows the workings of the sample application. Part 1 and Part 2 . The shows are only an hour each and can probably help you decide if its the right thing for you to use.
