Which Version Control System would you use for a 1000+ developer organization? Why?

There are many SCM systems out there. Some open, some closed, some free, some quite expensive. Which one (please choose only one) would you use for a 3000+ developer organization with several sites (some behind a very slow link)? Explain why you chose the one you chose. (Give some reasons, not just "because".)
