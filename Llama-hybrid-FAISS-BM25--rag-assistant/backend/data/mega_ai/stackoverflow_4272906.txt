Sharing an object between activities

I have a Weather app with four Activities. The main/launcher activity is 'invisible' using... android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"` ...and is simply used to do a few checks (whether this is a new install, whether a network connection is available etc) before firing off one of the other Activities. The other Activities are UI-oriented - two simply display weather data pulled from a website and the third to provide a location 'picker' so the user can choose which area to show the weather for. However, all four activities make use of a WeatherHelper object which basically does everything from checking for available SD card storage to maintaining preferences and pulling/formatting website pages. So, my question(s)...what is the best way to have one instance of WeatherHelper which can be used by multiple activities and where/how are best to create it in my case? I've been an OO programmer for a lot of years but I'm very new to Android and the design concepts - I've read a lot on the Android Developers site over the past weeks but I've stalled trying to decide on this. Any ideas gratefully received.
