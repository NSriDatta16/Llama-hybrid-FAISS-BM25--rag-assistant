Just for the sake of completeness on Danielle's great answer, there are other paradigms, where one randomly 'spins the wheel' on the weights and / or the type of activations: liquid state machines , extreme learning machines and echo state networks . One way to think about these architectures: the reservoir is a sort of kernel as in SVMs or one large hidden layer in a simple FFNN where the data is projected to some hyperspace. There is no actual learning, the reservoir is re-generated until a satisfying solution is reached. Also see this nice answer .
