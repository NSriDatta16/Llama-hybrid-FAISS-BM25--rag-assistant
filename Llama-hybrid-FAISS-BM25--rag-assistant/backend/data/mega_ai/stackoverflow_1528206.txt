How to load themes from a database in Spring MVC based on user-agent , etc

I am brand new to Spring web MVC. I am trying to create a simple 1 paged site that will check the users browser and display the current theme for that browser. If its a mobile app, I need to allow the user a button to switch to the regular site. Also the current theme for mobile and non-mobile is stored in a database, which includes the start date, end date and the theme name. The theme name is the folder where the theme's resources are located. Being a beginner I have never used themeresolver. Your help is much appreciated.
