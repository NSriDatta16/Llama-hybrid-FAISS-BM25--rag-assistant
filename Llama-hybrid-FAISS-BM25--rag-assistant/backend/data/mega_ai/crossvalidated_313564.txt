How does Bayesian analysis make accurate predictions using subjectively chosen probabilities?

Since Kahneman and Tversky found that humans do not accurately assume probabilities, how can Bayes theorem use subjectively chosen probabilities to accurately predict things (like insurance policies), when given extra data? In other words, humans are often wrong about probabilities, but Bayes theorem still works when using our (prior) estimates. Have I misunderstood things? To clarify the insurance reference, before big datasets were available, American insurers relied on a Bayesian method to calculate insurance premiums, starting with priors that were, for all intents, a best guess. The policies were still fair and profitable. (Edit: I haven't accepted an answer for this question, because there are several answers below which together answer the question.)
