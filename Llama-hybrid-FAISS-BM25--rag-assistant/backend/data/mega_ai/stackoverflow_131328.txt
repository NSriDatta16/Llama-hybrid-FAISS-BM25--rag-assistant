Regarding the specific question: No, deleting hash keys does not reduce your program's memory consumption. Regarding the more general case: The substantial majority of programs and languages will continue to hold on to memory which they have previously used, but are not currently using. This is because requesting the allocation of memory by the operating system is a relatively slow operation, so they keep it in case it's needed again later. So, if you want to improve on this situation, you'll need to reduce the peak amount of memory required by your program, whether by revising your algorithms to not need access to as much data at once, by using on-disk storage (such as the aforementioned DBM::Deep), or by releasing space from unneeded variables back to perl (let them go out of scope or set them to undef ) so that it can be reused.
