Just to add to answer by @NRH. The general idea follows the Goldilocks principal : If the jumps are "too large", then the chain sticks; If the jumps are "too small", then the chain explores the parameter space very slower; We want the jumps to be just right. Of course the question is, what do we mean by "just right". Essentially, for a particular case they minimise the expected square jump distance. This is equivalent to minimising the lag-1 autocorrelations. Recently, Sherlock and Roberts showed that the magic 0.234 holds for other target distributions: C. Sherlock, G. Roberts (2009); Optimal scaling of the random walk Metropolis on elliptically symmetric unimodal targets ; Bernoulli 15(3)
