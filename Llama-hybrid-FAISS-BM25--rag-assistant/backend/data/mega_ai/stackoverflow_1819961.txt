It depends on your motivation for learning the language. If you want to learn a new language to do your day-to-day work more effectively I would suggest Python or Ruby. They are popular languages that are both highly productive to work in, and can be applied to a wide range of programming tasks. As someone else has pointed out there are versions for both the JVM (Jython and JRuby) and for .Net (IronPython & IronRuby) so if you want to learn either of those platforms they are a good way to start. They are also both easy to learn and fun to use. My preference is for Python, but that is probably because I have been using it for many years. If you want to increase your employment options then go with the most popular languages used in business - this means either Java or C#. If you want to expand your mind then I suggest a version of Lisp. I recommend Clojure - it is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM and gives access to all the Java libraries. There is an excellent introductory book in the Pragmatic Programmers' bookshelf.
