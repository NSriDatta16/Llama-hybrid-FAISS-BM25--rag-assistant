Testing Hypothesis with Time series and Location Data

I have Data on Prices of house. Along with these variables. 1) Location i)Latitude-Longitude ii)City and State 2) Attribute of house. i) No. of bedrooms and bathrooms (could be taken as proxy for size?) 3)Year Built and prices of house on the same year. (so basically i have price of house when it was built hence time series data) Now, I want to test the effect of this variables on price individually and combined . What statistics Can be used for such test? Say, have prices increased in last 3-4 years? How exactly I can use the lat-long (since this is more granular than just cities) of data to check whether prices of house are dependent on location? Looking for some suggestions.
