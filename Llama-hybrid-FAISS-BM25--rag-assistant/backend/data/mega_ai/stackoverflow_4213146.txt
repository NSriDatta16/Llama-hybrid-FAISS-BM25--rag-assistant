Magento - Layout

I have studyed http://magebase.com/magento-tutorials/demystifying-magentos-layout-xml-part-1/ , it mention that a type attribute, which defines the block class name. In the code above, catalog/product_compare_sidebar and catalog/product_list should be a block class, so, where is the location of the php file that declared these block(Any hint from "catalog/product_compare_sidebar" and "catalog/product_list")? There are many block type, how can I know which block type is available and how to choose which block type is suitable for the existing block? Thanks you
