I also needed this to work, here is a workaround I found. You need to create a dummy xcode project. Place it in the same folder as your project. Add all your xib files and image files to that xcode project by dragging them in when the project is opened in xcode. Now you will be able to see the preview of the images. The image files must be in the same folder as the project file and xcode must be opened with the dummy project while the interface builder is opened. Not great - but solves the issue for now. Here is a sample project I have created. For this issue to be resolved on the MonoDevelop side - some inter-process communication code needs to be created, I think that a good starting point will be looking for "PBXProjectWatcherServerConnection-3.1.2" in google.
