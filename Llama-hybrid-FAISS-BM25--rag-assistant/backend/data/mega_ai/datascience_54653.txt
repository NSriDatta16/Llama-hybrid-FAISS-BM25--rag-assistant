What I understood from your question is, for your OneVsAll classifiers, is it ok to convert feature set in to binary or not? If this is correct, you should not convert your features into binary. From the shared data set, it seems you have continuous data set and if you convert into binary one, it will become categorical data, which will have different model representation. So according to me you should consume your data as it's. Though you can perform data normalization. Note: Multinominal Logistic Regression works on the similar principal i.e. OneVsAll. So you can try this one as well.
