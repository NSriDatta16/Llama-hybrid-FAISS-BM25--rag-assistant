Is Multiple Correspondence Analysis applicable to Multi-valued Categorical Variables?

I have a data-set containing only Categorical Variables . I needed to do Principal Component Analysis on the data set. Eventually, I found Multiple Correspondence Analysis and learnt it. But, in MCA, it's assumed that, each of the Categorical variable has only one of the levels as True and others as False , i.e an observation can not belong more than 1 category of the same variable. But in my data-set, I have multiple value for a categorical variable. For example, a disease has a set of symptoms, so, symptoms feature is a multi-valued categorical variable, where each of the symptom creates a different level. So for a disease, symptom feature can have multiple levels as true . How do I run PCA/MCA/FAMD on such data-set? Is there any solution to this issue? Thanks a lot for helping.
