I have a "fmt:relDate" tag that gives you Twitter-like relative dates "3 days ago", "less than 30 seconds ago", etc., with the real time as a tooltip. The current implementation is basically a gigantic chain of if/then statements with the boundaries that I like. A binary-search based algorithm would be better (in the sense of "more efficient"), and the current implementation has my personal preferences encoded into it, so I'm reluctant to share the tag.
