There are great number of credit card processing companies out there. Each company has their own api. Do you already have your credit card processing in place and you are receiving the auth code? If you do have your cc processing in place, then you have to look at what data transport mechanisms from your cc processor to magento and Oracle erp have. I would start with their respective data export and import facilities. If you do not have credit card (cc) processing in place, then talk to your bank and existing cc company for your over the counter sales. You could try eBay, but they tend to be a fair bit more expensive than having a direct relationship with your bank. you probably would also want to get advice from your accountant, perhaps see what Google comes up with for your country.
