I use a slight twist on DanHerbert's method. I tend to use the same names for the stylesheets, but I affix a version number in the query string so that the browser sees the files as different whenever one chooses to incriment the version. Things still will get cached, but you can invalidate it at your choosing. It's a bit cleaner than changing filenames and lends itself to being a centrally managed solution, especially in complex apps with lots of scripts and stylesheets coming from the four winds.
