Machine Learning Classification of Changes in a Time Series

I would like to classify the changes in the time series depicted in the figure below—representing an angular position history of a robot about the vertical axis—into increment/decrement of roughly (not necessarily exactly) ±90°/±180° (i.e., four classes; which could also be symbolic). In other words, I aim to detect any change in the angle history, and classify it over time within one of the four numeric categories {-90, +90, -180, +180} (or symbolic categories {up90, down90, up180, down180}). Please note again that I am specifically dealing with classifying the changes in the time series, rather than classifying the entire time series at once. I attempted to use the angle rate-of-change (i.e., angular velocity; figure below: the blue curve is raw and the orange curve is smoothed) to detect any change in the time series, but was not 100 % successful to discriminate between a "+90°" and a "+180°" angle jump for example. Besides, I think I need to use a “sliding window” technique in solving this problem, but don't know how to implement it. Therefore, (1) I was wondering if there is any idea on how to reliably train an ML classification algorithm given this type of data to achieve the stated objective? (2) What should be the input data (features), and (3) how to represent the output data (labels)? A test data is represented by the figure below. Thanks.
