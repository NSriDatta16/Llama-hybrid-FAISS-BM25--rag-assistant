I believe that one of the most accurate ways to calculate that probability is by using agent based simulation. Sketch of approach: I assume you already have access to chess databases with a lot of games between players with various ELO ratings. For instance, you may have 100 games of 1200-1300 ELO players VS 1300-1400 ELO players where in 33 white wins, 33 draws and 34 black wins and so on. This data will be your sampling distribution/dataset. You start by creating your agents: All chess players with their ELO ratings and you start by simulating 1 year of "championship" between them which includes the games that these guys usually play in a normal year. For instance first game, player 30 (1245) vs player 44 (1333) simulate a result from the above dataset: draw then the new ratings are player 30 1247 and player 44 1330 so +3 for player 30 and -3 for player 44. Next game, Carlsen (player 144) vs Caruana (player 145): Draw and so on.. So you repeat the above process for N years (big number) and then you count how many times k the event occurred (how many payers got more than 1000 ELO points). You then divide that k by the number of years N times the number of players n so $k/nN$ this is your probability.
