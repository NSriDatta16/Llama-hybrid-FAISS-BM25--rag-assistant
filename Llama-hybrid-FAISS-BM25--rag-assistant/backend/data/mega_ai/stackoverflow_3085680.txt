Change default text direction in a powerpoint presentation using VBA

I use the Powerpoint Object-Model to programmatically create a presentation in PowerPoint 2007. Some of the computers on which I run my program have PowerPoint set with Hebrew as the Primary Editing Language. (to change the primary language, push the "Office" button, then "Powerpoint options", and go to Popular->Language Settings->Primary Editing Language) On these computers, when I run my program, all the text in the created presentation (wrongly) appears right-justified and the bullets appear to the right of the text. I could fix this by editing the ppt/presentation.xml in the resulting presentation PPTX file. I adjust the Alignment and RightToLeft properties in the "Default Text Styles" for each bullet level. However, XML editing is not a good option for this project. How can I change the default text direction in a presentation using the Object Model (i.e., VBA), besides changing each TextBox individually? Thanks for the suggestions, What I tried: I performed Application.Presentations(1).LayoutDirection = ppDirectionLeftToRight , which changes the direction of the PowerPoint user-interface. I also changed Application.Presentations(1).LanguageID to US English. Unfortunately, doing these things did not solve the problem of the right-to-left text in the created presentation. So finally I gave up on changing the parameters for the Presentation itself and indeed directly changed ParagraphFormat.TextDirection and ParagraphFormat.Alignment for each Run of each TextBox which I initially tried to avoid, and naturally this had the desired effect.
