Creating a single index from several principal components or factors retained from PCA/FA

I am using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create an index required for my research. My question is how I should create a single index by using the retained principal components calculated through PCA. For instance, I decided to retain 3 principal components after using PCA and I computed scores for these 3 principal components. What is the appropriate ways to create, for each respondent, a single index out of these 3 scores? Is it relevant to add the 3 computed scores to have a composite value? Or to average the 3 scores to have such a value? Or should I just keep the first principal component (the strongest) only and use its score as the index? Alternatively, one could use Factor Analysis (FA) but the same question remains: how to create a single index based on several factor scores?
