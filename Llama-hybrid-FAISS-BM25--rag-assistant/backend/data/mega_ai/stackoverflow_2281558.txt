Maven is language agnostic and it should be possible to use it with other languages than Java, including C#. For example, the Maven Compiler Plugin can be configured to use the csharp compiler. There is also a .NET Maven plugin and there was a maven-csharp on javaforge.com (seems dead). But Java is getting most attention and man power and there is not much done with other languages. So, while using Maven with C# is in theory possible, I wouldn't expect much support and feedback from the community (i.e. in case of problem, you'll be alone). I don't know if using Maven for C# would thus be a good idea. I wouldn't recommend it actually (I may be wrong of course).
