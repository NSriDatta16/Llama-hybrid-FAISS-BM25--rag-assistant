Magento Checkout success page product price and SKU retrival

I want to add Commission junction to my client site, in that they asked for each product sku's and price. After the confirmation page/ success page only we need to pass thes values. But here how i can get all the product details. Including sku, price i need to pass. Is there any way to get each product details separately. Thanks Suresh
