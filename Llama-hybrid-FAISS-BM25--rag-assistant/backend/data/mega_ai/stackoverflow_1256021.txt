My main reasons for putting code into different modules: Separation of concerns : I feel that it is easier to limit the knowledge about the internals of classes on different levels or with different tasks if they are organized into separate modules. It simply feels more "dirty" to rely on internals if they are well hidden. Easier to maintain smaller components : I usually find the development environment to be more responsive if I am working on a project with fewer code files, than if the project contains hundreds and hundreds of files. Prevention of namespace clashes : When properly modularised, e.g. using namespaces in Java, you can have the same function name for the same functionality without having to worry that the printout() function in the Foo component will clash with the printout() function in the Bar component. Separation of security concerns : It is easier to minimise the potential damage when one component steps on the toes of another component. Depending on the technology being used you can limit where each module can play in memory.
