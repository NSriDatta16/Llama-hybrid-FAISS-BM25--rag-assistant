Random Forest for Regression: How does a decision tree decides the value of a terminal node when outcome is many continues values?

Ok, I spent almost most of my day trying to figure this out. I drew the picture below on my board(it can be seen better in zoom in) to have a better view on how a decision tree was taking its decision when working with continuous attributes from a homes' pricing dataset. Now, I can't figure out if at the leaf/terminal node, is the tree suppose to give me the average price(target data) from all the rows within the specific branch path/conditions? And so if in fact, this is the case, let say I am building a forest with ten trees, wouldn't my other trees do the same as the first tree. I have been finding a lot of examples, but most of them are for classification rather than regression. Thank you for the help!
