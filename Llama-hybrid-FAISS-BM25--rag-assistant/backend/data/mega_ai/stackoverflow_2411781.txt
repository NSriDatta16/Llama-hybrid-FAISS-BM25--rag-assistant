Is there any disadvantage to using only high resolution image resources for an Android application?

The Android documentation says that best practices are to make two drawable directories - one for HDPI and one for MDPI. It also says that if the MDPI directory doesn't exist and a MDPI device is running the app, it will scale down the HDPI ones so everything looks good. Is there any reason not to just make one high resolution set of graphics? One con that I can think of is performance issues and one pro I can think of is only having one set of images for your app.
