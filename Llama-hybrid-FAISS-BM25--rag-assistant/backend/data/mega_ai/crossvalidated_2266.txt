The "true" expected value cannot be calculated. You can estimate it using the mean of the ratings for each product, and get an idea about the position by calculating the 95% confidence interval (CI) on the mean. This is done by $CI \approx avg \pm 2 * \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$ with n being the number of ratings, SD the standard deviation and avg the average. More correct would be to use the T-distribution, where you use the 2.5% and 97.5% quantile of the T-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to number of observations minus one. $CI = avg \pm T_{(p=0.975,df=n-1)} * \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$ For 10 ratings, $T_{(p=0.975,df=n-1)}$ is 2.26. For 50 ratings, it is 2.01. There's a chance of 95% this confidence interval contains the true value. Or, to please NÃ¨stor: if you do this experiment 10,000 times, 95% of the confidence intervals you construct this way will contain the true value for the expected value. You assume here that the distribution of the average is normal. If you have a very low amount of ratings, the SD can be estimated wrongly. In that case, you could estimate an "overall" standard deviation on the scoring, and use that to calculate the CI. But keep in mind that this way you assume that the standard deviation is the same for every product. In extremis, you could resort to bootstrapping to calculate the CI for every product. This will increase the calculation time substantially, and won't be adding any value for products with enough ratings.
