Which model for my data?

I have this data: Group Time Size A 1 0.56 A 2 0.97 A 3 1.33 A 4 1.75 B 1 0.12 B 2 0.24 B 3 0.31 B 4 0.47 B 5 0.51 B 6 0.69 B 7 0.73 B 8 0.85 C 1 0.16 C 2 0.23 C 3 0.38 C 4 0.49 C 5 0.53 C 6 0.66 C 7 0.78 C 8 0.81 Here is the respective plot: Now I would like to test the three groups for differences in slope and intercept. I cannot use simple linear regression since these are time series and the data points are not independent of each other. Here are the additional tests I performed on the linar model: Data = read.table(textConnection(Input),header=TRUE) model = lm(Size ~ Time + Group,data = Data) Shapiro-Wilk test for normality: shapiro.test(residuals(model)) p=0.001288 (not normally distributed) Breusch-Pagan test for equal variances: bptest(model) p=0.016 (variances not equal) Since residuals are not normally distributed and variances are not equal an ANOVA (for example) could not be performed. Furthermore, the residuals are auto-correlated according to the Durbin-Watson test: dwtest(model) p=0.001065 (data points auto-correlated) Which model would be suitable for my problem (probably a multilevel linear model?) and which R packages I could use for the analysis? Another data set: Input = (" Group Time Size A 1 1.08152 A 2 1.10589 A 3 1.13292 B 1 1.04597 B 2 1.05763 B 3 1.07023 B 4 1.08612 B 5 1.10059 B 6 1.11589 B 7 1.13143 B 8 1.14741 B 9 1.16721 B 10 1.18288 C 1 1.04777 C 2 1.06145 C 3 1.07484 C 4 1.08908 C 5 1.10346 C 6 1.11866 C 7 1.13375 C 8 1.14931 C 9 1.16563 C 10 1.18294 ") dat = read.table(textConnection(Input),header=TRUE)
