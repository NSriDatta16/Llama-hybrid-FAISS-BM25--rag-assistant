Google Apps - Email Storage Amount - Special Number?

http://www.google.com/apps/ 25GB email storage per user but in the footnote it says: 7.527493 GB of email storage per account It seems a bit precise. What's special about that number that I'm not seeing? I thought maybe it's a phone number (752-749-3000) but no answer.
