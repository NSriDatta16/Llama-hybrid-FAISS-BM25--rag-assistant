In my experience to have a PhD doesn't mean necessarily be good in the enviroment of data science company, I work as data scientist and I'm just an engineer but I've known some universitary teachers who works in collaboration with my company and sometimes I've said them that Their point of view was not right because despite of their ideas and reasonings were right they are not applicables to the company activities, so we had to modify some data models to make them usefull for the company and the results lost their value so we had to seek new models. What I mean is that Data Science is a multidisciplinar area so many different people working together is needed so I think that your skills could be very useful in a data scientist team, you only have to find where you fit ;)
