How to reveal specific relationship using tSNE?

I’ve been using tSNE in attempts of finding and visualising some relationships in my data. I came to a following problem. If my data is say 1000 points, and I want to know about some relations between 10 particular points (I want to know how close are they to each other and other points of my data), tSNE won’t give much attention to them, as 10 is much smaller than 1000. My idea is to sample a uniform ball with radius R of say 20 points around each of 10 target points, and hence attract tSNE attention to that enlarged thing. If we can find R such that after tSNE we will see a cluster, consisting 10 target points, sampled points and not to many other points from a dataset, we can assume that target points in initial dataset were close. Do you know, has anybody elaborated on such topic for similar problems, and where can I read about it.
