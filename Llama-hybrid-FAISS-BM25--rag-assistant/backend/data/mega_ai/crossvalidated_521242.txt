How to handle imbalanced covariate (Gender) in logistic regression classification model?

I have classification model with OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) status as dependent variable and a continuous biomarker as independent variable, adjusting for BMI and Age . I get the following result. Call: glm(formula = OSAclass ~ ANGPTL7 + BMI + AgeSurgery, family = binomial, data = d) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7803 -0.8112 -0.6614 1.0924 2.0289 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -6.0448112 1.9004997 -3.181 0.00147 ** ANGPTL7 0.0003061 0.0001445 2.119 0.03410 * BMI 0.0693494 0.0329811 2.103 0.03549 * AgeSurgery 0.0409950 0.0179479 2.284 0.02237 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 156.72 on 124 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 143.14 on 121 degrees of freedom (9 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 151.14 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 But when I add Gender to the model. I lose the significance of ANGPTL7 . Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -7.2699222 2.0282067 -3.584 0.000338 *** ANGPTL7 0.0002434 0.0001493 1.630 0.103020 BMI 0.0903125 0.0351067 2.573 0.010096 * GenderMale 1.6716022 0.6147563 2.719 0.006545 ** AgeSurgery 0.0443312 0.0186087 2.382 0.017205 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 I tried the model with Gender == Male and Gender == Female separately. Still the ANGPTL7 is not significant. Following is the proportion of Male and Female in the sample. Non-OSA OSA Male 6 11 Female 85 33 Is the losing statistical significance of ANGPTL7 in the model because of adjusting with imbalanced covariate (Gender)? Can someone please help me how to understand these results?
