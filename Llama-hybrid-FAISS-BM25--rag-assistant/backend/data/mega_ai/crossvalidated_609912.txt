From the description in a comment: between each timepoints (ex: Ja2015 - Jul2016) I have ~200 individuals experiencing a change in area (growth rates), new individuals showing up in the population (recruitment events; binomial), and individuals found in previous timepoints have disappeared and are no longer present (mortality; binomial) it seems that you have data on individuals all evaluated at the same points in time while they are alive. That's a type of panel data. (If each individual can have its own observation-time intervals then you might need more sophisticated methods to handle the interval censoring.) In terms of survival per se , you have a setup for a fairly standard discrete-time survival model. You format the data such that you have, for each time interval, one row of data for each individual who was at risk of death at the start of the interval. That long data format simplifies analysis. Each row can contain the calendar start date of the interval to handle chronological time as a predictor, the duration of the interval to handle the different durations of intervals, and values during the interval for covariates like "heat wave present" (or maybe even better, some continuous measure of heat stress). I don't know enough about corals to say for certain, but I suspect that you might need to include an individual's age at the start of each time period as a covariate, or maybe maybe its size as a proxy for that. The event/outcome binary marker for each individual and time interval is set to 1 if the individual died during the time interval, to 0 otherwise. That 0 outcome value also is used for an individual lost to follow up for reasons other than death during an observation period ("right censoring" in survival analysis). This data format also allows you to include an individual newly born or otherwise added to the study, for time intervals starting with the first time the individual is observed. Then you do a binomial regression over the entire data set with appropriately modeled covariates (calendar date, duration of observation interval, age, size, environmental variables...). A logistic regression is one way to do this, but a complementary log-log link instead of the logit link used for logistic regression is more closely related to proportional-hazards survival models. You might model births with a Poisson or other regression model for counts; with the default log link, you would include the log-duration of each time interval as an offset to account for the differences in duration of observation intervals.
