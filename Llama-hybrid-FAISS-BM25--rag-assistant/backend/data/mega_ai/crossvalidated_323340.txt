Is there any kind of SVM or other linear models can be applied to such sceneryï¼Ÿ

Consider that I have only several positive samples, say 4 or 5, and a big amount of negative samples. I want to find a hyperline can exactly seperate the positive samples and negative samples if the training data is linear separable and if it is not, I want a hyperline that mis-separate the training data as little as possible. Only negative samples are allowed to be mis-separated, which means all positive samples should be in the same side of the hyperline. One thing to notice, we only consider linear models, which means we don't utlize any non-linear methods such us kernel methods. Still, there is a close-world assumption, which indicates that we will not meet any new sample besides training samples.
