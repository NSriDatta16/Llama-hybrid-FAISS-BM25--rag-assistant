JDBC, MySQL: getting back row data from PreparedStatement executes

I'm using the following setup: public MySQLProcessWriter(Connection con) throws SQLException { String returnNames[] = {"processId","length","vertices"}; addresser = con.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO addressbook (length, vertices, activity) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", returnNames); } processId corresponds to an auto-incrementing column in the addressbook table. So the idea is: I have a repeated insert, I get back some of what was inserted + the auto-generated processId. However, I'm getting a "column not found" SQLException when I attempt to addresser.getGeneratedKeys().getInt("processId"); after executing the prepared statement (after the appropriate setting of values). The code for that is addresser.setInt(1, length); addresser.setInt(2, vertices); addresser.setDouble(3, activity); addresser.executeUpdate(); int processId = addresser.getGeneratedKeys().getInt("processId"); inside a loop that is updating length, vertices, activity. So...what gives? Am I misunderstanding what the prepareStatement(sqlstring, string[]) method does?
