How to construct a reasonable prior and likelihood for Bayes modelling?

To apply Bayes inference for data analysis or machine learning, we have to construct prior and likelihood , right? But if I fail to come up with a reasonable prior and likelihood , then the Bayes model will not be meaningful, right? I wonder is there any technique could be utilized to construct reasonable Bayes models? Let me make it concrete by an example, given a dataest with features $X$ and target $y$, where $y=\{0,1\}$ and $X$ is composed of $p$ variables. This is an ordinary binary classification problem, to do Bayes inference, what and how should I specify for the prior and likelihood? One more question, if we could not specify a reasonable prior, then what's the point of using Bayes modelling?
