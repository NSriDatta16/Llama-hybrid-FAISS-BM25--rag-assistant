Notable changes when modeling unevenly univariate spaced time series as an evenly spaced multivariate time series?

When attempting to model univariate data (although, this could easily be extended to the multivariate case) that is unevenly spaced over time, a natural approach to be able to apply common time series methods would be to treat time as another variable to be modeled so that each observation is then a pair of a unix timestamp and a data value, both indexed by some sort of event time (say, the natural numbers: $0, 1, \dots$ ). Aside from the change that we are now modeling two variables observed over "event time" which comes with the complications of modeling two variables, are there any other notable changes/problems/biases being introduced by this reframing?/are there methods for unevenly spaced time series that lend themselves more easily to this situation than changing to "event time"?
