You appear (by eyeballing the data) to have some periodicity in the data, I would suggest before looking for significance, to do some ARIMA or similar analysis on the time series data. It appears there might be a 2 weekly cycle in your data. Your extreme point in January may just be a higher value of the 2 weekly cycle 'process'. Following this, what is the distribution of the data values? $chi$-$squared$? It would be worth knowing that as it might inform some of your analytic choices going forward. Without access to the data to analyse, I find it hard to say for sure, but you could try applying the Central Limit Theorem which would hopefully transform the data towards normality, then I would suggest leveraging some of the $6$-$sigma$ methodologies - perhaps also Shewhart boxplots, this will show you which of your points are statistically different values.
