wpf resize complete

So I need to procedurally generate a background image for a grid, it only takes .1sec. So I can wire into the SizeChanged event, but then when you resize the chart, it goes and fires the event maybe 30 times a second, so the resize event lags out signifigantly. Does anybody know a good way to wire into the resize event and test weather the use is done resizing, I tried simply checking for the mouse up/down state, but when the resize event fires the mouse is pretty much always down.
