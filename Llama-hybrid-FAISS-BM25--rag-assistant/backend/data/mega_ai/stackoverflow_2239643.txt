Lisp, a couple of questions about lists and recursion

sorry to overflow with so many questions. I have the following: (defun recursive-function (string) "returns list of strings" ;I am trying to return flat list ; create list L (append (mapcar 'recursive-function L))) But since recursive-function returns a list, I end up with a list of a list of a list..., whereas I want just a flat list. What is the proper way for me to implement recursion on functions which take a scalar and return a list of scalars? Thanks.
