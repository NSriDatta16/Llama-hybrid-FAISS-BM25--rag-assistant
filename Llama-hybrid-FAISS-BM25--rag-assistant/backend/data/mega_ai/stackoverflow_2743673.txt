mkdir error in bash script

The following is a fragment of a bash script that I'm running under cygwin on Windows: deployDir=/cygdrive/c/Temp/deploy timestamp=`date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S` deployDir=${deployDir}/$timestamp if [ ! -d "$deployDir" ]; then echo "making dir $deployDir" mkdir -p $deployDir fi This produces output such as: making dir /cygdrive/c/Temp/deploy/2010-04-30_11:47:58 mkdir: missing operand Try `mkdir --help' for more information. However, if I type /cygdrive/c/Temp/deploy/2010-04-30_11:47:58 on the command-line it succeeds, why does the same command not work in the script? Thanks, Don
