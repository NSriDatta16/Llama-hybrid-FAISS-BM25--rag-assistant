Consider: >>> nums = ((1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 5, 6), (19, 20, 24, 29, 400)) >>> flat = [[(x - i) for i, x in enumerate(tu)] for tu in nums] >>> print flat [[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 4, 4], [19, 19, 22, 26, 396]] >>> import itertools >>> print sum(1 for tu in flat for _ in itertools.groupby(tu)) 7 >>> we "flatten" the "increasing ramps" of interest by subtracting the index from the value, turning them into consecutive "runs" of identical values; then we identify and could the "runs" with the precious itertools.groupby . This seems to be a pretty elegant (and speedy) solution to your problem.
