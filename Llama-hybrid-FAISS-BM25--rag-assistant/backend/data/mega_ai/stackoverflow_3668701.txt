Why can't I connect the File's Owner to new Views in iOS SDK?

I am working on an iPhone SDK project using Xcode 4 Preview. I am in the IFB view and have deleted the default view icon and brought in two new views which I have named Portrait and Landscape. I should be able to control drag from the File's Owner to the two views to connect them, but the usual HUD does not appear and I cannot connect them. There is no code relevant to this task so I can't share that and a screenshot would be meaningless. I would appreciate any assistance on getting them to connect. thanks!
