Sounds like a PYTHONPATH problem. Try changing the code to this and see what happens: import sys print "Content-type: text/html\n\n" try: print sys.path import feedparser except: print "Cannot import feedparser.\n" print sys.path This probably will show that your ~/httpdocs/python-libraries/ directory is not in the path and you will need to either change sys.path or arrage for a PYTHONPATH environment variable, to correct the problem. When you change the path, make sure that you use the full directory name, not the ~ shortcut.
