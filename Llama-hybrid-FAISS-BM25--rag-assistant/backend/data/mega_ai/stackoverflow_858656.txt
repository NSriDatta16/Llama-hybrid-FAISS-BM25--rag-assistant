Java polymorphism confusion

The question below is from Java SCJP5 book by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates. Given a method declared as: public static List process(List nums) A programmer wants to use the method like this: // INSERT DECLARATIONS HERE output = process(input); Which pair of declarations could be placed at // INSERT DECLARATIONS HERE to allow the code to compile? (Choose all that apply.) A. ArrayList input = null; ArrayList output = null; B. ArrayList input = null; List output = null; C. ArrayList input = null; List output = null; D. List input = null; ArrayList output = null; E. List input = null; List output = null; F. List input = null; List output = null; G. None of the above. Correct Answers given are: B, E, F and the explanation in the book states: "The return type is definitely declared as List, NOT ArrayList so A,D are wrong. ......" This is what I don't get...why it is that the return type MUST be List only and not ArrayList?? Just like the argument can be ArrayList then why cant return type also be arrayList? Thanks
