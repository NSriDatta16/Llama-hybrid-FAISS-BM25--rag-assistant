Using correlation between predictors is not nearly as informative as the variance inflation factors (VIFs) or the condition number (ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue, $\sqrt{\lambda_{\max}/\lambda_{\min}})$ of the inverted Hessian matrix, $(\mathbf{X}^{\textsf{T}}\mathbf{X})^{-1}$ or $\left[\partial^2 \cal{l}(\boldsymbol{\beta})/\partial \beta_j \partial \beta_k \right]^{-1}$ ), to determine whether multicollinearity is present among predictors. (Yes, VIFs can be run for predictors of logistic regression, since they're derived from regressing each predictor on the remaining predictors -- has nothing to do with the dependent variable) . I have seen very bad ill-conditioned logistic regression models with between-predictor correlation of $|r| , i.e., not perfect ( $|r|=1$ ), with VIFs $\gg10$ - indicating severe multicollinearity. Thus, hunting down perfect correlation ( $|r|=1)$ won't help because extreme multicollinarity can occur with $|r| . You need to determine VIFs or look at the condition number of the inverted Hessian.
