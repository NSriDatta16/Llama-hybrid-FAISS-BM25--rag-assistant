hypothesis test_ determine null and alternative

What is the most suitable null and alternative hypothesis for following problem? It is believed that the average level of Prothrombin in a normal population s 20 mg/100 ml of blood plasma with a standard deviation of 4 mg /100 ml. To verify this, a sample is taken from 40 individuals in whom the average is 18.5 mg/100 ml. My answer is H0:average level of prothombrin in a normal population = 20mg/100ml H1:average level of prothombrin in a normal population != 20mg/100ml but in the answer sheet they have stated as follows H0:sample is not taken from 40 individuals in whom the average is 18.5 mg/100 ml. H1:sample is taken from 40 individuals in whom the average is 18.5 mg/100 ml. is my answer incorrect? How do we determine the exact null and alternative hypothesis for given problem?
