The results are not inconsistent. The models are answering different questions. lm fits a linear model, so the estimate for QM is the overall (linear) slope, taking no account of clustering - ie, that observations within each subject may be more alike one another. On the other hand, lme fits a linear mixed effects model, in particular a random intercepts model in your case, where the QM estimate is an "average" of the slopes for QM within each subject. So if the association at the group level is markedly different to the overall association, you will get different results, which is an example of Simpson's Paradox (the grouping variable confounds the association). A simple simulation shows this: We create 3 groups of data, all with a negative slope, and plot them, along with regression lines for each one set.seed(123) n It is clear from the figure that if we aggregate the data, the overall regression line slope will be positive, as we can easily demonstrate: > dt dt$grp summary(m0 |t|) (Intercept) 1.06688 0.64787 1.647 0.105 X 0.71873 0.02927 24.554 But if we fit a mixed model, we get the average slope, which is obviously negative (along with a random intercepts estimate): Linear mixed-effects model fit by REML Data: dt AIC BIC logLik 178.8397 187.0815 -85.41987 Random effects: Formula: ~1 | grp (Intercept) Residual StdDev: 9.906642 0.8493246 Fixed effects: Y ~ X Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value (Intercept) 19.908660 5.853642 56 3.401072 0.0012 X -0.204189 0.060771 56 -3.359980 0.0014
