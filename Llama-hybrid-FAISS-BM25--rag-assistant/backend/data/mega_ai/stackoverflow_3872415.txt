.net html to image with managed code

I have service which converts HTML to image and sends back. At present I am using WebBrowser control to do that. But it is far from perfect. During peak hours service crashes or gives Null reference exception. Also it is not lightweight on memory. I looking for lightweight managed option to this job. Kindly let me know for any open source project or for any other managed control which will do this job. Update: I have very simple HTML to render. It is only with table, paragraph and stylesheet for font and background-color. There is not Javascript, element float or other complex layout.
