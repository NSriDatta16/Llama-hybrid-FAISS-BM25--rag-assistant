I've come up with a solution using my original structure... That is, the VBA application calls a COM wrapper application that translates all of the types from .Net to COM safe types. This wrapper then calls the main service using .net remoting. The problem I was having was that the common dlls between the wrapper and the service needed to be in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12 folder (along side msaccess.exe). While I was using the AssemblyResolve method to provide the dlls at runtime, this wasn't working...So for now I'll just have to have the dlls copied to the folder - a far from elegant solution, but at least the communication is working for now.
