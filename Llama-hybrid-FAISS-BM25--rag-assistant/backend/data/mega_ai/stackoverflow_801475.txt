SQL design and / or PHP class for storing dynamic two-dimensional arrays?

I need an elegant way to store dynamic arrays (basically spreadsheets without all the functionality) of various sizes (both x and y), mostly being used as ENUMs, lists, lookup data, price sheets, that sort of thing. Multi-lingual would be a great bonus. Speed of the essence. Here's an example of a typical "sheet" ; | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 ------------------------------- model A | 2$ | 5$ | 8$ | 10$ model B | 3$ | 6$ | 9$ | 12$ model C | 4$ | 8$ | 10$ | 13$ So, to get info, I would do ; $price = this_thing_im_after ( '3', 'model B' ) ; echo $price ; // Prints '9$' I'm in the PHP5 and Zend Framework world, but thoughts on design and SQL is just as dandy, even suggestions on and from the outside world, libs, extensions, etc. as I don't want to reinvent too much of the wheel. I need the backend stuff the most, and I'll write a GUI for dynamic sheets later. Thoughts, ideas, pointers? Just an edit to point out that I'd prefer not to serialize and blob the data as I would like to query the indeces and sheets, perhaps even the data (or type for those who support such, now that would be awsome!) if I'm in a crazy mood. But again, this is not a breaker for me; if someone has a nice library or class for serializing in and out quickly out of a database with some simple querying, I'm all happy.
