Is there an elegant way to track the modification of all columns of one table in SQL Server 2008

There is a table in my database containing 100 columns. I want to create a trigger to audit the modification for every update operation. What I can think is to create the update clause for all columns but they are all similar scripts. So is there any elegant way to do that?
