Having just gone through this and looking for the best ways to learn ruby and rails I found the following most useful: http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails (covers Rails 3) I found this a good starting place to go through the basics of rails and while reading this I was able to follow along and build the application. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/ Instead of building an application you get the vertical view of rails - i.e., sections to understand models, caching, views, layouts, etc. This is a great resource to follow along and read the sections you are dealing with. http://www.railscasts.com As you come across something you need to implement - e.g., many to many relationships this site provides some great examples and walkthroughs. As a C# developer you may be slightly confused by Ruby. Here are the sites I recommend for learning Ruby: http://www.fincher.org/tips/Languages/Ruby/ Although not formatted great - I found this one very useful to get the gist of Ruby syntax. http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/ Another great easy to follow tutorial Lastly just try out some code. Good luck!
