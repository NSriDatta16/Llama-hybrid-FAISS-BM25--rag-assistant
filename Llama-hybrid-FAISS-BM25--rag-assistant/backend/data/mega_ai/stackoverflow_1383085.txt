How to effectively collect information for a company?

Please feel free to move this to meta/superuser if this is the wrong place. But this is a developer related question. I have a smallish company with about 10 employees (developers). Often when I am browsing the internet, I come across various techniques and methods which I would like to share with them. Now one way is to simply point them to those links, but that's not too effective as sometimes the link dies, our connectivity is down, people may want to add some comments/thoughts etc. I am wondering what is the best way to organize all this data. Couple of questions: Should I use a SO clone? Wiki? Digg clone? Personally I dont want to use a wiki. I find it to be a pain to create links manually. I just want to post stuff and links and select an appropriate category and people can then view and comment etc. How to get everyone involved in this process? SO does it well by giving points to users. How does your company manage information? Thank you for your time.
