In GANs, there are two networks. The first network generates fake data. The second network is shown examples of both real data and fake data generated by the first network. Its goal is to determine whether its input is real or fake. The second network is trained to better distinguish real from fake data, and the first network is trained to produce fake data that better fools the second network. The overall training procedure amounts to a competition between the two networks, which is why the model is called 'adversarial'. An equilibrium point of this competition occurs if the first network learns to perfectly model the 'true' distribution, at which point the second network can do no better than chance.
