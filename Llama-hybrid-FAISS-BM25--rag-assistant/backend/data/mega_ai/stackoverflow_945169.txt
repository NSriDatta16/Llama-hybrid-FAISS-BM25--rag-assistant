No Sql Server analyzes both the indexes and the statistics before deciding to use an index to speed up a query. It is entirely possible that running a non-indexed version is faster than an indexed version. A few things to try ensure the indexes are created and rebuilt, and re-organized (defragmented). ensure that the auto create statistics is turned on. Try using Sql Profiler to capture a tuning profile and then using the Database Engine Tuning Advisor to create your indexes. Surprisingly the MS Press Examination book for Sql administration explains indexes and statistics pretty well. See Chapter 4 table of contents in this amazon reader preview of the book Amazon Reader of Sql 2008 MCTS Exam Book
