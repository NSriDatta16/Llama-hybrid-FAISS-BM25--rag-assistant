How to consolidate / aggregate an array with a timestamp as one of these columns

In PHP, I have an array : [ // 'Timestamp' => 'data', '1296001511 ' => '2', '1295994311' => '25', '1295965511' => '34', '1295958311' => '32', '1295871911' => '31', etc. ] In order to use these data in a chart I need to reduce the number of data by aggregating / consolidating these. I'd like to keep just one value per day. In case of multiple value for one day I'd like to use an average or median value. Difficult point : I don't have the same number of data for each day, the data set is not regular. If it's easier I can work with SQL queries (the data is stored in a MySQL database)
