Are all Machine Learning algorithms divided into Classification and Regression, not just supervised learning?

I'm newbie in AI I know that Supervised Learning algorithms are divided into Classification and Regression algorithms. But is that true of all machine learning algorithms, not just Supervised Learning? Are there any other categories than Classification and Regression?
