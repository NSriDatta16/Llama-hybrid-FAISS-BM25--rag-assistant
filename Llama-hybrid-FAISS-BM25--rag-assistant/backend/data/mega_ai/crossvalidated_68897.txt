The detailed derivations of the equations for the conditional distribution of a Gaussian process can be found in chapter 2 and appendix A of the book [Rasmussen2005]. Take a look at (Eq. 2.23, 2.24) and above, which are based on the Gaussian identities (A.6) and the matrix property (A.11). [Rasmussen2005] C. E. Rasmussen and C. Williams. Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning . MIT Press, 2005.
