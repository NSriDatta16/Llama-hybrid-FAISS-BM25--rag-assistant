Time Series Analysis - ARIMA

I am trying to make sales prediction from time series data. After performing a log transformation to the original data and differencing it by 1, I got a stationary dataset. So I plotted ACF and PACF graphs. ACF graph: PACF graph: Does this mean I should use ARIMA(0,1,0) to perform time series analysis? Also, if I got the value of p,d and q, do I use the original data to perform ARIMA model? For example, ARIMA(original_data, order=(0,1,0))?
