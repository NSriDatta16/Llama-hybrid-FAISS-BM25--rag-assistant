I have developed two data intensive applications in Silverlight. One began as a SL2-B2 app and shipped in SL2 and the other is a SL3 app. From a data-intensive app standpoint, there is really no difference between the mac and the PC. I have had some rendering/performance issues on the mac though - nothing that made me regret using SL. (you can look at my other questions to see the silverlight cpu usage question) There are a lot of things that you will find very valuable for a data-intensive application when using SL (many of which I believe are impossible in more traditional web languages): Isolated storage - you can store large datasets locally, encrypted if you please. Mutli-Threaded execution - you can process data in parallel and take full advantage of multiple-core cpus (combined with #1 you can a lot of things not possible before) Binary encoding (if using WCF as your service) - this creates a lot of server side efficiency in transferring the data (though I guess this could be replicated with other technologies, but it is free with SL3 and WCF) Use of local GPU acceleration for rendering. If you data-intensive app produces complex visualizations, this can provide a big boost A common interchangeable language for both client and server side. We share a lot of code on both sides. We compute results on the client side using EXACTLY the same chunks of code that we use on the server side. (right now we "link" the code files into SL and regular .net assemblies, with .net 4 we can share libraries) - this produces a lot of programming and testing efficiencies. Also - someone commented above to "just write native apps" - I have updated my apps in place literally hundreds of times - all transparent to the end users. Writing the native apps is not really the problems in my experience, it is deploying them, updating them, etc. SL makes this extremely easy if not automatic. I tell folks all the time who try to position SL vs. Flash ot SL vs. HTML - to me the real difference is SL vs. (the entire native app, native installer, update experience). Good luck. Let us know how it turns out. BTW: I do all of my development on a Mac Pro running Win7 in VMWare Fusion.
