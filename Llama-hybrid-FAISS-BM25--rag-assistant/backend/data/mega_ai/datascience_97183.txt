Using STL(Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) for Anomaly detection

I am using STL to decompose my time series data in Season, trend and residual and then by applying this(see below) on residual. I am detecting the anomaly resid_mu = resid.mean() resid_dev = resid.std() //anything outside lower and upper limit is anamoly lower = resid_mu - 3*resid_dev upper = resid_mu + 3*resid_dev If I do this on 1 year of data it is giving a good result but now if I get new data say for 1 new day how can I use older decomposition data so that I have to process for 1 day only and not for 1 year+1 day.
