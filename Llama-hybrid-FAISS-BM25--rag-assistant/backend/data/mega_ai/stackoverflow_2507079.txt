Not cross-platform, no, but most browsers support this out of the box. At least Firefox and IE do this no problem on Windows: When you drag-and-drop a link, a .lnk file is created on the desktop. I assume it's the same for Mac. For Linux, I don't know but I could imagine this works with the more modern graphical desktops as well. There is no way to reliably enforce this across browsers, see this question (answered by yours truly) Try it out!
