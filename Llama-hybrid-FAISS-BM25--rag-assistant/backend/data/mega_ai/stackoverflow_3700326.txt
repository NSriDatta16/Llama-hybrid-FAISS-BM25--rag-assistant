Decode & back to & in JavaScript

I have strings like var str = 'One &amp; two &amp; three'; rendered into HTML by the web server. I need to transform those strings into 'One & two & three' Currently, that's what I am doing (with help of jQuery): $(document.createElement('div')).html('{{ driver.person.name }}').text() However I have an unsettling feeling that I am doing it wrong. I have tried unescape("&amp;") but it doesn't seem to work, neither do decodeURI/decodeURIComponent. Are there any other, more native and elegant ways of doing so?
