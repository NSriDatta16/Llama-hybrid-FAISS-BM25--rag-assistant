Embed Javascript Module within Flex application

I have a large module written in JS which uses Canvas to draw and animate trees. This module was written for a product which is now being migrated to flex. Is there a way in flex to embed this JS module as is? Or would I have to rewrite the whole module in AS3 (shudder)? Further, if embedding is possible, would user interactions (mouse clicks) etc. work seamlessly? An example of the tree structure I am talking about can be found here - http://thejit.org
