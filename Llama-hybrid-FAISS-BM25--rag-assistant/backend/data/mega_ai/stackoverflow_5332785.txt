Generating CRUD with entity framework (like DataSets can)

I added am edmx file and a table to my project. How can I get it to generate CRUD operations? I did this in the past where it generated them as stored procs, but cant find the option on the table properties. What did I do wrong? UPDATE After fiddling about, I discovered I am confusing my tools. With a DataSet.xsd I can drag a table onto the Dataset Designer and click the *TableName*TableAdapter. If you view the properties window you will see "DeleteCommand, InsertCommand, SelectCommand, UpdateCommand". Is there a way to accomplish this task with Entity Framework too? (If you have any trouble seeing this you can right click the table in dataset designer > Configure > Advanced options > check "Generate Insert, Update and Delete statements".
