Everything I have read in this question screams "security vulnerability exploit". Since it's one of the main things hosting companies are making sure doesn't happen, I would say your chances are very slim to have that work. However, if it's a web server, with something like CGI or PHP enabled, you could leverage that by uploading a CGI or PHP script in a place it can be run, and then calling it through a browser, thus doing whatever file manipulations you need... Things like safe mode, reserved or virtual directories could get in the way, but I think there is a better chance of that working.
