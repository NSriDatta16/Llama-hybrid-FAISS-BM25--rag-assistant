Is hierarchical regression appropriate for running a regression using multilevel dependent variable?

I have a paper submitted to a journal and one of the reviewers suggested me to conduct a hierarchical logistic regression. I know how to conduct multilevel regression analysis by clustering the data at different levels. Like for example a sample of students can be clustered by classrooms, and then by schools etc. But, what the reviewer asked is clustering using the dependent variable. Is any one out there who could help by giving some clue or recommending any reading materials.
