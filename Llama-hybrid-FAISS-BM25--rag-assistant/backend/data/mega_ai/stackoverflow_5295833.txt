DeadlineExceededError workarounds

I'm making something like a web spider. It will catch the data i want form the WEB LIST. The amount of the WEB LIST is approximately 20. Each can de done around 1 to 10 seconds. I know DeadlineExceededError means my request handler didn't finish within 30 seconds. I also know that I can't change the 30 second limit. So I need to split my job into into small pieces but I don't know how to do that. Here is my code: List ids = agent.getWebList(); if(ids.iterator().hasNext()) { for(String id : ids) { Data d = agent.getDetailedDataById(id); agent.updateData(d); } }
