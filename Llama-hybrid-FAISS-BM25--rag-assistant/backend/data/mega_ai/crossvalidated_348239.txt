Confusion with k-fold cross validation

I did k-fold CV on some data, but there is something which is confusing me which I don't really understand. I read in a book that for e.g. 3-fold cv I have to do 3 iterations so I will get 3 $MSE$'s. My mentor told me I can iterate many times and get many $MSE$'s. I briefly describe here how I understand it and how he told me I should do it: For 3 iterations I shuffle the data and I split the data into e.g. 3-folds. In the test fold I calculate $MSE_1$. Again I shuffle the data and calculate $MSE_2$ on the test data. Again I shuffle the data and calculate $MSE_3$ on the test data. I calculate the CV error by averaging the $MSE_1, MSE_2, MSE_3$. How my mentor told me I should do CV: For $n$ iterations e.g. $n=100$ I shuffle the data and I split the data into 3 folds and In the test fold I calculate $MSE_1$. Again I shuffle the data and calculate $MSE_2$ on the test data. ... 100.. Again I shuffle the data and calculate $MSE_{100}$ on the test data. I calculate the CV error by adding $MSE_1,MSE_2,... MSE_n$ and dividing them by the number of folds,3. I would very much appreciate any clarification.
