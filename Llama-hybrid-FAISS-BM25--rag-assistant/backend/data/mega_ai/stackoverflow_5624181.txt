HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found Location: http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/mobileiris/(xidluk550vzs5045l1cxkh55)/index.aspx [following] Which indicates that it is doing a 302 redirect to the URL containing the ID. You can write Perl (or other) code to find the redirected URL: #!/usr/bin/perl use warnings; use strict; use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->requests_redirectable([]); # don't follow any redirects my $response = $ua->get('http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/mobileiris/'); my $loc = $response->header('Location'); print "redirected to=$loc\n";
