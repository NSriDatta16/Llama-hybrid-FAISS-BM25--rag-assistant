Difference between feedback RNN and LSTM/GRU

I am trying to understand different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures to be applied to time series data and I am getting a bit confused with the different names that are frequently used when describing RNNs. Is the structure of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) essentially an RNN with a feedback loop?
