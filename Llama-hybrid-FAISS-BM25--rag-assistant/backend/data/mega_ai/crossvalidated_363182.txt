Implementing VAE with initial parameter values

I have been trying to implement a Variational Autoencoder. For VAE, we have a unit Gaussian prior and we infer the posterior using the encoder which gives us mean and logvar. I was wondering if there is a way to initialize the values of mean and logvar and then update them using the encoder part of VAE?
