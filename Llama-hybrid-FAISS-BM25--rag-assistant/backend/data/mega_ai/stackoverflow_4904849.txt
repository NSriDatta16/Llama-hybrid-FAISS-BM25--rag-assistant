How to share files created by an app?

How do I share files (music, video, image) create by my app? I am interested in sharing audio file specifically. Imagine I have a program that generates wav file. How do I take it from isolated storage? Is it possible to sent an attachment with e-mail? Save it on SkyDrive? Share on Facebook? Put it to media library? At least in some convenient for a user way to take it out from WP7 device? Any help regarding this topic would be welcome
