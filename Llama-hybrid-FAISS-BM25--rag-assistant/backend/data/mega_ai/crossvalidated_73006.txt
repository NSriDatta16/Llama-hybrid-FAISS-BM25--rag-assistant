I agree with your supervisor, logistic regression is the better choice. The continuous predictor allows you to make a more nuanced probabilistic statement about the disease relationship rather than the more blunt categorization statement of the relationship resulting from using disease as the predictor. You did word your initial question about whether X was different between controls and patients but it isn't clear that future use of the information might better be served by being able to make statements about the probability of disease given the value of X. I'm trusting that your supervisor has better knowledge of the more general use of the findings and therefore would offer more appropriate advice than any of us can here. It gets a bit tricky looking at your covariates of age and sex when they're primarily supposed to be related to X. My guess is they're related to both X and disease, in which case you really need to treat them not as covariates, that are generally ignored, but as fully analyzed predictors. You'll need to know the correlations among your predictors and how they influence your model.
