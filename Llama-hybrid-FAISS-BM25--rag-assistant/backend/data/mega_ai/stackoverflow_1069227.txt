How do I make my Linq to Sql entity implement INotifyPropertyChanged

I've manually created some classes in the Linq-to-sql designer and when looking in the xx.designer.cs file the class doesn't implement INotifyPropertyChanged interface. This works if I create the entity by dragging from the server explorer. Does anyone know why this is and if I am doing something wrong or if there is somewhere to set this up in the designer. Cheers.
