LocalStorage Firefox 3.6

According to everything I've read, Firefox 3.5+ supports localStorage. And yet I'm seeing the alert (failing) in Firefox 3.6. Do I have some strange settings in my Firefox? Any ideas? function supports_html5_storage() { try { return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null; } catch (e) { alert('failing'); return false; } } Note: The page has an HTML5 doctype (though I think this makes no difference).
