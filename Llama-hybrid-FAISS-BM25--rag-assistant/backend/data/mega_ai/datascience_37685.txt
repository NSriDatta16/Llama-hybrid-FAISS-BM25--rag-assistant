Feature Extraction Using A CNN

I want to use a CNN to extract features from a dataset. My questions are: What is the stopping criteria when training a CNN to extract features? What is the difference between extracting features after training for 50 epochs or 100 epochs? How should I choose the best layer for feature extraction? Does it depend on the accuracy of the model?
