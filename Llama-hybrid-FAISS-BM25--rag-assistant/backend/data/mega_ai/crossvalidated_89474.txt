Interpretation of ordinal logistic regression

I ran this ordinal logistic regression in R: mtcars_ordinal I got this summary of the model: summary(mtcars_ordinal) Re-fitting to get Hessian Call: polr(formula = as.factor(carb) ~ mpg, data = mtcars) Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value mpg -0.2335 0.06855 -3.406 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value 1|2 -6.4706 1.6443 -3.9352 2|3 -4.4158 1.3634 -3.2388 3|4 -3.8508 1.3087 -2.9425 4|6 -1.2829 1.3254 -0.9679 6|8 -0.5544 1.5018 -0.3692 Residual Deviance: 81.36633 AIC: 93.36633 I can get the log odds of the coefficient for mpg like this: exp(coef(mtcars_ordinal)) mpg 0.7917679 And the the log odds of the thresholds like: exp(mtcars_ordinal$zeta) 1|2 2|3 3|4 4|6 6|8 0.001548286 0.012084834 0.021262900 0.277242397 0.574406353 Could someone tell me if my interpretation of this model is correct: As mpg increases by one unit, the odds of moving from category 1 of carb into any of the other 5 categories, decreases by -0.23. If the log odds crosses the threshold of 0.0015, then the predicted value for a car will be category 2 of carb . If the log odds crosses the threshold of 0.0121, then the predicted value for a car will be category 3 of carb , and so on.
