Remembering that interpreting PCA results can be an art-form, let's use a relatively simple data set. The link here shows a PCA and interpretation of Fisher's iris data, which you can easily obtain for yourself and analyse in the software of your choice. The bottom of p.9 shows the eigenvalues for the four principal components and p.11 provides an interpretation of the first two principal components. As you can see, PC2 has been called a contrast between sepal length/width and petal length/width. The reason for that is that the eigenvector values corresponding to the sepal measurements are all negative and those corresponding to the petal measurements are all positive. However, and this is where the PCA "art" interpretation comes into it, you could argue that petal width has little effect on PC2, as it is only 0.08 and therefore not a very large value. Looking at PC3, and ignoring the fact it accounts for such little variance (as that is not the point of this discussion), it appears to be a contrast between sepal and petal width, on the one hand, and sepal length on the other. Having a subject matter expert on hand to help interpret PCA results can be very useful.
