If the junior programmer, or anyone, doesn't see the value in testing, then it will be hard to get them to do it...period. I would have made the junior programmer sacrifice their weekend to fix the bug. His actions (or lack there of) are not affecting him directly. Also, make it apparent, that he will not see advancement and/or pay increases if he doesn't improve his skills in testing. In the end, even with all your help, encouragement, mentoring, he might not be a fit for your team, so let him go and look for someone who does get it.
