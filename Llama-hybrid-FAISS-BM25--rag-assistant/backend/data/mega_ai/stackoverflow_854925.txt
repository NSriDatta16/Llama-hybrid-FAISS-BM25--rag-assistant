Sometimes the first call to cvQueryFrame() returns an empty image. Try: IplImage *pSaveImg = cvQueryFrame(pCapturedImage); pSaveImg = cvQueryFrame(pCapturedImage); If that does not work, try to select capture device automatically: CvCapture *pCapturedImage = cvCreateCameraCapture(-1); Or you may try to select other capture devices where n=1,2,3... CvCapture *pCapturedImage = cvCreateCameraCapture(n); PS: Also I believe there is a misunderstanding about captured image looking at your variable name. The variable pCapturedImage is not an Image it is a Capture. You can always 'read' an image from capture.
