Does a MCMC fulfilling detailed balance yields a stationary distribution?

I guess I understand the equation of the detailed balance condition, which states that for transition probability $q$ and stationary distribution $\pi$, a Markov Chain satisfies detailed balance if $$q(x|y)\pi(y)=q(y|x)\pi(x),$$ this makes more sense to me if I restate it as: $$\frac{q(x|y)}{q(y|x)}= \frac{\pi(x)}{\pi(y)}. $$ Basically, the probability of transition from state $x$ to state $y$ should be proportional to the ratio of their probability densities.
