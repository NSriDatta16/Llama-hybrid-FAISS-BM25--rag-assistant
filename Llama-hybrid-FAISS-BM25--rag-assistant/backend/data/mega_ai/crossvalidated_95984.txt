Notice that with a poisson distribution for the number of failures, the expected number of failures in 400 hours is 1.4. It's important to realize the distinction between the following two phrases "what you expect to happen" and how that differs from "what will happen most of the time". If you simulated this 400 hour period many times, the average number of failures across the simulations would be 1.4. It would probably be helpful to think of expected value in this way. Notice that the expected number of failures coincides with your faulty logic regarding the MTTF. However, the proportion of simulations with failures less than or equal to 4 would be .985. In assessing how to use this information, it seems more sensible to base your decision on what will happen most of the time as opposed to what happens on average.
