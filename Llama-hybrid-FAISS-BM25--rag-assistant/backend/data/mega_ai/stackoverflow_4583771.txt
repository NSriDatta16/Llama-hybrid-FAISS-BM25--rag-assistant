Synchronization using object lock in java

I have two threads thread1(printing numbers) & thread2(printing alphabets). My goal is to have the following output via syncronization: 1 a 2 b 3 c 4 d 5 e class thread1 implements Runnable { public void run() { try { for (int i = 1; i I am getting the output: Is Thread1 holding lock of Testing.class?:false Is Thread1 holding lock of Testing.class?:true 1 Thread1:Going to wait Is Thread2 holding lock of Testing.class?:false Is Thread2 holding lock of Testing.class?:true Thread2:Going to wait How did thread2 got hold the lock of Testing.class when it was already locked by thread1?. Also, Is there any other elegant way to achieve this sync?. Thanks in advance.
