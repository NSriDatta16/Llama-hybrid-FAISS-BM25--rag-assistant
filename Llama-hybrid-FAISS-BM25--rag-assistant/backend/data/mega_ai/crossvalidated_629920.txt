The original question related to finding evidence for whether a treatment is similar to another treatment. This is not what null hypothesis testing does. To really answer the OPâ€™s question would require something like a Bayesian posterior probability of similarity, once you define similarity, e.g., the absolute value of the difference in two means being less than some number.
