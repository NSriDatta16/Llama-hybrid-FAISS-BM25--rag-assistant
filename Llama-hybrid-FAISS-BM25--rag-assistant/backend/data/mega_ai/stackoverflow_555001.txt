I have create two small classes, and test them. First I've create a single object as prototype. Then I've create a 2,000,000 array to store them all. Then I've run a loop, create a new instance there and take the values from the prototype. The average results in seconds comparing each one is: WithGS Without 1.1323 1.1116 Diff = 0.0207 secs. So, for this case I think it would be much better to have a non-optimized solution first , and once no further requirements are needed, proceed with the profiling. Here's the code: PersonGetSet.java public class PersonGetSet { private String name; private boolean deceased; public void setName( String name ) { this.name = name; } public String getName() { return name; } public void setDeceased( boolean deceased ) { this.deceased = deceased; } public boolean isDeceased() { return this.deceased; } public static void main( String [] args ) { PersonGetSet pb = new PersonGetSet(); pb.setName( "name" ); pb.setDeceased( true ) ; long start = System.currentTimeMillis(); PersonGetSet [] array = new PersonGetSet[2000000]; for( int i = 0 ; i
