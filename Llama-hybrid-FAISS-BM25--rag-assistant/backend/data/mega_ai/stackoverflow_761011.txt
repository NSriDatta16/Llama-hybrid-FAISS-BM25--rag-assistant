Looking for a reference MsBuild configuration on a large project

I've been struggling with how to best organize my msbuild project files. At one time is was all in one file. Then I split it up into multiple files. But I want to be able to run 1 master project file that imports everything and builds them with dependencies. Or be able to build a project independently and not have it worry about not being able to find the task in the "dependsontargets" attribute. So I was wondering if anybody knew of a good reference for me to see how I should be organizing my projects. Thanks
