How to create HTML email with embeded image and show it in the default mail client using .net (c#)?

If you look at the Snip tool in windows there is an option to send the snip as an embedded attachment in the default mail client (I guess as an html email). I need exactly that. At the moment I am using simple MAPI to attach the image but that does not allow embedding. One key requirement is that it should be created and then shown in the default mail client. I don't think I can use System.Net.Mail for that. Or can I? Its a WPF application using c#. EDIT: Please read the question carefully before answering. I am not new to this. I know how to do this in unmanaged code without resorting to hacks. I need a managed equivalent. I am not looking for hacks and am happy to spend significant time on the correct solution if necessary.
