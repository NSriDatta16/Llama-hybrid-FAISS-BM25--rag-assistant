Object to an Array Collection

I have an application that takes some database info and shoves it into a datagrid, or chart. I've come across this error of having a single row and trying to use it in an array so I can use it in my app. Its come to my attention that its a pretty common problem that people face, but I don't seem to be able to get around it no matter what a try. My actionscript has a function that trots of to the database via ASP, and returns the data in the event - as below (obv I've removed some stuff - load of calls are made to the mssqlQuery function - only the one I have trauma with is below) mssqlQuery("SELECT (CASE SLARag ,COUNT (SLARag) as Volume FROM [CMI_ClientMI].[Portal].[BatchUpdate]","BusSegBuildSummary");} public static function mssqlQuery(sql:String,fid:String):void { var http:HTTPService = new HTTPService; var parm:Object = new Object; parm.fas_sql = sql; parm.fas_db = mssql_db; http.url = mssql_url+"?irand="+Math.random(); // http.showBusyCursor = true; http.request = sql; http.addEventListener(ResultEvent.RESULT, mssqlResult); http.addEventListener(FaultEvent.FAULT, mssqlFault); http.method = "POST"; sqlToken = http.send(parm); sqlToken.param = fid; } //Var for BusSegBuildSummary arraycollection [Bindable] public static var _BusSegBuildSummary:ArrayCollection = new ArrayCollection(); //Case statement for BusSegBuildSummary case "BusSegBuildSummary": if( event.result.results.record is ObjectProxy ){ trace("this is object Proxy"); } else{ trace("this isnt object Proxy"); _BusSegBuildSummary = event.result.results.record; } break; So - if the result has more than one record in it - then we are fine - its the trace("this is object Proxy"); bit that is troublesome. I think that I have to cast the object as an arraycollection and I've tried that a number of different ways with no success. Any ideas? I've been struggling for a while now and I'm panicking!
