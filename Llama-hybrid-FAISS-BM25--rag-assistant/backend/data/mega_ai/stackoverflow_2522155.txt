Java generics parameters with base of the generic parameter

I am wondering if there's an elegant solution for doing this in Java (besides the obvious one - of declaring a different/explicit function. Here is the code: private static HashMap nameStringIndexMap = new HashMap (); private static HashMap nameBufferIndexMap = new HashMap (); // and a function private static String newName(Object object, HashMap nameIndexMap){ .... } The problem is that I cannot pass nameStringIndexMap or nameBufferIndexMap parameters to the function. I don't have an idea about a more elegant solution beside doing another function which explicitly wants a HashMap or HashMap parameter. My question is: Can this be made in a more elegant solution/using generics or something similar? Thank you, Iulian
