Correcting for heteroskedasticity in Logit fixed-effects model

I found out that my panel data 'suffers' from heteroscedasticity by doing the test described on Stata FAQ, Testing for panel-level heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation . I understand that the $H_0$ for lrtest is homoskedasticity and I'm rejecting this. Please correct me if I'm wrong here. I'm carrying out a fixed effects logistic regression with xtlogit and I found that the vce option should be used to correct for heteroskedasticity. Still, I don't understand when to use vce(bootstrap) or vce(jackknife) ? What's the difference between the two? How can I decide which one to use? EDIT: Some info on the data size: Number of observations: 116304 Number of groups 2549 Obs per group: min = 1 avg = 45.6273 max = 20
