Enforcing English with a regular expression? That's a rather naïve approach, and I'm not sure you'd want to include it on your résumé even if you did manage it. I'm not even sure I'd brag about it at the neighborhood café. Believe it or not, there are a lot of English words (words that have been completely incorporated into the English lexicon) that are properly spelled with characters that don't match /[a-z]/gi .
