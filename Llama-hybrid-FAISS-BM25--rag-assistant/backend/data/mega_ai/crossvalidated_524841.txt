Smoothing factor in $n$-day exponentially weighted average

I have read online that if we want an $n$ -day exponentially weighted average we use the formula $$ \alpha = \frac{2}{n+1} $$ My question is why is this the case? Does this choice of factor turn out to make the weighting of the $n+1$ , $n+2$ ... data points negligible?
