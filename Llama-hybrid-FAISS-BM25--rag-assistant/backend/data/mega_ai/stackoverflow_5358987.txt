zlib memory usage / performance. With 500kb of data

Is zLib Worth it? Are there other better suited compressors? I am using an embedded system. Frequently, I have only 3MB of RAM or less available to my application. So I am considering using zlib to compress my buffers. I am concerned about overhead however. The buffer's average size will be 30kb. This probably won't get compressed by zlib . Anyone know of a good compressor for extremely limited memory environments? However , I will experience occasional maximum buffer sizes of 700kb, with 500kb much more common. Is zlib worth it in this case? Or is the overhead too much to justify? My sole considerations for compression are RAM overhead of algorithm and performance at least as good as zlib. LICENSE : I prefer the compressor be licensed under BSD, zLib, or equivalent license.
