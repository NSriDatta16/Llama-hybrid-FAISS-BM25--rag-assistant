I am not sure, what you want to achieve. It seems more like you want to abstract away from the $_SESSION variable than that you want to change the storage. Take a look at the way the Zend or the Solar framework handle the Session access. http://www.phpeveryday.com/articles/Zend-Framework-Session-Introduction-P571.html http://solarphp.org/manual:sessions How can i construct a class which receives the HTTP Request and Response during one request process? I don't know, what you mean by receiving the response, but the frameworks have front-/page-controllers which route to the chosen action, then call a method that can access the Session (read/write) and Request (read) objects and generates a Response object which is then rendered through a template. For automatic testing you can construct your own Request and Session objects and pass them to the page controller.
