Personally, I try to keep the database as simple (to the minimum) with Insert, Update, Delete without having too much function that can be used in code. Stored Proc is the same, contain only task that are very close to persistence data and not business logic related. I would put the MD5 outside. This will let met have this "data manipulation" outside the storage scope of the database. But, your example is quite "easy" and I do not think it's bad to have it inside...
