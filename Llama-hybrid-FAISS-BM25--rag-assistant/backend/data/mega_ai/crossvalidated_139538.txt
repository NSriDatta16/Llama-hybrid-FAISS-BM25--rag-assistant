This is just a general comment on pseudoreplication discussions. Many of the discussions and queries regarding pseudoreplication in the current literature and on the internetrefer only my initial 1984 paper and seem unaware of many later clarifying papers by myself and my colleagues that focus partly or completely on the topic. These are listed below. Pdfs of most of these can be accessed at my university website, at http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/stuart/stuart.html Reading of these may be helpful to researchers. It is regrettable that confusing or simply fallacious re-definitions of the “sin” are so prevalent in articles, books, and on the internet. Be careful who you accept as your “statistical gurus” and of all that you see on the glossy pages of “reputable” journals! Hurlbert, S.H. 1990.
