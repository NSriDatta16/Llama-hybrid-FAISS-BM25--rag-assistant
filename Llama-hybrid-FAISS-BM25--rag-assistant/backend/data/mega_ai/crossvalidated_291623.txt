An approach I can recommend is to use Tukeys methods from his EDA book. Use his smooth algorithms to split the time series into a smooth and a rough. The smooth acts acts as a reference level and the rough is how far the data is away from the reference level. Then apply Tukey outlier detection methods from box plots on the rough data to identify when the data is too far away from the smooth. I use various different versions of smooth and then combine these to give a result. You do not have to use the multiples Tukey recommends for outliers or far out values, you can use multiples that make sense for your data.
