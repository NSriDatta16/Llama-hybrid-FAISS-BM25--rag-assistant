recommended ways of splitting train/validation/test in time series in neural networks

for time series using neural networks with 500000 samples I am looking for tips for recommended percentage of spliting samples into train/validation/test and intervals of splitting. I absolutely am not looking for cross-validation answers because my model takes so much time to train. percentage for dataset of lengths of 10,000, 100,000 and 500,000(my case) what are recommended percentages for splitting train and test specifically for time series(30/70 or 98,2 etc)? interval splitting assuming we have chosen 70/20/10 percentage. so is it better to split samples to train=1-70 val=71-90 test=91-100 or its better to choose intervals i.e. 20 then split (for 100 sample example would be like) train=1-14,21-34,...,81-94 val=15-18,35-38,...,95-98, test=19-20,39-40,...,99-100 . is there any recommendation for this sort of intervals for splitting?
