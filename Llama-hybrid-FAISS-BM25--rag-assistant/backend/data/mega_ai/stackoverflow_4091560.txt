Make the divider of an NSSplitView undraggable and don't show the dragging cursor

I have an NSSplitView ( NO UISplitView(Controller)!! ) with three subviews. Now, for the last divider (index 1 ), I want the divider to not show the dragging cursor (two arrows pointing out of eachother). I have this to stop the dragging, but the cursor is still showing up: - (CGFloat)splitView:(NSSplitView *)splitView constrainSplitPosition:(CGFloat)proposedPosition ofSubviewAt:(NSInteger)dividerIndex { if (dividerIndex == 1) { return [splitView frame].size.width - 161; } } Note that I only want to hide the cursor for the divider at index 1 . Can anyone help me? Thanks. :) No, I don't want to use BWToolkit.
