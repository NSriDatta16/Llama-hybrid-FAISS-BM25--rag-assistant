Benefit in getting Orthogonal dimensions from a data set

What are the benefits of getting a new data set in which all their dimensions are independent from an original data set (applying PCA)? we know we can reduce the storage space needed, speed up computation or remove redundant features after doing PCA for example. but What computations in a statistical or probabilistic point of view are expedited or benefited when all dimensions are orthogonal?
