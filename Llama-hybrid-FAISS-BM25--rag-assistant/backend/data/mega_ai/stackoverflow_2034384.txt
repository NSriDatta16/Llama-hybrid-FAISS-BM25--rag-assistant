You should do what works for you; here's what works for me: My unit is a class : that's what I'm trying to test. Not a method. I'm trying to do object-oriented programming, so I put my attention on objects. If I find myself tempted to test a private method, I need to refactor . I only want to test a private method directly because there is too much other code between it and the tests, and because the private method itself is complex enough to need testing attention. So, I'll usually Extract Class to pull that private method, and other related members in to a new class. My classes tend to be quite small . They're easy to read and understand. My methods, of course, are also very small and easy to understand. Making the transition to this way of working required me to rethink many of my assumptions and habits about programming. What once seemed radical now seems commonplace.
