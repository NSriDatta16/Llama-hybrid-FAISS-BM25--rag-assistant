To actually classify a product, you could use somewhat of a "enhanced neural network" with a blackboard. (This is just a metaphore to get you thinking in the right direction, not a strict use of the terms.) Imagine a set of objects that are connected through listeners or events (just like neurons and synapsis). Each object has a set of patterns and tests the input against these patterns. An example: One object tests for ("seagate"|"connor"|"maxtor"|"quantum"| ...) Another object tests for [:digit:]*(" ")?("gb"|"mb") Another object tests for [:digit:]*(" ")?"rpm" All these objects connect to another object that, if certain combinations of them fire, categorizes the input as a hard drive. The individual objects themselves would enter certain characterizations into the black board (common writing area to say things about the input) such as manufacturer, capacity, or speed. So the neurons do not fire based on a threshhold, but on a recognition of a pattern. Many of these neurons can work highly parallel on the blackboard and even correct categorizations by other neurons (maybe introducing certainties?) I used something like this in a prototype for a product used to classify products according to UNSPSC and was able to get 97% correct classification on car parts.
