Predictor transformation in logistic regression

In linear regression, I've seen (granted, not many) situations where basic transformations to some of the predictors can significantly improve the fit and stability of the model, and often a scatterplot of the response variable vs each individual predictor can provide useful clues as to whether a transformation can help. Is there a similar approach that would work for logistic regression - i.e., what is an intuitive way to determine whether any predictor transformations can help?
