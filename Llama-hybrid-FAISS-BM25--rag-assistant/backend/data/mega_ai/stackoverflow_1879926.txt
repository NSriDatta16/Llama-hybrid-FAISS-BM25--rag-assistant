"TCP/IP Illustrated, Volumes 1-3" are the authoritative work on the subject. I recall, the original BSD stack was implemented based on volume 2. Volume 1 explains the protocols in detail. The RFC standard documents are also quite accessible to the average programmer, and you will need them if you want a modern, compliant implementation because those books are old. There have been many additions and changes to the standards over the years, IPv6 being one of the big ones. The other thing you may need to consider is the Ethernet protocol that (usually) underlies the IP layer. There are books but I haven't read enough of any of them to recommend one. The standards are freely available from the IEEE. http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.11.html
