Learning Python: Is there a better way to write words + vars to file?

For example, the following code: #!/usr/bin/env python cliente = 'TESTE' servidor_virtual = '10.2.192.115' porta = '22' conf = "# pool " + cliente + '\n' "virtual_server" + servidor_virtual + porta + '\n' f = open('cliente.conf', 'w') f.write(conf) f.close() I'm beginning at Python and creating a model to write some confs to a file. I just found this way, but i want to know if there another more elegant way to do this. And i want to mix word with variables values too.
