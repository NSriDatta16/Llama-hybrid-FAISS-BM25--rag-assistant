I know this is an old question but I am adding an answer to get feeback. This is a crossover study of 2 treatments and data can be reorganized as follows variables (columns): ID gender specialty order risk0 risk1 diffrisk Where risk0 and risk1 are risk values for 2 types of treatments and diffrisk is difference between the two. Order is treatment order (0-1 or 1-0). To determine if 2 treatments have different effects, one can simply use paired Student t-test to compare risk0 and risk1 . To determine influence of other factors, one can use diffrisk . Analysis can be done using regression as: diffrisk ~ gender + speciality + order Or, one can use mixed effects model (with data in original form) in following manner: lmer(risk ~ Treatment + gender + specialty + order + (1|ID), mydata) hence, keeping ID as a random effect. The order is commonly ignored for analysis and not kept in equation.
