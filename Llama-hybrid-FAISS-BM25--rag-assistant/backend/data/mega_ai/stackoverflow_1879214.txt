Dragging A Circle on a JFrame

I am trying to have a circle appear on the screen, then when the user clicks INSIDE the circle, enable the ability for them to drag the circle where the mouse goes while it is being pressed. This is the code i have so far, the drag works, but it is allowing the user to drag without them pressing the inside of the circle, just when anywhere on the screen is pressed. I hope i am not too confusing here's the code i have, please if someone could just tell me the code that needs to be corrected, it will save me anymore hours. import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; public class DragCircle extends JFrame { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; public static int size = 400; public static int r = 10; private int x; private int y; private int cX; private int cY; private int dX; private int dY; private MouseHandler mh; boolean isCircleClicked = false; public static void main(String[] args) { DragCircle c1 = new DragCircle(); c1.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); } public DragCircle() { super("Drag circle"); cX = r + 100; cY = r + 100; mh = new MouseHandler(); addMouseListener(mh); addMouseMotionListener(mh); setSize(size, size); setVisible(true); } public void paint(Graphics g) { super.paint(g); g.setColor(Color.RED); g.fillOval(cX, cY, r * 2, r * 2); } private class MouseHandler extends MouseAdapter implements MouseMotionListener { public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me) { if ((cX - me.getX()) * (cX - me.getX()) + (cY - me.getY()) * (cY - me.getY())
