What would make Graph Neural Networks better than 'normal' Neural Networks?

I am quite new to the area of artificial intelligence and deep learning, so I am exploring some of the available techniques and models. Throughout my readings, I noticed a growing trend towards using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recent years, so I would appreciate having some feedback from experts: What are the main differences between GNN and NN (apart from GNN has a graph as its input)? Consequently, what is the potential in using GNN instead of NN, for example in knowledge graphs and bases?
