You are correct in choosing to model your data with a Polytomous Logistic Regression for Nominal Responses. Since your data are not ordinal, it would not make much sense to use a Polytomous Logistic Regression Model for Ordinal Responses so there is no ordering among your responses. There is not reason why not cured (2) should be further away from not self cured (0) than self-cured. By using an ordinal model you are forcing the ordering to have some sort of logical sense, but your data do not support this. An alternative that you might consider, especially if your goal is purely to make the best predictions possible and not to necessarily interpret your models, is to consider a two-stage logistic regression prediction model. In the first stage you simply build a logistic regression model to classify your sample into Not Cured (Default) (i.e. any observation coded 1 or 0) vs. Cured (2). Once you've built your model, then you build a secondary model only among those who are not cured (1, or 0). Then you simply build another logistic regression model to classify observations as either not cured/default or not self-cured. Then, you'll run your models in sequence, first predicting cure vs. not cure and then after predictions are made, all those predicted to be not cured are run through your second model and you will predict not cured vs. not self-cured. You can then calculated your predicted error rates by comparing your predictions with the actual data.
