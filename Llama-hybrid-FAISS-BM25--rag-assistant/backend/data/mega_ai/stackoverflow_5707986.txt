Having a list of sub part IDs would be violating 1NF and is highly discouraged in almost any circumstance. If you're using any kind of a DBMS then having more rows in your intersection table is not a problem. Another thing to think about is why you have a separate sub-parts table. The conventional way to do this sort of thing (so-called "bill of materials") is to have one table for parts/assemblies and one table to say "these are the things that make up that thing". In other words: ASSEMBLY - Assembly ID (PK) - Assembly Name COMPOSITION - Contained In Assembly ID (PK, FK) - Contains Assembly ID (PK, FK) Edit: Note too that a real bill of materials would have fields in the COMPOSITION table for quantity and unit of measure (of the quantity).
