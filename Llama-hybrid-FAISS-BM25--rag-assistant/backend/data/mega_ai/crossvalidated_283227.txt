When Xgboost stops growing tree

I'm using Xgboost's gradient boosted tree model for binary classification. It has a max_depth parameter, which specifies the maximum depth of each individual tree. This makes me assume that it can potentially stop splitting and end with a tree that is shallower than the max_depth tree parameter. When building a tree, what stopping condition does Xgboost use to decide when to stop growing the tree (when to stop splitting a particular node any further)? I checked the original papers and the documentation and couldn't find any description of this.
