Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) share important assumptions. Amongst them is the assumption that all investors are at all times profit maximizing, rational and risk-averse. If this is the case then excess vol and vol clusters are said to violate a strict form of the EMH since this indicates that prices may deviate from fundamentals. Of course, excess vol/vol clusters are seen at all levels of granularity in financial time series. Financial economists seek to explain why excess vol exists and how best to incorporate it in their models. While the ideas about how to model vol don't necessarily come from financial economists, important ones, like ARCH/GARCH did, and were subsequently incorporated by financial firms in their pricing models and trading strategies.
