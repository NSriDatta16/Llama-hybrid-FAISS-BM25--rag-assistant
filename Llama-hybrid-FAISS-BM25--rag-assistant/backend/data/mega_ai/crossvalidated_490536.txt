Hard-margin SVM and logistic regression for non-linearly separable data

Hard-margin SVM doesn't seem to work on non-linearly separable data. It seems to only work if your data is linearly separable. What happens if you try to use hard-margin SVM? Does the algorithm blow-up? I have the same question for logistic regression, but it's not clear to me what happens when the data isn't linearly separable.
