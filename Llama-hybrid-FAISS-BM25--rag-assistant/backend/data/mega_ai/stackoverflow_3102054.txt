Keeping a session open for an extended period of time is OK (although that should not be eternity :-) A session should identify a unit of work - a coherent set of queries / updates which logically belong together. Can you identify such units in your app - e.g. client requests or conversations? If so, create a separate session for each of these. You should also definitely use a separate session per thread (typically a unit of work is handled by a single thread anyway). A simple way to achieve this is using thread local storage .
