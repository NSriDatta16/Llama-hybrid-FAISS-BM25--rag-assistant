Averaging time series with different sampling interval

I have a few time series that were (for technical reasons) acquired with slightly different time intervals, ranging between 19 and 21 seconds. Now, I would like to average the values of these different time series over time, so I thought that I could do some sort of interpolation of the values at some regular interval (e.g. each 20 seconds). Could someone point out a good way to do this?
