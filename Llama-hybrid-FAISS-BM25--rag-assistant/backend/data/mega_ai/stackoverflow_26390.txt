The Towers of Hanoi algorithm is one of the most beautiful algorithms. It shows how you can use recursion to solve a problem in a much more elegant fashion than the iterative method. Alternatively, the recursion algorithm for Fibonacci series and calculating powers of a number demonstrate the reverse situation of recursive algorithm being used for the sake of recursion instead of providing good value.
