A data warehouse (DW) is a database specifically structured/designed to aid in querying, analyzing and reporting (generating reports out of) of current and historical data. DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Basic difference between a data warehouse and a set of DB tables is how the data is organized/structured.
