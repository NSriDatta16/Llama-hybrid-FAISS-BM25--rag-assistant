Developing Applications that can interact Lotus Notes (.nsf) databases

I am a c# developer interested in developing a windows application to connect to a lotus notes .nsf db and display the information like 1) Number of forms 2) Number of views 3) Script Libraries 4) Actions 5) Agents Once I do this, I want to read each form and the UI elements available in each form and generate an equivalent .aspx file. I have lotus notes client and designer installed on my system. Could anyone suggest how to proceed with this requirement?
