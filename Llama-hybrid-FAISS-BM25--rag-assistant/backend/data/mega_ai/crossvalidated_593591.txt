How are counterfactuals useful and how should I understand them? Counterfactuals are useful in situations for which you observed a set of parameters and you want to reason about other scenarios that are in contradiction with the actual one. They are used for studying individual cases, as opposed to do-operators that are used for studying average effects by keeping all the variables in the network fixed (you don't change their values) and by just setting $X$ to $x$ . I'll leave some references at the end of the question that explain this in a better way. I'll try to be more specific on your case by answering your other question in which you were referring to a regression model. How do they differ from calculating $y$ for a given value of $x$ , or from the $do()$ operator? So, let us suppose you have a regression model that predicts values of $y$ given an observed input $x$ . Let me first point out that such model, as other machine learning models, captures only correlations and not causality because you train it with a dataset of observed features and related target values so you may have unobserved counfunders making you predict spurious correlations. But let us suppose that your model is somehow able to learn interventional probabilities $p(y|do(X=x))$ instead of observational probabilities $p(y|x)$$^1$ . Let us also suppose to be in the confounded scenario of the following image. Let us suppose that we observe $X=x_1$ . By performing an intervention using your model you are able to get the average value of $y$ after imposing $do(X=x_2)$ (that is $p(y|do(X=x_2))$ ) which may differ from the counterfactual value of $y$ had $X$ been $x_2$ (that is $p(y|X=x_1,do(X=x_2))$ ) because in the second case you exploit the extra information you get from your specific observation to get infos on the value of the unobserved variable $U$ as well. In particular, counterfactuals require to perform 3 steps: Abduction: update the probability of unobserved factors $P(u)$ exploiting the current observation $P(u|e)$ Action: Perform the intervention in the model (that is $do(X=x_2)$ ) Prediction: Predict the value of $Y$ in the modified model. Please note that this step exploits updated probabilities from the previous 2 points, that is not as performing just the intervention. In my opinion this was a great question, I had to dig into different resources to try to answer it so I'll leave my references here, maybe they can complement my answer. I found the first answer very useful (especially the example) to get the differences between do-notation and counterfactuals. I'd suggest you to try to run my example on the data tables provided on the first answer. Judea Pearl's twitted about the difference between counterfactuals and do-operations . $^1$ For the sake of completeness, there should be in the literature some models able to capture interventional probabilities if provided with interventional data.
