I made the R package mcp exactly because there is a lack of packages quantifying the uncertainty (e.g., SE) about the inferred change point locations. Change point problems are conceptually simple in a Bayesian framework, and computationally accessible using variants of Gibbs sampling ( read more in this preprint ). mcp includes a dataset with three linear segments: > head(ex_demo) time response 1 68.35820 32.842651 2 87.29038 -1.160003 3 69.01173 27.564248 4 11.59361 10.062971 5 19.50091 14.056859 6 46.12009 18.292640 Let's fit a piecewise linear regression with three segments. In mcp you do this as a list one formula per segment: library(mcp) # Define the model model = list( response ~ 1, # plateau ~ 0 + time, # joined slope ~ 1 + time # disjoined slope ) # Fit it. fit = mcp(model, data = ex_demo) Let's visualize it first: plot(fit) The blue curves on the x-axis are the posteriors of the change points. You can see them more directly using plot_pars(fit) . Note that they rarely conform to any "clean" known density like the normal distribution. See summaries using summary(fit) . mcp includes functions to test parameter values, model comparison, etc. Read more on the mcp website .
