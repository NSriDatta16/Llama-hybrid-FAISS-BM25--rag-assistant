Android java.net.UnknownHostException: Host is unresolved: server_address:443

I'm trying to get xml from server via https connection. If i do it with curl command curl -k -A "Mozilla/4.0" https://username:password@server.com/test/infoxml.ashx connection is successfull, but when i try it in java on android, it doesn't work. I'm using this code: URL url = new URL("https://user:password@server.com"); HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection(); conn.setRequestMethod("GET"); conn.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic **********************"); conn.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0"); conn.setRequestProperty("Host", "server.com"); conn.setRequestProperty("Accept", "*/*"); InputStream content = conn.getInputStream(); As you can see, I set up headers based on verbose output of working curl command, which is as follows: * About to connect() to server.com port 443 (#0) * Trying (server ip)... connected * Connected to server.com (server ip) port 443 (#0) * SSLv3, TLS handshake, Client hello (1): * SSLv3, TLS handshake, Server hello (2): * SSLv3, TLS handshake, CERT (11): * SSLv3, TLS handshake, Server finished (14): * SSLv3, TLS handshake, Client key exchange (16): * SSLv3, TLS change cipher, Client hello (1): * SSLv3, TLS handshake, Finished (20): * SSLv3, TLS change cipher, Client hello (1): * SSLv3, TLS handshake, Finished (20): * SSL connection using AES256-SHA * Server certificate: * subject: C=SI; ST=City; L=City; O=Company d.d; OU=ES; CN=server.com * start date: 2010-02-05 00:00:00 GMT * expire date: 2011-02-02 23:59:59 GMT * common name: server.com (matched) * issuer: C=ZA; ST=Western Cape; L=Cape Town; O=Thawte Consulting cc; OU=Certification Services Division; CN=Thawte Premium Server CA; emailAddress=censored * SSL certificate verify ok. * Server auth using Basic with user 'username' > GET /test/infoxml.ashx HTTP/1.1 > Authorization: Basic **************************** > User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 > Host: server.com > Accept: */* > I'm new to this secure connection stuff, so go easy on me :) p.s. sorry for my bad English.
