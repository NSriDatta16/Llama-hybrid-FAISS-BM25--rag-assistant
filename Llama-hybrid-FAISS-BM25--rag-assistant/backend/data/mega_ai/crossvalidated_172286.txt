As Marc said, AUC is only a measure of performance, just like missclassification rate. It does not require any information about the model. Conversely, BIC, AIC, need to know the number of parameters of your model to be evaluated. There is no good reason, if all of your predictors are relevant, that the missclassification rate or the AUC decreases when removing variables. However, it is quite common that combining a learning algorithm, an importance measure of the variables and variable selection (based on the importance the algorithm grants them) will perform better than fitting the model on the whole data set. You have an implementation of this method for Random Forests in the R RFauc package.
