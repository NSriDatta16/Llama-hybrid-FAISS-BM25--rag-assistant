In reference to Dave's answer here: This is like #2, but without the global header. You can define your array as static extern NSMutableArray *myGlobalArray; inside the #ifdef OBJC block of your project's .pch file. The .pch file is a header file that is automatically #imported into every file in your project. typedef is a storage class and static is a storage class, and you can only define objects in one storage class. Taking out "static" will allow the app to compile with your answer above.
