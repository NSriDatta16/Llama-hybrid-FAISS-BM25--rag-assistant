Actually I just fixed this issue. I realized that within the treeTable code I was using it was using the "parents" function and since there were tr's above it was assuming they were drop-able. I added a not(.ignoreForDroppable) for the tr (as shown below) to ignore the tr's outside of my tree table (and added the class ignoreForDroppable to those tr's). This way those tr's will not be drop-able. // Configure droppable rows $("#dnd-example .folder").each(function() { $(this).parents("tr:not(.ignoreForDroppable)")).droppable({ accept: ".file, .folder", drop: function(e, ui) { // Call jQuery treeTable plugin to move the branch $($(ui.draggable).parents("tr:not(.ignoreForDroppable)")).appendBranchTo(this); }, hoverClass: "accept", over: function(e, ui) { // Make the droppable branch expand when a draggable node is moved over it. if(this.id != $(ui.draggable.parents("tr")[0]).id && !$(this).is(".expanded")) { $(this).expand(); } } }); });
