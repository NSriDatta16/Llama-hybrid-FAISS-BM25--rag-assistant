I only have a superficial experience with Magento. I installed it on a shared grid-server and the page loading was dismal ~5+ seconds. On a lark, I installed it on my optimized for CMS sites dedicated server, and it felt very, very snappy. My Dedicated hosting had ~10 Joomla! sites and a VBullitin site running. My guess is it's just not going to be performant on shared hosting. The over-subscription just won't allow enough resources for Magento to run as it ought.
