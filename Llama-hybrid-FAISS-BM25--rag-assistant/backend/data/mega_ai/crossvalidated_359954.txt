Both your questions apply equally to calculating or summarizing highest-density-region s that come from other sources than Bayesian posteriors. I can't say what is done most frequently in the literature, but yes, it's quite frequent to summarize a multidimensional distribution by its marginals. Again, this is not specific to Bayesian posteriors. Unless you specify some additional structure, marginal distributions can be consistent with a wide range of joint distributions (see here or here ). The same of course also holds for marginal vs. joint HDRs. The tag wiki contains some additional information. You might be especially interested in the literature that is implemented in the hdrcde package for R .
