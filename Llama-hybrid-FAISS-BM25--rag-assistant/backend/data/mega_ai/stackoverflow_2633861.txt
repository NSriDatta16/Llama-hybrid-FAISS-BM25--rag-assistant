Comparing RPG to C# and SQL

In an RPG program (One of IBM's languages on the AS/400) I can "chain" out to a file to see if a record (say, a certain customer record) exists in the file. If it does, then I can update that record instantly with new data. If the record doesn't exist, I can write a new record. The code would look like this: Customer Chain CustFile 71 ;turn on indicator 71 if not found if *in71 ;if 71 is "on" eval CustID = Customer; eval CustCredit = 10000; write CustRecord else ;71 not on, record found. CustCredit = 10000; update CustRecord endif Not being real familiar with SQL/C#, I'm wondering if there is a way to do a random retrieval from a file (which is what "chain" does in RPG). Basically I want to see if a record exists. If it does, update the record with some new information. If it does not, then I want to write a new record. I'm sure it's possible, but not quite sure how to go about doing it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
