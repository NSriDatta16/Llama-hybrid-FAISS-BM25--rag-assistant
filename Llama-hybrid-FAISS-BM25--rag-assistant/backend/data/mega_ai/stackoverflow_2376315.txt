There's no right or wrong here. It's up to the preference of you, or your team/organization. As far as the braces go, my current team has chosen option B, but I actually prefer option A. Personally I would recommend a little more spacing especially after the "for" and "if", and a bit more indentation on option B, for readability. But, that's just my preference.
