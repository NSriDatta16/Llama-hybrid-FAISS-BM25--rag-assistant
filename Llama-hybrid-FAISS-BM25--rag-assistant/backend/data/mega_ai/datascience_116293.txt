Target values close to 0 for a regression problem

I want to train a deep neural network to solve a regression problem with target values in range $[-1,1]$ . The problem is that most of these target values are really close to 0 (like $10^{-5}$ ), but there are also some values (a really small fraction) that are larger (closer to $1$ or $-1$ ). What is the best way to handle this problem?
