Can I set the password of a JDBC connection from the Connection Pool? (Tomcat 5.5.17)

I have a connection pool set in the tomcat server context.xml (connection used by several webapps so seems the best place for it). However, I don't like having passwords hard-coded in the file. Is there any way for me to retrieve the password from elsewhere (secure password store) and set it pragmatically at the time the pooled connections are established? Thank you Ryan
