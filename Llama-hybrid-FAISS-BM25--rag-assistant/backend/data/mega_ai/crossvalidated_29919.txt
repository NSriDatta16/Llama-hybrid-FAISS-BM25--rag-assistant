If this is a binary classification problem then it should be possible to apply an online SVM such as Bordes, A. and Bottou, L. , "The Huller: a simple and efficient online SVM", ECML 2005 . If this is a non-binary classification (i.e. more than 2 possible labels) you could look into kernel recursive least-squares techniques. They are made for online regression, but they perform pretty well for online classification too. Here's one basic KRLS algorithm: Y. Engel, S. Mannor and R. Meir , "The Kernel Recusrive Least Squares Algorithm", IEEE Trans. Signal Processing, 2004 . Both of these approaches will require fixed window-sizes in order to compare input vectors of the same size.
