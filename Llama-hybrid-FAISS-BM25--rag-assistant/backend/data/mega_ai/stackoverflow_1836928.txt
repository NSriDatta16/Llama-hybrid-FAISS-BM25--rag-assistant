You need to return false from the ondragstart event. I had this issue myself, and that's how I've solved it. It's an issue in IE7 as well. The problem is IE's drag and drop api, its standardisation into html5, and firefox's subsequent implementation of it. Others suggestions of using a javascript library for drag and drop won't work. (I was already using jquery UI), as this is a recent thing in firefox, and jQuery UI doesn't seem to account for it.
