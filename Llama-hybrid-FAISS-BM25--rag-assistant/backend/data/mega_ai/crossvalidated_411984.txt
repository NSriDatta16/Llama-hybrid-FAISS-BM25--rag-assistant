DNN architecture example

Could someone please give me an example (or where they have been used, if possible, link of a reference) of any NN architecture where a set of 1D CNNs are first used as feature extractor and then a set of RNNs to build a summary and then a FC DNN to finally give a classification output? Also, could someone explain in short the importance of RNN in this architecture? Why do we need them? Thanks!
