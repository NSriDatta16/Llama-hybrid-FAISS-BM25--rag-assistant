iPod touch debugging: Error on install/run only if app exists on device already?

I am using an iPod to test an app. The device is all set up with the right provisioning profiles, etc-- that's not really the issue. But every time I start the app from Xcode on the device, I get the "A signed resource has been added, modified, or deleted." error from the Organizer window. Wait, I know, you think it's a provisioning profile problem. But here's the kicker: if I just delete the app from the iPod (using the main screen) and try again, it works fine. I only get this error when the app is already installed. The other kicker is that this behavior doesn't happen on an iPhone that I have for occasional testing-- on that device, I can start/restart/restart indefinitely. But using the iPod, my compile-run-test cycle is annoyingly slow since I have to manually delete the app each time. Any ideas? I'm using Xcode 3.2.2 (prerelease) FWIW. The iPod has stock OS 3.1.2 on it. Thanks!
