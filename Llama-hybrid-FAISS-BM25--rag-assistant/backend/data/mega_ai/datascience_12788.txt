Average F1 Scores scikit-learn

I know there is f1_score metric to get all types of F1 scores (micro, macro, and weighted); however, I would like to be able to print micro averaged F1 score using classification_report of scikit-learn. By default, it seems to be returning weighted micro averaged F1. But I would like the micro averaged F1 in the classification_report . How do I do that? Also, I know the difference in the formula between weighted and microaverages, but what are the instances where one would be preferred over other? And, what information do they convey?
