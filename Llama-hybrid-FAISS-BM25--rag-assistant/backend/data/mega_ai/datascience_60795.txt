How to approach data prediction problem

I'm new to ML and data science. I would really like high level advice how to approach the following problem. I need to predict if an engine will fail, what I've is a sensor that give a certain value between 1 to 4 so a record might look like: 1243412312431444123123234234232423 Each record is 150 readings in length. I've a few millions of this records but in no particular order (i.e. the database doesn't contain explicit timestamp although by using some quirk database artifact I can make some records appear in order) I've 200 different engines and a label of "failed" and "active" for each one. So I'm looking for a predictive model that can predict (or detect) using the above data whether an engine failed or not. Any advice? Thanks, Eden
