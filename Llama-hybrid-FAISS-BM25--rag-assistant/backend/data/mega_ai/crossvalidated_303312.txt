A simple option would be to 'slice' the data along one of the dimensions, then create a series of plots visualizing the remaining dimensions (one plot for each level of the slice). For example, plot year, location, and count for each level of education. If there are many levels of education, you can bin the levels to obtain fewer plots in the sequence. You can also try slicing along different dimensions to obtain different views of the data. Another alternative would be to perform dimensionality reduction . For example, you can define a distance metric that quantifies the dissimilarity between data points (using all dimensions), then use multidimensional scaling , t-SNE , or various other algorithms to obtain a two or three dimensional representation that captures the structure of the data in some sense (as defined by your distance metric and chosen algorithm).
