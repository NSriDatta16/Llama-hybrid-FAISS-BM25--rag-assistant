Configuration storage setup [file vs. database]

I see programmers putting a lot of information into databases that could otherwise be put in a file that holds arrays. Instead of arrays, they'll use many tables of SQL which, I believe, is slower. CitrusDB has a table in the database called "holiday". This table consists of just one date column called "holiday_date" that holds dates that are holidays. The idea is to let the user add holidays to the table. Citrus and the programmers I work with at my workplace will prefer to put all this information in tables because it is "standard". I don't see why this would be true unless you are allowing the user, through a user interface, to add holidays. I have a feeling there's something I'm missing.
