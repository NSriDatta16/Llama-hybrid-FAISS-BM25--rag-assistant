How do I remove items from a 2-d array based on randomised conditions?

I have a small game (5 classes) being developed in XNA. There are balls bouncing around the window, moving at right-angles when colliding with the sides of the window. The user creates a marquee by dragging the mouse anywhere in the window. When the marquee is created and confirmed, every time a ball hits the marquee it is to be removed. I have my balls in a 2-d array, and I wondered how to remove the balls from this type of array. Currently I am doing the following: Rectangle ball = new Rectangle((moveBallX - 4), (moveBallY - 4), moveBallX, moveBallY); Rectangle marquee = new Rectangle(tempInitialX, tempInitialY, tempWidth, tempHeight); if (ball.Intersects(marquee)) { balls[rowIndex, columnIndex].SetRed(0); balls[rowIndex, columnIndex].SetGreen(0); balls[rowIndex, columnIndex].SetBlue(0); } This makes the balls that enter the marquee black, so as they become invisible. I want to do other things with the code such as display the number of balls remaining on the board, so being able to remove the items from the array would be useful. Thanks for your time.
