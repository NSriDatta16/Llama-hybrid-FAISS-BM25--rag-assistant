Best way to interact with an R session running in the cloud

I've got R running on amazon EC2, using a modified version of the bioconductor AMI . Currently, I am using putty to ssh into my server, starting R from the command line, and then copying and pasting my script from notepad++ into my putty session. The thing is, I hate cut and pasting. It feels stone-age and I occasionally get weird buffering issues that screw up my code. I can't use RStudio , because it doesn't support multicore , which I heavily depend on. What's the more elegant way to do this? /Edit: Thanks for all the great suggestions. For now, I've switched over to using foreach with the doRedis backend, which works great on my Mac, my PC, and on amazon through RStudio. This switch was pretty easy once I learned how to write a function that emulates "lapply" using "foreach." (Also, doRedis is awesome!)
