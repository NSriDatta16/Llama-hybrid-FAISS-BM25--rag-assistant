Removal of SQLite Database when Application is un-installed

I'm creating an app that uses SQLite as a data storage on BlackBerry OS 5.0. When it is removed from a device, I'd like to be diligent and remove the database from the phone. Although I can seem to find out plenty of information on Persistant Storage being removed on the removal of an app, I can't find anything about an SQLite database. Does anyone know a way of removing the database? By default, I'd be storing it on external media (SD Card) but information on removing it when storing it on eMMC-enabled devices would get an up-vote too. Thanks!
