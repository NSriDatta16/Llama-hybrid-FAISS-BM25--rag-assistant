As Robert Harvey wrote, a report is pretty good. Also, having ratios, such as that of failed logins to successful ones would be a nice statistic, for any particular user, and as an average. You can avoid images, and perhaps colour-code certain numbers once they get to a dangerous level (80% ratio of failed logins to good ones would be red, for example, indicating to the admin that there's something potentially wrong with the login form).
