Multimodality of mixtures of more than two Normal distributions

Let $$\phi(x;\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left(- \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$ denote the Gaussian density function ($\sigma > 0$). Let $$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \phi(x;\mu_i,\sigma_i)$$ denote an $N$-component mixture of normal densities, where $p_i\ge0$ and $\sum_i p_i = 1$. Depending on the parameters $p_i,\mu_i,\sigma_i$, the mixture density $f(x)$ can be unimodal, or have more than one peak. Ref. [1] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a mixture of two $(N=2)$ normal densities to be unimodal. Have there been any generalizations applicable to mixtures of more than 2 densities $(N > 2)$? If there are no rigid conditions, at least an approximate condition would satisfy me. I am mainly interested in the parameter regime $0 \le \mu \le 100$, $\sigma \approx \mu / 2$, and $0 \le p_i \le 1$ arbitrary. $N$ can be anything between 1 and 100. References [1] Robertson, C.
