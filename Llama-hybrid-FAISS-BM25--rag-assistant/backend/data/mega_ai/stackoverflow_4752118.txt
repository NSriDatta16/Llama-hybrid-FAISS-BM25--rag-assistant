You could be having problems with your connection string. It shouldn't be a variable in code, it should be set in your web.config and pulled from there. Here's mine in web.config: and here's I pull it from code: mcnn.ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyConnectionString"].ConnectionString; Also, If there is a spelling error, or if your missing something, in your connection string, you won't be able to even reach the database to attempt a log in. sql would have nothing to log. Could be worth double checking ^_^
