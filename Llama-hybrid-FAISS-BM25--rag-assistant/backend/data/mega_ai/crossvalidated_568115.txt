Bland-Altman plot correction for proportional bias

I am comparing 2 measurement methods with the Bland-Altman plot methodology. I found a proportional bias between the 2 measurement systems, by the regression model: difference = intercept + b1*average The parameters of the regression are: intercept = 18.44 b1 = -0.27 both are significant. How do I correct my new measurement scores with the parameters I found in the regression, so that I that both measurements have the same scores?
