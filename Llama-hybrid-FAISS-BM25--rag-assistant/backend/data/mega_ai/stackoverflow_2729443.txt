I have not enough information to solve the problem, but these tips might help you already: The link to your simpletip script seems absolute: -> is the www/public intended? Your page does not validate against a W3C HTML validator - which can cause trouble with DOM manipulation Your javascript throws errors (are you using prototype and jquery together? Be careful) You should use Firebug or Opera Dragonfly to see more details. Try making the page as small as possible (remove redundant stuff) and get it working there. Then upload (to a test directory first ;))
