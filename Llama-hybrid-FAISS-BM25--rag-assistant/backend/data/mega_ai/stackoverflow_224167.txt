Here's an idea: - Just before you create the alert window, stop the DragEvent event.stopImmediatePropagation(); store the event so we can resume if the user clicks the Yes button queuedEvent = event as DragEvent; show the alert window if the user clicks the yes button, resume the queued event dispatchEvent(queuedEvent);
