It sounds like the web service is using a self signed certificate. Frankly this isn't the best approach. Assuming you're a large organisation and it's internal you can setup your own trusted certificate authority, this is especially easy with Active Directory . From that CA the server hosting the Oracle service could request a certificate and you can use AD policy to trust your internal CA's root certificate by placing it in the trusted root of the machine store. This would remove the need to manually trust or accept the certificate on the web service. If the client machines are external then you're going to have to get the folks exposing the service to either purchase a "real" certificate from one of the well known CAs like Verisign, Thawte, GeoTrust etc. or as part of your install bundle the public certificate and install it into Trusted Root certificate authorities at the machine level on every machine. This has problems, for example no way to revoke the certificate, but will remove the prompt.
