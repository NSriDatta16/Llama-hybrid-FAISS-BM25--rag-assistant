For retrieval of network data by the server process, Boost.Asio as suggested by @radman is a good choice. Between server and local clients, Boost.Interprocess would be more efficient as this is interprocess data transfer, not requiring network usage. Each of these Boost libraries provides a ready-to-run wrapper around complex underlying Win32 APIs, so you will likely get a working solution faster by using the libraries than by building your own special-purpose code with equivalent function.
