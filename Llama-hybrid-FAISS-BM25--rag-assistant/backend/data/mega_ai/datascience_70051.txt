I finally understood "Bias and Variance" with Logistic Regression (LR). LR is known to have a high bias but low variance. For example, LR accuracy might be only at 90% while you'd get 95% with a Decision Tree (tends to overfit). But with LR in production feeding new data, you're very likely to see 90% accuracy ... while the Decision Tree had massive accuracy swings (variance) with new data (70% - 95%). Hope that helps.
