So long as the confidence interval is treated as random (i.e., looked at from the perspective of treating the data as a set of random variables that we have not seen yet) then we can indeed make useful probability statements about it. Specifically, suppose you have a confidence interval at level $1-\alpha$ for the parameter $\theta$ , and the interval has bounds $L(\mathbf{x}) \leqslant U(\mathbf{x})$ . Then we can say that: $$\mathbb{P}(L(\mathbf{X}) \leqslant \theta \leqslant U(\mathbf{X}) | \theta) = 1-\alpha \quad \quad \quad \text{for all } \theta \in \Theta.$$ Moving outside the frequentist paradigm and marginalising over $\theta$ for any prior distribution gives the corresponding (weaker) marginal probability result: $$\mathbb{P}(L(\mathbf{X}) \leqslant \theta \leqslant U(\mathbf{X})) = 1-\alpha.$$ Once we fix the bounds of the confidence interval by fixing the data to $\mathbf{X} = \mathbb{x}$ , we no longer appeal to this probability statement, because we now have fixed the data. However, if the confidence interval is treated as a random interval then we can indeed make this probability statement --- i.e., with probability $1-\alpha$ the parameter $\theta$ will fall within the (random) interval. Within frequentist statistics, probability statements are statements about relative frequencies over infinitely repeated trials. But that is true of every probability statement in the frequentist paradigm, so if your objection is to relative frequency statements, that is not an objection that is specific to confidence intervals. If we move outside the frequentist paradigm then we can legitimately say that a confidence interval contains its target parameter with the desired probability, so long as we make this probability statement marginally (i.e., not conditional on the data) and we thus treat the confidence interval in its random sense. I don't know about others, but that seems to me to be a pretty powerful probability result, and a reasonable justification for this form of interval. I am more partial to Bayesian methods myself, but the probability results backing confidence intervals (in their random sense) are powerful results that are not to be sniffed at. Moreover, even within the context of Bayesian analysis, where we let $\theta$ be a random variable with a prior distribution, we can see that the prior predictive probability that the confidence interval contains the parameter is equal to the confidence level. Thus, even within this alternative paradigm, the confidence interval can be regarded as an estimator that has powerful a priori prediction properties.
