Latent class analysis is a clustering algorithm. It’s main purpose is to find clusters in the data (latent classes). Decision tree is a classification algorithm. It doesn’t assume that the data is clustered, but it implicitly assumes data coming from a homogenous distribution. In classification you know the labels and want the algorithm to learn how to recreate them. In clustering you don’t know the labels, the algorithm finds a useful grouping for the data. I never heard of “LCA classification”, but I guess someone could use the name for latent class regression for logistic regression, but even in such case, it still does the clustering regardless of the labels. Decision tree may be more interpretable if you want to explain the classification decision. On another hand, if you need to explain what are the clusters in the data, decision tree does nothing related to solving this problem.
