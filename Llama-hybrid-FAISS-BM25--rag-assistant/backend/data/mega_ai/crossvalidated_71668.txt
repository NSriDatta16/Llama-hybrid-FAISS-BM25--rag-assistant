Your approach is basically correct but heavily depends on the strong distributional assumption you are making. If it is violated, even for very large samples, the confidence regions wont have the stated coverage probabilities. That's why statisticians try to avoid such reasoning if there are more robust methods available. There is actually an example (not related to confidence intervals but point estimation) where your approach is frequently used by applied statisticians: Assume you want to estimate the true 97.5% quantile e.g. to detect outliers. Often, instead of calculating the sample 97.5% quantile, researchers assume normality and estimate the true quantile by sample mean plus two standard deviations. If the underlying distribution is normal (which it usually has no reason to be), this estimate is more efficient than the one based on sample quantiles.
