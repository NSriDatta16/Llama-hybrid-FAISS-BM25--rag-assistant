Global optimization methods may be what you are looking for. DIRECT (Jones et al., 1993) is a relatively simple yet working gradient-free global optimization algorithm. It basically divide the search space into sub-rectangles during its search, so that's why it's named DIviding RECTangles. Bayesian Optimization (See Shariari et al., 2015 for the comprehensive review) is more sophisticated than DIRECT, and is a topic of intense research in the machine learning field. These algorithms are not direct descendents of the random search. However, they are "random" in a sense that they sometimes do exploration (instead of exploitation). They are "adaptive" in a sense that they do exploitation when a subregion in the search space looks promising.
