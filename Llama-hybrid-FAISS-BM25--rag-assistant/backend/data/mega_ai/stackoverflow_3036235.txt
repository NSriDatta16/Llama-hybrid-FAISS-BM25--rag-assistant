How to call an action from input component's onchange?

Given for example a SelectOneMenu, I can trigger valueChangeListeners or rerendering of page fragments via f:ajax: That's nice, but I want to do some more complicated stuff when the box changes (if validation is passed). Is there any possibility to call an action method on a bean using f:ajax when it's not attached to a UICommand component? Or, if not, how can I call a bean method in the "invoke application" phase when the value of the select box changes?
