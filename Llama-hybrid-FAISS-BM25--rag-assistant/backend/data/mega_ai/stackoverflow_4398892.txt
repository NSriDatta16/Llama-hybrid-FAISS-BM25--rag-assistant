Codeigniter + TankAuth + Swfupload not able to get the logger user id

I am using Codeigniter with the TankAuth library installed and trying to upload to index.php/requests/doUpload from swfupload but can't access the page as authenticated. I have read many posts around the net about similar problem and tried to set $config['sess_match_useragent'] = FALSE; but still no difference. I have ended up skipping the login check in my controller for testing purposes. But now I need to access tankAuth library from my controller to get the current logged in user ID. It is requested in my application and cannot skip it, I really need to pass the logged in user id to that doUpload model. I have setup controller like this: function doUploadFileFn() { if (!$this->tank_auth->is_logged_in()) { return; } else { $user_id = $this->tank_auth->get_user_id(); $this->load->model('requests/doUploadFile'); $this->doUploadFile->uploadData($user_id); } } Now, it does not pass the is_logged_in() check, as I learned from other posts, CI deletes the session but I have setup the config not to match the user agent but still not working. Is there any solution to this out there ?
