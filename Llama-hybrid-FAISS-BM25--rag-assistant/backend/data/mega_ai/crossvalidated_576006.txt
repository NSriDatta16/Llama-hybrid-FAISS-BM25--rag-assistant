This question has nothing to do with logistic regression per se, the problem and answers is the same for all generalized linear regression models. If you have only one categorical variable, just leave out the intercept, with more than one that will not be useful. See the earlier posts for details: Why is it necessary to "ignore" a level when applying sum contrasts? How to interpret regression function with categorical variable? Removing intercept from GLM for multiple factorial predictors only works for first factor in model But, however you parametrize your model (there will be many ways, no perfect), you can always just test the contrasts of interest after the fit!
