Here is an Example of using the win32 API to drive the mouse - actually used for drag and drop selection of an area, but you could change the coords to mouse down/up inside the button. POINT p; BOOL cursorPosGetSuccessful = GetCursorPos(&p); mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE | MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE, horA, verA, NULL, 0); mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, 0, 0, NULL, 0); mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE | MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE, horB, verB, NULL, 0); mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, 0, 0, NULL, 0); if (cursorPosGetSuccessful)// put the mouse back to roughly where it used to be before the scan. mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE | MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE, p.x, p.y, NULL, 0);
