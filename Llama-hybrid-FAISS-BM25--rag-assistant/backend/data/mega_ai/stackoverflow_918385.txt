I agree with Gandalf about the startup time. Also, you are allocating a huge HashSet which is not at all similar to your python code. I imaging if you put this under a profiler, a good chunk of time would be spent there. Also, inserting new elements is really going to be slow with this size. I would look into TreeSet as suggested.
