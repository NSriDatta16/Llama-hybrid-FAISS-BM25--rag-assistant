It may not be too complicated now, but a simple check to verify that it is still working as expected can be very useful later on if the method gets modified. Since the check should be really easy to write, why not do so? It helps the stats, and also helps give you a check later just in case it breaks. Also, for TDD, you would like 100% coverage, because then you can be sure (or very close to it) that you're not breaking anything when you refactor.
