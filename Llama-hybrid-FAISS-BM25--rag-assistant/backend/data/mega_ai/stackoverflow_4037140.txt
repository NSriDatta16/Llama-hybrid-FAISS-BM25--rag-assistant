Image resizer with 8 handles and drag & drop

I'm currently building a simple app that overlaps one image on top of another. The top one needs to be draggable and resizable. Initially I thought jQuery UI would be a good idea, there are two main issues with it: For some reason, Chrome doesn't like both behaviors even when they're imposed to different elements. I need 8 handles, just like the standard for any image manipulation software. Here's my code $(document).ready(function(){ $(".draggable").draggable(); $(".resizable").resizable({ handles: 'n, e, s, w, ne, se, sw, nw' }); }); I can't set both behaviors to the same element because it messes something up. What I need is something like jCrop , the only difference is that I'm not cropping an image, but overlapping one on top of another. The handles are exactly what I need but the current options won't let me change the resizable element since it's a div and I need an image. Thanks.
