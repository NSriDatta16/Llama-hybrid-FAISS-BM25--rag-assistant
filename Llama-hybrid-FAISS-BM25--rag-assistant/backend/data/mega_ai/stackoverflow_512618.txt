As a producer/consumer example, a batch reporting program be implemented with coroutines. The key hint for that example is having nontrivial work to consume input data (e.g. parsing data or accumulating charges and payments on an account), and nontrivial work to produce the output. When you have these characteristics, then: It is easy to organize/understand the input-side code if you can write units of work at various places. It is likewise easy to organize/understand the output-side code if it can read the next unit of work in a nested control structure. then coroutines and queues are both nice techniques to have at your disposal.
