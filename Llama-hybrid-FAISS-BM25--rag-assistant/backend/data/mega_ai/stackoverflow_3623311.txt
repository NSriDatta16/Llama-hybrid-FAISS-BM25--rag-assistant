i != -1 relies on the -1 being silently cast to a size_t , which seems fragile to me, so, of the alternatives you present, I'd definitely go with the post-decrement one. Another possibility (esp. if you don't actually need i in the loop body but just need to iterate on an array in reverse order) would be to wrap the array in a std:: -like container and use an iterator on the wrapper, with the rbegin and rend methods. E.g., Boost.Array would support the latter choice.
