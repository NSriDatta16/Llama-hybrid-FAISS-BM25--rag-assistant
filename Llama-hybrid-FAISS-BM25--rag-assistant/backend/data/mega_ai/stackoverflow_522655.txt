I like some of the comments in the GNU binutils. This one is from BFD som.c: /* You'll never believe all this is necessary to handle relocations for function calls. Having to compute and pack the argument relocation bits is the real nightmare. If you're interested in how this works, just forget it. You really do not want to know about this braindamage. */ This one too: /* Don't ask about these magic sequences. I took them straight from gas-1.36 which took them from the a.out man page. */ ... /* Keep track of exactly where we are within a particular space. This is necessary as the braindamaged HPUX loader will create holes between subspaces *and* subspace alignments are *NOT* preserved. What a crock. */ Another one: /* We will NOT put a fucking timestamp in the header here. Every time you put it back, I will come in and take it out again. ... */ From gas: /* Yes this is ugly (storing the broken_word pointer in the symbol slot). Still, this whole chunk of code is ugly, and I don't feel like doing anything about it. Think of it as stubbornness in action. */
