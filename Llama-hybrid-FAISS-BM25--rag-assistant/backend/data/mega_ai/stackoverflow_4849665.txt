First thing: thing: the operations you are using, doesn't require the facebooksdk library. Its sufficient to use official facebook c# sdk . So, if you think the facebook sdk a little complex, you can only use the official sdk. Second, You haven't entered the exception message, at least, I can't see. whatever sdk you are using, this is the core facebook api call. So, it shouldn't fail unless you have forgot to implement the access token retrieval part(remember, code and token are 2 different thing, don't get confused between those two). Also, you should take the result as "JSONObject result" , or at least cast it to for getting result. and to show the name use: "result.Dictionary["name"].String" statement instead. Hope this will help you solve your problem. Seems like you are beginning in facebook c# sdk, you can refer to my facebook graph api basics in c# article. Hope this will help too. Regards
