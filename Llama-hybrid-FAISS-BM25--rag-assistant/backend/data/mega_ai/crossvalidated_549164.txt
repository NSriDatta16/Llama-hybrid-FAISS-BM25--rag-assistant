Consider the following data. You can imagine the two groups as two months, and the two rows as two bills. Group A Group B 1 2 3 4 The overall average is equal to $2.5$ . The mean of A is $2$ , the mean of B is $3$ . The mean of $2$ and $3$ is $2.5$ , which is the same as the overall average. Now consider the following data, which has the same exact values, but is grouped differently. Group A Group B 1 2 3 4 The overall mean is still the same. The mean of A is $1$ , the mean of B is $3$ , and the mean of $1$ and $3$ is $2$ , which is not equal to the overall mean anymore. A similar argument can be made for variance, since you are using the mean when estimating the variance. Edit: how is all this relevant for your problem? Let's assume the following data for a given client. Month 1 Month 2 Car bill 100 120 Dentist bill 700 Trash bill 30 20 What you choose to calculate now depends on your research question. Suppose you are interested in the average bill price for this client, then you would calculate a simple average of all the bills, which is $194$ , and the standard deviation is $\approx 286$ . Suppose instead you were interested in the average monthly bill for this client, then you would first calculate an average for each month, and then average these. The mean of month 1 is $65$ , the mean of month 2 is $280$ , the mean of these two is $172.5$ , the standard deviation is $\approx 152$ . Conclusion: 1) the mean will not be the same if you have a different number of bills per month, 2) the variance/SD can vary greatly based on how you group your data.
