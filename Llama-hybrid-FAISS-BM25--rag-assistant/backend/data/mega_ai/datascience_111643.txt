I would try to apply techniques from the "changing point problem" world. In this kind of problem, you try to identify times when the probability distribution of a stochastic process or time series changes. This is a classic problem with classic solutions, so maybe you don't need a neural network to solve it. In your particular case, you're interested in the online version, this is, you have to detect the change in the distribution in real-time. I leave here some sources I've found that may be interesting Change detection in streaming data analytics: A comparison of Bayesian online and martingale approaches Bayesian online change point detection â€” An intuitive understanding Online change detection techniques in time series: An overview If you ask me, I would try a Bayesian approach, where you have a prior distribution on the defects rate and you update the distribution with incoming data. You could model the probability of receiving a defective segment as a beta distribution $B(x; \alpha, \beta)$ , which has the nice property that parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are updated as $$ \alpha_{t+1} = \alpha_t + s_t $$ $$ \beta_{t+1} = \beta_t + f_t $$ where $s_t$ is the number of segments without any defect at time $t$ and $\beta_t$ is the number of segments with defect at time $t$ . Therefore, after observing $T$ segments you would have $$ P = B(x; \alpha_T, \beta_T) $$ And with this distribution, you can implement strategies like "Stop the production if the defect rate is higher than some threshold $t$ with a probability $>95$ , ie: stop if $\int_{t}^1 B(x; \alpha_T, \beta_T) dx > 0.95$ "
