Honestly, your best bet is going to be avoiding storing the password in the DLL, as there is no persistent storage of non-static data within a DLL file. So you can store constants in DLLs, but not passwords. Now, if you want, you can store the user's password in a user specific registry key (encrypted I would hope :)) and then access that from the DLL, and that would let you have the illusion of storing the password in the DLL and get you kind of where you want to go. You can also look (if you're using 3.5+) into using C#'s internal settings mechanism - this would let you transparently write the data from the winform then read it from the DLL without having to worry about -WHERE- it's stored. Good luck!
