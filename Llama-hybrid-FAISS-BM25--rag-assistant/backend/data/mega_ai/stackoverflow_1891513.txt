Can I force gVim to open dragged-in files in a new tab?

I'd like gVim to open files dragged into it to open in a new tab, instead of replacing the current file. This question is on the right track, but I'd like to be able to run multiple instances of gVim, just able to drag files to the window I want. I'm running on Windows 7.
