Logistic Regression - Adding a polynomial basis to my input matrix make sense?

When I tried to run logistic regression on a 1500 X 35 input matrix, I obtained an error of 0.23 with 0 -1 loss. Then, I tried to add a polynomial basis of degree 2 or 3 to my matrix, which can be represented now like: $$1, X_1, X_1^2, X^3, X_2, X_2^2, ... X_N^3$$ I obtained 0.16 with degree 3 and 0.19 with degree 2 on my test error after running 10-fold cross validation. So the thing is I obtained a better result for sure, but I am wondering if adding a polynomial basis makes sense? Am I not corrupting my data here?
