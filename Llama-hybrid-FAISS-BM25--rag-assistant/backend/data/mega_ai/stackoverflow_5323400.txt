Where is your 'update' method? The edit is only called when you are loading the data and rendering the page the user will see to edit the record. When save/update/submit is clicked on that page, it should be calling the 'update' method in the controller. So, you should be able to put that same line into the 'update' method in the true condition of the if block that looks something like this: if @kase.update_attributes(params[:kase]) #your code would go here @kase.create_freeagent_project(current_user) if params[:send_to_freeagent] #the rest of the code would go here end
