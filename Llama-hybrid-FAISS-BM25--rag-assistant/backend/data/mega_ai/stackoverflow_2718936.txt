capturing dns packets using java

I want to log the websites visited in a system. So i decided to record the packets send by the system. I am using Jpcap API. I am able to record a lot of packets. Now what i want to do is i want to filter only DNS packets. I think that will be able to log the websites. I want a way to filter the DNS packets. How can I do it?
