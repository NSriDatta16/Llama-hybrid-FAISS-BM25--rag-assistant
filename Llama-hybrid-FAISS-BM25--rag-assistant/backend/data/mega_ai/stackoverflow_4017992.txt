An alternative answer to my other one ... this one specifically stops Elmah from logging the 404 errors generated by ZmEu, while leaving the rest of your sites behaviour unchanged. This might be a bit less conspicuous than returning messages straight to the hackers. You can control what sorts of things Elmah logs in various ways , one way is adding this to the Global.asax void ErrorLog_Filtering(object sender, ExceptionFilterEventArgs e) { if (e.Exception.GetBaseException() is HttpException) { HttpException httpEx = (HttpException)e.Exception.GetBaseException(); if (httpEx.GetHttpCode() == 404) { if (Request.UserAgent.Contains("ZmEu")) { // stop Elmah from logging it e.Dismiss(); // log it somewhere else logger.InfoFormat("ZmEu request detected from IP {0} at address {1}", Request.UserHostAddress, Request.Url); } } } } For this event to fire, you'll need to reference the Elmah DLL from your project, and add a using Elmah; to the top of your Global.asax.cs. The line starting logger.InfoFormat assumes you are using log4net. If not, change it to something else.
