Maybe there's a more elegant solution but you can create a canvas with the dimensions of your image, use drawImage to put your image on the canvas, use toDataURL with the MIME type that you want and get a data: URL which will be something like "data:image/png;base64," and then the base64 representation of the image in a given format. Oh, I've just read that it's on another server. Then you can't have the base64. Sorry. The only information you can get are the dimensions.
