Yes, it works properly. And it is more elegant in presentation. However, if I've learned correctly, not using the Zs variable as an accumulator makes it not tail recursive and thus less efficient. Also, using the reverse with the accumulator is more efficient than appending it together in correct order. This is, I believe, why the original would be in some cases more proper. But readability should trump efficiency where efficiency doesn't matter. Perhaps: merge(Xs, Ys) -> lists:reverse(merge(Xs, Ys, [])). merge([X|Xs], Ys, Zs) -> merge(Ys, Xs, [X|Zs]); merge([], [], Zs) -> Zs. This would merge the efficiency of the original with the concise comprehensibility of yours.
