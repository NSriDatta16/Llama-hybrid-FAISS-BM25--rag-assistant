Bulk user creation in Zend Framework. Already have single user creation for working

I am using Zend Framework I have a form that allows me to create a user. It has all of the necessary validation and it works well. I was tasked with creating a single page that allows me to create up to 25 new users with a single submit. example: salutation / first name / last name / email salutation / first name / last name / email salutation / first name / last name / email salutation / first name / last name / email How can I leverage the form I created for a single user and allow for each new user to get validated separately? Is there some way to have an array of forms or something else that will achieve the same thing?
