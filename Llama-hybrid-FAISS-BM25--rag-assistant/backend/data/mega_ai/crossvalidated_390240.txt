Predict when a user logins next

I am building a user login prediction system. This is my first time building any prediction system. Main aim is to predict when a user might login next in future. That is i need to predict "Time". I have a dataset of hundreds of users and when did they login. It is shown below. I only have login time and nothing else. no activity time or logout time. i have gigabytes of such data. +----+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----------------+ | Id | Time_Stamp | Login_Time | Day | Account_name | +----+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----------------+ | 1 | 2019-01-31 00:01:35.818000 | 00:01:35.818000 | Thursday | user1 | | 2 | 2019-01-31 00:01:35.885000 | 00:01:35.885000 | Thursday | user2 | | 3 | 2019-01-31 00:01:26.335000 | 00:01:26.335000 | Thursday | user2 | | 4 | 2019-01-31 00:01:35.885000 | 00:01:35.885000 | Thursday | user1 | | 5 | 2019-01-31 00:01:26.336000 | 00:01:26.336000 | Thursday | user2 | | 6 | 2019-01-31 00:01:29.842000 | 00:01:29.842000 | Thursday | user3 | | 7 | 2019-01-31 00:01:35.819000 | 00:01:35.819000 | Thursday | user4 | | 8 | 2019-01-31 00:01:26.336000 | 00:01:26.336000 | Thursday | user7 | | 9 | 2019-01-31 00:01:35.821000 | 00:01:35.821000 | Thursday | user5 | | 10 | 2019-01-31 00:01:35.886000 | 00:01:35.886000 | Thursday | user4 | +----+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----------------+ My approach 1) Store data into data base and get data for each user as the original dataset has data combined for all users. 2) Run machine learning algorithms on each user and predict when he will login next 3) cross verify predicted result with actual result when the user does login. Machine learning algorithm I am thinking is linear regression or SVM but the issue is in some user the data is too less and some is too much. so I need some algorithm which will work for both. Also I am planning to combine pattern recognition and time series prediction algorithms to get more accuracy. Another issue is what variable should i take into account. Should I just pass login date and login time of each user and let the algorithm predict next? or is there any better way? i need suggestion whether my approach is correct or not? How can I predict time? Do libraries support that or do I need to write my own algorithm? Most Machine learning problems take some sort of numbers into consideration like stock market prediction but how should i take "time" into consideration?
