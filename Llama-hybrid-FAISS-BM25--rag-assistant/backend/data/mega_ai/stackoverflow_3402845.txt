Maybe you can leverage someone else's work and get a headstart. The makers of NetDrive for instance offer an SDK - not sure what that requires / costs, however. But it might be worth an inquiry, no? And maybe, if you combine this approach to define a remote FTP site as a Windows network share, and then use this code in C# to mount a network share as a drive, you might get your job done :-)
