It sounds like you might be asking how to aggregate the sample standard deviations in a set of groups to get the sample standard deviation in the pooled data that combines those groups. The sample standard deviation of the pooled data is not the average of the sample standard deviations of the groups, and the actual formula is a bit more complicated than that (see e.g., O'Neill 2021 ). So long as you have the sample sizes, sample means and sample standard deviations (or variances) of each group, you can compute sample the sample variance of the pooled data with the sample.decomp function in the utilities package . The method is described in the linked paper and you can also find examples of how to use the function here , here and here .
