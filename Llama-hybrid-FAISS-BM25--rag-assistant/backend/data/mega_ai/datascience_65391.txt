this answer may be late, but one really good way of going about this problem would be to develop a transformer network, read the paper " attention is all you need " by google, there are a lot of datasets available online, you can either use them or you can create your own dataset by crawling Reddit or some other social networking site or anything, focus only on data that comes under your use case, don't take in random conversations in your dataset ( yes our dataset should be in conversation form )
