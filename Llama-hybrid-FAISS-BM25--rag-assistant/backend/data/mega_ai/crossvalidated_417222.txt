Simulating a queue in R

It's noted that the number of folks in a stationary system will maintain an average equal to the rate of arrival multiplied by the mean of the service distribution. Where the formula $L = \lambda$ is valid for any queuing model in steady state. $L$ and $w$ are longterm steadystate average values, respectively. \lambda denotes the arrival rate to the system. Where we can add up the total time in the system as: $\sum w_{j} = \sum i T_i$ And let $T_i$ represent the time units in which $i$ entities were in the system. But things are always more interesting with sample sizing and simulating result, so say in 5000 iterations we estimate a state of a system in 1-min intervals, between the first minute and the last arrival at a determined time. So if use a random interarrival rate of $\lambda = 2$ per minute and the service distribution is $N(8,1)$ minutes for the system. How can I model this is R, using rexp() and rnorm() ? So far this is what I came up thus far lambda Provided the $\mu$ we expect that the interarrivals is about half a minute mean(interarrivals) = .516 service.times where the service distribution is $N(8,1)$ arrival.times Where I am having is determining at time 1-min to the last, how many individuals remain in the system... Having issues conceptualizing the model ~ this is what you are supposed to estimate (Little's law), which states that rate of arrival = 2 units per minute * mean of the service distribution = 8. Also, I don't know how to convert to ts() for plotting.
