Number of parameters in CNN

I'm trying to understand the convolutional neural network and especially its parameters. I found several formulas on the internet, but I cannot understand them. For example: ((filter_size*filter_size)*stride+1)*filters) What is the number of filters here? Does it mean, that we train different size*size weights for every stride that we do, and the total number of strides will be the number of filters?
