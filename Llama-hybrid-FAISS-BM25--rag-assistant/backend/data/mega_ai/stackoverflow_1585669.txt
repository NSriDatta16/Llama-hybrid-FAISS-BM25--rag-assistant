You could store them as protected variables in your asp.net page's code-behind, and then use databinding expressions to store them as public variables in your javascript ... In your ASPX page: var regexPhone = new RegExp(" "); var regexEmail = new RegExp(" "); var regexBlah = new RegExp(" "); In your code-behind: protected string regexPhone = "put regex string here"; protected string regexEmail = "put regex string here"; protected string regexBlah = "put regex string here"; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { // We need to call DataBind() on the page so that // we can use databinding expressions DataBind(); } While I've never tried this exact approach before, I think it would work :-P Let me know if it helps! Note: A possible caveat here would be that the .NET Regular Expression flavor may differ from the JavaScript Regular Expression flavor. The great Jan Goyvaerts has an impressive comparison chart which may be helpful.
