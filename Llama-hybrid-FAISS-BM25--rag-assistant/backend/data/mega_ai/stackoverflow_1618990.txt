You will get it all or nothing. But there is no particular guarantee that you will receive packets exactly once in the order they were transmitted; packet loss, reordering and (less often) duplication are all possible. There is a maximum frame size (of 65,507 bytes), send()ing packets of larger sizes will return an error. You must provide enough buffer to receive the entire frame in one call. UDP packets CAN be fragmented into multiple IP fragments, but the OS will drop an incomplete packet. This is therefore transparent to the application.
