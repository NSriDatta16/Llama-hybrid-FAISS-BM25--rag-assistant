(Revisiting this problem while trying to close out old lme4 issues) On reflection, I just don't think it makes sense to build a binomial (Bernoulli) GLMM where the responses don't vary at all within levels of the grouping variable. If we do something like this (i.e. each frog has either all-zero or all-one responses), then we can make the model fit perfectly by allowing the random effects for each frog to go to -infinity (for 0 responses) or +infinity (for 1 responses). When I fit this model using the latest development version of lme4 , I get a very large standard deviation for the frog random effect and non-significant values for all of the predictors, which is consistent with my diagnosis. I do get some wonky results -- in particular, I get an AIC for the full model that is more than 2 units worse than for the one-parameter-reduced model, which should be impossible. I conclude that the model specification is, more or less, pathological ... (I agree that glmer should tell you that something is wrong, but I think it has an excuse when trying to fit a model that turns out not to be sensible.) My recommendation would be to collapse all of the predictors for each individual frog by averaging them (you could use other summary statistics [median, maximum, minimum, etc.], or more than one, if you thought it was more appropriate) and then do a regular GLM fit on the reduced data. This is analogous, although I think not quite identical, to Murtaugh (2007)'s suggestion of reducing nested ANOVA analyses to their aggregated equivalents (in a nested design, the treatment variables are identical for all individuals within a group; in this case, the response variables are identical ...) This will mean you only have 23 frogs left, but I actually think that's a more realistic representation of the amount of data you have. Similarly to the way that things work when you aggregate data from a nested design, the aggregation should give you a better estimate of the characteristic habitat of an individual ...
