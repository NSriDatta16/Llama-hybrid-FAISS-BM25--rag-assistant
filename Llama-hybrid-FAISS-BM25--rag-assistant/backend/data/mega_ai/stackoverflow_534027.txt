I would point out that having clean code is a sign of a organized and intelligent mind. However, the real killer will be when he writes a large amount of code. I doubt you will be able to convince him because more than likely he is getting excited about the logic of the app and not the process. It will take experience to teach him a harsh lesson. So here are my suggestions. Give him a project full of messy unformatted poorly named code and let him suffer. Encourage him to work on a project with a large code base and let him see how well he remembers his own variable names after the 1,000th source file.
