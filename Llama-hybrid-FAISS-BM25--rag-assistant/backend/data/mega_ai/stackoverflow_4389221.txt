Drag/Move Multiple Selected Features - OpenLayers

I know that I can easily allow a user to select multiple Features/Geometries in OpenLayers but I then want enable the user to easily drag/move all of the selected features at the same time. With the ModifyFeature control it only moves one feature at a time ... is there a way to easily extend this control (or whatever works) to move all of the selected features on that layer?
