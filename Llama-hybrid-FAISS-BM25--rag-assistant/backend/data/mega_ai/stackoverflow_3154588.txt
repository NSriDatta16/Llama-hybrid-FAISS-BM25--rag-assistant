C# - swap Last,First MI fastest way

Ok, I can certainly do this with some IndexOf, or even a Split(), but I thought I'd throw this out as a bit of a performance teaser. I have data - like 100K's of these - in LastName,FirstName Mi and I need to make it FirstName Mi Lastname. I think that SubString/IndexOf(',') can do the job, but was hoping for a more elegant/performant suggestion. Any better ideas?
