Is there "rule of 30" in machine learning

In the Deep Learning course on Udacity, the instructor mentioned "rule of 30", means that your new method / algorithm ... can be considered as "significant improvement" if it can improve the results on at least 30 items on test set. However, he did not provide the source. Could you give me the reference for this information?
