For a deep dive into all sorts of possible issues that can come up in practical application of policy gradient, have a look at this paper: A Closer Look at Deep Policy Gradients Some common ways to improve policy gradient methods is: Confine the updates to a "trust region" near the current policy (see TRPO and PPO). Introduce a value network (called Critic in Actor-Critic) which can be used to subtract a baseline that reduces variance in policy-gradient learning.
