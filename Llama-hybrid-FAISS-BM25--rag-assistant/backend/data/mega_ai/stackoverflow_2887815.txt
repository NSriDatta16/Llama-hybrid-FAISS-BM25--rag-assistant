Speeding up Math calculations in Java

I have a neural network written in Java which uses a sigmoid transfer function defined as follows: private static double sigmoid(double x) { return 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-x)); } and this is called many times during training and computation using the network. Is there any way of speeding this up? It's not that it's slow, it's just that it is used a lot, so a small optimisation here would be a big overall gain.
