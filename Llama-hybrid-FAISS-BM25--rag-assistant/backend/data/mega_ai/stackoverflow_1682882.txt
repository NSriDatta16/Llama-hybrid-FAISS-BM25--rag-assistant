making LWP Useragent faster

I need to perform a large number of HTTP post requests, and ignore the response. I am currently doing this using LWP::UserAgent. It seems to run somewhat slow though I am not sure if it is waiting for a response or what, is there anyway to speed it up and possibly just ignore the responses?
