Which one is the message and which one the entity in HTTP terminology?

I am trying to make better sense of HTTP internals, and often "entities" and "messages" are mentioned in the specification, strangely enough without proper explanation though, believe it or not. From what I gathered, one identifies the content itself, even when split across a request / response chain and/or transfer encoding fragmentation rules, while the other identifies content of a single HTTP request - i.e. what follows the headers and ends with a CRLF. My problem is I cannot figure out which one is which exactly.
