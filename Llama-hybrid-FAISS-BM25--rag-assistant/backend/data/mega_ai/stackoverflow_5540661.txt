When I rotate the phone, the Droid goes into landscape mode and the background no longer fits correctly. How do I tell the App it needs to use landscape mode when I'm not using a layout? If you alreay detect the rotation, then the Device class is the way to go. Second, when I run this app on the Xoom, it picks the mdpi drawable which is nowhere near the size of the Xoom screen. How do I define a second mdpi drawable that has a 1200x800 size? You can use various image folders dependending on the resolution of the device: ldpi, mdpi, hdpi or xhdpi. You should take a look at the following page for proper support of various resolutions and screen sizes.
