Is ECMAScript really a dialect of Lisp?

A friend of mine drew my attention the welcome message of 4th European Lisp Symposium : ... implementation and application of any of the Lisp dialects, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, AutoLisp, ISLISP, Dylan, Clojure, ACL2, ECMAScript , ... and then asked if ECMAScript is really a dialect of Lisp. Can it really be considered so? Why? Is there a well defined and clear-cut set of criteria to help us detect whether a language is a dialect of Lisp? Or is being a dialect taken in a very loose sense (and in that case can we add Python, Perl, Haskell, etc. to the list of Lisp dialects?)
