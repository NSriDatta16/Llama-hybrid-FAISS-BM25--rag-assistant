I would recommend tab delimiting each field and carriage-return delimiting each record. Within each string, Replace all characters that would affect the field and record interpretation and rendering. This would include control characters (U+0000–U+001F, U+007F–U+009F), non-graphical line and paragraph separators (U+2028, U=2029), directional control characters (U+202A–U+202E), and the byte order mark (U+FEFF). They should be replaced with escape sequences of constant length. The escape sequences should begin with a rare (for your application) character. The escape character itself should also be escaped. This would allow you to append new records easily. It has the additional advantage of being able to load the file for visual inspection and modification into any spreadsheet or word processing program, which could be useful for debugging purposes. This would also be easy to code, since the file will be a valid UTF-8 document, so standard text reading and writing routines may be used. This also allows you to convert easily to UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE if desired, without complications. Example: U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION becomes ~TB U+000A LINE FEED becomes ~LF U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN becomes ~CR U+007E TILDE becomes ~~~ etc. There are a couple of reasons why tabs would be better than commas as field delimiters. Commas appear more commonly within normal text strings (such as English text), and would have to be replaced more frequently. And spreadsheet programs (such as Microsoft Excel) tend to handle tab-delimited files much more naturally.
