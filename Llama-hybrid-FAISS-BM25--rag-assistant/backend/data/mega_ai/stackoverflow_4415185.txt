Using VoiceXML built-in types in SRGS grammar

I am trying to create a custom grammar for a sentence containing a number, e.g. (Revenue increased by 34.5 billion dollars). A rule that I created using W3C specification looks like: To pick up the numeric part of the sentence, I want to leverage a built-in type of VoiceXML (e.g.) or alternatively use some sort of library for number patterns. The last alternative would be to create a set of rules from scratch to recognize any number. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
