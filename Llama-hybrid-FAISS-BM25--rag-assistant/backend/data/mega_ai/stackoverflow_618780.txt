Of what relevance is PDO_SQLITE? Unless you actually plan on using the SQLite driver then compatibility is not mandated by PDO. If you aren't going to use SQLite then I would make the legacy database layer PDO compatible and re-use the connections until you can fully migrate to Doctrine. That said, the level of connections is not going to be your only performance concern moving to an ORM. They are inherently inefficient so I'd expect slower queries, higher bandwidth use between application servers and the database servers and higher memory use at the application level due to redundant data inevitably getting selected. Depending on your current setup, the above may or may not be issues. You should probably take that last paragraph with a pinch of salt though because they are just traits of ORMs in general and not Doctrine in particular, with which I've had no experience.
