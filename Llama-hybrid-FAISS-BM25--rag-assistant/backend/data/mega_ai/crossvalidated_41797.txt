Entropy estimation is a surprisingly difficult problem. The fundamental issue is that your estimate is heavily biased by "unobserved" events (which nevertheless have nonzero probability). There are quite a few different entropy estimators designed specifically to address this problem. For instance, see the BUB esimator by Liam Paninski, the NSB estimator by Nemenman et al, the coverage-adjusted estimator by Vu et al (also see Chao et al, 2003), and the PYM estimator by Archer et al . There are many other papers that address the problem. Each has a somewhat different approach, and some may be more appropriate under different situations. Several of the papers I suggest provide free code online which automatically computes an estimate and measure of confidence. You may also be interested in this and the R package 'entropy' .
