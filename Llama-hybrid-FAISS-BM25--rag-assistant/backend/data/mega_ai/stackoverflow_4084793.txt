What a cleartool diff -pred myFile gives you when executed in your snapshot view path? cd c:\path\to\my\snapshotView\myVob\path_to_myFile cleartool diff -pred myFile If the global path is incorrect, it can be because of: an incorrect mktag ( cleartool man mktag ), as kolslorr mentions in his answer . Don't forget to specify the host of the view storage as well as its global path (see "Renaming a ClearCase VOB or View" ) an incorrect region (see your ClearCase control panel): the view might be correctly defined in another region
