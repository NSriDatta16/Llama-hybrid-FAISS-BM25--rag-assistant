I will assume $a=0$ and $b=1$ in the following. Here is a simulation experiment to look at the variability of the expectation in $M$ : e=rep(0,N) f=matrix(0,T,N) for(t in 1:T){ phi2=runif(N) we=runif(N)/(1-phi2) f[t,]=cumsum(we*(5-4*phi2))/cumsum(we) e=e+f[t,]} with the plot of the averaged e (in red) against the f[t,] 's (in gray): The expectation thus appears to decrease with $M$ . Due to the lack of expectation of the individual weights $\sigma^2_{0,i}/(1-\varphi_i^2)$ , it is unclear that the average within the expectation enjoys a finite variance, as indicated by the repeated jumps in the individual gray curves. Note that an equivalent expression for the expectation is $$1+4\mathbb E^{U,W}\left[\sum_{i=1}^M U_i\Big/\sum_{i=1}^M W_i \right]$$ with $$(U_i,W_i)\sim \frac{u}{w^2}\mathbb I_{(0,1)}(u)\mathbb I_{w>u}$$ by a change of variables and that it is approximately $$1+2\mathbb E^{W}[\overline W_M^{-1}]\tag{1}$$ for $M$ large. (Or asymptotically equivalent by Slutsky's theorem.) Note also that the marginal distribution of the $W_i$ 's is $$W\sim \frac{(w\wedge 1)^2}{2w^2}=\frac{\mathbb I_{0 1}}{2w^2}$$ This means that an asymptotic equivalent to (1) is $$1+4\mathbb E^{W}[1\big/(\overline S_{M/2}+\overline R_{M/2})]$$ where $$\overline S_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n U_i\qquad \overline R_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n V_i^{-1}\qquad U_i,V_i\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1)$$ hence $$1+8\mathbb E^{W}[1\big/(1+2\overline R_{M/2})]$$ Comparing the distribution of $$1+4\sum_{i=1}^M U_i\Big/\sum_{i=1}^M W_i$$ with the distribution of $$1+8\big/(1+2\overline R_{M})$$ does not exhibit any significant difference: The distribution of a sum of Pareto variates is particularly intricate . However, the limiting distribution of the centred average is a stable distribution. Namely, $$\frac{\overline{R}_M-\log(M)-C}{\pi/2}\approx F_{1,1}$$ where $C\equiv 0.8744...$ and $F_{1,1}$ is the stable distribution for $\alpha=\beta=1$ . With cdf $$F_{1,1}(x)=2\left(1-\Phi(2/\sqrt\pi \exp\{-1/2-\pi x\sqrt2/4)\}\right)$$
