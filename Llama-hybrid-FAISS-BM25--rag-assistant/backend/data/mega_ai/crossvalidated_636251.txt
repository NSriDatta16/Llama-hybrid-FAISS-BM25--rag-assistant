Prediction interval for linear regression on seasonal data in R

I am using the following code to perform a generalized linear regression which produces a satisfying prediction for this highly seasonal time series. i am just not very satisfied with the prediction interval. library(tidyverse) df pivot_longer(names_to = "Month", values_to = "Value", -Year) |> mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.abb)) m filter(Year mutate(time = 2010 +(row_number()-0.5)/12) |> ggplot(aes(x = time)) + labs(x = "", y = "", linetype = "", fill = "", color = "") + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_pi, ymax = upper_pi, fill = "95% pi"), alpha = 1) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci, fill = "95% ci"), alpha = 1) + geom_line(aes(y = Predicted, linetype = "Predicted")) + geom_line(aes(y = Value, linetype = "Observed")) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 2020, color = "End of training period")) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, NA)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2010, 2022, 1), minor_breaks = NULL) + theme(legend.position = "top") I would expect it to look a lot more like this boxplot diagram showing much smaller variance in summer time. df |> filter(Year ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = Value)) + geom_boxplot() What am I doing wrong here?
