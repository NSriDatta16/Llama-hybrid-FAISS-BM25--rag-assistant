What is the best way in PHP to reduce an array by an array of known keys?

I am browsing the array functions in PHP, trying to find the magical wand(s) to do this. Here is what I have. $images = array(...); $randomImages = array_rand($images, 3); // Now I want to reduce $images by the keys in $randomImages What PHP array functions can I leverage for this? Update I ended up answering my own question after digging for a while, but I'm still open to alternate solutions :)
