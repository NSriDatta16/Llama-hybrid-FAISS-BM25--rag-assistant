What´s the single most influential database book or tutorial every DBA should read?

I am looking to learn more about databases (MySQL for starters), particularly about choosing the right approach (e.g. stored procedures vs views and triggers for data aggregation) in a situation. Maybe this example shows what I mean: Yesterday I asked a general SQL question about aggregation of data and received the answer that "it depends" – which turned out to be absolutely correct. Now I am looking for some database lectures that covers scenarios as opposed to focusing on syntax. Though I encourage everybody to suggest the obvious too, I think the standard normalization / relational stuff is easy to find – personally I am rather looking for practical examples in different kinds of application.
