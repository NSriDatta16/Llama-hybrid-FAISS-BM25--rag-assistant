One challenge is that 13 weeks and 3 months are not necessarily the same time period: September to November is 91 days and 13 weeks, but October to December is 92 days. But let's not focus on that. The simplest approach would be to post-process your forecasts, scaling both to achieve the same sum. One possibility for the target common sum would be the average of the two: $$ S := \frac{S_1+S_2}{2}, $$ but you could use any other value for $S$ , like $S:=S_1$ (scaling the monthly predictions to equal the sum of the weekly ones), or $S:=S_2$ (the other way around). Once you have $S$ , simply scale all the weekly predictions by a factor of $\frac{S}{S_1}$ , and all the monthly ones by a factor of $\frac{S}{S_2}$ . Then the new weekly forecasts and the new monthly forecasts will both sum up to $S$ . If you want to delve deeper, there are some papers on the Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (MAPA) like Kourentzes et al. (2014) where you take forecasts on different temporal granularities and optimally combine them along the grouping hierarchy , but this is a bit more advanced and more general.
