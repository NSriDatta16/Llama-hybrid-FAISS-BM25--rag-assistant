Keep multiple trials for each patient in analysis, or average across trials?

I have a sample of 10. Each patient completes a walking task twice. Is it reasonable to use both trials in my analysis? I get scale data. I see the patients at two different time points. To clarify. Each patient performs a walking task twice on one visit. The technology I employ to extract the gait data only gives me averages fro each task. So I have two averages for each patient at each visit. My question is can I use both averages from these trials in my analysis? Or do I have to take an average across the two trials? I would like to explore the difference between the two time points.
