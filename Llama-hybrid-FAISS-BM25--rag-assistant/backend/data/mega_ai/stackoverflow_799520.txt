Is a good idea to put all projects in the same trunk?

We understand the default and usually recommended svn repository organization, in case of having multiple projects, is something like this: root/projectA/(trunk, branches, tags) root/projectB/(trunk, branches, tags) ... Our projects have a lot of interdependence, and that would demand an extense use of svn:externals between them, considering we don't do dll referencing to internal projects, we'd prefer to view their source code instead of working with binaries. Using externals too much, when branching repositores, syncing changes, can become a complex and error-prone experience, so the team didn't trust this solution at all. So a team member suggested something that we all think this could be a better solution: put all projects in the same trunk. At first, we recognized some problems with this approach, but as a whole we agree these problems are based on hypotethical situations that very probably we'd never experience. Do you see some serious problems we may have with this solution?
