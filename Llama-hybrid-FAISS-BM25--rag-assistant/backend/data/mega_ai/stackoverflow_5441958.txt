embedding flash using swfobject in drupal 6.x dimensions issue

I embedded flash to my site using this: print swf('myflash.swf'); into my page.tpl file however it is not recognizing the orig dimensions when using this: print swf('myflash.swf',array('height'=>400,'width'=>700)); But the flash is showing up, only the dimensions had the problems. I have been searching and searching around in Google and drupal forums to no avail for a few days now.. If anyone out there had the same issue please help I am so stuck!
