Extract a specific string from a curl'd result

Given this curl command: curl --user-agent "fogent" --silent -o page.html " http://www.google.com/search?q=insansiate " * Spelling is intentionally incorrect. I want to grab the suggestion as my result. I want to be able to either grep into the page.html file perhaps with grep -oE or pipe it right from curl and never store a file. The result should be: 'instantiate' I need only the word 'instantiate', or the phrase, whatever google is auto correcting, is what I am after. Here is the basic html that is returned: Did you mean: instantiate &nbsp;&nbsp; Top 2 results shown So perhaps from/to of the string below, which I hope is unique enough to cover all my bases. class=spell> instantiate &nbsp;&nbsp; I keep running into issues with greedy grep; perhaps I should run it though an html prettify tool first to get a line break or 50 in there. I don't know of any simple way to do so in bash, which is what I would ideally like this to be in. I really don't want to deal with firing up perl, and making sure I have the correct module. Any suggestions, thank you?
