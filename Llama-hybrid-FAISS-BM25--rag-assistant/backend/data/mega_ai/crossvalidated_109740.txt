As @whuber hints, these are not quite the same, but in practice we assess the conditional variance of the response variable ${\rm Var}(y|x)$. The key issue is that of the errors versus the residuals . It is a very subtle topic. The errors are the deviations of observed data from the expected values, $y_i - {\rm E}[y_i|x_i]$, whereas the residuals are the differences between the observed values and the model's predicted values, $y_i - \hat y_i$. Importantly, $\hat y_i$ only necessarily equals ${\rm E}[y_i|x_i]$ 'at' infinity (and even then only if the estimator is consistent ), in the short run, they are almost certainly different. Thus, the residuals you have are not identical to the true errors. Moreover, the assumption of homoscedasticity pertains to the errors, not the residuals. However, when we want to check the assumption, we don't have access to the true errors, so we use the residuals instead. (Even this part is more complicated, because the observations typically have different amounts of leverage and so the residuals don't all have the same standard deviation. As a result, we don't check the raw residuals that I mentioned above, but the standardized residuals instead. For more about that it may help to read my answer here: Interpreting plot.lm .)
