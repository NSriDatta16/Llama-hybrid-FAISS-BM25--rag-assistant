Yes, there is no problem with ARIMA/ETS with forecasting a full seasonal cycle of 24 data points ahead. I think you may be misunderstanding the way that ARIMA and ETS deal with seasonality. ARIMA takes period-over-period differences (i.e., looking at the difference of the time series between point $t$ and point $t-24$ ), and then models this difference using ARIMA. Thus, we don't just look back 6 periods - we may be looking back 6 seasonal periods . This is actually a very rough approximation to what is actually happening. See here for the actual details. ETS or exponential smoothing does something similar. In the smoothing formulation, you would have a seasonal shape consisting of 24 (additive or multiplicative) indices, one for every hour of the day. And with every observation, you update only the entry corresponding to the current hour. And again, you can apply this to the separately smoothed level and trend components to get seasonal forecasts. Here is an explanation of seasonal smoothing. If the daily seasonality is dominant in your series, I would expect SARIMA or ETS forecasts to be quite competitive with more complex approaches that model possible multiple seasonalities. In any case, I would use a seasonal forecast::auto.arima() and forecast::ets() forecast as benchmarks. They will certainly be faster in fitting than forecast::bats() or forecast::tbats() .
