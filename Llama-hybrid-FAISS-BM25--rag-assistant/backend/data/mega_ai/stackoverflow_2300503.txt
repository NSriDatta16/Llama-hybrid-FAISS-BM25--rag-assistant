The latest SVN version of OpenCV contains an (undocumented) implementation of HOG-based pedestrian detection. It even comes with a pre-trained detector and a python wrapper. The basic usage is as follows: from cv import * storage = CreateMemStorage(0) img = LoadImage(file) # or read from camera found = list(HOGDetectMultiScale(img, storage, win_stride=(8,8), padding=(32,32), scale=1.05, group_threshold=2)) So instead of tracking, you might just run the detector in each frame and use its output directly. See src/cvaux/cvhog.cpp for the implementation and samples/python/peopledetect.py for a more complete python example (both in the OpenCV sources).
