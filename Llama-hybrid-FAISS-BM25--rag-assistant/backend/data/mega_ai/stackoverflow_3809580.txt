Bundling version control software with product

I was wondering if its possible to bundle version control software with a product, so customers can use it to version control the configuration files required for the final product to run. So far, searching has only given me pointers to using SVN/Git etc. for versioning source code within an organization. Are there any examples of using API(if any) provided by SVN/Git for bundling version control within a final product?
