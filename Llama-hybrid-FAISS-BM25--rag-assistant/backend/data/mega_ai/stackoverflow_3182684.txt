Page_Init : Fired when page is initialised. This includes postbacks. All server controls are created to their initial, unaltered state. First step in page lifecycle, controls are organized hierarchically. Page_Load : Controls fully loaded, if the page is a postback, then the controls are loaded with their viewstate. In other words, Viewstate only comes into effect on Page_Load, where (if Viewstate is enabled for the control/page), the controls previous state is reloaded. Hope that helps.
