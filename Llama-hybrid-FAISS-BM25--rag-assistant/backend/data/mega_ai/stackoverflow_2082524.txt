It’s not possible with the code you’re currently using. Because the text fragments are text nodes that are only represented by anonymous inline boxes that can not be styled with display separately. But if you put the text that’s surrounding the a element also in elements, e.g. span s: This container has a link in it Then you can do this: #container span { display: none; } #container a { display: block; }
