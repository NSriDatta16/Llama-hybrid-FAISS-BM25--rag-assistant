Best practice for writing a self-updating windows service

We need to create a windows service that has the ability to self update. Three options spring to mind, a second service that manages the retrieval, uninstallation and installation of the first service. Use of some third party framework (suggestions welcome. I believe .NET supports automatic updating for windows forms apps, but not windows services) Use of a plugin model, whereby the service is merely a shell containing the updating and running logic, and the business logic of the service is contained in a DLL that can be swapped out. Can anyone shed some light on the solution to this problem? Thanks
