Sometimes an effective approach is to start by working out what your method signatures need to look like (this is commonly achieved using interfaces ; I'm guessing you haven't gotten there in your course yet, though). Here are a couple of examples. Assignment Public class method to get each integer number input. Hint The description indicates that the method will get input; this typically takes the form of a parameter to the method. public void CollectInput(double input); Assignment Public class method to calculate the average of the numbers input. Hint The description mentions calculating a value; such a method will almost certainly return the result of its calculation. Presumably the values involved in the calculation are stored by the Average class internally (the values input by CollectInput above need to go somewhere, after all). public double CalculateAverage(); Actually, I'm going to stop right there. Hopefully this answer is enough to get you started and heading in the right direction.
