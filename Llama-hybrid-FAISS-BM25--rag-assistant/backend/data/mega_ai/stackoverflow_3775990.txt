I divine your question to be: What approach should I take, and what mindset should I adopt, when tackling problems involving bit manipulation ? If that is correct, read on, if not, stop now ... Bit manipulation is a difficult topic for the beginner such as me. I will have to concentrate hard and pay careful attention as I work through a graded set of sample problems. I will revise what I learn at regular intervals.
