Keeping an iFrame static while the window reloads? (creative thinking needed)

Here's my problem: I have a Flash object on my page. The user can change views within the Flash. [Not directly relevant but possibly useful: when this happens, the Flash creates a JavaScript event.] I'd like to create separate Disqus comment threads for each Flash view, and according to Disqus's customer support, this needs a unique URL (not just hash fragment) for each comment thread. It's not possible to write to the URL (as opposed to the hash fragment) without reloading the page (except in newer Webkit browsers). However, I'd really like to avoid reloading the page, and having to reload the whole Flash object, each time the user changes views. But I'd really like to offer unique Disqus threads on each Flash view. Can anyone think of a smart way I can get round this? Could I put the Flash in an iFrame and not reload it when the rest of the page reloaded... or is that impossible?
