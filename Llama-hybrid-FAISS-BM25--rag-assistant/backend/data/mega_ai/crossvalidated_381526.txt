Is downsampling okay for logistic regression if I only care about relative ordering (ROC AUC)?

I see a few discussions that suggest downsampling is never correct for logistic regression or suggesting that you have to do bias term corrections post-hoc: Downsampling vs upsampling on the significance of the predictors in logistic regression Does down-sampling change logistic regression coefficients? Does an unbalanced sample matter when doing logistic regression? Should sampling for logistic regression reflect the real ratio of 1's and 0's? The reasoning makes sense to me. However, I am training my logistic regression via SGD because of the amount of data I have (sparse features and a lot of samples). I am not able to get any meaningful convergence without downsampling. If I primarily care about ordering and not about calibrated expectation of response variable is it okay to downsample in order for my SGD to converge? Alternatively, I can set a very low learning rate and try to use all of my data but would rather avoid that if feasible.
