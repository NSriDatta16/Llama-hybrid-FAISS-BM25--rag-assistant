List folders of Classes in C++ PDB using DIA SDK

I am working on a profiling tool in C#. It analyses C++ PDB files using DIA SDK and lists all classes, functions, fields etc. I would like to know the folder names of the classes and list classes, functions etc folder wise. I have seen all the properties/functions on IDiaSymbol, but could not find anything on the folder name of the class. How to get folder name of the classes in C++ PDB using DIA SDK? Thanks Raghu
