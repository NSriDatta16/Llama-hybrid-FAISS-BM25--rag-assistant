You are doing it wrong. Separate versions of a javascript library for each page is a bad idea since the library won't be cached but fetched separatly for each page. You're better off minifying, concatinating and GZIP your scripts and serve the exact same script file for all pages. However, if you need to know what lines are actually run, you can probably find out using JSCoverage .
