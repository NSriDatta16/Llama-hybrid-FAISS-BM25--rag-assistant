You're correct regarding the $0.12 / hour: you're billed based on resources consumed (meaning virtual machine instances), whether you're running at 0% cpu or 100% cpu. While it might seem expensive compared to your average shared-hosting provider, consider that you're getting health monitoring, failover, SLA (if you have 2 or more instances) upgrade domains, etc. I have two blog posts that go deeper into Compute Instance billing that you might find beneficial: Part 1 : The True Cost of Web and Worker Roles Part 2 : Staging and Compute-Hour Metering I hope this helps...
