Ordered logistic Regression with categorical variables

I am conducting a regression. There is an ordinal dependent variable (ordered from 1 to three) and some categorical independent variables (each of them includes several items). I adopted the multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression using stata software. Unfortunately, the regression outputted regression's results with omitting the results of last item of each categorical variable and showing that there is a collinearity between the items. Is there anybody encountered the same problem? what should I do on this?
