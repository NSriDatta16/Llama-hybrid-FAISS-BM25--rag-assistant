They all have advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I've found Telerik and Infragistics seemed more like they were designed specifically with WPF in mind. Syncfusion's offering is more of a port of their Windows Forms product, so the design is more like they're other product lines. That being said, each product you listed is good - and each have their own feature set. There is no substitute for trying a demo and seeing how you like working with the products in question.
