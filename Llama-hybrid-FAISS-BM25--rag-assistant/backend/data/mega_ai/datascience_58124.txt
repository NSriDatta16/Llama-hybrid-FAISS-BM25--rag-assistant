Simmultainiously calculting loss from target interdependend metric

Is there a way to incorporate multiple targets into one loss? Currently, I work with the Sequential() API, I guess this won't be sufficient.... I work with area predictions as targets. Each sample of the Dataset has a finite area to allocate. my regression often overestimates the total sample area... I want to implement an area restriction into a loss. This would be the sum of all true target values for a sample. I want to separately penalize the overestimation of the area. I know Keras does automatically average losses like this : 1.trained on batch --> 2.for all targets: loss (target) --> 3.mean loss over all targets But i need something like this: 1.trained on batch --> 2.loss(sum all predicted areas, sum of true areas)& for all targets: loss (target)--> 3.mean loss overall targets and areasumloss The current solution was a feature engineering approach : total area per sample got added to the feature list but did not enhance the result. The sum of individual areas is still overestimated Is there a way to do this with the Sequential() API or do i need to use the Functional API?
