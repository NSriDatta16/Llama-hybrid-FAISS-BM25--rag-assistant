php soap question: howto create custom namespace

I am using php soap. I can't get my soap body to include a custom namespace. Here is an example of what I want: getStuff I can't get the namespace called tns to appear inside the body, or the elements op and args. Can anyone suggest how this is done? My code looks like: $client = CreateSoapClient(); try{ $result = $client->__soapCall( 'MyCall', array(), // no params array( 'uri' => 'urn:Myurn', 'soapaction' => 'urn:Myurn' )); ?>
