I took a quick look at the code for Varien's autoloader and it appears to use a call to spl_autoload_register , which is a stack for performing autoloads. While I don't think you'll have much success adding to the default Magento autoloader, this means that you should be able to push another autoloader on top of Magento's. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
