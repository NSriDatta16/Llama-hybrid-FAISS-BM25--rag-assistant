How to analyze a small dataset?

I have this dataset and I'm not sure how to analyze it. I threw the classical regression methods such as OLS at it and haven't achieved much success. My response variables are Tensile.Strength , Elongation , and Compression.Set and the predictor variables are the other columns. So far, I've tried linear regression and random forest regression. Is there anything else I can try here besides polynomial fitting? I want to examine the relationships between our response variables and these predictors, but none of the methods seem to do well. In general, I'm just confused on how to analyse this when the standard regression methods fail. Thoughts?
