"After some feature scaling". Maybe that is a bad choice? But you did not give any details... You may be emphasizing variability in your data where it wasn't. Assume that all but one user chose the same answer for some question, say 2. but one funny user chose 3 for all questions. Now if you naively apply standardization first, all users will likely get a small negative value, and the one different user will get a very large other value. PCA will then preserve this variable largely unchanged - but it never was meaningful. The other issue, in particular with PCA and standardization is resolution. Your input data only has a few levels, but that doesn't mean the "true" values shouldn't be continuous. It's best to think of these to have a high uncertainty. If the true values weren't 0 and 1, but 0.49 and 0.51 rounded, your variance would have been several times less! By PCA and these you pretend the values are of higher resolution and linear (but research has shown that even 1.2.3.4.5 questionnaire values are better not treated as numerical).
