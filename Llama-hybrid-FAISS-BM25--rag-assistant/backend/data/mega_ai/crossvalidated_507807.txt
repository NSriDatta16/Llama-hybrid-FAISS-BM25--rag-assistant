As a plot, I would simply plot the Variable against the Outcome , with a little jitter in the Outcome dimension to reduce overfitting. Optionally, add a beanplot or a boxplot (but your dataset is so small that you should really plot the raw data, not only summaries): R code: library(beanplot) with(dataset, beanplot(Variable~Outcome,what=c(0,1,0,0),col="lightgray",las=1,xlab="Outcome",ylab="Variable")) with(dataset,boxplot(Variable~Outcome,add=TRUE,outline=FALSE,xaxt="n",yaxt="n",col=NULL)) # outline=FALSE because we plot points anyway set.seed(1) # for replicability with(dataset,points(as.numeric(Outcome)+runif(nrow(dataset),-.2,.2),Variable,pch=19,cex=0.8)) Note how R automatically puts everything in the correct order because we defined Outcome as an ordered variable. Now, this does not suggest a strong relationship. (Also, any fitted relationship may be driven by the two points around -600, so it would be good to make an effort to understand where precisely these come from.) One analytical approach would be an ANOVA of Variable against Outcome , which suggests that Variable on average does not differ between Outcome s, $p=.39$ : > anova(lm(Variable~Outcome,dataset)) Analysis of Variance Table Response: Variable Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) Outcome 2 42106 21053 0.9648 0.3856 Residuals 77 1680186 21821 However, this does not account for the ordered nature of your Outcome . A simple alternative would be to calculate a rank correlation between your Variable and the Outcome . (A rank correlation, because the Outcome is only ordinal, not interval scaled .) > cor.test(dataset $Variable,as.numeric(dataset$ Outcome),method="kendall") Kendall's rank correlation tau data: dataset $Variable and as.numeric(dataset$ Outcome) z = 1.2954, p-value = 0.1952 alternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0 sample estimates: tau 0.1131906 Finally, you might want to look into ordinal regression or similar methods, but those get more complicated. And to be honest, it does not look like there is a lot there. Edit: you note that there is a trend in the "average line". Note that the thicker horizontal line in a boxplot is the median , not the mean. And yes, the medians increase across the groups: > with(dataset,by(Variable,Outcome,median)) Outcome: Disband [1] -222.5 ----------------------------------------- Outcome: Completion [1] -167.2 ----------------------------------------- Outcome: Upgrade [1] -109.8 However: While the correlation test using Kendall's $\tau$ above is not strictly speaking a test on medians, as a rank test it is related, and it didn't find anything that would not be consistent with random noise. You could of course run a standard test on medians. (I don't know of one offhand, but you could always ask here on CV, ideally linking to this thread so people can get the context.) And somewhat more importantly, this monotone relationship does not hold for group means : > with(dataset,by(Variable,Outcome,mean)) Outcome: Disband [1] -195.9727 ----------------------------------------- Outcome: Completion [1] -206.0154 ----------------------------------------- Outcome: Upgrade [1] -155.2562
