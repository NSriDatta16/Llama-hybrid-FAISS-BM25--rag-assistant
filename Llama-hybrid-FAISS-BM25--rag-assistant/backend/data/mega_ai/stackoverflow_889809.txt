the new world of information is all about BLOBs. No, it isn't. BLOBs are useful for certain things, but they don't replace or make obsolete more structured databases or the appropriate use of data types. The relational model is very good at solving a certain class of data organization problem. Non-relational models solve some different problems, but that doesn't make the relational model obsolete. There are other non-relational database architectures emerging all the time. And this has been going on since the relational model was first published. We can use OODBMS, key-value stores, MapReduce frameworks, semantic web, etc., without detracting from RDBMS. There is no zero-sum game.
