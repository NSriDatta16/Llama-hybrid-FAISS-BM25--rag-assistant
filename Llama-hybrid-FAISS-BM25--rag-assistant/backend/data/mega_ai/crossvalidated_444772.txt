Finding the optimal split threshold for a feature using XGBoost in R

While implementing a gradient-boosted tree algorithm on a dataset, is it possible to learn the optimal value for a feature that best predicts a class? For example: In the iris dataset, what is the value of sepal length that best predicts the species versicolor? When I run a single tree, I can see what value of sepal width the tree is splitting at at a given node, and what the probability of predicting a species is. How could I get this information when I run a model with 50 trees?
