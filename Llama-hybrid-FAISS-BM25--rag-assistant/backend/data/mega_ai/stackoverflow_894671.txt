Your best bet is probably to use an IDataObject as your data in the call to DoDragDrop(). Instead of putting the data you want in there directly, create a class that inherits from IDataObject to hold your data. When the user "drops" the part, then the IDataObject's "GetData" method will be called. You can use this to set a flag to close your form or give user feedback that the drop occurred. Note that there is an implementation of IDataObject already provided - DataObject. It's normally much easier to extend or use that than try to create your own. EDIT: I see you're using DataObject already - rather than use it, use a derived class and override GetData, this will be called when the drop occurs.
