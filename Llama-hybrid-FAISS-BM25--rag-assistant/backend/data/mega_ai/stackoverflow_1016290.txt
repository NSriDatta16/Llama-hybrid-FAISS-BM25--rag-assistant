How to organize my classes?

I'm developing a small project in ASP.NET MVC to manage photos, but I don't know how to organize my classes in namespaces. I have 2 base classes (Photo and Category). Should I put these classes into which namespace? Domain? POCO/POJO? For Data Access, I have more 2 classes, PhotoDAO and CategoryDAO in DAO namespace. (Is it right?) Which namespace should I put my business logic classes and how name them? Does someone has any advice which design patterns I have to use/study? I'm sorry asking so basic questions. Thank you.
