You could create some form of weighted equation. Say you want the following criteria: Number of updates (numUpdates) 1 / days since last post (lastPost) Average updates per day since creation (avgUpdates) Then, you could give each criteria a specific weight. E.G, rating = (weight1 * numUpdates) + (weight2 * lastPost) + (weight3 * avgUpdates)
