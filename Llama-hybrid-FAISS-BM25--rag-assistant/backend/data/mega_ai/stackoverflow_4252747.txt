If you really want it in a list comprehension then you could do the following: {Date, Time} = erlang:universaltime(). DateList = tuple_to_list(Date). DateListString = [ [$- | integer_to_list(X)] || X Roberto's is a better/more efficient solution to this but in case you wondered how you might do it with a list comprehension this would be one way.
