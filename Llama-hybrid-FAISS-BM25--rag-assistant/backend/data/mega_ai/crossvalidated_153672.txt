The fundamental difference in case of time-series prediction against general regression problem (not only for SVM) is the dependence of response on more than one cases. So, for example if the input vector with N cases is X 1 ...X N , then for predicting some case number n , all the input-response data from X 1 through X n-1 can be used (and are supposed to effect its outcome). Generally, a fixed number of cases immediately preceding the case to be predicted are used. One way to do time-series prediction with SVM is to transform your input variable X to include features derived from the desired number of preceding cases. Here is a code example by Quantum Financer .
