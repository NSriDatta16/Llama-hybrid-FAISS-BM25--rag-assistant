Assuming that the file handle to the configuration file is closed after the configuration file has been read and processed, I would send a message to the application to tell it to re-read the configuration file after you have updated the file. If this approach is not working, then I suspect (as Hogan suggested) that the file handle is not closed. What error codes are you getting from the file opening, reading and closing system calls? (use perror to report the error message)
