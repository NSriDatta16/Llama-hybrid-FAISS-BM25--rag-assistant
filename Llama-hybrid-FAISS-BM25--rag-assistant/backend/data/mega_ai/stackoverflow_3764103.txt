I've found the only (proposed) way this code is ever actually compliant, though it does not apply in Google's case (since they lack a DOCTYPE). XHTML 2, which was proposed and then scrapped, implements a tag as a way to replace the alt attribute. So, instead of this in XHTML 1.0/1.1: You'd have this Monkeys throwing feces Where 'Monkeys throwing feces' only displays if monkeys.gif fails to load. This would make behave as other content embedding tags, like . In the spec's words, The img element is a holder for embedding attributes such as src. Since these attributes may be applied to any element, the img element is not strictly necessary, but is included to ease the transition to XHTML2. Like the object element, this element's content is only presented if the referenced resource is unavailable.
