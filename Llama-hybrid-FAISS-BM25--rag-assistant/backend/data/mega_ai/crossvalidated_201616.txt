Humans indeed do many classification tasks that can be modeled by machine learning classifiers (e.g. deciding on a color category from an r,g,b triplet, deciding on a phoneme from acoustic features). IMHO your example, deciding on 'is sqrt(2) rational?', isn't one of those. You suggest that the human gain from time is due to '..toying and symbol shuffling'. This means that the 'algorithm' people use in this case (at least if they spend considerable time on this) isn't a comparison of the 'test-set' with a training-set like machine learning classifiers do but something more similar to Automated Theorem Proving . As far as I know, in ATP more time means better success rate since further potential solutions can be explored. A related and even more extreme case is the task of playing chess, in which computers may gain much more than humans from being given additional time (assuming no effective memory limitation, the former can explore more and more of the game tree).
