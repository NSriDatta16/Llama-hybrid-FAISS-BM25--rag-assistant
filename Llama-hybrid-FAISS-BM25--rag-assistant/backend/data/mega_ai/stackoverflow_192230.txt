I would say the last ten years (1998-2008) have seen open source RDBMS products become viable in mainstream deployments. Most Fortune 500 companies now use MySQL or PostgreSQL or another open source RDBMS somewhere in their organization, even if they also use one of the commercial, closed-source RDBMS brands. This isn't a technical advancement, but it's noteworthy nevertheless because the availability of a stable, open-source RDBMS engine enables many other innovative projects. I realize that both MySQL and PostgreSQL were available as early as 1995, but I would argue that they weren't mainstream for several years after that.
