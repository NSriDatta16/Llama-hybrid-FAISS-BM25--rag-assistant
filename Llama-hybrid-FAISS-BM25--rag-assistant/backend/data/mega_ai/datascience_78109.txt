Should you use random state or random seed in machine learning models?

I'm starting to study machine learning. All the examples I saw, the person that created the ML model used a random state or a random seed to stop the randomness of the process. But, in real life, when you're trying to apply a machine learning model into an actual project of a company, should you use any random state or seed? Is it right (in data science terms) to set a random state to the machine learning model and make reproducible results?
