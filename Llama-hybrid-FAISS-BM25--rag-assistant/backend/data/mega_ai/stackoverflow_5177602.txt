ImageButton does not display a particular drawable

This is rather a funny problem I have ever come across, I have a table layout with 9 image buttons, 3 per row. Every ImageButton has a different image associated with it. I have set the background of the image button to transparent (#00000000). Now here is where the funny stuff happens, One of the images doesn't show up on the emulator (Gingerbread) as well as a device running Froyo. The layout editor shows all the images in place. Here are some more stuff: I used a RelativeLayout instead of a TableLayout , the same issue persists. I changed the position of the image (used it on different buttons) and still it doesn't show up. When I use a different image they show up, but when I use this particular image it won't. All images have the same resolution (90x72) and density (72ppi) All the images are in the the drawable-mdpi folder. Any pointers? EDIT Turned out to be a bug and this issue has been resolved. Please check this link .
