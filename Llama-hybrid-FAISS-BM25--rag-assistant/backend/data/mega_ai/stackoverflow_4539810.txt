Organizing Drupal Code

How do you like to organize your Drupal code? One giant module? Separate modules per feature? Separate modules per code type (theme functions, menu hooks, etc...)? I've started by trying to organize by feature, treating modules like they were libraries. Ultimately though things are never perfectly contained... modules want to use each other's theme functions, and modules are all contributing various tabs to a common page -- two examples of it not always being so clear where to find code. This tempts me to keep all theme functions together, and all hook_menus together, but this would be awkward for other reasons... Assume that all code is too specific to eventually share, so there's no attempt here to make self contained contributed modules. I'm mostly concerned about maintaining sanity and cleanliness in a large scale Drupal site.
