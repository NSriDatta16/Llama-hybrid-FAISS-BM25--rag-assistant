Setting up a git repo on my GoDaddy hosting plan

I have a project which is version-controlled using git. What I want to be able to do is set up a repo on my (ssh-enabled) GoDaddy shared hosting package so that I can deploy with a push rather than dragging and dropping in FTP. Any tips would be appreciated. Best would be an account from someone who's already done it, but I couldn't personally find any online.
