Test for cointegration between two time series using Engleâ€“Granger two-step method

I am seeking to test for cointegration between two time series. Both series have weekly data spanning ~3 years. I am trying to do the Engle-Granger Two Step Method. My order of operations follows. Test each time series for unit root via Augmented Dickey-Fuller. Assuming both have unit roots, then find linear approximation of relationship via OLS. Then create a series of the residuals. Test residuals for unit root via Augmented Dickey-Fuller. Conclude cointegration (or not) by result of 3. Questions: Does this method look okay? (I'm an undergraduate, and I'm looking to analyze my data in a legitimate way, not necessarily to analyze it in the most rigorous known method.) If one series cannot reject the null hypothesis with the ADF (and therefore does not have a unit root) in step 1, is it reasonable to conclude that the two series are not cointegrated because one data set is nonstationary? I wouldn't think so, but I want to be sure. Both datasets look "stochastic", so I am wondering if it is appropriate to use OLS to measure the relationship to get the residuals.
