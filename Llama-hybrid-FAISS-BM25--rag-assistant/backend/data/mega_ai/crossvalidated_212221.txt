Logistic regression - linearity and non linearity

Is logistic regression a linear model which separates the two classes with linear decision boundary? Can we use logistic regression for non linear problems as well? I looked at python sklearn and I don't see how to make a non linear logistic regression, so wondering if logistic regression cab be applicable for non linear problems as well. Considering the hypothesis function h(theta) = 1/1+exp(z) where z is theraT * X. I hope we can make z as a non linear function by increasing the degree. Does it affect the linear decision boundary to be a non linear?
