Why is lmer model correlation in R very different when switching the predictor and response variable?

I am using the lme4 package to create a linear mixed effects model that accounts for repeated measures. Data colony_area_and_cover_code_data In this analysis, I am looking to see if two variables are correlated, namely if algal cover (mean_cover_code) is a significant predictor of coral cover (total_area) within 11 experimental modules that were sampled repeatedly over time where 6 are at one site (Waikiki) and 5 are at another (Hanauma Bay). In order to account for repeated measures, I created random effects for these experimental modules (1|module_colony_area_vs_cover_code) and time with nested season inside year (1|Season/Year) . First model with mistakenly switched predictor and response # Variable vector of module number to account for repeated measures module_colony_area_vs_cover_code Originally when I did this analysis, I made the mistake of making coral cover a predictor of algal cover on accident. This model (as the output code is shown above) showed a significant relationship with coral cover as the predictor (total_area) and algal cover as the response (mean_cover_code). Once I realized I made this mistake, I switched algal cover to be the predictor and coral cover to be the response. However I was shocked to find out when I did this, there was a gigantic change in the p-value generated by the lmer fit. Whereas the mistaken model had a p-value equal to $0.0202$ (see mistake model output), the corrected model with the predictor and the response reversed was $p = 0.887$ . See the below script for the output: Second model with correct predictor and response # Variable vector of module number to account for repeated measures module_colony_area_vs_cover_code I was very confused as to how the significance of a lmer linear mixed effects model could change so drastically with swapping the predictor and response variables. Especially considering that looking at the plot of the raw data, there does appear to be a correlation despite the model results. Figure Code col_area_vs_cover_code_plot I wanted to see if anyone could explain how this is happening or if something is wrong with the analysis and/or figure code that is making a correlation completely change when swapping the predictor and response variable. Especially because my understanding that when two variables are correlated with one another, that correlation should exist regardless of which is the predictor and which is the response.
