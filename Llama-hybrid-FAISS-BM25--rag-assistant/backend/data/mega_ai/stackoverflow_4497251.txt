javascript mouseover while dragging

I'm trying to implement a drag and drop script and have hit the wall with one problem. When you take an item and start dragging it - the item is directly below your cursor and onmouseover event is very rarely fired on the items below. But i want other items to highlight when i drag something over them. One of the solutions would be not to drag anything at all - that way the mouse events would work, but that would look ugly. Has anyone ever done something like this and know how to overcome this problem? If you're thinking about suggesting some JQuery plugin or something like that - please don't. I don't need a completed solution, this is educational.
