Time series deseasoning

The forecasting methods I am interested in include: croston, naive, seasonal naive, ma, adida, exponential smoothing, TSB intermittent demand method). In case the time series contains a seasonal component or an overall trend, is there a rule of thumb about which method to use? To my understanding, one should always deseason the data and then apply forecast methods. Is that right or should some methods be applied to the original time series (eg seasonal naive, exponential smoothing)? Thank you!
