You shouldn't exclusively use onkeyup or onkeydown for detecting user input. They don't catch the edge cases such as cut, paste, drag and drop or spell checker corrections. You should use the HTML 5 event, oninput where available (Firefox 2+, Google Chrome, Safari 4+, Opera 10) and Internet Explorer's onpropertychange event. For browsers that don't support either event, you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check, which is a little better than onkeyup . In newer browsers, you can check for the oninput event, which should be the most reliable approach.
