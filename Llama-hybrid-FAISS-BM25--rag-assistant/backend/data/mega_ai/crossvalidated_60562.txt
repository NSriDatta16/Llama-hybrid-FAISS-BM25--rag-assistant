I would guess that you could take every value that was 4.7 or so, and use Various interpolation rules to replace it. These rules could start with linear, cubic, cubic spline or piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation. On the last, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline Any appropriate time series smoothing or forecasting method (e.g. some kind of exponential smoothing) to replace it. If the 4.7 is genuine, a good method should replace it with about the same value any way (that's optimistic, but I don't know what other attitude to take). How would you assess which possible method was least bad? Take genuine values not 4.7, replace them with missing, then see which method got closest, using a criterion for closest that matches your data generation process and statistical philosophy.
