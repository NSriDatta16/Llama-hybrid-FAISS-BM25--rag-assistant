Saddle point method used to calculate the inverse Fourier transform

Here I want to find the asymptotic behavior of the following integral $$f(x,t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp(-ikx)*\exp(t(1-\exp(-|k|^\beta)))dk,~~~~~~~Eq~1$$ where $x$ goes to infinity. So I try to use the saddle point approximation to find the asymptotic behavior of the above formula. According to the saddle point method, we should first find the saddle point $$\frac{\partial}{\partial k} (-ikx+t(1-\exp(-|k|^\beta))=0~~~~~~~~~Eq. 2$$ . Using the Mathematica, the solution of Eq.~(2) is $$k_0=\left(-\frac{(\beta -1) W\left(-\frac{\beta \left(-\frac{i x}{\beta t}\right)^{\frac{\beta }{\beta -1}}}{\beta -1}\right)}{\beta }\right)^{1/\beta }$$ Here $W$ is the Lambert W function. Notice that $k_0$ is a complex number instead of a real number. According to enter link description here , I should find the angle $\theta$ ; see the circles in the figure Clearly, $\theta$ is not fixed. My problems: 1) In principle, the saddle point approximation is valid here? 2) Are there other methods to calculate the behavior of the large $x$ for Eq.~1?
