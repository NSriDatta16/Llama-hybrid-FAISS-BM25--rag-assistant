Machine learning input relationships

After learning about a few machine-learning models (NN, SVM, decision trees), I was wondering if these models are able to find inherent relationships when learning. For example, if I feed it two inputs A and B, but it is really A - B or the percent change from A to B that determines the output (but this relationship is unknown to me), would these models be able to pick up that relationship from just the A and B inputs? What about more complicated relationships?
