The first thing I would do is check the baseline accuracy of the datasets you're working with by looking at the averages of your dependent variable in each dataset. It might be that the baseline accuracy for Dataset A is higher than Dataset B. It's also possible that despite having the same variables and similar distributions of those variables, the relationships between the variables in each dataset are not similar for whatever reason, like non-random sampling between the datasets, for example. One more thing you could try is test other models on the datasets. A quick thing you could do is run a logit on each dataset and see if this stark performance difference exists in other models too, which would provide more evidence that it is a data issue and not a model definition issue.
