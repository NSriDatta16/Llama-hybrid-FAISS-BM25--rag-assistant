The useragent and related HTTP headers that are sent in all requests can give you some information (Browser and version), but for detail about the client-side installation, you may be out of luck for an automated capture mechanism that obtain a list of arbitrary plugins installed on the client browser. This would be a security violation, so unless a browser intentionally exposes them, you wouldn't get access to this without installing a client-side binary. Depending on the relationship with the user, you could try something like Go2Meeting or CoPilot so that you can see the bug in action yourself. This would also allow you to peruse the browser settings and plugins.
