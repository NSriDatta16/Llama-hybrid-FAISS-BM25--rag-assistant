Entity Framework How to specify paramter type in generated SQL (SQLServer 2005) Nvarchar vs Varchar

In entity framework I have an Entity 'Client' that was generated from a database. There is a property called 'Account' it is defined in the storage model as: And in the Conceptual Model as: When select statements are generated using a variable for Account i.e. where m.Account == myAccount... Entity Framework generates a paramaterized query with a paramater of type NVarchar(6). The problem is that the column in the table is data type of char(6). When this is executed there is a large performance hit because of the data type difference. Account is an index on the table and instead of using the index I believe an Index scan is done. Anyone know how to force EF to not use Unicode for the paramater and use Varchar(6) instead?
