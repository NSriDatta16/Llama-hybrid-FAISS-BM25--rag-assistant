You might use the System.Net.HttpListener class as an embedded webserver. The HttpListener will do the low-level stuff for you, but you will have to write the code that returns the Html/javascript/images yourself. I tried it out just for fun myself, embedding firefox using GeckoFx against a web server embedded in the application itself. It seemed to work well, but my test was very simple and limited.
