It helps to know what the data is, but you might first consider adjusting them for seasonality effects. Using the rolling mean as a proxy for what the seasonally adjusted series might look like, I would test the two time series for cointegration since it looks like they could share a common trend (alternately, it could just be the result of strong correlation). This would suggest an error correction model or vector autoregression might be a good initial estimation strategy.
