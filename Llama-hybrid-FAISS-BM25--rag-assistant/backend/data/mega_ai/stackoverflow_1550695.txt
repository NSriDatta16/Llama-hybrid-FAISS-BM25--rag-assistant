error compiling the linux kernel

I was trying to compile the linux kernel, but getting some errors. While running the top Makefile i am getting the following errors :- CHK include/linux/version.h CHK include/linux/utsrelease.h SYMLINK include/asm -> include/asm-x86 HOSTCC scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:32:19: error: flask.h: No such file or directory scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:56:29: error: class_to_string.h: No such file or directory scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:61:35: error: initial_sid_to_string.h: No such file or directory scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:66:35: error: common_perm_to_string.h: No such file or directory scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:91:24: error: av_inherit.h: No such file or directory scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:95:28: error: av_permissions.h: No such file or directory scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:103:31: error: av_perm_to_string.h: No such file or directory scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c: In function â€˜mainâ€™: scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:140: error: â€˜initial_sid_to_stringâ€™ undeclared (first use in this function) scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:140: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp.c:140: error: for each function it appears in.) make[3]: *** [scripts/selinux/mdp/mdp] Error 1 make[2]: *** [scripts/selinux/mdp] Error 2 make[1]: *** [scripts/selinux] Error 2 make: *** [scripts] Error 2 Prior to build i configured the using make oldconfig seems that the files in error log were supposed to be generated during configuration. But somehow they are not getting generated and hence the error. Searched the net but still not able to fix the errors. I am very new to kernel programming. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks.
