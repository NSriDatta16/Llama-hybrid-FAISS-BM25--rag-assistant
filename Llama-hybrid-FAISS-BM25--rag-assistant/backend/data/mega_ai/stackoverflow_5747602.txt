ios: best way to display variable-length, multi-line text

I'm planning on loading multi-paragraph content from a text file and displaying it on the UI. I'll be loading from one of several text files and won't know ahead of time how long the text is going to be. My first thought was to use a UILabel inside a UIScrollView. However, it doesn't seem like UILabel can be made to expand based on the number of lines it contains. Is this correct? If UILabel isn't the right tool for the job, what should I use? UIWebView? Will UIWebView handle the scrolling nicely for me?
