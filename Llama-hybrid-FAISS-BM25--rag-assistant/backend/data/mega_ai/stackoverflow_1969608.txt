Need help with HttpWebRequest on a Compact Framework Project

not so long ago I´ve created a small iphone app for my Daily use. Now I want to port this app to a Windows Mobile Device while using C# and the Compact Framework. But I really have no clue how to use the HttpWebRequest and the msdn doesn´t help me either. I think I have a lag of understanding on how Web Requests work in general. In the iPhone app I have the following lines code: NSMutableURLRequest *theRequest = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://xxx:xxx@api.test.net/RPC2"]]; [theRequest setHTTPMethod:@"POST"]; [theRequest addValue:@"text/xml" forHTTPHeaderField:@"content-type"]; [theRequest setCachePolicy:NSURLCacheStorageNotAllowed]; [theRequest setTimeoutInterval:5.0]; NSString* pStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@" xxx.SessionInitiate LocalUri RemoteUri xxxx TOS text Content %@ Schedule ", number.text, TextView.text]; NSData* pBody = [pStr dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; [theRequest setHTTPBody:pBody]; NSURLConnection *theConnection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:theRequest delegate:self]; The Webservice has no wsdl so I have to use the HttpWebRquest Object in .Net CF. What I didn´t get is, where to put the Body (the long XML) in my Request? HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(@"https://xxx:xxx@api.xxx.net/RPC2"); req.Method = @"POST"; req.ContentType = @"test/xml"; req.Timeout = 5; I started this way, is the first line it´s own HttpWebRequest and for the XML Body I have to create anotherone?! How do I use it correctly, how do I send it? Sorry if this might be normaly totaly easy but I really don´t get it. I´ve searched the web, 2 Books and the msdn but in every tutorial is only a Webrequest with an URL but without a body. Thank you twickl
