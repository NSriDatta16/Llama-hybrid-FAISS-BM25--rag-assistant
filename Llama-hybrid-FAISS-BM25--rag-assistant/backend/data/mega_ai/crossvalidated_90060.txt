You could try SamIAm . It's a great free program I've been using constantly since I first downloaded it a year ago. I'm not sure if it has any node limits, but I've had Bayesian networks with 50+ nodes, and it's handled them fine. It's really a nice program; I've been able to do almost all of my calculations and work within the application.
