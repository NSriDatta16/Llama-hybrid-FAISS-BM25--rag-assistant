Understanding the Stata margins command on dichotomous variables

If I run the margins command on a dichotomous variable, what does the output tell me exactly? On a continuous variable I understand that it tells me the average value for a given category but if I run on a dichotomous outcome variable and a categorical independent variable, what does it tell me? Is there a cut-off at 0.5 so if it's 0.25 that means that the average value at that level of the categorical variable is closer to 0 than 1, so the result (if significant) says that the effect is significantly lower? As an example say I'm looking at cancer sizes and seizures. Cancer sizes is a 4 level categorical ordinal variable. I run a logistic regression for seizure no/yes and cancer sizes. I then run the margins command and see that size 2 has a "margin" of 0.25. Does that mean that people are more likely to NOT (no being 0) experience seizures at this level? And also how is this different than running a logistic regression on each level of the categorical variable dichotomized to dummy variables?
