Not an actuarial, but in case none wander by and answer your question... What software does your school use? What software does your school offer classes in? Does your school help you to get STATA at a student price? When you read actuarial journals and textbooks, what tools do they use? As jem77bfp said, R is free and you can continue to use it and explore it all you want. Professionals in most fields use multiple tools, and you can't tell what future employers might require (SAS, SPSS, etc), so it might be a good idea to branch out a bit now. It wouldn't be unusual for a professional economist/statistician to use R for general-purpose analysis and graphing, JAGS/BUGS/STAN for MCMC analysis, ArcGIS for spatial data, Gephi or some other program for analyzing graphs, etc. But the bottom line is that R is free and has a LOT of packages to do particular types of analysis. A couple of years ago I was in a graduate machine learning class where the teacher did everything in Matlab and recommended Matlab toolkits. (The school also sold student discount Matlab in the school store.) But I used R and did very well, while other students used Stata, Java, etc. I wasn't going to get any help from the teacher or TA's -- or even other students -- if I had a problem doing something in R, but that wasn't a concern for me.
