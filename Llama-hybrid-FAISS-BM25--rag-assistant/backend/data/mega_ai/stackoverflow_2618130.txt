The unit test result isn't a single value for a given response, it's a distribution of values for a range of inputs. Probability means you'll have to run many tests to build this up. If your object really ought to return one value half the time on average and the other the rest of the time, then the appropriate test would be to run many tests and make sure that the limiting behavior gives you the distribution you want. Build up the appropriate distribution of results and make sure it matches what you expect.
