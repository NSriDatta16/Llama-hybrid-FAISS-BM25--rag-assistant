By rejected I assume you mean a statistical test is applied. Beware as these tests do not have a power of 1.0 as needed for your approach, and they can also, for very large N, reject the null hypothesis of normality when the non-normality is very small. But more to your point, OLS regression is only optimal if you have normal residuals and constant variance. If for example you should have analyzed log(Y) instead of Y, all the coefficients will be virtually meaningless. It is far better to think of a more general and robust solution. One path forward is semiparametric regression, e.g., proportional odds ordinal logistic regression or proportional hazards model. Examples in BBR and RMS course notes show how to do such robust modeling for continuous Y. Don't use the bootstrap to get the right standard error of the wrong quantity.
