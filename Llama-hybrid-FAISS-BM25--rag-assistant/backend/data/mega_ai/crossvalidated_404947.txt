The Bayes factor $B_{01}$ can be turned into a probability under equal weights as $$P_{01}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{\large B_{01}}}$$ but this does not make them comparable with a $p$ -value since $P_{01}$ is a probability in the parameter space, not in the sampling space its value and range depend on the choice of the prior measure, they are thus relative rather than absolute (and Taylor's mention of the Lindley-Jeffreys paradox is appropriate at this stage ) both $B_{01}$ and $P_{01}$ contain a penalty for complexity (Occam's razor) by integrating out over the parameter space If you wish to consider a Bayesian equivalent to the $p$ -value, the posterior predictive $p$ -value (Meng, 1994) should be investigated $$Q_{01}=\mathbb P(B_{01}(X)\le B_{01}(x^\text{obs}))$$ where $x^\text{obs}$ denotes the observation and $X$ is distributed from the posterior predictive $$X\sim \int_\Theta f(x|\theta) \pi(\theta|x^\text{obs})\,\text{d}\theta$$ but this does not imply that the same "default" criteria for rejection and significance should apply to this object.
