Winforms: Best control to use for listing data quickly

I need a control that can list data in 3 columns, I want to manually add the items (not databind the control)..... firstly I'll populate column 1 and 2, then later when a button is clicked, I need to loop through the values of column 1 and 2, perform an operation, then update the value of column 3. From what I remember the datagrid does not allow for this , and must be bound to a data source, am I right? What is the best quick drag and drop control I can use from the toolbox?
