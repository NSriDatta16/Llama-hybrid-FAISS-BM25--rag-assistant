Before you choose a technique, you should characterize the communication according to its throughput, granularity, latency, and criticality. Throughput -- how much data per unit time will you need to move? The range of possible values is so wide that the lowest-rate and highest-rate applications have almost nothing in common. Granularity -- how big are the messages? How much data does the receiving application need before it can use the message? Latency -- when one aplication sends a message, how soon must the other application see it? How quickly do you want the receiving application to react to the sending application? Criticality -- how long can a received message be left unattended before it is overrun by a later message? (This is usually not important unless the throughput is high and the message storage is limited.) Once you have these questions answered, you can begin to ask about the best technology for your particular situation. -Al.
