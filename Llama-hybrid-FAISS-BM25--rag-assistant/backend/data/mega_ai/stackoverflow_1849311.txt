How should I organize Python source code?

I'm getting started with Python (it's high time I give it a shot), and I'm looking for some best practices. My first project is a queue which runs command-line experiments in multiple threads. I'm starting to get a very long main.py file, and I'd like to break it up. In general, I'm looking for: How do python programmers organize multiple source files? Is there a particular structure that works for you? My specific questions include: Should each class be in a separate file? How should I organize unit tests relative to source code? Where should I put doc comments, specifically those for command-line operation? If I use multiple directories, how do I import classes between them? I can probably draw some of my own conclusions here by trial and error, but I'd rather start from something good .
