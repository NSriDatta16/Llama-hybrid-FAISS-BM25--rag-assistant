It sounds like you are making this more complicated than it is with trying to predict spend at the cohort level. It is best to use cohorts for understanding "why" something occurred and time series analysis for understanding "what" will occur. The Forecast package in R seems to be solution to your problem. Just forecast Monthly spend and be done with it!
