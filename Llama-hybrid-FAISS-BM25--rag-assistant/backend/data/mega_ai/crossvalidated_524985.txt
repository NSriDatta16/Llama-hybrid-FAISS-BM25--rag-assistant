Fitting data to sums of squares of sinusoids

I am given some time series data $(t, y(t))$ sampled at regular intervals $t=0,s,2s,3s,\ldots,1$ for some step size $s$ , obtained from a function $$ y(t) = y(t, \vec A, \vec \delta) = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \sin(\pi t + \delta_i)^2 $$ i.e. a linear combination of squares of sin's, all with the same frequency. $N$ , the number of terms, is known. Assuming the step size $s$ is "small enough" ( $1/s\gg N$ ) and the data is noise-free, I have the following questions: Is there a way of obtaining the parameter vectors $\vec A$ and $\vec \delta$ from the time series data, e.g. by a least squares fit? Is there a method that converges, and does so effiicently (say, in the number of data points/number of parameters)? Is the solution unique (where, for the $\delta_i$ , I mean unique modulo $2\pi$ )? What if all the $A_i$ were $1$ to start with, i.e. $y(t) = y(t, (1, \ldots, 1), \vec\delta)$ ? In this case I only need to find the phase shifts; does that alter answers for the above? I am asking this because I suspect the solution would not be unique (as in, I tried fitting a few example cases with Mathematica, and didn't always get a unique answer, which might just mean I'm not doing it right though); but I can't find a simple argument for it. Thanks!!
