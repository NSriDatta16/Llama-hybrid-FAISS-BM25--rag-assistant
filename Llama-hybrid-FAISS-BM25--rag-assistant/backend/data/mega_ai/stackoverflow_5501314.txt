How do I import registry settings using TeamCity?

I'm having trouble importing settings from a .reg file using TeamCity. The app in question has a lot of registry settings which change fairly regulary so it is vital to have it as a build step. I'm using the following command: regedit /s "C:\app\params\epm\epm_tlp\trunk\csr_vsm_tlp_exl.reg" The path is fine (I checked several times). When I run this command manually, it works. However, when run from TeamCity, it doesn't seem to do anything. Here's the log: [16:01:13]: Checking for changes [16:01:16]: Clearing temporary directory: C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\temp\buildTmp [16:01:16]: Checkout directory: C:\app [16:01:16]: Updating sources: server side checkout...

Could there be any security causes? Are TeamCity runners running as another user?
