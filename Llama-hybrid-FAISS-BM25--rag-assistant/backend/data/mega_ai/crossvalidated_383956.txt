Predictions like these don't include the 'error' in your model: that is, you expect that even if your model is very good, a student with some combination of predictors will not be exactly the prediction, they will be above or below it. The only way you would get a prediction of 4 would be if a combination of predictors gave an estimate that the average GPA for that observed combination would be 4. If the average GPA for that observed combination is 3.6 with a range of 3.0-4.0, your model would predict 3.6 even if you would expect some fraction to have 4.0; your best guess for each individual student is the expected value , the mean. If you instead imagined your predictions as probability distributions you would find that these include 4.0. However, it looks like your model itself is not very good: there is a lot of difference between your predictions and outcomes and very little slope between them relative to the variance.
