Check the FILE STATUS and act accordingly. Try the following: Add a FILE-STATUS under the FILE-CONTROL , for example: FILE-CONTROL. SELECT MYFILE ASSIGN MYDD ORGANIZATION SEQUENTIAL ACCESS SEQUENTIAL FILE STATUS MYFILE-STATUS. Declare a FILE STATUS variable in WORKING-STORAGE as a PIC X(2) value, for example: 01 MYFILE-STATUS PIC X(2). 88 MYFILE-ALREADY-OPEN VALUE '41'. Then in the PROCEDURE DIVISION issue an OPEN for your file. Immediately following that, test the value of FILE STATUS as in: OPEN MYFILE.... IF MYFILE-ALRADY-OPEN CLOSE MYFILE... END-IF IF MYFILE-STATUS <> '00' perform some sort of general error routine END-IF Values of FILE STATUS where the first character is not a '9', are COBOL standard values so testing for '41' to detect an already open file should work on all COBOL implementations. Beware when the first character is a '9', these are vendor specific file status codes.
