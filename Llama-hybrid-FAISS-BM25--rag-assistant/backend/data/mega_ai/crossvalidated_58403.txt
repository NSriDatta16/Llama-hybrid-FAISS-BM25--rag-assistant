Dealing with Dates of Birth in Predictor

I have a predictor variable of type factor which contains the date of birth. From your experience (when dealing with logistic regression), what is the best way of treating date of birth (or similar types)? As a continuos variable or maybe or maybe as a categorical variable which stores different age segments?
