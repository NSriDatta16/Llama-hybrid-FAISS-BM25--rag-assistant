Examples where is Java more elegant than C#?

It's been a couple of years since I last worked with Java. Can you tell me what problems can be solved more elegantly in Java? I am aware of the following benefits of Java: Java 'runs everywhere', Java has support for units and measures (supposedly) better latency in Java J2EE (I don't think there is an equivalent in .Net) different approach to generics (with odd circular definitions such as "Enum>", see Ken Arnold ) What about generics - are there elegant Java examples that cannot be represented in C#? Or other APIs or libraries? Thanks, Jiří P.S. some general links: Wikipedia comparison article Comparing Java and C# Generics - Jonathan Pryor's web log
