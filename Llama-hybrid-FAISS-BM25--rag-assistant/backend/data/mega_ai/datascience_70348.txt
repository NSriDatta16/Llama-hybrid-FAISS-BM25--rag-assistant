Convolutional neural network block notation

The paper by He et al. "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" illustrates their residual network in Figure 3 as follows: I am not a neural network expert, so could somebody please explain to me what the highlighted notation above "3x3 conv, 256, /2" means? The first part is clear (convolutional neural network with a 3x3 pixel window), but what is the "256" and the "/2"?
