Can I use wilcoxon signed rank test for time series data

I have a question about wilcoxon signed rank test. I have 2 different speed profiles (speed starts from time 0 to 100 sec) of the same participant that was given 2 different treatment. I would like to ask if I could use wilcoxon signed rank test to compare if both speed profiles are different from each other. I am a little bit confused how to fit the null hypothesis of this test (median difference) to my case. I also think that once I use wilcoxon signed rank test to my time-series data, I may lose the sence of data sequence from my speed profile. Any help from anyone will be appreciated. Thank you, Ayla
