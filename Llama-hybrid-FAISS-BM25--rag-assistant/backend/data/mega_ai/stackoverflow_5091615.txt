Is it better to use fwrite() or move_uploaded_file()?

It's more of a coding standards question this one. Which one is, if I can call it "better" to use in file upload handler scripts? I know that fwrite() and it's accompanying methods for reading and writing can do it in chunks but using move_uploaded_file() is much more elegant and shorter code. Thanks
