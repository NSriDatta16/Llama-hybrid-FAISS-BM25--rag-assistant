What is the proper way to calculate an average with two columns of data?

I saw a post on the internet about this a long time ago and can't seem to find that post again. The post talked about the proper way to calculate an average if the data was in two columns and the solution wasn't intuitive. Perhaps someone here can provide guidance. I'm trying to calculate the average amount of time it takes to document a business process. My data set looks like this process_id, num_rows_of_data, completion_time (in minutes) 1,9,34 2,4,21 3,56,144 4,78,43 5,17,27 I'm trying to calculate the average number of minutes it takes to document a single row of data. I think most people would say average = sum(completion_time) / sum(num_rows_of_data) But that seems too simple to be correct.
