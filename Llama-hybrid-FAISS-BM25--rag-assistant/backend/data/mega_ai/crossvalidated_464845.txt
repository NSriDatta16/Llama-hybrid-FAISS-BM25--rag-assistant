A meaning/significance of validation loss in a Generative Adversarial Neural Network?

On most of the tutorials on GANs that I came across the only monitored quantity is training loss. 1) Are there any general conclusions that could be derived from comparing training and validation losses in a GAN? 2) If the losses on training and validation data have a different pattern, what can the validation loss tell about the performance of a GAN? 3) In ideal case scenario should the adversarial losses have similar pattern on training and validation data? 4) Lets say we have a CycleGAN. The discriminator is basically a classifier. Can we diagnose memorization in a discriminator of a GAN by monitoring its loss on unseen data(validation set)?
