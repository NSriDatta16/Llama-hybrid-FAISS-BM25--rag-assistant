Average of grouped rows in Sql Server

I have an Sql Server Table.. it's something like this: Id ...... Column1 ...... Column2 ```````````````````````````````` 1 ........ 1 ............. 34 2 ........ 1 ............. 44 3 ........ 2 ............. 45 4 ........ 2 ............. 36 5 ........ 2 ............. 23 6 ........ 3 ............. 68 7 ........ 3 ............. 26 So, I need to select the average of Column2,but group with column1 before doing that. I mean, if I say Avg(Column2) it just returns a single row with the average of all rows. What I need is, first i need to group them by column so: Average of column2 where column1 = 1 Average of column2 where column1 = 2 Average of column2 where column1 = 3 So I want 3 rows returned with the averages of respective values of column1. I am lost at doing this, any hints / help please? ps: I tried several related questions, and none of them helped / I couldn't understand.
