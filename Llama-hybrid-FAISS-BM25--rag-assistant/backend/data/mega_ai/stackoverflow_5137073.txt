If you want a sane way to match a url fragment that doesn't start with a scheme, then I think you're stuck matching hostnames that have valid top-level domains. You can get an authoritative list of all the TLDs from IADA . Unfortunately, that's a long list, and too arbitrary to match programmatically, so you'll be stuck with a huge string in your regex unless you pare down the list some. But either way, search for a word that looks like [^/]*\.(ac|ad|ae|aero|af|ag|â€¦|zw)/.* (word boundaries excepted).
