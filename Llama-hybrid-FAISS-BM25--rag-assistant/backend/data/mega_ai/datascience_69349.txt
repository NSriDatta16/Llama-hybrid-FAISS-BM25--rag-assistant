Attention to multiple areas of same sentence

Lets consider some sentences below: "Datascience exchange is a wonderful platform to get answers to datascience related queries and it helps to learn various concepts too" "Can company1 buy company2? What will be their total turnover then?" "Coronavirus was originated in china. After that it is spreading all over the world. To prevent it everyone has to take care of cleanliness and prefer vegetarians." In all above sentences you can see there are multiple questions or utternaces. Sometimes separated by and sometimes by question mark and sometimes by just a dot. A rule based separation of these sentences fail in many cases. I want to split these sentences in individual intents. One of the approach I am guessing is by using attention mechanism on different parts of sentences. I cant use gensim etc sentence embeddings as I dont have clear sentence boundaries here. Can someone suggests if attention approach will work? If yes, any similar code if they can point to, that would be helpful as I haven't coded this before. If any other better approach can solve this problem then please suggest.
