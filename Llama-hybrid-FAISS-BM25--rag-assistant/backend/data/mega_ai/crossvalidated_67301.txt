Strictly speaking, a true weighted average of your returns rate would be just (sum of returns)/(sum of counts). This would be like your overall mean return rate, but it's technically a weighted average of the individual return rates of each name. What I'm not sure about is why you're looking to calculate a weighted average. If your eventual goal is to create a metric that measures the performance of each name in a certain way, what role does the weighted average play? It sounds like your concern is that if you create this metric/score for each name, then you're prone to having extreme values for names with small counts, which may be "false alarms" in a certain sense? If that's the case, then what you really want to do is create a credibility-weighting scheme for your metric/score where you combine the overall mean return rate with the individual mean return rate. Specifically, it would go something like this. For name F, the cred-weighted return rate would be 10/50*Z+(Overall Mean)*(1-Z), and Z=50/(50+K) where K is some count value you consider to be adequate. You can choose K by judgement, and the beauty is that the result is not sensitive to K. As the count goes up, the weight on that name's actual results increases. There is some Bayesian basis for this formula, but that is beyond the scope of this comment :-).
