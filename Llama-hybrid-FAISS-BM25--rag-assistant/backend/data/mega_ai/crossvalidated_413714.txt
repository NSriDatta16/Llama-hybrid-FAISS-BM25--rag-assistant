When $p=1$ or $p=0$ , variance of each individual $X_i$ , mean of them, sum of them, or any deterministic function of them will be $0$ because now $X_i$ 's are certain (they become constant), i.e. you know what's going to happen. For example, if $p=1$ , then all $X$ will be $1$ , and the average will still be $1$ . One can tell you the result without uncertainty as I did.
