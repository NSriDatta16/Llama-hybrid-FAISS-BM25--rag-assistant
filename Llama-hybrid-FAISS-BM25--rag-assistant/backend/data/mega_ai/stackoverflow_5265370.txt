I like the CSS transitions method but the pragmatist in me remembers the effect of the top navigation dropping in can also be easily done with jQuery. $(document).ready(function(){ $("#nav").slideDown("fast"); }); http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/ To get a fancy bounce effect you will need to additionally include jQuery UI with easing methods (in Effects Core). $(document).ready(function(){ $("#nav").slideDown("fast", "easeOutBounce"); }); http://jqueryui.com/download - be sure to include Effects Core http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/ - The easing methods are documented here
