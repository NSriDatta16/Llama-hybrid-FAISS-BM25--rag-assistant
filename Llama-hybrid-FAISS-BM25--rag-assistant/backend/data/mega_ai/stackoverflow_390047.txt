As an alternative to Sphinx and Lucene, a relatively simple search engine can be created using the Xapian library. + Supports many advanced search features (such as relevancy ranking) + Fast - You would need to learn the API to create your interface - Requires a php extension to be installed Note also that Xapian stores its data in a separate index to mysql. You might also be interested in Forage which is a wrapper for Solr, Xapian and Lucene. The Xapian people also created the Omega search engine which is a frontend to Xapian, and can be called via cgi.
