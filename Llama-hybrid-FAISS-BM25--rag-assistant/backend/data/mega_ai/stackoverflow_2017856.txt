Does Microsoft SQL Report Builder require Reporting Services running at all?

I'm having trouble figuring this out. I stopped ALL of local SQL Services, e.g. SQL Server, SQL Agent, Reporting Services. Then using Report Builder 2.0 to create a report connecting to a remote SQL Server (No SSRS running) out in the farm. When I click on "Run" button, for some odd reasons, it still render the report. I thought you must have SSRS running in the first place. Is SQL Reporting Services even required for Report Builder? Img alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?0bf8bb1f1d.jpg
