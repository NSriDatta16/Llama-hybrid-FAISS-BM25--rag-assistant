How to pick a specific object from a Linq Query using Distinct?

I have a list with two or more objects of class Agent. Name = "A" Priority = 0 ResultCount = 100 ; Name = "B" Priority = 1 ResultCount = 100 ; Both objects have the same ResultCount. In that case I only need one object and not two or more. I did this with a Linq Query with Distinct and an custom made Comparer. IEnumerable distinctResultsAgents = (from agt in distinctUrlsAgents select agt).Distinct(comparerResultsCount); With this query I get only one object from the list but I never know which one. But I don't want just any object, I want object "B" because the Priority is higher then object "A". How can I do that? My custom Comparer is very simple and has a method like this: public bool Equals(Agent x, Agent y) { if (x == null || y == null) return false; if (x.ResultCount == y.ResultCount) return true; return false; }
