When is it ok to remove observations from a dataset

I have a dataset, equal to 135,997 rows and 9 columns, the head of the table looks like this fixed_id time_period default_flag score_1 score_2 score_3 score_4 score_5 score_6 1 1 1 3 4 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 My question is, when is it ok to remove rows 3 and 4 in this dataset? Plan: I plan to estimate a series of multivariate logistic regression models to identify the best combination of factors containing any mixture of score_1 to score_6. My thought process: If I have a dependent variable and no explanatory variables - I see no logical reason to keep these observations in. Is there any statistical reasoning to keep them in e.g. a present dependent variable but no explanatory variables still adds to degrees of freedom or other? Other comments: My reasoning for wanting to remove these rows is that I will have a substantially smaller dataset and this will greatly improve the time to estimate a series of multivariate logistic regressions. Edit: to be clear, I only want to remove rows where all scores 1-6 are missing.
