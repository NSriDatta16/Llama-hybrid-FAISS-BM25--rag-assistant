Is it possible to register a user and submit a comment with one form with Wordpress?

Is it possible to do both registering for an account and submit a comment at the same time? I want the user to be able to do this all on one page to ecourage the registration rather than be discouraged about typing something, not realizing they had to be registered and thus having to leave the page. I think that this could be done by adding register user action to the submit comment action, but not sure how to do it with the prebuilt wordpress add_action or do_action functions. Has anyone tried this, or know of any plug-ins that do this already? I searched but couldn't find anything helpful. Thanks.
