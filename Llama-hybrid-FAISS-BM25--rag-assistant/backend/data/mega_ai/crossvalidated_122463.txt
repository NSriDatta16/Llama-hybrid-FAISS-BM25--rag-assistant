Does a Bayesian network include the CPTs?

I'm preparing slides for a lecture, and I require some guidance. I'm only talking about discrete variables. How would you formally define the concepts surrounding Bayesian networks? A Bayesian network is just the graph (without CPTs). A Bayesian network is a graph, together with a set of compatible CPTs. A Bayesian network is a set of CPTs (inducing the graph). I find support for the first two options within the literature. E.g. the books by Pearl (1986, Probabilistic reasoning...) or Koller and Friedman (2009, Probabilistic Graphical Models...) define a BN as just the graph/DAG that has to be compatible with some distribution. Then many resources say that a BN defines a distribution (e.g. Russel and Norvig, 2009, AI - A modern Approach). What is the more common, or more accessible way of defining BNs?
