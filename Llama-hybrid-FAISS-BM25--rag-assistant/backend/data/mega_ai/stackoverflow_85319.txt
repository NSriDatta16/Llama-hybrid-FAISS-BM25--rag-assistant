Don't delete them right away. Calling the garbage collector for each object is a bad idea. Normally you really don't want to mess with the garbage collector at all, and even time critical processes are just race conditions waiting to happen if they're that sensitive. But if you know you'll have busy vs light load periods for your app, you might try a more general GC.Collect() when you reach a light period to encourage cleanup before the next busy period.
