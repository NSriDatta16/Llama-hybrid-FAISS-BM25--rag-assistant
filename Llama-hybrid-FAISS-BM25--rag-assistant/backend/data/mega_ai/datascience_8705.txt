collaborative filtering using graph and machine learning

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Collaborative filtering based recommendation using machine learning approach and graph based approach ? Say I have user purchase data (user_name, user_location, user_company_name, product_name, product_price, product_ingredients) and would like to recommend product for user based on what other user from the same location, company are buying, based on product price, ingredients etc. How to decide on which of them is suitable for a given use case? I would like to evaluate Neo4j (Graph database) and Mahout (Machine learning) for Collaborative filtering.
