Getting back to this issue now (had to move onto other fires for a bit) @Jonathan Webb - I tried some the ideas but with no success. In fact I learned we are doing something similar (calling an external program using post build tasks) in other internal projects. I'm inclined to believe it is some interaction with the jsmin.exe tool or some other foolish error on my part. All is not lost however, another developer turned my attention to the YUI Compressor and its implementation in .NET . Through some manual .csproj manipulation I was able to achieve my goals and then some (including CSS compression)!
