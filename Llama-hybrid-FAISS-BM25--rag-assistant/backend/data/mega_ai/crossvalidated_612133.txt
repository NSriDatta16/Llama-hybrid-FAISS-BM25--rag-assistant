Yes, it does. The prior distribution is about where you think the possible values of the parameter (the difference in means) can be. Normality is about the shape of the data distribution in the population or about the distribution of residuals. You can have uniform/half-Cauchy/horse-shoe prior, but that doesn't mean the data are uniform/half-Cauchy/horse-shoe distributed. In Bayesian analysis (depending on the software), you can change the distribution of residuals from normal to something else, so your Bayesian test doesn't need to assume a normal distribution, but by default, it does, and that is something else than the prior distribution. This can be done with frequentest/likelihood based analysis too, but it is less common
