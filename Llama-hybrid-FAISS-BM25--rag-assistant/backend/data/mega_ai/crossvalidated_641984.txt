Binary problems use features to make predictions about a binary outcome: yes/no, alive/dead, dog/cat, etc. A multi-class problem uses features to make predictions about an outcome that can be one of multiple categories: dog/cat/alligator, 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 , shirt/boots/dress , etc. A multilabel problem uses features to make predictions about an outcome than can be one, several, or none or multiple categories. This is an archetypal multilabel problem. There are thirteen categories, so the problem cannot be binary. The categories are not mutually exclusive, so the problem cannot be multi-class . Therefore, a reasonable task is to predict the probability of having each disorder vs not having the disorder, exactly a multilabel problem. One of the more basic models that still treats this as more complex than just thirteen binary problems (e.g., bipolar vs not, ADHD vs not, etc) is a multivariate probit model, which allows for correlations between outcomes. For instance, if ADHD and schizophrenia tend to go together, the model can make a point to assign high probabilities to one when the other has a high predicted probability. Sophisticated models of such an outcome could include neural networks. These multilabel problems are far from obscure, so there should be plenty of tutorials available about the coding. I will close with links to some posts on here about multilabel problems.
