One-to-rest Weight vectors in one-to-one multiclass SVC

I'm attempting to generate some one-to-rest weight vectors for a multi-class SVC for feature selection purposes. However, I'm current using one of the several LibSVM ports, which inherently performs one-to-one in multi-class classifications. The columns of the sv_conf output does not appear to me to be duals of one-to-rest classifications. But is there a way to re-construct one-to-rest feature weights from the output of one-to-one classifications, or I'd have to run several one-to-one and obtain the weight vectors separately for each class?
