Converting a fairly simple C# Class library into a COM object?

Here's my problem: I have to call a web service with a secure header from a classic ASP page that returns a complex data type. For various reasons concerning a 3rd party tool it has to be classic ASP. We decided that I should create an external dll to do this - which I did (in c#) so it returns a dataset (Something ASP can understand). However now I need to expose that function to the ASP page. Because this is classic ASP I think the only straightforward way to do this is to expose this class library as a COM object. I need to know the down and dirty easiest way to accomplish this task. What do I have to do to my dll? I have never created a COM object before only used. Somebody said my class has to be static and I can't have a constructor. Is this true? Can someone layout the steps for me? HELP! (o: Edit: This specific problem is now solved however as Robert Rossney noted I can't do anything with the DataSet in classic ASP. This has led me to post a second question here regarding implementing XmlTextWriter - Robert if you see this I think you could really help!
