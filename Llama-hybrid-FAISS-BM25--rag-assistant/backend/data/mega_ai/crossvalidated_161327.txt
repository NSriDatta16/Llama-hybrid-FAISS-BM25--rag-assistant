What do you mean by "serious way"? A timeline of slightly outdated collections of (now over 10000) published (and I guess peer-reviewed) papers based on the Self-Organizing Map are listed at the website of Kohonen's alma mater: Bibliography of SOM papers . One of the links on that website contains the text: Many of the papers on SOM analyze the method or present variants or generalizations of it. Most of the papers, however, apply the method or its variants in fields ranging from engineering (including image and signal processing and recognition, telecommunications, process monitoring and control, and robotics) and natural sciences to medicine, humanities, economics and mathematics.
