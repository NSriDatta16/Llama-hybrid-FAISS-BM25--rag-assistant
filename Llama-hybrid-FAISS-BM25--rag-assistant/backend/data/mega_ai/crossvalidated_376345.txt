You need to specify what you mean by 'analyze'. You seem to be dealing with a structural break in your time series . If your objective is to detect anomalies or to prove that a structural break occurred, there are tools for doing that. If your objective is forecasting, then the structural break has made your time series very difficult to forecast and your going to need a lot more data about the periods after the break to be able to generate any reliable forecasts. You will also want to look into some causal analysis of why the break happened.
