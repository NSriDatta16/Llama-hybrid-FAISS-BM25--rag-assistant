What to Do When a Log-binomial Model's Convergence Fails

There are times when one might want to estimate a prevalence ratio or relative risk, in preference to an odds ratio, for data with binary outcomes - say, if the outcome in question isn't rare, so the RR ~ OR relationship doesn't hold. I've implemented a model in R to do that, as follows: uni.out But I'm continually getting convergence issues, even when providing starting values (such as the coefficient estimates pulled from a logistic regression), or turning up the number of allowed iterations. I've also tried glm2 without any success. The two ideas I have from here are to either fit a poisson model to the same data using a sandwich estimator for the variance, or fitting the model using MCMC and taking the standard error of the posterior (this is being used alongside multiple imputation, so I can't just report the posterior). The problem is, I have no idea how to implement either one of these in R , nor if they're the best solution. Additionally, while using a model like: glm(Death ~ age, family= binomial(link=log),start=c(-3.15,0.03),data=data) I'm regularly get an error message "Error: cannot find valid starting values: please specify some", but not always. What is generating this message?
