Moving delegate-related function to a different thread

We are developing a library in C# that communicates with the serial port. We have a function that is given to a delegate. The problem is that we want it to be run in a different thread. We tried creating a new thread (called DatafromBot ) but keep using it as follows (first line): comPort.DataReceived += new SerialDataReceivedEventHandler(comPort_DataReceived); DatafromBot = new Thread(comPort_DataReceived); DatafromBot.Start(); comPort_DataReceived is defined as: Thread DatafromBot; public void comPort_DataReceived(object sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e) { ... } The following errors occur: Error 3 The best overloaded method match for 'System.Threading.Thread.Thread(System.Threading.ThreadStart)' has some invalid arguments C:...\IR52cLow\CommunicationManager.cs 180 27 IR52cLow Error 4 Argument '1': cannot convert from 'method group' to 'System.Threading.ThreadStart' C:...\IR52cLow\CommunicationManager.cs 180 38 IR52cLow Any ideas of how we should convert this to get it to compile? Please note that comPort.DataReceived (pay attention to "." instead of "_") lies within a system library and cannot be modified.
