Algorithm to detect how many words typed, also multi sentence support (Java)

Problem: I have to design an algorithm, which does the following for me: Say that I have a line (e.g.) alert tcp 192.168.1.1 (caret is currently here) The algorithm should process this line, and return a value of 4. I coded something for it, I know it's sloppy, but it works, partly. private int counter = 0; public void determineRuleActionRegion(String str, int index) { if (str.length() == 0 || str.indexOf(" ") == -1) { triggerSuggestionList(1); return; } //remove duplicate space, spaces in front and back before searching int num = str.trim().replaceAll(" +", " ").indexOf(" ", index); //Check for occurances of spaces, recursively if (num == -1) { //if there is no space //no need to check if it's 0 times it will assign to 1 triggerSuggestionList(counter + 1); counter = 0; return; //set to rule action } else { //there is a space counter++; determineRuleActionRegion(str, num + 1); } } //end of determineactionRegion() So basically I find for the space and determine the region (number of words typed). However, I want it to change upon the user pressing space bar . How may I go around with the current code? Or better yet, how would one suggest me to do it the correct way ? I'm figuring out on BreakIterator for this case... To add to that, I believe my algorithm won't work for multi sentences . How should I address this problem as well. -- The source of String str is acquired from textPane.getText(0, pos + 1); , the JTextPane. Thanks in advance. Do let me know if my question is still not specific enough. -- More examples: alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 22 return -1 (maximum of the typed text is 7 words) alert tcp 192.168.1.1 any return 4 (as it is still at 2nd arg) alert tcp return 2 (as it is still at 2nd arg) alert tcp return 3 alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> return 6 It is something like shell commands. As above. Though I think it does not differ much I believe, I just want to know how many arguments are typed. Thanks. -- Pseudocode Get whole paragraph from textpane if more than 1 line -> process the last line count how many arguments typed and return appropriate number else process current line count how many arguments typed and return appropriate number End
