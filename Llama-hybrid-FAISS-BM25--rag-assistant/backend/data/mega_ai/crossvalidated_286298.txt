How to create a markov chain with gamma marginal distribution and AR(1) coefficient of $\rho$

I want to generate a synthetic time series. The time series needs to be a markov chain with a gamma marginal distribution and an AR(1) parameter of $\rho$. Can I do this by simply using a gamma distribution as the noise term in an AR(1) model, or do I need to use a more sophisticated approach?
