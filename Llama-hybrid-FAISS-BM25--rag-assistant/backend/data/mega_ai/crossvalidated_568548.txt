It sounds like you might be interested in the literature on cartography and, more generally, data visualization. The former explicitly addresses questions of choropleth (area-filled) maps. Among the considerations in any such work are Purpose: Why do you want to draw this map? What message should it convey? Audience: To whom do you wish to communicate? Psychology: What are the ways in which maps and statistical graphics communicate information? How do people derive meaning from graphics? What methods of symbolization lend themselves to faster and more accurate understanding? Statistics: To what extent do the data suggest forms of visualization and grouping of the values? What are suitable ways of expressing and re-expressing data for visualization? The classic reference is Jacques Bertin, Semiology of Graphics. It contains extensive (thousands) of examples organized by a few basic principles. A modern study of the psychological aspects is Allen MacEachren, How Maps Work. It is difficult reading but provides rewarding insight. Another classic work is William Cleveland, Visualizing Data. Cleveland's group at Bell Labs conducted psychological studies aimed at obtaining scientific answers to these basic questions, leading to practical advice for constructing statistical graphics (and, incidentally, maps).
