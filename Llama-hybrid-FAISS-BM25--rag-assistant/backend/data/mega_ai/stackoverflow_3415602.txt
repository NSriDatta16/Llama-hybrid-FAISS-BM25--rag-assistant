Actually, I would see the most "elegant" way as defining each variation separately. The advantages: Selection of the proper calculation is done by the compiler at compiler-time (where it should be done), instead of at run-time. Each calculation method contains just the calculation code. The disadvantages: It's a bit more code (just learn to friggin' type) So, let's see, you've got: Fraction op Fraction Fraction op Value Value op Fraction Value op Value Times 4 operations, giving a grant total of just 16 methods, which will probably be about one line each.
