Questions around modelling arrival process of randomly sized groups

I have the following situation: I'm trying to model groups arriving to some location by some process. I assume the distribution on some interval $T$ is a Gamma-Poisson mixture where $\Lambda \sim Gamma(k, \theta)$ with $k$ , $\theta$ (shape, scale) known. I then get the marginal distribution of the number of groups arriving over $T$ as $N \sim NB(k, \frac{1}{1+\theta})$ see wiki where $NB$ is the Negative Binomial distribution with support on $\{0,1,...\}$ . Now I have two questions: Each group is of some unknown size (nr of people in the group) with an empirical average size of $a$ . I assume these groups $G_1, ..., G_N$ are independent random variables distributed as $\text{Geometric}(1/a)$ . I'm interested in the distribution of the total amount of people arriving which would then be the sum of these groups which see wiki has a Negative Binomial distribution too. So the distribution of the total amound of people arriving would then be $A \sim \text{NB}(N,1/a)$ . So it's a Negative Binomial where $N$ is itself a Negative Binomial as above. I would like to find a closed form expression for the marginal distribution of $A$ if possible. I started trying to marginalize out $N$ but it ends up as a series of quite complex terms so I wonder if there are other better ways to find closed form expressions to things like this? In case there is no closed form expression I thought I could try to approximate the marginal distribution of $A$ by simply scaling $N$ by $a$ . However I'm unsure of whether this even makes sense and which distribution I should scale in that case. If I should just scale $N$ , as $Y = aN$ (and I was unable to find results of whether this would still be a Negative Binomial and if so how the parameters $k$ and $1/(1+\theta)$ would be affected) or since the distribution of $N$ is the result of a Poisson-Gamma mixture would it make sense to scale the intensity $\Lambda$ so that $a\Lambda \sim Gamma(k, a\theta) \Rightarrow N \sim NB(k, \frac{1}{1+a\theta})$ . Any thoughts on this given the situation I'm trying to model?
