Can you recommend a good php Gantt charting development?

I would like to add a simple Gantt chart to my development, was wondering if you could recommend any that seem good to you. I don’t need anything really flash (I’m not trying to reproduce MS Project) just need to plot a number of projects over a 24/7 timeframe. Would appreciate your comments
