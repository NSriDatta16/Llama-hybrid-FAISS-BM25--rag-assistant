How to normalize time series?

This is a general question on normalization of data so that all the variables are within the same range. Why do we normalize data in pattern classification? How to normalize time series which is multivariate? I have collected motion time series from Kinect skeleton tracking. In general, what is the process of normalization when the features are the joint angles, x,y,z coordinate of the pixel and in cases of features say flower width, size, color ?
