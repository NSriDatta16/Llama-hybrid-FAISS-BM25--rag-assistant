Well, all requirements in 5.2.7 should be observed together . You can't just stop after 5.2.7/2 and start writing code that supposedly satisfies everything "up to 5.2.7/2". The entire 5.2.7 defines the specification of dynamic_cast . The polymorphic requirement is singled out because it is conditional . When you use dynamic_cast for upcasts, the polymorphic requirement does not apply (in fact, dynamic_cast is equivalent to static_cast in upcasts). The polymorphic requirement only applies when you use dynamic_cast for downcasts or crosscasts. The specification of dynamic_cast is organized sequentially, meaning that it takes care of simpler cases first, and then proceeds to more complicated applications. You are supposed to read it step by step, until it covers your specific situation. Everything you read along that path applies cumulatively, And "otherwise" means: "if we haven't covered your case yet, then continue reading".
