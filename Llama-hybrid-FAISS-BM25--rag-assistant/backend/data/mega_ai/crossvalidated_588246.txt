The hidden nodes (states) in an HMM are random variables, while in an RNN only the input nodes could be considered random variables, all the other nodes are just deterministic nonlinear functions. Thus, it is difficult to formulate an HMM with an RNN. However, some attempts have been made to combine the ideas of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), of which HMMs would be examples, and neural networks, e.g. the VRRN , alpha-nets , or GenHMM . How much those still resemble vanilla RNNs or DBNs is up for discussion.
