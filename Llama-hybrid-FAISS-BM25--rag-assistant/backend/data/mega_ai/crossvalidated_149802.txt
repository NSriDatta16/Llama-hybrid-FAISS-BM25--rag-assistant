Linear SVM can handle unbalanced data sets just fine by using class-weights on the misclassification penalty. This functionality is available in any decent SVM implementation. The objective function for class-weighted SVM is as follows: $$\min_{\xi,\mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2 + C_{\mathcal{P}}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{P}} xi_i + C_\mathcal{N} \sum_{i\in\mathcal{N}} \xi_i, $$ where the minority class uses a higher misclassification penalty. A common heuristic is as follows: $$C_\mathcal{P} \times |\mathcal{P}| = C_\mathcal{N} \times |\mathcal{N}|,$$ with $|\mathcal{P}|$ and $\mathcal{N}|$ the number of positive and negative training samples, respectively.
