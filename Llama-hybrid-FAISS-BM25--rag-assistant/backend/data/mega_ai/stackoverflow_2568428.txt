Clearing TortoiseSVN authentication cache from the command line

TortoiseSVN is nice for the most part, but one thing that blows in a team development situation where more than one person is using a particular PC is the authentication. When I'm working on stuff, I like to save my credentials so that I don't need to keep entering it in for logging, branching, committing, etc. The problem is that I always forget to clear my credentials when I walk away, because: I don't want to have to re-enter it again if no one else uses the computer and purposely forget. It's a PITA to do and requires 4 too many mouse clicks to do. Ideally, I would just have a couple of nice batch files in SVN to deal with this sort of thing, including rebuilding the icon cache (which I have working okay). I looked at the command line documentation and it doesn't mention clearing the authentication cache. Has anyone figured out how to do it? I think it'll encourage me to clear my credentials more often. It's not the end of the world since we can always change the author after the commit, but still...
