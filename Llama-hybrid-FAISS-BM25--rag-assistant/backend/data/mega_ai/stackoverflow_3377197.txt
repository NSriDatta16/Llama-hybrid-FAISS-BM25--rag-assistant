If you are the one producing these lists then the following could be a trivial solution: interface StringList extends List {} class ArrayStringList extends ArrayList implements StringList {} Not too elegant though. I think we have reached the boundaries of the Java language here. I have encountered the same problem, and couldn't find a better solution either...
