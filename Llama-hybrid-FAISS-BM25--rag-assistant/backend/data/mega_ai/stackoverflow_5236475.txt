JAVA: Possible to add a runnable thread into a queue?

I recently began working with Threads and I am trying to complete a Java implementation of the Looper class in Android. Basically I am making a Java class that puts threads into a queue that will then be executed by the Looper class. I have the code completed for the most part but have an issue with the enqueuing of tasks. In the Looper class I have the queue declared and my enqueue method: List queue; public synchronized void enqueue(Runnable runnable) { queue.add(runnable); notify(); // signal a waiting thread } I then created another class called TaskManager to add Tasks into the queue. I receive the error when I call: loop.enqueue(new Task()); Where Task() implements runnable and just adds two integers together in its run() method...this is just a test. The error I receive is: Exception in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.NullPointerException at Looper.enqueue(Looper.java:20) (this is the queue.add(runnable)) at TaskMaker.run(TaskMaker.java:16) (this is the loop.enqueue(new Task()) I'm obviously doing something wrong and not implementing this right...how should I go about this? Is the way I am enqueuing the task right? Thanks for any help it is much appreciated!
