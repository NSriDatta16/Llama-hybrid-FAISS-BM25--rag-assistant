At the very least, you have to append the output to body , html , or document to see it in a browser. Of course, you can output it as a Javascript-alert, but I strongly discourage the usage of alert(); . EDIT 1 You can add the output to a variable. var globalVariable = ''; $(document).ready(function() { $.ajax({ type: "POST", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", data: "{}", url:"page.aspx/getData", dataType: "json", success: function(data) { if (data.hasOwnProperty("d")) DoSomething(data.d); else DoSomething(data); } }); function DoSomething(msg) { var SComms = msg; globalVariable = SComms; } If you do it like this, you can access the variable later on. It is important however that you declare it outside of the ready() method or else the value is lost because it goes out of scope .
