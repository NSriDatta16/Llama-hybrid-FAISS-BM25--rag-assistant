A Bayesian Network can be viewed as a data structure that provides the skeleton for representing a joint distribution compactly in a factorized way. For any valid joint distribution two restrictions should be satisfied: 1) All probabilities in the distribution should be non negative; 2) All the probabilities should sum to one. Normally a graph is determined by the ordering of the factorization and the conditional independencies assumed in the independency structure of the distribution. Since we are dealing with an invalid Bayes Network we don't need to follow the procedure, and we can design many counterexamples to verify that the sum of the distribution would be not 1. For instance, assume that we have such a graph over three binary variables: And we can obtain the joint distribution easily: in all $2^3$ possibilities at least two are 1: $P(a_0, b_0, c_0) = P(a_0|c_0)P(b_0|a_0)P(c_0|b_0)=1$ $P(a_1, b_1, c_1) = P(a_1|c_1)P(b_1|a_1)P(c_1|b_1)=1$ Then $\sum_{A,B,C} P(A, B, C)\ge2>1$ , so the distribution is invalid(indicating the cyclic Bayes Network is invalid). If we remove any one of the directions in the graph and adjust the parameters in the CPTs accordingly we can find that the joint distribution will be valid.
