Does it make sense to interpolate image just before a CNN?

I'm training a CNN with images which have lots of horizontal black lines (due to the nature of the sensor). I'm thinking in removing this artifacts by some kind of preprocessing (interpolation, median filters...). The thing is: does it make sense, since the CNN tries to apply optimal filtering? (if some 2D filtering is intended to be done just before the CNN, is just adding a deterministic layer at the beginning of the net...)
