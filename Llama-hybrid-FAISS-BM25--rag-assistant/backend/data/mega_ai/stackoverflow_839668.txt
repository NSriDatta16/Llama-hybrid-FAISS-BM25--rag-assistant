will mmap use user cpu instead of whole sys cpu? (solaris)

when use mmap to allocate some anonymous mem, we often set the start address as 0/null so mmap will figure out the starting address by itself. And to get the start address, it will work thought the whole virtual memory space to find a hole which could put the chuck of mem to be allocated. I guess this is calculated as user cpu instead of sys cpu. If the virtual memory is fragmented, then the time to find the starting address will use more user cpu, is my understanding correct
