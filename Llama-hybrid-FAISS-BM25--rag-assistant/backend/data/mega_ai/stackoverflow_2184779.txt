PartCover and TeamCity

I am using TeamCity to build via a solution file. I am attempting to get " PartCover " to work it. It is easy enough to point it to the partcover.exe, I am just unsure how to get team city to produce a proper report from the results of our nUnit test. I have added the a coverage.zip file to our setup and it is displaying the correct info under the artefacts tab , however under the code coverage tab the only info displayed is "Coverage by assembly" and nothing else. Any help or ideas would be great.
