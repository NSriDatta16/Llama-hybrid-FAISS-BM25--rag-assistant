Offline version of a web site

I've written a web app in PHP and MySQL that permits users to insert orders from a catalog. The customer now asked me to create a version of the website that runs on the agent's PC even when they are not connected to the Internet. they must insert orders and then, when connected, send the orders to the DB. The agent's webserver has to be synchronized with the product images and previous orders. Do you know what can I use to obtain this result? I've seen Server2go , but it runs only on Windows. I would like something more portable.
