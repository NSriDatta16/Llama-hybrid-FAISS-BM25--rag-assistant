I don't understand why you just don't make a configurable product based on size for every color? That way you don't need to hack the way Magento works. If you make a simple product that is part of a configurable product visible on the frontend, it will not link to a configurable product, if it is part of one (as you have found out). It wouldn't really make sense for you either because if your configurable products are based on size AND color, the simple products are going to have a set size and set color. You would be done, fully functional, and hack-free if you just made a configurable product for each shirt color. Then, you can also use related products to show other shirt colors. The less hacking, the better. That's my opinion.
