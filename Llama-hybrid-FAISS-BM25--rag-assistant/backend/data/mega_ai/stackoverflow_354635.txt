Create an NSView subclass that holds an NSColor as an ivar. In the drawRect method, create an NSBezierPath of the appropriate size, using the view's bounds. Then set the color [myColor set] and fill the path [myPath fill] . There's a lot more you can do, such as set transparency, a border, and so on and so on, but I'll leave that to the docs unless you have a specific question. To use the NSView subclass, just drag a view object onto your nib, and choose the name of your subclass in custom class in IB's inspector. You'll need to also set an outlet to it in your controller, so you can change the color as needed.
