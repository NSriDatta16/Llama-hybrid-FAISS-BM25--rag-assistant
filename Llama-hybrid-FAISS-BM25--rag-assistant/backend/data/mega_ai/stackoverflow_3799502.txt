The idea is to make sure your header file is only read once during build. The idiom to accomplish that is the structure: #ifndef _SOME_UNIQUE_NAME #define _SOME_UNIQUE_NAME /* The actual header code */ #endif This means that you should choose a name that you are pretty sure will be unique and is a valid identifier for #ifndef. You should also make sure that the identifier is not used in actual code or confused with a variable or something. Having an upper case tag marks the idiom clearly. Besides that, it is merely conventions not language that dictate that choice. Visual Studio's wizards generates a GUID like identifier for. Sone compilers support #pragma once that have the same effect.
