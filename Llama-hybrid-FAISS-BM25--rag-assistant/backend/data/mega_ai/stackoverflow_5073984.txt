Provisioned iPhone not showing in Xcode Organizer (or iTunes)

I've recently set up an app id and provisioning profile and was able to test my app on the device successfully. I then downloaded some sample iOS XCode projects and upon deploying one of them and deleting the sample app from the phone have since been unable to sync the phone with iTunes or see it as connected in the Xcode organizer window (the device is still listed in the lefthand pane, but shows up as disconnected). All new projects created in Xcode are now greeted with the following message when I attempt to build and run on the device. No provisioned iOS device is connected. I'm running Xcode 3.2.5 and iOS 4.2. Any ideas? Many thanks.
