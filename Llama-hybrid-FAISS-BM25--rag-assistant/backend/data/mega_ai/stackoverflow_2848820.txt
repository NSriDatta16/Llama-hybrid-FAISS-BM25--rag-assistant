One specific idea that attempts to leverage Fitts law is to put the most often used controls at the bottom of the screen (i.e., the opposite of current GUI conventions with the menubar and toolbar). This allows users to touch multiple controls in sequence without withdrawing their hands to see the effects, shortening the mean distance moved between inputs. For a tablet, kiosk, or desktop device, the bottom of the screen is probably also the hands’ “rest” position. However, there is the potential problem of the most important controls being the last thing the users sees when scanning the display.
