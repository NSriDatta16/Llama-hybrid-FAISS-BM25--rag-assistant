How to install multiple packages and post-processing?

I find myself in a unique scenario -- it has to be, because no searching I do seems to turn up any answers. But maybe there's a MacOS X guru out there that can answer this for me? I'm using PackageMaker to create an install process for my company's application. It's a cross-platform app and my home base is Linux and Windows, so please forgive my MacOS X un-intellect. We've got two software bundles -- er, apps. One is Other.app, which is developed by an external company which we are "bundling" our software with. Our app is Stats.app. Our app will run as a launch agent, so correspondingly I have a .plist file that works when I install by hand in the terminal. My goals of the install process are this: Install Other.app to /Applications Install Stats.app to /Users/ /Applications (see NOTE) Install Stats.plist to /Users/ /Library/LaunchAgents Post-process Stats.plist to modify the "ProgramArguments" key so that the path is correct: %{HOME}/Applications/Stats.app/Contents/MacOS/Stats Post-execute some simple commands: /Application/Other.app/Contents/MacOS/Other --configure=config.txt Check exit codes, and if all is good, tell the user we're finished. I'm hoping -- no...praying! -- that someone how there has information for how this can be done. To clarify, it's not a requirement that Stats.app be in the users home directory. It is a requirement that the Launch agent is in the home directory since Stats.app requires a running Carbon to operate.
