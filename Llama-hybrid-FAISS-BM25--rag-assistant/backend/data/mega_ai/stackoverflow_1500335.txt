You get multiple events because there really are multiple events. Windows animates the resize by doing it several times as you drag the window (by default, you can change it in the registry I think). What you could do is add a delay. Do a clearTimeout, setTimout(myResize,1000) every time the IE event fires. Then, only the last one will do the actual resize.
