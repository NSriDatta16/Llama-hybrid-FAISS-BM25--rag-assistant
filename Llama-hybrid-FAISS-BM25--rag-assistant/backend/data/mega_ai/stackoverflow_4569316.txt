Does Xcode compile images?

What I did is as follows. Imported (including copy items) 20 images to my project. (using drag & drop) Selected Device for building the project - Build the project. Installed on device (in my case iPad) Ok. Now Application is installed - I started iPhone Explorer (to explore & check whether images are copied into .app or not). I found that images are copied properly but when I opened images I found them empty? Here is the video that demonstrates the empty images. My Question is Does Xcode compiles images? How does Xcode copies images into .app file while building? Why we can not see the images within .app? Once application is build, how to ensure that images are copied properly?
