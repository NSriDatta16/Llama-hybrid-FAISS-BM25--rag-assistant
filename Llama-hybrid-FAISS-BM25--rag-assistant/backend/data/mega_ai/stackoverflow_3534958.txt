ItemsControl Drag and Drop

I have an ItemsControl with a DataTemplate that is bound to an ObservableCollection of integers. And in the Windows Resources: I'm trying to implement the ability to drag and drop items within the ItemsControl (i.e. to be able to reorder the integers). Does anyone have a simple example of how to do this? I hooked up the PreviewMouseMove, DragEnter and Drop events. The problem is that I can't figure out how to determine which item is being dragged and where it is dragged to. It seems that the entire ItemsControl gets passed into the events.
