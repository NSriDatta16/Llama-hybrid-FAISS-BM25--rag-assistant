Is it bad use "display: table;" to organise a layout into 2 columns?

I am trying to make a 2 column layout, apparently the bane of CSS. I know you shouldn't use tables for layout, but I've settled on this CSS. Note the use of display: table etc. div.container { width: 600px; height: 300px; margin: auto; display: table; table-layout: fixed; } ul { white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; display: table-cell; width: 40%; } div.inner { display: table-cell; width: auto; } With this layout: First Second Third Hello world This seems to work admirably. However, I can't help wondering - am I obeying the letter of the "don't use tables" rule, but not the spirit? I think it's ok, since there's no positioning markup in the HTML code, but I'm just not sure about the "right" way to do it. I can't use css float, because I want the columns to expand and contract with the available space. Please, stack overflow, help me resolve my existential sense of dread at these pseudo-tables.
