Comparing ranking methods across multiple

I have a bunch of ranking algorithms that rank a collection of $k$ items. I have $n$ of these collections that I want to evaluate each algorithm on. If I didn't have $n$ of these collections I would just use the Spearman rank to evaluate the correlation of each ranking algorithm to the true ranks, but how should I compare the algorithms when there are $n$ such collections I want to evaluate on? I care about the ranks all equally, unlike in information retrieval where high ranked items are more important.
