To round down to the nearest 20: y = Math.floor(y / 20) * 20; Also, .top() and .left() don't exist: you'll want: $(this).offset().top and $(this).offset().left for getting the positions .css({left: ..., top: ...}) for setting them Another thing is that if you only want one of these bookmark images to be floating around, depending on where you click, then you'll probably want to put the at the level (at the end), and positioned absolutely, so it is free to move around the entire document. Then, don't bother subtracting the offset of the paragraph from the y coordinate. Sample code : $('p').click(function (e) { var offset = $(this).offset(); var top = Math.floor(e.pageY / 20) * 20; $('.bookMarkImg').css({ left: offset.left, top: top }).show(); }); See a working demo : http://jsfiddle.net/upgBa/ Note : You may have to consider any padding/margin/border you have on the paragraphs and the body though, which could throw off the calculations (just subtract the "top" portions of these).
