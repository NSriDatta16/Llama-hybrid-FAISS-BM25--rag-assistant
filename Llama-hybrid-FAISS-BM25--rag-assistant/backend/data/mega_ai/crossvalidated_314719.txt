How to calculate ATT using Propensity Score Matching method

I am working on thesis work for Mphil. I am interested to estimate the average treatment on treated effect (ATT) by using propensity score matcing method. The primary data on 320 respondents, out of which 160 are beneficiaries of a social cash transfer and 160 are non-beneficiaries have been targeted. The propensity scores will be calculated through binary logistic regression. Is this suitalbe to estimate ATT in this situation?
