Of course you can use application scope for storing these components if they are used by all users in different parts of application. Now, possible issues are : size of the component(s) time needed for initialization if these are set during application start racing conditions between setting/getting states of these components For the first, there are ways to calculate size of a component in memory. Lately there were lots of posts on this topic so it would be easy to find some. If you dont have some large structure or query saved inside, I guess you're ok here. Second, again, if you are not filling this cfc with some large query from DB or doing some slow parsing, you're ok here too. Third, pay attention to possible situations, where more users are changing states of these components. If so use cflock on each setting of the components the state.
