Statics tend to hurt testability. In particular, you'll find it relatively hard to test anything which uses the repository. Instead of creating a new repository on each call, it should be part of the state of anything which requires it. Use dependency injection to supply the repository, which implements an appropriate interface. You can then test anything which uses the repository by mocking it out. Of course, this is an idealist solution which may not be the pragmatic solution for your case - but it's a generally object-oriented one. You could have the "current" repository and still be reasonably testable, but it still requires static state which is generally frowned upon. It's a slight code smell, but it would at least be better than the static methods.
