Finding optimal beta when there are multiple different errors

I am working on an econometrics model that I'm not sure how to approach. I've made a utility function where the weights have noise as well. In short it's: $$ y_i = (\beta + \epsilon_i)x_i + u_i $$ How would one estimate beta hat? So far, I've approached it by estimating two beta hats from: $$\min_\beta \epsilon_i^2 = \min_\beta \sum (y_i - \beta x_i - \epsilon_i x_i)^2 \implies \hat{\beta}_\epsilon = \frac{\sum x_i y_i -\epsilon_i x_i^2}{\sum x_i^2} $$ $$ \min_\beta u_i^2 = \min_\beta \sum (\frac {y_i - \beta x_i -u_i}{x_i})^2 \implies \hat{\beta}_u = \frac{1}{n}\sum \frac {y_i - u_i}{x_i}$$ At the end of the day, $\hat{\beta}$ can be whatever you want it to albeit there are better $\hat{\beta}$'s. Is there a unique optimal $\hat{\beta}$? Is it useful to have $\hat{\beta}$'s which have a probability distribution? EDIT: I'm working on schelling's segregation model but I've added a wealth and distance from work as additional elements to the utility function. Currently, I am using the following utility, $$y_i = \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} - \beta_3 x_{3,i} + u_i $$ Where each $x_i$ characterizes matching race, wealth or distance from an employment and each $\beta_i$ is the subsequent weighting for each parameter. I wanted to add some more heterogeneity to each agent such that each agent had an individual preference set. The intuition is that some agents prefer living with the same race, others prefer having a shorter commute, etc. That's where I thought changing the model to the following would have an interesting effect: $$y_i = (\beta_1 + \epsilon_{1,i})x_{1,i} + (\beta_2 + \epsilon_{2,i})x_{2,i} - (\beta_3 + \epsilon_{3,i})x_{3,i} + u_i $$ For now, I assume that all the errors are i.i.d. and $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. I am simulating this in R.
