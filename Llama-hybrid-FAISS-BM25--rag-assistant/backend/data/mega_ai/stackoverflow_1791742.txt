Importing text objects and fonts embedded in swfs can have any number of weird embedding errors - in my experience it takes a lot of tweaking to get things right. A few things to look at: are you embedding all of the characters? Selective embedding might not be including the set of characters your trying to display. For example, if the text is bold but you only embedded the normal version of the font, the characters won't show up. are you embedding the font correctly? Make sure it's embedding as a flash type font if you're exporting from Flash Authoring CS4, or triple-check your embed syntax if you're embedding in Flex. One little typo can throw the whole thing off. Try exporting the movie clip from Flash Authoring CS4. Can you view the text there? This will help you trouble shoot whether the problem is on the Flash Authoring CS4 side or the Flex side. Hope that helps - embedded text can be a bit nasty. If you can include more code or link to a swf we could try to play around with it a bit more and give you more information.
