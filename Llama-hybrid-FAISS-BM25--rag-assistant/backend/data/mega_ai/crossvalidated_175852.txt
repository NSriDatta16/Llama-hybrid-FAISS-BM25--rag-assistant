How to deal with a systematic bias in the random forest model, and what are possible alternative modeling approaches?

I am trying to find a predictive model for my dataset with the following properties: I have 52 predictors, 1 response and 53 records. The predictors differ in scaling and type: 7 of them are categorical variables and the rest is numeric (with discrete and continuous values with different range). My first Idea was to use a Random Forest because it can handle both with categorical and continuous data and is useful for datasets with more variables than records. The result of the fit of the learning data is a 0.85 R^2. But consider the plot of the response variable against the modelled data: I think the model overrates the little values of the response and overrates the bigger ones. My questions: 1) How should I deal with this under-/overrating? What could be the reason for this and how could I improve the result? 2) Which other models can I use (I don't know much models which can deal with the described properties of my data)?
