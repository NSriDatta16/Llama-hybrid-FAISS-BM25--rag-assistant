An annotated Fisher would be an excellent resource! I don't think that you will be able to understand Fisher without at the same time attempting to understand other major parts of the development of statistics and Fisher's interactions with the other important contributors. I found Statistics in Psychology: An Historical Perspective by Michael Cowles to be very helpful. (Don't let the psych bit of the title put you off: the book is quite general and seems to be a very even-handed account.) On the topic of annotated Fisher, I quite recently annotated one of his paragraphs when I was asked to justify an assertion that Fisher proposed P-values to be indices of evidence against the null hypothesis. This is how I responded: I have looked around a bit without finding an exact specification because, as usual, Fisher's writing is awkward and requires some effortful interpretation on the reader's part. He says on p. 46 of Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference (I have the last edition): "Though recognizable as a psychological condition of reluctance, or resistance to the acceptance of a proposition, the feeling induced by a test of significance has an objective basis in that the probability statement on which it is based is a fact communicable to, and verifiable by, other rational minds. The level of significance in such cases fulfils the conditions of a measure of the rational grounds for the disbelief it engenders. It is more primitive, or elemental than, and does not justify, any exact probability statement about the proposition." Here it is again, with my editiorial and interpretive statements: "Though recognizable as a psychological condition of reluctance, or resistance to the acceptance of a proposition, the feeling induced by a test of significance has an objective basis [Significance tests are less well-defined mathematically than Neyman's hypothesis tests, but they are nonetheless objective. Neyman may have criticised Fisher for subjectivism bordering on Bayesianism (Gigerenzer et al. 1989, quoted by Louca ISSN No 0874-4548), and Fisher wouldn't have liked it.] in that the probability statement on which it is based [i.e. the probability of having observed data as extreme or more extreme under the null hypothesis] is a fact communicable to, and verifiable by, other rational minds [i.e. to everyone except Neyman, whose misunderstanding or misapplication of significance test principles is criticised by Fisher in his preceding paragraph.]. The level of significance in such cases [the P-value] fulfils the conditions of a measure of the rational grounds for the disbelief it engenders [which is to say, evidence]. It is more primitive, or elemental than, and does not justify, any exact probability statement about the proposition [and hence can be an index, but not a measure of probability.]."
