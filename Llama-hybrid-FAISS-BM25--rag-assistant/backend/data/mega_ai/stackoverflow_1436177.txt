ip command does not seem to be available on the phone, and the device does not use BusyBox (it does use toolbox for commands such as cat , chmod , etc though). Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you may consider using route , netcfg or ifconfig . This answer applies to the official Cupcake branch of Android OS and Google Android Dev Phone 1. If you are running some custom distribution, then regular Linux ip command from BusyBox may apply.
