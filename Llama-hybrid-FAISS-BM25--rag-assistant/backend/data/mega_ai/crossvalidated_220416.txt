Working with percentages of positive variables

Say we run an experiment and observe the following impact on a variable of interest (one row per experimental unit): Observed benefit (%) 1 20% 2 60% 3 180% 4 -10% ... 100 214% where Observed benefit is simply measured as: 100 * (After - Before)/Before (i.e. before and after running our test). Now, say someone asks us if we should embrace the proposed feature based on the results of the experiment. One way to answer this question is to measure the "expected benefit", i.e. $E(\%)$ , we will see using the data we collected, and embrace the feature if it's greater than 0. I see a potentially dangerous "positive bias" in using a decision rule based on this estimate to decide whether or not to embrace this feature. Positive variables can never become lower than 0, so the possible smallest drop the variable can experience is -100% . However, positive variables can definitely experience changes much greater than 100% . Can this bias us to accept changes? Or is my fear unfounded ? Examples in finance: Say we want to test a new trading algorithm that buys and sells securities. We take a sample of securities, buy them and sell them using the new algorithm, and observe a distribution of returns on these securities. On all securities, you can at most lose all the money you invested, i.e. see a return of -1X , but you could see much higher returns (e.g. 2X and beyond ). Given the above, it seems likely that the sample mean estimator (for $E[\text{%}]$ ), which is not biased per se, will be greater than 0% and potentially bias us to adopt the feature we are testing if we are just trying to maximize expected returns , which is a reasonable goal. But the above seems problematic to me. One should not always expect positive returns regardless of the feature/strategy we are testing... So what's wrong with this thinking? Examples in advertising One is often interested in CPA (cost per "action") or CPC (cost per click). The denominator in both quantities can be relatively small (few actions and few clicks for many dollars spent). So it's common that these quantities reach very high values and thus % can be highly variable. With this in mind: Am I incorrectly assuming that one may overestimate $E(\%)$ in this problem using sample averages? Given that percentages can reach very high values very easily, should one take "additional" cautionary measures when estimating the significance of a positive result? That is, how do we protect ourselves from overestimating % ? Is the "usual playbook" of methods to avoid overestimating significance enough here, or should one proceed with even additional care?
