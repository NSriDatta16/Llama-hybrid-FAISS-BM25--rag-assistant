Setting UserAgent for HttpWebRequest in Silverlight 4

I'm using Silverlight 4 and need to set (override) the UserAgent for a HttpWebRequest . Unfortunately this is not supported. The platform notes in MSDN state: "Do not use this member when targeting Silverlight 4." And if I try, I get a System.NotImplementedException with this StackTrace: at System.Net.Browser.ClientHttpWebRequest.SetUserAgent(String value) at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.set_UserAgent(String value) I've tried altering the Headers collection directly but that returns the same error. Is there any way to do this? Bonus question: anyone know why this is not supported?
