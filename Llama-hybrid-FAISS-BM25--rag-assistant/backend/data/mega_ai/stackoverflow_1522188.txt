Organizing Classes in PHP

Suppose I've the following classes in my project: class Is // validation class class Math // number manipulation class Now, if I want to validate a given number for primality where would be the logical place to insert my Prime() method? I can think of the following options: Is_Math ::Prime() Math_Is ::Prime() I hate these ambiguities, the slow down my thinking process and often induce me in errors. Some more examples: Is::Image() or Image::Is() ? Is_Image::PNG() or Image_Is::PNG() ? Is_i18n_US::ZipCode() or i18n_Is_US::ZipCode() or i18n_US_Is::ZipCode() ? In the Image example the first choice makes more sense to me while in the i18n example I prefer the last one. Not having a standard makes me feel like the whole code base is messy. Is there a holy grail solution for organizing classes? Maybe a different paradigm?
