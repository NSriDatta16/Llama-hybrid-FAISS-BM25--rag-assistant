What HTML5 canvas-based controls library should I use right now?

Google shows that there are already few generic HTML5 canvas-based libraries available. But no high-quality editing/charting controls that I used to see from "big" control developers like Infragistics, Rad, etc. Any recommendations on what should I look at?
