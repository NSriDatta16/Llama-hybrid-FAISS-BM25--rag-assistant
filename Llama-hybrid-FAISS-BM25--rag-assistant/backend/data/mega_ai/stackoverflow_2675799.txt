Using Silverlight in Views in ASP.Net MVC - a bad idea?

I'm currently writing a small application for use internally at my office. I started out teaching myself some MVC (I've been a C# dev for 3 years). One of the main requirements is editable grids - I quickly realised that silverlight (i have zero silverlight experience) could be a big help in this. I've managed to create a proof of concept of getting MVC and silverlight to talk back an forth by combining these two techniques: Creating a Rest API using MVC MVC SilverLight I also got some help on stackoverflow: silverlight-grids-mvc-http-post Essentially all I'm doing is embedding a silver light object in a view. Serializing the Model data as JSON and passing it to silverlight(using intit params written into the response). The silverlight object can post data back to the controller as JSON. So far this seems like it could work quite well. However I am a bit concerned that I could be painting myself into a corner with this approach, as in I don't have much experience with either technology so I'm worried I'm going get hit with something further down the line that I won't be able to work around. Has anybody else tried doing this? Any advice would be much appreciated!
