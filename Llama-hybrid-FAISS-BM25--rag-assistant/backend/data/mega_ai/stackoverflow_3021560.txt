Do not properly deleted pointers fragment memory?

That's basically the question. If I have a pointer int *a = &someIntVar and I do not delete it over the course of the program, does it stay in memory after the program has terminated? Is this a case of data fragmentation? EDIT: My mistake for using a bad example. So int *a = new int[100]; never gets deleted, and even if it gets deleted, an answer says that the pointee is deleted, not the pointer. Yet pointers also have a length. So the question is, on a Windows or Linux OS, does it automatically clean up after pointers? (Assume C++)
