Using random projections to reduce the dimensionality of the data may prove useful to reduce the the space required to store the features, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_projection . It scales very well and every example can be projected to a lower dimensional space independently and without any direct optimization methods such as PCA, SVD, Sammon Maps, NMF, etc.
