@Tash, although this is a common practice in psychology, this is indeed the kind of fishing you should be concerned about! Here's a reference on precisely this topic: Simmons, J. P., Nelson, L. D., & Simonsohn, U. (2011). False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant. Psychological Science, 22(11), 1359â€“1366. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611417632 If, as you say, Everything in my MANCOVA is significant Then this suggests you might have a very high-powered study, and you can avoid the problem by shifting your attention to the effect sizes instead of the p-values. Another potential solution is to split your data into a training and testing sample, build the regression models on the training data, and then evaluate their performance on the testing data. Select the best model based on $R^2$ in the testing data.
