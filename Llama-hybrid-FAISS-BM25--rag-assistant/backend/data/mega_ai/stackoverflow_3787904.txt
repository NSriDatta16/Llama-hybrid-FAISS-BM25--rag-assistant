Per @JaredPar elsewhere on this site : The underyling string you create will also need a contiguous block of memory because it is represented as an array of chars (arrays require contiguous memory) . I am sure you should not rely on this as it's not part of the interface , but implementation is an array if this statement is correct. That makes sense to me given what we know about char-strings and Microsoft's need to support efficient interop between managed and native languages. MSDN says only this, which does not guarantee that the storage is an array. A string is a sequential collection of Unicode characters that is used to represent text. A String object is a sequential collection of System.Char objects that represent a string. The value of the String object is the content of the sequential collection, and that value is immutable (that is, it is read-only).
