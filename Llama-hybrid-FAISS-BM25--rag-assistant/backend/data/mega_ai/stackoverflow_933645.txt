Multi-column CSS lists

Is there a way to do re-flowable, multi-column lists, where the list can have list items of varying heights, using only valid CSS? By re-flowable, I mean that as the user drags the window wider or narrower, the number of columns should automatically adjust when the list items are of fixed width. I've seen the article on A List Apart , but none of their solutions fit all of those (seemingly simple) requirements. At first glance, I think the CCS3 proposal for multi-column lists does not either (because it appears you have to specify the number of columns). If it helps, I am not at all concerned about IE6 and only kind of concerned about IE7. My target audience is early-adopter, web-savvy types. Update: Looking more closely at the CSS3 spec, specifying a column width should do it, but in reality, I'm running into weirdness with overflows and such. Anyone using this stuff IRL?
