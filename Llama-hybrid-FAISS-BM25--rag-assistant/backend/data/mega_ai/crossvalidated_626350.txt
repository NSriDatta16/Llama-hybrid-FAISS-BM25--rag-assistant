Coefficients interpretation of survregbayes

I used the function survregbayes from the package spBayesSurv in R to perform a spatial accelerated failure time model with CAR frailties. The event I analyze is the digitalization of cities. The problem is that I don't understand how to interpret the coefficients of the model. In particular, I get: Accelerated failure time model: Call: survregbayes(formula = Surv(t0, t2, treat_v) ~ total_pop_ln + perc_over65 + Avg_income_ln + software_ln + perc_graduate_employees + frailtyprior("car", PRO_COM), data = df8_forsurv_non_2, survmodel = "AFT", dist = "loglogistic", mcmc = mcmc, prior = prior, Proximity = queen.mat, InitParamMCMC = T) Posterior inference of regression coefficients (Adaptive M-H acceptance rate: 0.1767): Mean Median Std. Dev. 95%CI-Low 95%CI-Upp total_pop_ln 0.0551136101 0.0550254170 0.0021825035 0.0509362581 0.0595294889 perc_over65 -0.0040149026 -0.0040398522 0.0005232949 -0.0049687370 -0.0028849028 Avg_income_ln -0.0339629467 -0.0339211752 0.0164280091 -0.0630650276 -0.0034046992 software_ln 0.0038724879 0.0038917297 0.0002729899 0.0033178749 0.0044044441 perc_graduate_employees -0.0001839882 -0.0001824825 0.0001066416 -0.0003971492 0.0000258413 Posterior inference of conditional CAR frailty variance Mean Median Std.

For the variable software, the coefficient has a positive sign and it is statistically significant, so does it mean that higher expenses in software make the city experience the event sooner or later?
