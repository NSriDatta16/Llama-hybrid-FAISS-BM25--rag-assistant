No you can't do something like .composite { .something; .else } This are no "class" names in the OO sense. .something and .else are just selectors nothing more. But you can either specify two classes on an element ... or you might look into another form of inheritance .foo { background-color: white; color: black; } .bar { background-color: inherit; color: inherit; font-weight: normal; } Hello, world Where the paragraphs backgroundcolor and color are inherited from the settings in the enclosing div which is .foo styled. You might have to check the exact W3C specification. inherit is default for most properties anyway but not for all.
