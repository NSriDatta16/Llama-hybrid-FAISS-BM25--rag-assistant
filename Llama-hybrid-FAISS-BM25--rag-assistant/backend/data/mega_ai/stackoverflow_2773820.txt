Program not running from expected directory?

I am working on a web-based program, using Java. I am not sure exactly how to phrase this, but I expect the program to be running from within the c:/Resin/webapps/apps directory. However, when I reference a file in the program like this: "../files/randomfile.pdf", it cannot find that file. It works when I reference it like this: "c:/Resin/webapps/files/randomfile.pdf". How to I change the "running location"? (And what is the technical term for this?) try { Document iTextDoc = new Document(PageSize.LETTER, 27, 27, 35, 18); HttpServletResponse res = (HttpServletResponse) pageContext.getResponse(); res.setContentType("application/vnd.ms-word"); res.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" + fileName + ".rtf;"); RtfWriter2 rtfWriter = RtfWriter2.getInstance(iTextDoc, res.getOutputStream()); iTextDoc.open(); iTextDoc.add(new Paragraph ("Testing RTF Letterhead with Logo")); // Use full classname to avoid ambiguity with java.awt.Image com.lowagie.text.Image logoImg = com.lowagie.text.Image.getInstance("../files/someimage.jpg"); logoImg.setAlignment(Image.RIGHT | Image.TEXTWRAP); iTextDoc.add(logoImg); iTextDoc.add(new Paragraph ("Put other information about organization beneath logo")); iTextDoc.close(); } I get the following error with the resulting file: Adobe Reader could not open 'someFile.pdf' because it is either not a supported file type or because the file has been damaged (for example, it was sent as an email attachment and wasn't correctly decoded). However, if I change the getInstance command to this: com.lowagie.text.Image logoImg = com.lowagie.text.Image.getInstance("webapps/files/someimage.jpg"); it works. So my guess is that the working directory (thanks for the term) needs to be set somewhere. I am using Resin -- any idea where I should be setting this? Thanks!
