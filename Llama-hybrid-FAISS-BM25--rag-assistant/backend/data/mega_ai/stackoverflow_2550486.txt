There's been a lot going on with languages that run on the Java Virtual Machine, leverage the Java libraries, and interoperate with Java, but that are more expressive. Take a look at JRuby (which runs Rails), Groovy (and the Rails-like Grails ), Clojure , Jython (a Python implementation), and even Javascript (see the Rhino interpreter, written in Java). Particularly interesting is Scala , very elegant fusion of object-oriented programming and functional programming. Scala's nearly as fast as Java, has the best interoperability with Java, and is very expressive. Scala programs can be much shorter than Java programs. The Lift Framework is comparable to Rails in the Scala world.
