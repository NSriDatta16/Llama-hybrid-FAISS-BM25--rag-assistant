Approach to be used when the independent variables are categorical

I have a dataset of 45k datapoints. The dependent variable is Continuous (Time to resolve certain ticket) and most of the independent variables are categorical in nature. I tried to apply multiple linear regression and Random forest. The accuracy with both the models seems to be pretty bad (around 6%). Can I get help from this forum how to approach to this kind of problems to get a better performing model?
