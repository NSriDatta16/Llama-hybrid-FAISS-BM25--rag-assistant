What type of classification algorithm for recognizing events in a set of data?

I would like to know what type of machine learning to use for recognizing events in a set of data. (or at least be pointed in the right direction so I can do my own research on the topic.) I'm trying to identify M&M color using an RGB sensor. Here is an example of some data I collected. I want to train a neural network by saying "this is what it looks like when a blue M&M passes by the sensor... And a yellow..." So it then can tell me when and what color M&M has passed by. My type of problem is similar to this . In this case, they record accelerometer data and use it to identify the exercise someone was doing. How can you teach an ANN to do this? And how do you teach it what an "event" looks like? ** P.S. I'm new to this forum so any modifications to my question to make it more relevant and understandable are welcome.
