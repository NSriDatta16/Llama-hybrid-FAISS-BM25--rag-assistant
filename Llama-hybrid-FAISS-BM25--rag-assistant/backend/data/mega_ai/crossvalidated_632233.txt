Which method or technique should I use to account for the binary response variable? For a binary response you can use logistic regression. In SAS that would be PROC LOGISTIC . You can also use PROC GLM with a binomial family and logit link, however PROC LOGISTIC is (obviously) designed for fitting logistic models and has extensive options for modelling, binary, and nominal response data, including various link functions, model selection methods, and diagnostic statistics (such as ROC analysis). When testing the main effect for Factor B, I do not want to test the difference in purchase rates in Table 1 (which is what is computed by default in SAS). Rather, Iâ€™m interested in comparing the differences in purchase uplifts between the groups, i.e. the numbers in table 2 highlighted in green. If I understand correctly there are several approaches for proportional/fractional outcomes: Tobit (with PROC QLIM or NLMIXED ), NLS (nonlinear least squares, with PROC NLMIXED ), fractional logit ( PROC NLMIXED or GLIMMIX , beta (PROC GLIMMIX or NLMIXED , and simplex ( PROC NLMIXED ). If you have negative uplifts, or uplifts greater than 100% this may limit your options.
