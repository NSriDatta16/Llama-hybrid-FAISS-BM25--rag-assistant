Logistic regression model that has one categorical variable with multiple values

I have the following data: Rank Platforms Technology high Windows||Linux Unity high Linux low Windows Unreal low Linux||MacOs GameMakerStudio||Unity||Unreal low GameMakerStudio Both Platforms and Technology are categorical variables and each row can have one, or multiple, or Empty value. How do I go about building a logistic regression model that predict the Rank as high or low in R? I am thinking to separate the variable into multiple Boolean variables: like is_windows = [true, false] , is_mac = [true, false] ,etc... However, for Technology , there are about 21 unique values.
