Is there some .NET machine learning library that could, for example, suggest tags for a question?

Just to use it as an example, StackOverflow users already associated tags to questions for a lot of questions. Is there a .NET machine learning library that could use this historic data to 'learn' how to associate tags to newly created questions and suggest them to the user?
