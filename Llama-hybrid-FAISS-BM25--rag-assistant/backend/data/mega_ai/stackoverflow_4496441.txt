How to list network interfaces, its configuration IP,netmask and gateway in Python/Windows

I wanna develop a small application to monitor arp and scan arp list in local network. Currently, I need to retrieve the list of network interfaces and its configuration. Most of the time I work with Linux, so I don't know much about Win32 API, is there anyway to do this in python way ? I'm using Python 2.6 with PyQt and Scapy (has pywin32 aswell, so if you provide the detail way with win32, I will try) I found pcapy.findalldevs(), but it cannot retrive configuration. I don't care much about the name, just configuration(IP,netmask) is OK.
