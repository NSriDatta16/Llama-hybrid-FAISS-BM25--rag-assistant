How can causal inference be used with machine learning?

I am wondering how Causal inference is being used with machine learning and specially where in the data science project ? I have been searching for an answer and I've came to the conclusion that Causal inference can be used after the modeling phase in order to confirm some correlations between variables and the target/outcome. For example if the model has a good accuracy and gives you a high correlation/association between input A and the target B you may want to perform a causal inference to validate that A has an effect on B . I would like to know if my understanding is correct and also know if there is other application of Causal inference with Machine learning.
