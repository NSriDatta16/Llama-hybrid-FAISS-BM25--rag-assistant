th smart pillboxes, RFID tags, ingestible sensors, and video check-ins. Smart pillboxes use sensors to record when they are opened. These tools can be used to get real-time data on the patient's health. Adoption challenges and solutions Barriers to AI adoption Despite AI being a potential problem solver in the field of pharmacy, there are barriers to overcome before it goes fully mainstream. More research is needed in different pharmaceutical practices to ensure that they are beneficial to patients. There is a lack of training and knowledge among pharmacists. The research facilities do not have a proper AI infrastructure to support innovation and to build the right facilities for AI adoption, which needs a lot of financial investment. If an AI model is trained on a biased dataset, it can give misleading results which could harm patients. Ethical and regulatory challenges AI adoption also raises a lot of ethical and privacy questions, like security, potential bias, and data privacy. Data breaches could expose sensitive information, and a model trained on a biased dataset could suggest unsuitable (and potentially fatal) treatment plans. Solutions for AI adoption AI-based education and training programs could be started to tackle the problem of lack of training and knowledge of AI. The government could assign more funds to healthcare to encourage more research in the field. Patient data could be encrypted and protected safely, with accountability. To prevent the use of biased datasets, regulatory guidelines or policies could be established. Transparency could be improved so that people using the models know the population on which the data was based and how it was trained. Future directions Experts say that for the future of AI in pharmacy, it should focus on better combination with electronic health records and other technologies to reduce the healthcare costs. There could be a common AI framework to encourage international collaboration to speed up the research and contributions of everyone in the field. == References ==
