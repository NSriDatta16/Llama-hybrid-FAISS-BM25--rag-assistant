If the second variable is a binary variable indicating whether the participant got dizzy or not, you need to consider other factors beyond the raw head rotation data to accurately predict whether the participant experienced dizziness. One factor that can contribute to dizziness is the movement of fluid in the inner ear. To capture this, you can compute the velocity and acceleration of head movements along the X, Y, and Z axes, and analyze the frequency components of these signals. Specifically, you can look for sudden changes in acceleration or velocity, and check if they occur at frequencies that are known to be associated with inner ear disturbances. Another factor that can contribute to dizziness is the orientation of the head relative to gravity (I donÂ´t know if relative the the space station floor or Earth). To capture this, you can compute the orientation of the head in space, and look for changes in orientation that could result in a mismatch between the visual and vestibular systems. In addition to these factors, you should also consider other potential contributors to dizziness, such as changes in blood pressure or heart rate, and use them to inform the features you extract and the model you build. IF It is that what you are after... it seems to be a complex problem. It requires feature selection and to do the feature engineering you need a deep understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms.
