Best way to access a UNC path in C#

We are building an application that will be storing a lot of images. We have a virtualized environment at GoGrid.com and we were hoping to utilize their cloud storage. Not sure exactly how to word this, but if we (in our code) specify the unc path and creds to place or retrieve an image, that seems terribly inefficient (connect, get image, disconnect) If we have a large volume of images or many users performing this at once, it seems like it would bring any normal server to it's knees. So my question is, short of having huge drives that your website is running on, how should we aim to accomplish this? Again, we are opting for the GoGrid cloud starge versus Amazon S3 since everything is under one nice umbrella. The cloud storage is accessible via a UNC path and a specific username/password. Thanks!
