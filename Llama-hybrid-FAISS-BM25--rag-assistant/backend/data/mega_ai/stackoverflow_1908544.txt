Generate a blank table on form check in Word 2003

In Word 2003, I am trying to create a form that can generate additional entries if the person filling out the forms requires them and clicks a checkbox stating (for additional tables click here). I have tried a form field that runs a macro on entry but that does not seem to be working. Is there a more elegant way to make a form that can add a table in Word as the user requires? Essentially something like this (as an unrelated though functionally accurate example): http://pixiurl.com//image/5o2r751t%5FExample.png (Sorry I can't post images) When the "Click here" is clicked is generates another exactly the same. Also I need to make sure the fields on the new table remain blank even if they were filled in on the original so I can't use a copy and paste method. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
