My suggested method of meeting your specifications is shown in R code below. Are your specifications consistent with three points chosen at random without restriction on $(0,1)?$ set.seed(601) b = runif(1); b [1] 0.5592886 g = runif(1, b, 1); g [1] 0.8007153 r = runif(1, b, g); r [1] 0.7927287 plot(b, 0, col="blue", xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(-.1,.1), ylab="") points(g, 0, col="darkgreen") points(r, 0, col="red") I think the answer to my question is No. Three unrestricted points according to $\mathsf{Unif}(0,1)$ will have average range $E(\mathrm{Max - Min}) =1/2.$ Three points placed according to your restrictions, if I understand the restrictions correctly, will have average range $E(G - B) = 1/4.$ Here is a simulation. Formal proofs should not be difficult. set.seed(2020) rng.u = replicate(10^6, diff(range(runif(3)))) mean(rng.u) [1] 0.4997172 m = 10^6; rng.bgr = numeric(m) for(i in 1:m){ b = runif(1); g = runif(1, b, 1) rng.bgr[i] = g-b } mean(rng.bgr) [1] 0.2500847
