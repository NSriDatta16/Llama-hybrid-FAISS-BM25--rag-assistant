In the Tensorflow example for CNN a distorted_inputs function is implemented. Besides flipping the images randomly, it's also randomly distorting Image brightness Image contrast So, the intensity of the images is changed intentionally. They do it to increase the number of training images artificially. Because of that knowledge I wouldn't suggest making the input similar. Moreover, I think the variability within the input dataset is essential for making the generalization, which is needed for classifications of that example. Due to low reputation I am not able to post this information as a comment. Please be gently.
