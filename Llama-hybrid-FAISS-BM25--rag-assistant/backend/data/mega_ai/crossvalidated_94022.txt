According with the R manual the cor function, with default parameter values computes Pearson correlation. A detailed description of Pearson correlation you can find on the dedidated Wikipedia page . What is important to note here is that Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of linear correlation. So a value close to $1$ or $-1$ shows only that there is a linear dependence between the actual values of $y$ and your prediction $\hat{y}$. It is a known fact that RF has some bias on regression. That mostly happens due to averaging on leaves, but I think it is a longer discussion. However the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient might give you some hints on how the prediction bias looks like (you need also a graphical inspection of your residuals, at least), but it is certainly not a measure for accuracy.
