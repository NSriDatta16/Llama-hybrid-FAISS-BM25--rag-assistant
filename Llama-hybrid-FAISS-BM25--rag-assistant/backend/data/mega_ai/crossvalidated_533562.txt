How to adjust constant/drift to ARIMA forecasting model and how to scale down the cycle up/down size?

I ran ARIMA model on a dataset to forecast the next 180 days sales after training period. My data is daily sales data and is provided here sales data . It has 1267 periods. For the period 729~808, there are errors in the original data so I replaced them from forecasted values based on period 1~728. The data is stationary after one order of differencing. The periodgraph suggests that the data appears to have 3.5 and 7 days seasonality. With fourier regressors added to auto.arima function, I am able to include seasonality to fit the cycle of sales change. However, the forecasted data appear to match the test data poorly due to two problems: the model forecasting results on average seem to be lower than the real test data, which suggests that a constant can be added to the model to improve the accuracy. I have set allowdrift=TRUE, allowmean = TRUE in the auto.arima() function. But the results show it is not ideal. How do I adjust the value of constant that auto.arima add to the model in R? Is there other ways to add constant beyond allowdrift and allowmean ? the model forecasted the right up and down cycle, which suggests the seasonalities are added correctly. But the cycle has a much larger range than the test data. I think scaling down the cycle might help to improve forecasting accuracy but I am not clear how to adjust the range of forecasting cycle? Below are my codes and output: #create time series p y0 % msts(seasonal.periods = c(3.5,7)) # two seasonals train test #ARIMA model testing fit fit_f autoplot(fit_f)+autolayer(test) #check accuracy measures fit_f_v MdAPE_ARIMA MdAPE_ARIMA accuracy(fit_f, test) If anyone can help to address my questions, it would be greatly appreciated!
