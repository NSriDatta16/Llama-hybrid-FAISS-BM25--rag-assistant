FluentNHibernate mapping settings - file storage in SQL Server database

I've read various things but I didn't see something specific, so I'm reposting. Sorry if I missed one and duplicate posted. I am storing files in a database; previously, with ADO.NET Entity Framework, I would use image type and it streams it as byte[] array. Is that the approach to do it in NHibernate with FluentNHibernate mappings? I setup the column as image. I defined this as the mapping for the property (which the C# property is a byte[] array): Map(i => i.FileContents).CustomSqlType("image"); Is that the correct way to set this up? I am getting an error and am not sure if its related to this? Thanks.
