Bayesian approach for comparing the predictability of different datasets for another

Suppose I have three datasets A, B and C with not necessarily the same amount of data. Now, I want to know whether dataset A or dataset B is better in predicting C. I want to use a Bayesian approach here. To give more details about what I mean with datasets. Let us assume the following three datasets (variables). A B C ---------- 2 0.6 10 1 0.7 5 10 0.2 50 3 0.3 1 Let us assume that C refers to the amount of burgers kids in a school eat over the period of a year. Now, we want to know whether (A) the number of siblings of the kids or (B) the social class of the family rated from 0 (poor) to 1 (rich) can better predict C. I have some ideas which I quickly want to elaborate next. However, the main goal of this post is to get ideas of how I would tackle the task of determining whether A or B are better in predicting C within the Bayesian framework. My current idea is to build two models (with different priors) and calculate the Bayes factor with data C to check their relative plausibility. The priors should resemble data A and B. Thus, the priors could be posteriors from A and B with some kind-of flat proto prior. In simple terms, we observe data A and B, determine posteriors for both of them, and use them as priors for C. Now, we want to compare them by using Bayes factors. Another, more simple idea of mine is to just calculate correlation between A or B and C in a Bayesian way. Or, we could also focus on regression or similar methods.
