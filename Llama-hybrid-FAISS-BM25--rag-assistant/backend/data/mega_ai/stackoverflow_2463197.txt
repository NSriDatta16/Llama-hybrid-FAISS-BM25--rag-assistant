If you have customers, then customer service is key to your business objectives. Service starts when application development starts -- by spending more time planning and designing a truly great (beyond "stylish!") user interface and experience, you serve your customers better from the beginning. That investment, far from being draining on financial resources, will make your offerings more stable and are easier to support, resulting in lower costs, a happier and more productive workforce (people like taking pride in the software they create -- can you take pride in a soulless, battleship gray "enterprise" app?), and better customer loyalty. The question isn't "what 'standard' amount of time must we spend on style," but "can we afford not to give the user's experience our full attention." If you aren't creating really great business apps, you're leaving money on the table for any competitor who is.
