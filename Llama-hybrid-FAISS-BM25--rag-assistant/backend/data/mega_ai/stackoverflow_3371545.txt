Visual Studio 2008 locks custom MSBuild Task assemblies

I'm developing a custom MSBuild task that builds an ORM layer , and using it in a project. I'm being hampered by Visual Studio's behaviour of holding onto MSBuild task DLLs and not letting go. I'd like to organize my solution like this; My Solution | +- (1) ORM Layer Custom Task Project | | | +- BuildOrmLayerTask.cs // here's my task | +- (2) Business Logic Project // and here's the project that uses it. | +- However, when project (2) builds, it locks onto the assembly from project (1). So now I can't build project (1) again without closing the solution and re-opening it. Is there any way I can organize things so that the custom build task is not kept locked by Visual Studio?
