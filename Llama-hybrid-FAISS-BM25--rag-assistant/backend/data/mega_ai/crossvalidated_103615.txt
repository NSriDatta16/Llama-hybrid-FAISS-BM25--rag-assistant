Logistic regression does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the independent variables (neither does OLS regression, but that's another post). However, if there are a lot of variables and a lot of zero inflation, then I think the potential for complete or quasi-complete separation increases. Another problem may be accuracy of estimates; as far as I know, the computed standard errors etc. will be correct, but I think they could well be large. More details (the number of IVs; the sample size; the nature of the variables, the degree of correlation among the IVs) will help you get more detailed answers. Actually running the regression and posting results would also help.
