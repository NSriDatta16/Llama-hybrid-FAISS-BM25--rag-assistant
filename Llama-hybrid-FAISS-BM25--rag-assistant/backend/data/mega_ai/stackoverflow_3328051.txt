It doesn't matter where the user input is coming from, it matters how its used. The one attack that affects IRC is CRLF injection . This will come up for you if you echo back user input over IRC. An attacker could try and inject a carrage return (\r) line feed (\n). This type of injection affects many protocols including HTTP and SMTP . In the case of IRC the attacker would be able to force your bot to send a command to the IRCD (like /join or /kick or /ban :). Make sure to look at an ASCII table and filter out all 0x0A (\n) and 0x0D (\r). In most cases the new line is enough, so make sure you filter for both. Make sure you read over OWASP A1: Injection . Especially if you are using user input in a sql query or invoking a process on the commandline.
