Implementing Neural Network for time series

I am currently working on neural networks for time series forecasting. My doubt is: do we need to take into account issues like trend, non-stationarity and seasonality while using neural networks instead of the box jenkins methodology? If yes, how do we do that? For instance, do we need to change the cost function or other parameters? I am currently using nnet and neuralnet packages in R but I do not find anything about these issues in the related documentation. If not, then does it imply that the model learns the seasonality from data itself? For instance, suppose there is a time series with an upward trend, along with some variations. Could I assume that if we fit a neural network on such series then it might learn just an interpolation?
