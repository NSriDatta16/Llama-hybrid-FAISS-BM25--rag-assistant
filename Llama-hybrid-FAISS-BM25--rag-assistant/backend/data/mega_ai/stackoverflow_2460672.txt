Verify that you don't have any images on the report with external links. If you do, it's possible that your images could be taking a long time to be server by the image host. I had a very similar situation where the reporting server lost outbound internet access and so the report server was not able retrieve the external image during processing. Unfortunately, SRRS did not just check, get an http error, and return, it waited, and waited. I supsect (but have not verified) that it tried to retrieve the image for each page of the report. I say this because of a correlation between report length and discrepency between old execution times and execution times when the problem existed. It seemed like a 5 to 12 second delay on each page of the report. If you want more details about how I fixed my issue see my post: SQL Server Reporting Services - Fast TimeDataRetrieval - Long TimeProcessing Kind Regards, Bernie
