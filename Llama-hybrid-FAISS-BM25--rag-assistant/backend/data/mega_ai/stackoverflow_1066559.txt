You could try something like: #recent a + #friends a:hover { background-image: url('recent-normal-neighbor-hover.png') no-repeat; } #friends a:hover { background-image: url('friends-hover-neighbor-normal.png') no-repeat; } Not sure if that even makes sense, and it isn't very elegant, because you'd have to make a regular image for all three tabs, a regular image for all three tabs with the clipped portion of the neighboring tab having a hover state, and a hover image for all three tabs. Then you'd need to have like 6 CSS selectors.
