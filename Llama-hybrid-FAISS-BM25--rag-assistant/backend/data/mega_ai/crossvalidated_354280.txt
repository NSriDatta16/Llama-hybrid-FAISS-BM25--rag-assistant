Why is the mean of a standard normal distribution zero?

Supposedly I have a set of values, normally distributed, if i find their arithmetic mean (which i am supposing is the mean in context for a normal distribution) there must be a value that will be an average of all the values throughout the distribution. Then why is the mean of SND = 0?
