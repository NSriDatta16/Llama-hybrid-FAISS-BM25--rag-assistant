When you define your array, you are allocating storage for exactly 120 pieces: hexagon hexpieces[120]; But in your loop, you iterate over indices 0 through 120, which is actually 121 locations: for(int i = 0; i Either allocate 121 hexpieces in the originaly array, or use i in the loop to avoid the error.
