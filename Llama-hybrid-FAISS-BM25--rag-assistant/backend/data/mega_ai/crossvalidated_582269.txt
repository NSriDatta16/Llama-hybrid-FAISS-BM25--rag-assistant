In Multivariate time series Each variable depends not only on its past values but also has some dependency on other variables. This dependency is used for forecasting future values, So if A, B, C ,... have a relation with each others so you have to use Multivariate time series. To check if they have a relation or not you can plot the heatmap and see the correlation between the features. Ex: if you live in country that use a currency depend on dolar when you want to predict the price of any thing you have to add dolar values because every thing depend on dolar. Date Egg-Price-currency Dolar-price 01-06 500 10 01-07 600 12 01-09 ??? 9 If you want to predict the egg price in 01-08 without using Dolar-price this will be wrong (the pattern is always up without dollar price but dolar price went down so the price will go down) I hope i explained this clearly.
