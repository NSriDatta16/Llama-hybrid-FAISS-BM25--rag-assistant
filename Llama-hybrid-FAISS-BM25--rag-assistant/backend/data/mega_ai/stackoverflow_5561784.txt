Implode all the properties of a given name in an array of object - PHP

Is there a way to implode the values of similar objects contained in an array? I have an array of objects: $this->inObjs and I'd like a comma separated string of each of their messageID properties: $this->inObjs[$i]->messageID Is there an elegant way to do this or am I going to have to MacGyver a solution with get_object_vars or foreachs or something similar? Thanks for the help.
