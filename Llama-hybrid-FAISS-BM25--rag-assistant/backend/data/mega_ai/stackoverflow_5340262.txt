If you change the version of the Framework the description changes: With 4.0 A decimal number is a floating-point value that consists of a sign, a numeric value where each digit in the value ranges from 0 to 9, and a scaling factor that indicates the position of a floating decimal point that separates the integral and fractional parts of the numeric value. I'll say it's sloppy editing of the 1.1 version. And even in 1.1 in the next paragraph it's written: The binary representation of an instance of Decimal consists of a 1-bit sign, a 96-bit integer number, and a scaling factor used to divide the 96-bit integer and specify what portion of it is a decimal fraction. The scaling factor is implicitly the number 10, raised to an exponent ranging from 0 to 28.
