The ODBC specification only allows two encodings: ASCII and UCS-2. It is the job of the ODBC driver to convert whatever the database is in to one of those two, but I find most ODBC driver authors don't understand how it is supposed to work. When a query is executed, pyodbc does not ask for any encoding. It executes the query and then asks the driver for the data type of each column. If the data type is Unicode, it will read the buffer and treat it as UCS2. If the data type is ASCII, it will read the buffer and treat it as ASCII. The storage format is supposed to be irrelevant.
