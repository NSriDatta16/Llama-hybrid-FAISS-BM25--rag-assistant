I would not interpolate the data before estimating the model on this data, as @Remi noted. It's a bad idea. An extreme example: imagine you have two data points Jan 2013 and Jan 2014. Now interpolate 10 monthly points in between: Feb through Dec 2013, and run regression on the monthly date. In reality it's not going to be this bad, but it's the same idea: you'll be inflating your statistics at best. The way to go is to use time series methods which handle missing data. For instance, state space methods. Take a look at astsa R package. It comes with an excellent book on time series analysis. This will handle missing data nicely. Matlab now has a similar functionality in ssm package. You have to learn converting your models into state space form, but you have to learn this anyways if you want to step away from auto.arima "magic".
