Predict how many days late or early someone will finish their work

So I have a set of deadlines and people, with a database of when those people finished their previous work and how much after the deadline it was, as well as when the work was given. The work itself were articles, so I also have the word count for each. How do you, based on the previous data, calculate the amount of days earlier or later somebody will most probably finish their work? As a concrete example of the problem I'm trying to solve: John finished his last 5 projects 5,4,3,6,2 days late. What is the most probable amount of days earlier or late he will finish his work? Basically I'm looking for an appropriate machine learning algortihm to implement to calculate this probable end date.
