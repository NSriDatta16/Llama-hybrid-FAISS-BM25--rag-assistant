I don't think it's actually possible to do exactly what you describe, since the .NET Framework is just going to delegate the drawing of your Form's border and title bar to Windows itself, which doesn't have any option for what you describe AFAIK. Instead, what I would do is use FormBorderStyle.None and then draw any window decorations (title bar, borders) you want manually. A Google search for "borderless form C#" turns up these sites as the top three hits: BorderLess Window (java2s.com) Transparent borderless forms in C# (c-sharpcorner.com) Draggable Form: Drag a Borderless Form by Clicking Anywhere on the Form (codeproject.com)
