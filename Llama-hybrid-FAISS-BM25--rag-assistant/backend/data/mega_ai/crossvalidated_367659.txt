In more abstract, model independent terms, you're trying to show that $P(L|C,G)=P(L|G)$ (if you know the gender, then knowing the country doesn't give you any extra information) You can train a classifier (could be logistic regression, but could also try random forest, xgboost, neural network, etc) which knows only about Gender, and another one which knows about Country and Gender. You can then, under cross-validation see whether the latter model outperforms the former. If your hunch is correct, you should find that they outperform each other about equally frequently. The main downfall of this method, is if $P(L|C,G)\simeq P(L|G)$, i.e. knowing country gives you a small amount of extra information over knowing only gender. Then you might find, that the model which includes both outperforms the model which includes gender only, 80% of the time. Or it might outperform it every time, but with tiny differences in cross-entropy. Then it can be quite difficult to determine whether it's "worth" including country or whether its contribution is so marginal that it's not worth it.
