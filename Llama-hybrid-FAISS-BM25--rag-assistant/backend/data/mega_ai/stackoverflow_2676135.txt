Catching uncaught exceptions

In my workplace we are mantaining a lot of ecommerce websites, some coded better than others. On some of those, sometimes uncaught exceptions are thrown, and showed by the alertbox from the flash player debug (If you have it installed). To rise the average user experience I'd like to report all those exceptions throught a in house tool we already have. Is there a way to catch those exceptions? Maybe the flash player debug exposes them to javascript, or in some other way.
