Possible ways to convert predicted scores from PCA analysis?

I have my predicted scores from PCA analysis, and my predicted scores have both negative and positive numbers. For instance, minimum value is - 4 and maximum value is 4. I plan to use the predicted score as an index for my research. I am wondering whether I should transform my predicted scores to 1- 10 scores or 0 - 1 and such to make the index looks nicer. In addition, why do both negative and positive numbers involved in predicted scores I got from PCA? Please share me readings related to rescaling or converted predicted scores from PCA if they exist. Thanks in advance
