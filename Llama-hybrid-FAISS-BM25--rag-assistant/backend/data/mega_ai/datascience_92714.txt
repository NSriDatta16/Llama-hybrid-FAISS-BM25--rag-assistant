Can I cluster an aggregated data-set (grouped by) and apply dimensionality reduction?

I have data of sales, however it is in the millions, about 500M rows. I aggregate this data by factors such as location, shoptype, country_of_shop, cardtype, and then the aggregated statistic is: number of transactions sum of amount in dollars My questions is can i cluster this say using kprototypes or something similar? And can i reduce the dimensionality using Factor analysis?
