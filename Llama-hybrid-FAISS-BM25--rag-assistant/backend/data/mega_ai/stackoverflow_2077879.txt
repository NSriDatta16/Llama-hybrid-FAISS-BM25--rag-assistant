On the client side, I recommend you to have a look at OpenLayers , a free and open source web mapping framework released under a BSD-style License. It is completely written in Javascript and offers a lot of functionality, including the features that your application may need (Add markers to the map, drag them to adjust the locations, ...). It also supports dozens of different geographic data formats and services such as WMS , KML or Google Maps. If you are worried about licensing issues regarding the use of Google Maps, you can use other global data sources like OpenStreetMap or a public WMS if they provide enough coverage of your area of interest. On the server side, I agree with the answer provided by Daniel Vassallo . I will just add a little detail and recommend you to serve the markers in a standard format natively supported by OpenLayers like KML, GeoJSON or GeoRSS . It will make really easy to draw the markers on the map. Looks like a really interesting project, I hope you are lucky starting it up.
