The answer to this is yes. I tested it by doing a simple hello world servlet. It averaged about 2 seconds to load. Then I added a bunch of libraries that I didn't even use. Then it averaged about 4 seconds to load. Though it could just be that the server was running slower while I did my second test. I only did a few tests for each case.
