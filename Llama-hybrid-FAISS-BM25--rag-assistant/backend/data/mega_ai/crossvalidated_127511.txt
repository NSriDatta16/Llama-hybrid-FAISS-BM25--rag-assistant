How to normalize by the covariance matrix?

I am trying to understand an image processing research paper [1] that calls for normalizing a distance between an object's center point and the center of a cluster of points by the covariance matrix of the cluster. Given $m^f_c$ - center of cluster $c$ at frame $f$ (2 dimensional $x,y$ point) $m^f_t$ - center of cluster $t$ at frame $f$ (2 dimensional $x,y$ point) $\Psi_c$ - covariance of cluster c For each object $t$, the distance to each cluster $c$ is calculated $D_{ct}=\frac{1}{f}\sum_f(m^f_c-m^f_t)(\Psi^f_c)^{-1}(m^f_c-m^f_t)^T$ The paper says " It is important to normalize the cluster-to- [object] distance by the covariance matrix of the cluster to handle the scale variation of objects " What is meant by " normalize by the covariance matrix "? I understand normalization by a scalar, but by a covariance matrix is confusing me. [1] Anjulan, A., & Canagarajah, N. (2009). A Unified Framework for Object Retrieval and Mining.
