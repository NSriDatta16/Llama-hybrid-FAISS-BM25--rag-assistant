can computers play word association games?

Suppose I give you these 6 English words: circle, low, Brian, sentence, support, wild and ask you to find a 7th word that is associated with all of them. You probably already know which one it is. Each word is obviously associated with many other words, e.g. circle could be associated with friends , pi , area ...; sentence could be associated with judge , grammar , phrase ...; etc. Each association can be stronger or weaker, perhaps depending on its frequency in naturally occurring language. So the task would seem to be: intersect all the sets of words associated with each of the 6 'seeds', and find what is left. But with some measurement of the strength of the results. Could a computer 'play' this game? Are there any machine learning methods that could do this? I'm thinking association rules or something related to text mining, but I am not sure. Thanks!
