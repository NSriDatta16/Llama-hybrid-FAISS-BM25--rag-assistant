How can i get the Dragged Element in a Silverlight App

i have two ListBoxes (in a Silverlight 3 Application), each wrapped with a ListBoxDragDropTarget. Now i fill the SourceBox with some custom Objects (Person). Then i wire up the DragOver Event of the Destination DragDtopTarget. This all workd fine and i can drag & drop the elements from the first list to the second. Now my issue: How can i get the Element, which is being dragged to allow/disalow dragging? (I cannot get the Person from the FragEventArgs). This is my Xaml: and this is the Code of my DragOver-Handler: Private Sub DragDest_DragOver(ByVal sender As Object, _ ByVal e As Microsoft.Windows.DragEventArgs) _ Handles DragDest.DragOver Dim Pers = e.Data.GetData(GetType(Person)) End Sub Thank you for any hints how to solve this. Christoph EDIT: This is my short version of the Answer :-) : Private Sub DragDest_DragOver(ByVal sender As Object, _ ByVal e As Microsoft.Windows.DragEventArgs) _ Handles DragDest.DragOver Dim Args As ItemDragEventArgs = e.Data.GetData(e.Data.GetFormats()(0)) Dim Sel As SelectionCollection = Args.Data Dim Persons = (From Pe In Sel Select DirectCast(Pe.Item, Person)).ToList End Sub
