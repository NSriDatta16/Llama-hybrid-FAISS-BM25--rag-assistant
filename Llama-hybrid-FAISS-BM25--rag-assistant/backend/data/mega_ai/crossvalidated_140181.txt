The hurdle regression model fits both of the models you are interested in (I think). It is a two-part model where both parts can be estimated completely separately: (1) You fit a binary regression model (e.g., logistic regression) to the response of "no visitis" (= 0) vs. "at least one visit" (> 0). (2) Then, you fit a zero-truncated model to the data with response > 0. Thus, model (1) answers the question what are the determinants of no visits vs. any visits. And (2) addresses the question what determines the number of visits given that there are any visits. Model (1) is usually a standard logistic regression while model (2) is not a standard Poisson model because the zeros have been dropped (or "truncated"). Hence, this has to be accounted for in fitting the model. If you are using R, then the hurdle() function in the pscl package can fit this model and the accompanying vignette("countreg", package = "pscl") briefly explains the theory and gives more details.
