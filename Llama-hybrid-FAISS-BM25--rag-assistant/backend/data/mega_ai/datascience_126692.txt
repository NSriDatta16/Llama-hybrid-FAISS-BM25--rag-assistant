Sale Forecasting Problem -- Is it legit to use inventory level as a feature?

I'm working on a project to predict future sales for our company's products so that the supply chain can have better idea how much to restock. Detail about the model I'm working on: Model: LGBM (from Darts library) Features: Past sales, calendar information, price, some other external features, and the one that I have question on -- inventory level (exact number of inventory from one day before). Prediction Window: One step, but recursively predicting 35 days forward. My question is, is it even legit to use inventory level as a feature to predict sales? If so, how to use it properly? Inventory level certainly contains some information about sales: like 0 in-stock usually means 0 sales; low stock may drag the sale down; restock after a long time of out-of-stock status will cause the sale to climb up gradually instead of jumping up suddenly (in my case). However, during prediction, there's no way for us to pre-know the inventory level for each day. I could certainly use some logic to simulate inventory dynamic, but in that case, there's no way to compare the true and predicted value because the inventory data is not even real. Using the real inventory data will also raise my alert that I'm giving the model something that it probably shouldn't know at the time of prediction. So, can I still use it, or does it make sense to still use it? If so, what's a proper way to process this data so I could still use it in the validation data? maybe categorize it? Looking forward to any helpful thoughts and suggestions. Thank you!
