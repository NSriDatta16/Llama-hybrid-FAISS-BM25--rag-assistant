All the priors you mention are "joint" priors in that they define a joint distribution on the parameter vector $\mathbf{\theta}=(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_p)$. When the prior writes down as $$\prod_{i=1}^p \pi_i(\theta_i)$$ each component $\pi_i(\theta_i)$ can also be interpreted as a (marginal) prior on the component $\theta_i$ [provided all components are proper] and the components are independent a priori. Since all priors are acceptable within the Bayesian paradigm, there is no foundational reason to favour independent priors over dependent priors.
