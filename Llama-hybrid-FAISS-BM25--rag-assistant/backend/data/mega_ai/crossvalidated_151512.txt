If you're interested in whether the average correlation is higher than zero, this should be straightforward Under a null of no correlation, the individual Kendall correlations of $m$ elements should have mean 0 and variance $\frac{2(2m+5)}{9m (m-1)}\,$. This variance formula applies down to $m=2$. Imagine there are $n_k$ cases where $m=k$. Then the sum of $n_k$ independent such correlations $\sum_{i=1}^{n_k} \hat{\tau}_i$ has mean 0 and variance $n_k\frac{2(2m+5)}{9m (m-1)}$, and the average at $m=k$, $\bar{\tau}^{(k)}=\frac{1}{n_k}\sum_{i=1}^{n_k} \hat{\tau}^{(k)}_i$ then has mean 0 and variance $\frac{1}{n_k}\frac{2(2m+5)}{9m (m-1)}$. The estimate of $\tau$ with smallest variance would weight inversely proportional to variance. That is $\hat{\tau}=\sum_k w_k \bar{\tau}^{(k)}/\sum_k w_k$, where $w_k=n_k\frac{9m (m-1)}{2(2m+5)}$. The variance of this can be computed by the basic properties of variance. We have that $\overline{\tau}$ should be approximately standard normal under the null. You could then either set up a one- or two-tailed test, as you wished. (A continuity correction would improve the approximation but with large $n$ should not be necessary.) [If you want to consider something other than the average correlation as a statistic there'd be a variety of other ways of combining the individual information into a single overall statistic, but it depends on what you're interested in.] However, with an $n$ of 20000, you might want to consider that you're almost certain to reject the null at any reasonable significance level. It might make more sense to try to construct a confidence interval for the Kendall correlation.
