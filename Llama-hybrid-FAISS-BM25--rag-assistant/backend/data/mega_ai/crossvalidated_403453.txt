How to find out if there is any real pattern in the data set?

Let's assume that we have a regression problem (in the machine learning sense). Our data set consists of pairs of features vectors and numeric targets. It might be the case that there is absolutely no relation between features and targets. How can we detect those situations? I would like to have a test such that we do not miss any weak relation. In other words, if the test says that there is no relation, we can be quite sure that there is really nothing in the data and it does not make any sense to build a predictive model.
