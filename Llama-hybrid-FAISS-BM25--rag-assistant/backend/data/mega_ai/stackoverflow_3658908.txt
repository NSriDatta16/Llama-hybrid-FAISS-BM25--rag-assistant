Given the following class: class MyWorker implements Runnable { @Override public void run() { } You can create and start a thread with: Thread thread = new Thread(m_worker); thread.setDaemon(true); // If the thread should not keep the process alive. thread.setName( "MyThreadName" ); thread.start(); You can implement the Runnable as a top-level class, a nested class, or an anonymous class. Multi-threaded programming requires special attention. Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java," 2nd ed., has an introduction to some issues in its "Concurrency" chapter. It would be worth reading. One suggestion is to prefer executors and tasks to raw threads.
