Unfortunately, this problem is all but hopeless for a random forest approach. You do not have enough data to do much of anything, let alone a complicated model like you have selected. If you just want to learn the mechanics of implementing a random forest in software without having to concern yourself with excessive training time due to a large data set, then this is fine, but you should not expect good predictions from your data or an ability to identify important features with any kind of confidence in your identification. How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless The first paragraph and image posted by Gung apply here (unless you just want to work on the software mechanics), even if that was posted in a rather different context.
