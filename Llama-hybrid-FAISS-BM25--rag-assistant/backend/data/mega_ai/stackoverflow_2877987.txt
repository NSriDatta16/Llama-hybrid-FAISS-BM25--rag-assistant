If you don't call StartRecognition before Run, the handler never gets hooked up. So the obvious solution would be to make sure that your line of code that hooks up the recognition handler gets called. The simpliest solution is the best one :) I made the recognition handler in the run() method. I call the startReconition method method after run and it worked! thanks Robert Harvey
