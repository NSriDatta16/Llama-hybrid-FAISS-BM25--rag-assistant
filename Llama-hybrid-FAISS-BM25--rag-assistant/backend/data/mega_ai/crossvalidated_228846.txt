How to choose a Bayesian network?

I have fitted several Bayesian network models to complete training data with different local probabilistic distribution but with a fixed network structure. I want to choose only one of them. How can I go about this? I've read that I can choose the model which gives the lowest prediction error or other loss metric, as well as some goodness of fit criteria like some information criterion. But how can I tell which of these approaches are better? Thanks!
