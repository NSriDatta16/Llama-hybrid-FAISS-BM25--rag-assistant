Time Series Hyperparameter Tuning

My question is about the intuition for hyperparameter tuning of time series. In other models, like Linear or Logistic Regression there is labeled data and according to accuracy or precision, the parameters are tuned. But in time series, the future values are predicted. For example, the next 30 days. My question is, what is the point of tuning, when you do not know what the answer is (as it is going to happen in future)?
