Condition if there exists any event at specific day

I just modified some functions such as extended drag and modify them to save a timestamp (start and end) into a hidden input (I send those information to MySQL). But one of the conditions is that event that I dragged can't exist with another event in one day. Is there any method in fullcallendar that can tell me if that condition is fulfilled? Thanks for answers. :)
