If categorical variable has some hierarchy, should I just label them or split into dummy variables (One-Hot encode)?

I have a column which has 5 unique categories. There's a hierarchy between these categories (Best > good > OK/Not Sure > Bad > Worst) In this case, should I label them based on hierarchy like: Best: 4 good: 3 OK/Not Sure: 2 Bad: 1 Worst: 0 Or should I perform one-hot encoding/Dummy encoding? What's the intuition behind how the model perceives the two things? Note: I should also mention that this is for predictive modeling using Logistic Regression.
