Consolidation of my comments to an answer. This doesn't address the etymology, but the underlying concern of the OP as to whether "average" can mean median. There are times when "average" is used to refer to medians. It's common to say "The average American household earns 50,000 per year," and intend that the median household income is 50,000. Compare, for example, the headline and data presented here . The headline: Hereâ€™s how much the average American earns at every age and the data presented: Below, check out the median earnings for Americans at every age bracket, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the second quarter of 2017. (Also later in the article, use of "average man".) As a different example from a statistical source, Grissom and Kim, 2012, Effect Sizes for Research , 2nd ed. The first sentence of chapter 2: Recall that the location of a population is a parameter that is usually defined as a measure of its "average," commonly its mean or median. To be clear, I think that "average" usually indicates the mean. But to the original question, it's possible the speaker was using average in a way that implies a median value. As a final note, I wonder if when we say, "man of average height" if we are thinking of the median and not the mean. Probably neither per se. But I could see how speaking this way, I might use the median as the criterion.
