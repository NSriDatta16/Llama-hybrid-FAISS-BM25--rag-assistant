Is there an IIS setting to get rid of extra '/' characters in a requested URL?

The general problem: We have urls coming to our IIS web servers formatted like: http://www.server.com/page.aspx We are also seeing that urls like this are coming in: http://www.server.com//page.aspx We would like to get rid of that extra path character because when the user agent is Internet Explorer, this is resolving as 2 different pages, and thus, downloading the content twice when it should be resolved from a cache. I am not sure if this is a problem to be solved with something like a url-rewriting module, or if there is a configuration setting.
