I would rather suggest you to use more traditional approaches of coding such as dynamic programming or Greedy method to solve this rather than going for machine learning because in your question as far as i can understand there is nothing much that a machine learning algorithm can do for you in such a problem because there is simply nothing to learn here , so go for optimization techniques such as DP this actually to me looks like a problem similar to knapsack problem here your prices of items can act as weights and 40 as your maximum capacity then you can proceed i guess similarly in the way knapsack problem is solved using DP(i prefer it).Lastly, since you are new to machine learning i should tell you by reading your problem there is not much machine learning you can do here
