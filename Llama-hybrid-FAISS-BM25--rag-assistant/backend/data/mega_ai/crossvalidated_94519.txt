How to produce the minimum forecast error using R?

Considering that we want to use optimize() on the interval [0,1] how can I write an R code for finding the value of Î² that produces the minimum forecast error without using external packages like forecast ? For simplicity assume that: I want to use the following package: > require(datasets) > str(nhtemp) Time-Series [1:60] from 1912 to 1971: 49.9 52.3 49.4 51.1 49.4 47.9 49.8 50.9 49.3 51.9 ... in which nhtemp is the Yearly Average Temperatures in New Haven CT .
