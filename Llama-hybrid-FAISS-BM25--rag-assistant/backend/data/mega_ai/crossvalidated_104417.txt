Exploring properties of groups in R

I have a data frame with the following structure: age gender region homeowner.status extrovert agreeable conscientious type 1 34 Female Northern England Mortgaged 7 4 5 3 2 38 Female South East England Mortgaged 4 3 6 1 3 35 Female Northern England Mortgaged 3 7 7 4 4 30 Female Northern England Mortgaged 2 6 5 3 5 60 Male Scotland Owned outright 4 5 6 4 6 66 Male Northern England Owned outright 7 6 6 3 The type column has been created by assigning each row to a cluster. The clusters were determined using variables that are not present in this frame. I would like to produce a general report on how the various types differ from each other in terms of the other columns. That is, I would like to generate statistics of the form: type 1. 5% less likely to be a homeowner (p=.003) 3% more likely to be from Scotland (p=.03) 2.1 pts more extrovert than the average (p=.xxxx) I actually have many more columns than this, so a programmatic method of tackling each column is desirable. I am using R.
