If all the conditionals are Gaussians, does it mean the joint is Gaussian?

Suppose I have a set of variables $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and I know that all the conditionals are Gaussian. That is, I know that $p(x_1)$ , $p(x_2\mid x_1)$ and $p(x_3 \mid x_2, x_1)$ are Gaussian. What can we say about the joint distribution $p(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ ? It is necessarily Gaussian? Context I am reading Normalizing Flows for Probabilistic Modeling and Inference . If you go to 3.1.1., in the paragraph below equation (33) we have the following set up: Suppose I have $\boldsymbol{z}=(z_1, z_2, z_3)$ jointly Gaussian, and I transform this into a random variable $\boldsymbol{z}' = (z_1', z_2', z_3')$ as follows: $z_1 ' = \alpha_1z_1 + \beta_1$ where $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ are fixed . $z_2' = \alpha_2 z_2 + \beta_2$ where $\{\alpha_2, \beta_2\}$ are output of a neural network with input $\boldsymbol{z}_{ . $z_3' = \alpha_3z_3 + \beta_3$ where $\{\alpha_3, \beta_3\}$ are the output of a neural network with input $\boldsymbol{z}_{ Then we know: $z_1$ is Gaussian since it's a marginal of a Gaussian. $z_1'$ is Gaussian since it's an affine transformation of a Gaussian. Then, they say, this means that all the conditionals $z_i'\mid \boldsymbol{z}_{ are Gaussian however the joint $\boldsymbol{z}'$ is not.
