G'day, What abut start writing some fragments for reuse in other pieces of software? That way you can: optimise the particular pieces of functionality by revisting them every now and then, not have to re-invent the wheel everytime you need to have this functionality incorporated into your main pieces of software, start spreading them around and make a bit of a name for yourself. Off the top of my head, some of the things I'm thinking of are things like: logging reading config from a file setting up a common environment All of which, if you had them already written, would make your turnaround time on other projects where you'd used them much faster. The functionality would also be consistent across multiple projects. HTH cheers,
