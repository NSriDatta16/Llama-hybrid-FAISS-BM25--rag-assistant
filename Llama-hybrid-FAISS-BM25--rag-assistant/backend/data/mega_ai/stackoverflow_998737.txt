Integrating tomcat and eclipse as a hot-deploy environment

I would like to setup eclipse and tomcat in an integrated fashion such that changes to my JSPs and servlets(if possible) are reflected immedietely without requiring a deployment. Ok, this is one of those questions that has plenty of answers all across the internet but they all seem different. (use Sysdeo plugin, use JBOss plugin, do stuff with an outdated Eclipse, use MyEclipse instead etc.) and I couldn't find 1 definitive resource to refer to. So for my benefit, what is the simplest and most recommended procedure to set this up ? This assumes I have eclipse and tomcat running independently. I actually have managed to integrate them in a non-hot deploy fashion using instructions here : http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-eclipse-tomcat/index.html Eclipse version Version: 3.4.2 (Ganymede) Tomcat v6.0.20
