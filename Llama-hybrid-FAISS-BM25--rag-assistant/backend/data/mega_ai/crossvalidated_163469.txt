The default output from lsmeans is on the latent-variable scale -- a bit hard to explain but one way to think of it is that the common model involves a linear predictor for the logit of the cumulative probabilities, and the latent value is the average of that linear prediction of each grid value across cut points. If you want the predicted average class number on the 1-9 scale, it's easy to get: lsmeans(..., mode = "mean.class") For more details, see ? models with lsmeans loaded.
