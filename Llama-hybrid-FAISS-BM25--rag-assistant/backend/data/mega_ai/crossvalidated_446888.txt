95% confidence ellipse using Hotelling T-squared in a score plot (R)

I am trying to draw a 95% confidence ellipse using Hotelling T-squared in a score plot of two principal components from a PCA. I have checked that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42637860/pca-and-hotellings-t2-for-confidence-intervall-in-r But, I didn't find information to perform an outlier detection using Hotelling T2 since the ellipse used doesn't seem to be based on Hotelling T2. Do you have any example?
