Errr... just guessing: Have you tried to click on the button with a litte "plus"-sign on it left hand to the perspective buttons? There should be an "Other" section containing all available perspectives. Second guess: I've had the same issue some time ago. First: Do you use the most recent Ganymede release of Eclipse? I tried to install PDT by hand and the perspective was missing to. After i installed PDT trough the "Install new Software" Feature (PDT is now part of the standard repository) it worked perfectly.
