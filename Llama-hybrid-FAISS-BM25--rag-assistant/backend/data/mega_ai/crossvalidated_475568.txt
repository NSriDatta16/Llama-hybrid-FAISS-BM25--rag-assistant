detrend time series data for non-regression proposal

Suppose I have a time-series data (temperature and ice-cream sales). I would like to fit a copula model to this data (just to understand the dependency between these two variables. I do not want to fit a regression copula model). My question is, do I need to detrend the data? As I understand I can detrend the data only if I need to fit a regression model.
