Optimal Lag for Newey West

I am currently working on my PhD thesis and was wondering how I can identify the optimal number of lags for the Newey West covariance matrix. So far, my code is library(sandwich) library(lmtest) library(dynlm) Regression Since I have to compare coefficients of multiple regressions (for the same time series), I should use the same lag as well. However is there a rule of thumb or a simple method to get the lag? Thank you and best regards
