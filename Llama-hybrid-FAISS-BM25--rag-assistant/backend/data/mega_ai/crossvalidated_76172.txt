How to use the datasets to practice machine learning algorithms?

I'm a beginner in ML, and I want to practice with some algorithms I learned from the book, after searching stats.SE, I found some places where I can get some datasets. But, how to use them? For example, the Iris dataset from UCI contains 150 examples, 50 instances for each classes. OK, I thought I should take bulk of this dataset as training examples, spare rest of the dataset as test examples, right? And the problem is how should I divide this dataset? Shuffle them randomly and then draw the training examples randomly? I think different training set will affect the model learned from it, right? Please give me some advice on how to use the dataset, thanks.
