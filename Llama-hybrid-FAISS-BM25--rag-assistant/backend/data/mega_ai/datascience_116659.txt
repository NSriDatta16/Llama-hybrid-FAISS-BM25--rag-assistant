Generate similar text based on category or the similar texts

I'm trying to generate the similar text based on the category or to generate text by combining similar texts into the new text. I was checking multiple nlp tasks like question generation, but they don't work for my task. I have a dataset of text and related categories. In addition, I have a text category classificatory Is there any text generation branches for the similar tasks or the papers to read? I looked at Permgen, but I had a problem with generation Thank you in advance
