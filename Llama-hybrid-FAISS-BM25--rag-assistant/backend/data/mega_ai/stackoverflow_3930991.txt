Are these projects or namespaces? There's an ancient and ongoing debate about fine-grained verses coarse-grained project structure. I'm in the coarse-grained camp. An assembly is a unit of deployment, not a logical layer, and the structure you are describing is better achieved as namespaces in a single project. Having said that, your organisation looks sensible. My only change would be to put interfaces alongside their implementations rather than in Project.Core.
