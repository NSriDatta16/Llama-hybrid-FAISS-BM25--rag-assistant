NLP: Getting the top 5 or top 10 predictions

I am working on a social networking application and I have to make its news feed better. For example: If someone searches for 'suggest me some good books', it should yield some names. Now, I have used the Infersent algo (to begin with) in order for my model to be able to answer questions. I am getting only the best output that my model could predict viz., 'Alchemist'. I want at least 4 or 5 other outputs, other words, the top five predictions. I know that Xgboost has the ability to do this activity in some sorts, but I am not sure how I should use that in my problem. Any heads up? My apologies, I cannot share any code but I would really appreciate ideas and suggestions. Thank you,
