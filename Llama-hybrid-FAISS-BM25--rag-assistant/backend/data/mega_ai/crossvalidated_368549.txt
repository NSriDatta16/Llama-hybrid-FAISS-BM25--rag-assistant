What you described is called "Locally connected layers" and it is a trade-off between convolutional layers and fully connected ones, as the following figure [1] visualizes: It has much less parameters than a fully-connected layer but much more than a convolution layer. Whether you will get better or worse results depends entirely on the problem you are trying to solve. Look for papers using locally connected layers to see for which problems is this approach suitable.
