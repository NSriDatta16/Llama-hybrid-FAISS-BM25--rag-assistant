"There were 3 hits and 3 misses, and so the probability of the 7th shot hitting is 0.5. " Do you mean: "There were 3 hits and 3 misses, and so my estimate of the probability of the 7th shot hitting is 0.5. " Some more information is needed before your question can be answered. Firstly, is the process stable? i.e. is the real probability of a hit constant, or does it drift over time? Secondly, what prior knowledge do you have of the process? If you can encode your prior knowledge as a probability distribution of the unknown P then bayesian methods provide a precise answer to your question. In the absence of prior knowledge your question has no answer. Put it this way: suppose I have already planned the infinite sequence miss, miss, hit, hit, miss, hit, miss ... according to some whim, then the first $n$ results don't really tell you anything about the $n+1^{st}$
