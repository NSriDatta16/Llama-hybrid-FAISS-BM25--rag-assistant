Assumptions: Outcome follows a categorical distribution ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution ), which is linked to the covariates via a link function as in ordinary logistic regression Independence of observational units Linear relation between covariates and (link-transformed) expectation of the outcome For assumption 1 to be fulfilled, the categories of your outcome need to be exclusive (non-overlapping) and exhaustive (covering all possible forms the outcome can take). I don't really know if there are any proper statistical tests for assumption 2. For time-series data there is a test of autocorrelation called Durbin-Watson test. For other forms of correlated data, I think you would rather make that decision based on theoretical considerations (e.g., if your data come are derived from a cluster-sampling procedure, you would expect the data within clusters to be correlated). As for assumption 3, in binary logistic regression you can plot binned residuals against estimated probabilities to see if the average residual is around 0 over the entire range of estimated probabilities. I suppose this can be generalized to multinomial regression by making (k-1) such plots instead for the different categories of an outcome with k categories. EDIT: Concerning alternative models: Assumption 1 is fairly straightforward to fulfill. You might run into trouble because you have to estimate a large number of parameters (k-1 different sets of intercepts and slope parameters). In such a case, you could for example collapse the outcome into a binary outcome and do a simple logistic regression. If assumption 2 is violated, you could use a mixed model, which allows you to specify a dependence structure- As for assumption 3, you could transform variables of which you suspect that they have a non-linear effect. A common transformation is for example to include age squared in health-related outcomes.
