Using neural network regression for skewed data

I'm using a feed forward network for a regression problem where the response variable is a ratio that can be negative and is very heavily skewed. As the response can be negative, I can't just log transform the raw data. I've thought about doing log(1+x) , rank(x) and standardize(rank(x)) . What would be the best way to deal with this while preserving as much feature of the data as possible?
