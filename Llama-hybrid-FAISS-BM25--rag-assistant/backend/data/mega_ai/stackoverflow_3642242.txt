Windows Azure Storage in VB: Not running in a hosted service or the Development Fabric

I'm trying to run an instance of the Azure Blob Storage in the Azure Visual Studio 2010 development environment, but keep getting the following error: System.InvalidOperationException: Not running in a hosted service or the Development Fabric. The stack trace is pointing to these lines: Imports Microsoft.WindowsAzure Imports Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Diagnostics Imports Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient ... CloudStorageAccount.SetConfigurationSettingPublisher(Function(configName, configSetter) configSetter(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings(configName))) Dim this_storage_account = CloudStorageAccount.FromConfigurationSetting("DataConnectionString") ... I'm a little dubious about the first line as it comes from a c# interpretor output of what appears to be a common hack to get around a quirk of the CloudStorageAccount class. DataConnectionString is set to UseDevelopmentStorage=true Both the Development Fabric and Development Storage are running in the task bar. I've tried creating a clean solution to see if this was a configuration issue, but am still getting the same error. Any ideas gratefully received.
