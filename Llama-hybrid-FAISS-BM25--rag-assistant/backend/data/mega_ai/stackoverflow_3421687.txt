This is a very wide question, not having a simple and clear answer. However, you are on the right track. It all starts and ends with the users... what are their goals and how are they expected to reach their goal? Should they complete tasks or find information? Every design process start by a strategy . Ask yourself what is the purpose of the site and what are the user needs. Without a clear strategy, projects are more likely to fail. Second, you define the scope of the site. Which content requrements and functional specification do the site have. Moving on to the structure of the site. We are now concerned with Information Architecture (Labeling, Navigation, Organization and Search) and Interaction Design. On the market there are various techniques and tools to find out how user relate labels to information, like to navigate and so on. The initial user tests can be performed in this early stage to verify that the project is on the right track. When all the above have been done, its time to start draw the site on a piece of paper. Where will certain elements be, and how will users interact with the site. You can also use a drawing tool like Balsamiq Mockup to build the skeleton . Last, you implement the surface ; colors, images and the real coding begins. Visualization takes place, and hopefully more user tests. Remember though, design isn't a straight forward process. You have to iterate through every design step, moving back and forward between these layers, until you have a good result. Finally, do some tests of the site targeting the intended audience. User tests make all the difference. Reference and more to read: Jesse James Garrett: The Elements of User Experience .
