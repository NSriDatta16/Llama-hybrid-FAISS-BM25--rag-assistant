Is var-args can be used as method argument only?

This is compiling fine :- public class Demo { public static void main(String... args) { } } But this is not getting compiled. public class Demo { public static void main(String... args) { String... strVarArgs ; //here i initiallize strVarArgs by some logic, like we do for arrays } } Plz correct me, if i am syntactically wrong. :-) cletus wrote :- It's really just syntactic sugar for an array Here is an example followed by a statement from a very popular java book written by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates (Head First Java, 2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill/Osborne) :- Topic generics, , where MyClass is a class, and , where MyInterface is an interface. Following is the as it is copy from book (page 548, chapter 16) :- In generics, "extends means" "extends or implements"??? The java engineers had to give you a way to put a constraint on a parameterized type, so that you can restrict it to. But you also need to constrain a type to allow only classes that implement a particular interface. So, here's a situation where we need one kind of syntax to work for both situations-inheritence and implementation. In other words, that works for both extends and implementations. And the winning word was ...extends. Whenever there's a chance for the sun engineer's to reuse an existing keyword, as they did here with "extends", they will usually do that. But sometimes they don't have a choice...(assert, enum). MyQuestion : Is var-args just a syntactic sugar of array, with no other features then array???
