Generally an average of a set of forecasts gives a better forecast than any individual forecast, so why not use all the forecasts, even the poor ones? The question - you also ask - is how to do this. The most simple way is to use weighted mean , where you weight each forecast by the inverse error. This makes 'poor' forecasts have a low weight and the 'good' ones to have high weight. There are more sophisticated approaches, check the references for learning more. Winkler and Makridakis (1983). The Combination of Forecasts. J. R. Statis. Soc. A. 146 (2), 150-157.
