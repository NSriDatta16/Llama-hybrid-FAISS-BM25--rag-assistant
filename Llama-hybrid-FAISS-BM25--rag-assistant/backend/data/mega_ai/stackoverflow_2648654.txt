how do i troubleshoot transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining or Empty reply from server?

Recently and without any website code changes, a few of our dynamic PHP pages are either only partially rendering or not rendering at all. When the page won't render at all, and when I run curl, this is what I see: $ curl -lv http://example.com/create_ad.php * About to connect() to example.com port 80 * Trying 66.777.888.999... * connected * Connected to example.com (66.777.888.999) port 80 > GET /mypage.php HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: curl/7.13.2 (i386-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.13.2 OpenSSL/0.9.7e zlib/1 .2.2 libidn/0.5.13 Host: example.com Pragma: no-cache Accept: */* * Empty reply from server * Connection #0 to host example.com left intact curl: (52) Empty reply from server * Closing connection #0 And on partially rendered pages, when I run curl, I see this: $ curl -lv http://example.com/anotherpage.php * About to connect() to example.com port 80 * Trying 66.777.888.999... * connected * Connected to example.com (66.777.888.999) port 80 > GET /anotherpage.php HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: curl/7.13.2 (i386-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.13.2 OpenSSL/0.9.7e zlib/1.2.2 libidn/0.5.13 Host: example.com Pragma: no-cache Accept: */* No errors in PHP error logs. Any ideas?
