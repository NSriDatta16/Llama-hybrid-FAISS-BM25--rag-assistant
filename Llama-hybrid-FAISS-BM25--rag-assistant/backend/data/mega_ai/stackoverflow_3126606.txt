iWekbit was mentioned in articles I read recently. I did not evaluate it thought. I use jqTouch and it is a good software but its development has been slow last 6 month. With sancha out it is clear why, the guy is moving his attention to Sencha Touch. ballmw mentions the oreilly book. I read this book, it is a good one. it shows a lot of useful stuff. Two things are important to notice in regard of this book. First, jonathan the author will be the new maintainer of jqtouch. second, the code of latest jqtouch (I write this on 2010-06-27) which is beta2 is not compatible with the examples of the book. the difference is small but out of the box it will not work. Sencha Touch which I did not evaluate is based on Ext JS (now Sencha), while jqtouch is based on jquery. I never worked with Ext. My understanding is that Ext is not as fast as jQtouch, but take this with a huge grain of salt as I don't remember wehere I got this impression from. IMHO Sencha Touch has one huge benefit over jqTouch - iPad support. It also has android, but for me iPad is more important.
