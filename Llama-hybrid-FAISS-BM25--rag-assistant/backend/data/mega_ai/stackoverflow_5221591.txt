This depends how VisualSVN is organising your repository(ies) under the covers. If Dantooine is a separate repository (i.e. has its own independent version numbers) then easiest thing to do would be to copy / rename the Dantooine directory on the server. The name isn't included in the repository data - as far as subversion is concerned that's just the URL for data transport, it recognises repositories by a GUID revprop - so a rename followed by a svn switch --relocate on your clients should be enough to move it. If instead you want to create a complete copy / fork of the repository you can again just copy the Dantooine directory. Or if you actually want to copy / filter the branches from the reposistory you can use svnadmin dump to make a backup of the old repository and the svndumpfilter python script to strip out branches you don't want, then svnadmin load to load the filtered backup into a fresh repository. All of this might not be the VisualSVN way to do things, though - I've never used that myself.
