Find and Replace with Unique

I am performing a find and replace on the line feed character ( &#10; ) and replacing it with the paragraph close and paragraph open tags using the following code: This almost works perfectly, except that I really need it to de-dup the line feeds as the paragraphs tend to be separated by 2 or more resulting in . Is it possible to get it so that it will only ever replace this once per paragraph?
