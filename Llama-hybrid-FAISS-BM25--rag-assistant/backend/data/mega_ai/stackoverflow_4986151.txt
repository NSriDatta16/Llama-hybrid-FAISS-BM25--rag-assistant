I've recently been working on something similar - you can check out the dev site here , and the js is not minified, so feel free to take what you want. Initially I went for trying to 'render' the draft in SVG - this ended poorly, as browser support is still not that great, even using svg-web and similar libraries. I needed to do stuff like round text, and those features can really creep up on you. In the end, I wrote a tiny python server (using CherryPy ) that generates a png based on a set of querystring parameters using python-cairo . It takes serialized json object of 'text lines' and images. The png is actually the resource, and the function itself returns a 'render.png' filebuffer, so all you have to do on the front end is change the src attribute of the tag and it will refresh. I added upload functionality to the "image processing" server, too. Since I was already serializing json that contained all the information about the design, saving that in a database and loading it to edit designs was trivial. I would definitely recommend a library like jQuery (which is what I used) to make development easier. I didn't manage to do much in the way of dragging/dropping, which is something I would probably try to do from the start if I was starting over. Feel free to email me if you'd like to see some of the back-end code or if you have any questions (my email is in my SO profile).
