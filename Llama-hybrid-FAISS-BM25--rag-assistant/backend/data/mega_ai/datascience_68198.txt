Linear regression is not a classification technique. Most of this is meaningless as a result. Did you mean logistic regression? You do not need OneVsRestClassifier explicitly if you set LogisticRegression to handle multi-class classification internally with 'ovr' (one vs rest again) or 'multinomial' (softmax loss)
