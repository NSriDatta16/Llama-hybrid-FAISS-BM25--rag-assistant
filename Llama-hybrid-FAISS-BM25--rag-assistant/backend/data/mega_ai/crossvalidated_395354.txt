Whether you should use Cox regression, logistic regression or some other method depends on exactly what you are trying to do. You write I'm trying to predict what is causing people to cancel their policies and also What kind of regression would be most suitable to predict cancellations So it's not clear whether you are primarily interested in explanation (first statement) or prediction (second statement). In addition, you need to decide whether you are interested in a) whether the person cancels at all (which would indicate that some form of logistic regression should be used, possibly a non-linear multilevel model to deal with the changing fees, or you might have some other way to deal with those changes, or, if the changes happened to all members, you might need to ignore them) or b) how long the person stays a member, which would indicate some form of survival analysis, possibly Cox regression but perhaps some other form.
