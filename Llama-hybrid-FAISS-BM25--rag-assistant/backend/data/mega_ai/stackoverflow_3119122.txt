Since logging has nothing to do with UI, this is definetly the wrong place. The domain model is there for data representation in my opinion. So i would do it in a seperate class or even a seperate project. I have a MVC application where i have a seperate project for a logging service. In my structure it is in the most bottom layer (data access) since it directly logs to files and all other services are using it. I also use DI on it with use of the MEF framework. This has been working fine for me for a while and i didn't want to change it since then. I had other solutions which i skipped after a while because they were not as elegant to use as my current solution. Hope that helps you with your decision.
