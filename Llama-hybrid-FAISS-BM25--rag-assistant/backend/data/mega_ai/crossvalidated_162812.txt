There's no rule of the thumb since you can't know in advanced the patterns of information in your data. You should first apply a basic clustering algorithm (such as hierarchical clustering) on your raw (or scaled) dataset and see what that gives you. If you're not happy with the result, you could use a dimensionality reduction technique such as Principal Component Analysis in order to decrease the number of variables by keeping the more informative ones, then re-apply a proper clustering algorithm on the reduced dataset. If you know what you want to observe, it will be trivial to evaluate emerging patterns as you try out different techniques.
