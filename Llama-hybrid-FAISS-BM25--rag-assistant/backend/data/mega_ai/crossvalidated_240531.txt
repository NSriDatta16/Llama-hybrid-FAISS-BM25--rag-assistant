In this equation: $$ A V_A = B V_B $$ we right-multiply by $ V_B^T $: $$ A V_A V_B^T = B V_B V_B^T $$ Both $V_A$ and $V_B$ are orthogonal matrices, therefore: $$ A V_A V_B^T = B $$ Because $ Q = V_A V_B^T $ is a product of two orthogonal matrices, it is therefore an orthogonal matrix . This means that: $$ AQ = B $$ Note: if two datasets $A$ and $B$ have the same principal components, it could also be that $ B = A T^T $, where $T$ is a translation matrix (which is not orthogonal). However, since data centering is a prerequisite of PCA, $T$ gets ignored. Also given this post , we can say that: two centred matrices $A$ and $B$ of size $n$ x $p$ are related by an orthogonal transform $ B = AQ $ if and only if their principal components are the same.
