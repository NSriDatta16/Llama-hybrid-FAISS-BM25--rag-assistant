How to wash/validate a string to assign it to a componentname?

I have a submenu that list departments. Behind this each department have an action who's name is assigned 'actPlan' + department.name. Now I realize this was a bad idea because the name can contain any strange character in the world but the action.name cannot contain international characters. Obviously Delphi IDE itself call some method to validate if a string is a valid componentname. Anyone know more about this ? I have also an idea to use Action.name := 'actPlan' + department.departmentID; instead. The advantage is that departmentID is a known format, 'xxxxx-x' (where x is 1-9), so I have only to replace '-' with for example underscore. The problem here is that those old actionnames are already persisted in a personal textfile. It will be exceptions if I suddenly change from using departments name to the ID. I could of course eat the exception first time and then call a method that search replace that textfile with the right data and reload it. So basically I search the most elegant and futureproof method to solve this :) I use D2007.
