It's strange that the image begins to zoom when you start dragging. I looked at the implementation of the Image Zoom plugin you linked, and it uses the click event (technically, the onclick event), which shouldn't be triggered until the mouse is pressed and released within the bounds of the same element. I just set up a minimal test case of the jQuery UI Draggable plugin to record every time the click event is registered on a draggable element. Sure enough, if you click the mouse and release without dragging, you get a click event. However, as soon as you begin dragging a draggable, the click event will not trigger (even when you release it). So anyway, that's why it's weird that you're seeing the Image Zoom plugin zooming the image while its being dragged. Maybe try a different image zooming plugin? There are several linked at the top of the recently decommissioned Thickbox page.
