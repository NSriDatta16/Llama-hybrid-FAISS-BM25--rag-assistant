Keep in mind that the data you got in any context is just one possible realization of infinitely many. Hence, it is not really desirable to hit R^2=1 for a given dataset (keyword overfitting). Rather, you want to estimate parameters that provide for different samples on average reasonable results. From my point of view the instructor should have validated his results by using a different sample and show that his R^2 remains relatively stable. Further, with regard to the linear assumption, hardly any data/context/relationship is exactly linear. Therefore, an R^2=1 would be really unrealistic and further, an R^2=1 would make me really sceptical if there is not a problem with multicolinearity etc. Take it like that: There is a monotonic relationship between independent and dependent variables (more or less linear) and you try to approximate that monotonic relationship with a linear model. In this case a R^2=0.8 is quite good. Of course you don't have grasped the relationship perfectly, but, understanding parts of it is better than understanding nothing. cheers
