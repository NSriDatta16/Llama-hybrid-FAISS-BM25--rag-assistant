SQLite or SharedPreferences for persistent data storage?

For persistent storage of data is there any distinct advantage of using a SQLlite database over SharedPreferences or vice versa? Currently my application data is only a couple of kilobytes in size, though it could conceivably rise to ten times that size in the future. I can't find anywhere that states how much storage is available using SharedPreferences but would imagine this would be one limitation of using it? Is there any difference in speed between the two methods? I'm looking to weigh up the pros and cons of those two storage methods.
