Weather impact on plant growth

I have a data set that includes the following and am using it to learn more about data science. I have googled a bunch - but can't seem to find any examples on what I am trying to do. I am trying to predict days to harvest. I have quite a few years of historical data. Plant Date Variety Days To Harvest Transplant Plant Tape 5/16/2022 Wildcat 59 1 0 5/16/2022 Wildcat 81 0 0 5/18/2022 Bearcat 77 0 0 I realize this is a super simple data set, but I am learning! :) What I would like to try to do do is some how incorporate weather data into predicting the days to harvest. What I am unsure of is how to best put the weather data into the data set. For example, do I create a column for each weather feature and day within the X number of days? Example: Plant Date Variety Days To Harvest Transplant Plant Tape Day 0 Min Temp Day 0 Max Temp Day 1 Min Temp Day 1 Max Temp 5/16/2022 Wildcat 59 1 0 40 65 55 72 5/16/2022 Wildcat 81 0 0 40 65 55 72 5/17/2022 Bearcat 77 0 0 55 72 54 80 Would I be on the right track doing it this way? Or would 45 days of climate data be too much and should I be summarizing by the week instead? My goal would be to predict the days until harvest based upon the plant date and first X number of days of weather data.
