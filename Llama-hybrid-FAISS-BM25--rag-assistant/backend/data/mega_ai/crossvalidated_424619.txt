multiple regression with constraints of independent variables

I'm running a regression analysis with independent variables $X_{1}, X_{2}, \cdots, X_{n}$ and dependent variable $Y$ . There is a constraint among some of the independent variables, say, $X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3} = 1$ . What kinds of regression models (or other data science techniques) could be used in this scenario?
