If you need to store pointers to things in a container, you should either store some sort of smart pointer (like std::tr1::shared_ptr or boost::shared_ptr ) or use a container designed for storing pointers, like those found in the Boost Pointer Container Library . If you do store bare pointers, you need to remember to delete the pointers in the container before the container is destroyed. This includes any time that an exception is thrown that might cause the container to be destroyed. Getting this right is tedious, bug-prone, and wholly unnecessary given the facilities mentioned in the previous paragraph.
