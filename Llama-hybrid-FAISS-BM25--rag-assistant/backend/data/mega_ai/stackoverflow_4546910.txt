Well, the hide and show stuff is pretty simple. You'll want to give all of these elements ID's to make it easier to target: $(function(){ $("#listtable").hide(); $("#my_form).submit(function(){ $("#listtable").show(); return false; } } Now, actually doing something useful will require either a page reload, in which case you don't need the jQuery modifying the page at all or Ajax, which is probably what you're after. You can look at something like the .load() method. Using this method, you can load the results of an Ajax call into a target element easily. Pay special attention to the data argument. This is just an object of key value pairs of data to pass. So, you could do something like: $('#listtable').load('/my/ajax.url', {query: $('#my_input').val()}); HTH
