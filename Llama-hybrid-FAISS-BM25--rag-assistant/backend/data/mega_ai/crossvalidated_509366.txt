A Cox model has a baseline hazard instead of an intercept. In standard treatment coding with a linear regression model, the intercept represents the estimated outcome value for the reference levels of all predictors. That's the reference level of each categorical predictor, 0 for a continuous predictor. Coefficients for other levels of a categorical predictor represent differences from that intercept determined by the reference level. Similarly, the baseline hazard in a Cox model is that for the reference levels of categorical predictors; coefficients for other levels represent associated differences in log-hazard from the baseline. Attempts to code the levels as multiple binary predictors will not help. You can approach this as with pairwise comparisons in analysis of variance. If pairwise comparisons are needed, you should incorporate a correction for multiple comparisons . The R emmeans package provides a coherent approach to such analyses in a wide variety of modeling contexts. As I recall, with a Cox model it will provide estimated differences in log-hazard for all levels of a predictor, versus an average among them. That gets around using one species as the reference. If all you care about is whether there are any differences among species, then there is no need to do pairwise comparisons. Otherwise, see Point 2 for doing all pairwise comparisons. If there were only a few specific comparisons that you had in mind before you saw the results, you could do those and have a less vigorous correction for multiple comparisons.
