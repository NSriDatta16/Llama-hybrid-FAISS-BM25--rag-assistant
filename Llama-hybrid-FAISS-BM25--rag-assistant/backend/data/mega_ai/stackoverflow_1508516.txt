Reusing a Control in another Windows Forms Project

I've got lots of web experience but am a total novice when it comes to Windows Forms so this might be easy to answer: I have Project1 which I've added a reusable control to which allows filtering and searching of data and presenting results. I now want to use the same control in another Project. When I open Project1 and select my form the reusable control appears on the toolbar so I can drag it onto any form in the project, but how do I get this to happen in my new Project?
