List .BinarySearch doesn't accept a delegate, but it does have an overload that accepts an IComparer . Use that overload with the appropriate custom comparer ( CarByOwnerComparer : IComparer ) to get it to search the way you want it to. Of course, bear in mind that the list has to be already sorted with that comparer to allow binary-search to work. If you prefer writing a delegate (e.g. through a lambda) to implementing an interface, consider using a converter that can translate between the two, such as the ProjectionComparer provided here. However, I would suggest that you use a more appropriate collection-class instead, which provides fast retrieval by key. For example, SortedList and SortedDictionary will both do the job in O(logn) . If ordering is not a true requirement, it might be a lot easier to just go with Dictionary .
