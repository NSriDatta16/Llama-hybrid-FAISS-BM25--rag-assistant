How is writing a C interface easier in Ruby than Perl?

According to the official ruby About page it's easier to extend Ruby with C than Perl. I'm not a (perl) XS guy, but I find it dirt simple to write something quick and simple with Inline::C , so why is it easier in Ruby? Writing C extensions in Ruby is easier than in Perl or Python, with a very elegant API for calling Ruby from C. This includes calls for embedding Ruby in software, for use as a scripting language. A SWIG interface is also available. Any further explanation from those that do more C extensions would be useful.
