How do you interpret coefficients from a logistic regression model with interaction effects?

I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around my results from a logistic regression model I ran. In a nutshell, I'm trying to determine if singing behavior in a songbird is influenced by environmental factors. My model is as follows: Singing (yes or no) = B0 + B1 x Photoperiod + B2 x Rain + B3 x Wind + B4 x Photoperiod x Rain + B5 x Photoperiod x Wind + error Here's the output of the logistic regression: I know I cannot interpret B2 and B3 like in a standard regression (i.e., one without interaction terms). But instead have to interpret them as the relationship of rain and wind with singing (respectively) when photoperiod is 0. So my question is - what does that mean? The interaction effect plot of B4 shows a negative relationship of rain with singing probability (shown as detection on the y-axis) but the plot of just B2 (sorry it's so poorly done) when photoperiod = 0 shows a positive relationship of rain with singing probability. That seems contradictory to me. Are B2 and B3 even relevant to discuss? After all, photoperiod cannot ever be zero at these study sites (it ranges from ~10h in winter to ~12h in summer). So, under real-life circumstances, rain should have a negative influence on singing behavior, correct? Thanks in advance for any assistance y'all can provide!!
