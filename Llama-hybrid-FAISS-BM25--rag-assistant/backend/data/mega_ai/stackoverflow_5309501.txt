Best way for storing/viewing different image dimension scenarios in a web page?

I have a pages with different post/placement types. This placements having different dimension of images. Same posts, different image dimensions. An example; Homepage : Featured 600*400 Left side of featured 300*200 Bottom of featured 200*150 Other articles 150*100 Article Detail : Detail page 600*400 Maybe different sizes for category views... Which way is the best way for showing this images ? Resizing and storing image for all possible dimensions Pros : We can use articles in all homepage places Cons : This way uses more storage. Resizing and storing image for certain dimensions (If this example, we place this article to "Left side of featured" and we need to resize to 300*200 and 600*400) Pros : Less storage use. Less files. Short process time. Cons : When we want to change place of article, we need to re-process original image for new dimensions. We must map placements and dimensions. Also re-processing time needed. Storing original image, resizing and showing on-the-fly where we need (cache images to folder or different caching adapter, with a script - in this example i will write a php class for this, after i'll cache this files to a folder (garbage collection needed) or Redis (with expired cache)) Pros : We can use articles in all homepage places, images resized if you need to show. Cons : Browser hits to script for showing image. Not to file. It may increases CPU usage and more slower than other ways.
