Are you trying to examine the effects within your sample (ie. explanatory model) or are you using this data as a training set to build a model that can be used externally (ie. predictive model)? If the goal is to "find relationships among this variable and these 300+ predictors", I tend to agree with a regularized regression approach like LASSO and trying to establish some sort of "variable importance hierarchy". It's possible that all your variables are poor predictors, but I believe you can vary a cut-point in the LASSO to establish a relative importance. Multicollinearity may be an issue here, in which case you can try something like principal components regression or structured equation modeling approach. If you're trying to build a predictive model, as others have mentioned, you cannot train the model AND assess model performance on the same dataset by simply using % accuracy without an external validation method (eg. train/test set split, cross validation, bootstrap). Random forest seems like a good option here, given the many predictors.
