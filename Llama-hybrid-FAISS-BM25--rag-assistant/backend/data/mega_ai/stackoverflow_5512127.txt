How can I rotate around a scene in webgl on mousedrag (emulating a camera moving around a position)

Okay, So I have been reading for the past few hours and I have managed to get the mouse drag to work on the x axis using the following matrix computation, but no luck with the y axis: where newX = new mouse X coord previousX = mouse X coord at last update position = camera position mvMatrix = model view matrix or 'world matrix' angle = 0.01*(newX-previousX); rM = mat4.create(); mat4.identity(rM); rM[0] = Math.cos(angle); rM[2] = Math.sin(angle); rM[8] = -Math.sin(angle); rM[10] = Math.cos(angle); mat4.multiplyVec3( rM, position, position ) *Note this uses the glMatrix Library (http://code.google.com/p/glmatrix/) And also in order to always face the position 0,0,0 mat4.lookAt( position, vec3.create([0, 0, 0]), vec3.create([position[0], position[1]+1, position[2]]), mvMatrix ); I got the matrix from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix I have used the matrix under 'basic rotations' and Ry I am sure this has been done before, any help would be apreciated. Cheers, Josh
