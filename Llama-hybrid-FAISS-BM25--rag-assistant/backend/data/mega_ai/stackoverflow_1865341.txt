I'm not sure what are you trying to achieve, but there are several things that need your attention. First of all, check the syntax of : http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp So I'd change your html code to: Apples Oranges And on server side, after actually submitting the form, just look for $_POST[ "choice" ] for your desired value (1.00 or 0.80).
