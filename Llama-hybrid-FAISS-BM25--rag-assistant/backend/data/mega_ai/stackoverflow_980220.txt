Is it true that the paragraph in Tree Menu of MSDN library is store in the database?

I was assigned to develop a website looks similar to MSDN Library . According to MSDN Library, I have sense that their tree menu is updated in the database. They are not fixed like others Javascript tree menu. But I am not sure, I just have doubt, is it true that the paragraph in Tree Menu of MSDN library is store in the database? If it's true, respectfully, may you please provide me a brief explanation of MSDN library database diagram? I really appreciate for all the contributor in StackOverFlow and looking forward for the response.
