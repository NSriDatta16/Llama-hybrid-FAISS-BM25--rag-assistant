I realise this answer is a bit late for the poster of this question, but I thought it may help others reviewing this question. There is an excellent tutorial paper on interrupted time series analysis by Bernal et al: Bernal, J. L., Cummins, S., Gasparrini; A. (2017). Interrupted time series regression for the evaluation of public health interventions: a tutorial, International Journal of Epidemiology, 46(1): 348â€“355. You can download it free at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303883790_Interrupted_time_series_regression_for_the_evaluation_of_public_health_interventions_A_tutorial And best of all the paper's supplementary material includes R code for all of the examples discussed in the paper. It is particularly relevant to the poster's question since it uses segmented linear regression which is more appropriate for smaller data sets (i.e. less than 100 time points) than ARIMA.
