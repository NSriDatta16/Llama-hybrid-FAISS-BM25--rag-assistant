Tools such as Biztalk might fit for your scenario, depending on your architecture and integration options. See http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/en/us/default.aspx . edit: as per your edit with your additional questions: if you are storing results to your local database, you should be able to do a database rollback if any of the service calls fail. If the service calls will span a long duration of time, so that this cannot happen in the context of a single session, then you can create a holding area of sort in your data model. The holding area can hold all of the results from your various service calls. If all succeed, you can then transfer the holding area to your permanent storage. If all fail, you can rollback your holding area data. One way to to improve user responsiveness in this type of scenario is to asynchronously call your web services. This may require a page redesign, since the user's browser page will receive its response even if all service calls haven't completed. But if you have no control over the services and must call them, this is probably your only option to improve user responsiveness
