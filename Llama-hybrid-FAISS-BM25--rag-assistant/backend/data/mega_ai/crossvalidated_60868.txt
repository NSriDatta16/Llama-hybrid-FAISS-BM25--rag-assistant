Preliminary summary: Masson/Loftus is very exhaustive, and not an easy reading to give to my medical colleagues who would not accept something like an "interaction". They also have some suggestions for multiple comparisons, which show that pairwise confidence intervals are difficult to illustrate when one does not want to simplify heavily. I don't like this style: the bars with error bars look last millennium Excelish. However, they also use a slightly more elegant style: Cumming/Finch and Belia et al. are must readings. The first is the perfect choice to give your friend who shudders when (s)he sees the word interaction . I ordered Cumming's book after reading that article. The second shows a test I will implement in Shiny for the next medical investigator meeting. I like this plot, even if there is a second axis which I never used before; check Henrik's and some other's contribution on StackOverflow for an R-base graphics method to obtain it. I would prefer to put the second axis to the left of the difference to make absolutely clear that the values changed, and maybe add a p-value axis. Anybody from the lattice/ggplot fraction taking a shot? All supplied solutions are base graphics and not panelizable/facetable. However: note that comments and papers are mostly from the psychology department (and @cbeleites from hardcore chemistry). It would good to get comments from reviewers of medical journals.
