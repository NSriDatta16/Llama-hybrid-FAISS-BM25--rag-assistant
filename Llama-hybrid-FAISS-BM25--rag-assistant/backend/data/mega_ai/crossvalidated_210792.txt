After doing some digging in the literature, encouraged by Kjetil's answer, I've found a few references that do take the geometric/dynamical systems approach to the CLT seriously, besides the book by Y. Sinai. I'm posting what I've found for others who may be interested, but I hope still to hear from an expert about the value of this point of view. The most significant influence seems to have come from the work of Charles Stein. But the most direct answer to my question seems to be from Hamedani and Walter, who put a metric on the space of distribution functions and show that convolution generates a contraction, which yields the normal distribution as the unique fixed point.

Tech., Harlow, 1991, pp. 391–396. Cited in Karl Stromberg, Probability for Analysts, page 114 . ADDED October 19, 2018. Another source for this point of view is Oliver Knill's Probability and Stochastic Processes with Applications , p. 11 (emphasis added): Markov processes often are attracted by fixed points of the Markov operator. Such fixed points are called stationary states. They describe equilibria and often they are measures with maximal entropy. An example is the Markov operator $P$ , which assigns to a probability density $f_y$ the probability density of $f_{\overline{Y+X}}$ where $\overline{Y+X}$ is the random variable $Y + X$ normalized so that it has mean $0$ and variance $1$ . For the initial function $f= 1$ , the function $P^n(f_X)$ is the distribution of $S^{*}_n$ the normalized sum of $n$ IID random variables $X_i$ . This Markov operator has a unique equilibrium point, the standard normal distribution. It has maximal entropy among all distributions on the real line with variance $1$ and mean $0$ . The central limit theorem tells that the Markov operator $P$ has the normal distribution as a unique attracting fixed point if one takes the weaker topology of convergence in distribution on $\mathcal{L}^1$ . This works in other situations too. For circle-valued random variables for example, the uniform distribution maximizes entropy. It is not surprising therefore, that there is a central limit theorem for circle-valued random variables with the uniform distribution as the limiting distribution.
