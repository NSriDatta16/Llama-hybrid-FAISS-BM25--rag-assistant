My best short, intuitive explanation: Take that $X'X$. That is like the covariance of the $X$'s (it is actually the sum of squares). So, the variance (ish) of each $X$, and how each one changes when the other is at a certain value. Take that $\hat\sigma$. That is the residual variance. On average, how far does a point lie from its estimated expected value? Since it is scaled by $n$, think of it like a standard error. It is the uncertainty in the expectation of $Y$ given $X$. Now, scale that ``standard error'' by the "covariance" (actually sum of squares) of the data. What you have is the variance in the expectation of $Y$ per unit variance (covariance) in the data. This is an interpretation of the variance of $\hat\beta$. All that said, understanding the formalism (including an understanding of why the derivation is structured the way it is) will help with the intuition more than an intuitive explanation will help with the intuition.
