You seem to be attempting to identify a calibration curve. This is related to inverse regression (which terms if you want to use Google to search for, you'll need to add -sliced -topic to remove other results you don't want). However, plotting your two sets of numbers seems to suggest you have an odd notion of 'precise'. For example at A=10, B is 5.5,6,6 ... almost a 10% range. Similarly at B=7, A is 9.1 and 10.2 ... again about a 10% range. So at least one of the two is not very precise at all. If you had two precise sets of numbers where one was shifted by a constant, the sort of thing you should see is the grey points (points close to a line with slope 1): while what you actually have is the blue points, which don't seem to have any relationship at all. This is what makes me question the notion 'precise' in relation to these measurements. While the difference in means is about 3.5, from the information here there's no more reason to shift B up by 3.5 than there is to just always take adjusted-B=9.87, say -- the A and B are unrelated here, so there's no point shifting B, since it doesn't tell you anything about what A would give; might as well just take the average of all the A's.
