Why do I suddenly get an exception when using the System.Reflection.Assembly.CodeBase property?

In the fragment below, the CodeBase property fails on the assembly System.Xml.Xsl.CompiledQuery, no where else. The message says that "The invoked member is not supported in a dynamic assembly". I get that the CodeBase property is not implemented, what I don't get is why all of a sudden this is a problem. This code has been in service for months without a problem and suddenly ... if( CompareCaseInsensitive( Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension( assembly.CodeBase ), namespaceURI ) ) return assembly; I have several options available to code around this, but I'm hoping that someone can explain what happened in a way that might lead to a more robust solution. Edited with a follow on question. Is there some way to tell which assemblies have this property implemented and which do not without resorting to exceptions?
