Sample conditional distribution from a Markov Chain

Suppose I have a Markov chain (initial distribution and transition matrix). Using this Markov chain I can generate an arbitrary length sequences. How can I effective sample (other than rejection sampling) on it to satisfy certain properties? For example, I want sample from the conditional distribution: $$P(X_5,X_6|X_1=1,\cdots,X_4=1,X_7=1,\cdots,X_{10}=1)$$
