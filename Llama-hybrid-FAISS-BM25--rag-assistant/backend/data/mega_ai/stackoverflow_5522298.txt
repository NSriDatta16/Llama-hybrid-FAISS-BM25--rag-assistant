In my Mvc Controls Toolkit I have a TreeView server control. It allows also node editing, insertion of new nodes, and moving sub-tree into another location by dragging it with the mouse. All changes are reflected Automatically on data structures on the server side when the view is posted. Moreover all nodes are templated and the same tree can have different type of nodes.
