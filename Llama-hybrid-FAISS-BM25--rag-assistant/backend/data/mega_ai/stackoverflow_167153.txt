Re "unmodified" (NM's reply) - note that many complex containers like Dictionary do not guarantee to preserve order. Sometimes adding an item will make it appear last (giving the impression that order is preserved), and sometimes it will cause the internal buckets to re-organise, giving a completely different order. Things like SortedList etc obviously have their own rules.
