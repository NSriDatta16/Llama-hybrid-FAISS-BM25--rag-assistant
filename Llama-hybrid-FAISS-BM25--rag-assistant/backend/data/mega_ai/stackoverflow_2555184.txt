In the view I have this method: -(void) touchesBegan :(NSSet *) touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSArray* mySubViews = [self subviews]; for (UITouch *touch in touches) { int i = 0; for(; i } Whenever the touches event is triggered, Hellooooo gets printed in the console but the method before that is simply ignored
