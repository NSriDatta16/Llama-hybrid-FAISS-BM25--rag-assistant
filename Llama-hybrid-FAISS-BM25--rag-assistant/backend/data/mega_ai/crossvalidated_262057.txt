A good place to start is this book , you can download it online. Quick recap and starting points: If you're looking for image processing, CNN are a great choice and it seems you already played with it. For speech recognition - you can take a look at RNN (recurrent neural networks). Basically you can use them for images and videos too. And (sic!) you can use CNN to process audio (especially if it's preprocessed with FFT to get a 2D spectrum) NLP utilizes RNN as well. In order to extract features, you might take a look at Word2Vec . Additionally, encoder-decoder architecture is being used for machine translation. (Active research, not for production) for statistical inference and unsupervised learning (anomaly detection etc.) - you might take a look at auto-encoders and RBMs. Autoencoders are particularly used as an alternative for Factor Analysis: Factor Analysis vs Autoencoders Deep learning helps with reinforcement learning too: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf Recommender Systems use deep-learning as well. TensorFlow models (they are usually state-of-the-art): https://github.com/tensorflow/models Small collection of Java-examples to complement those from TensorFlow: https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples
