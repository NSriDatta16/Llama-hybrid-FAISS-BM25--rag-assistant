How to interpret a Spearman plot

Given the following data: library("fifer") homicidiostaxa0515 = c(26.1 26.6 26.7 27.2 27.8 27.4 29.4 28.6 29.8) #BR's homicide rate 2005-14 popcartaxa0515 = c(196.2 214.8 229.6 247.3 260.2 267.5 283.5 289.3 299.7) #BR's inmate rate 2005-14 I ran Spearman's correlation test on them and the result is as following: data: popcartaxa0515 and homicidiostaxa0515 S = 4, p-value = 0.0001653 alternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0 sample estimates: rho 0.9666667 Found a spearman.plot function in the package above, ran it as below: spearman.plot(popcartaxa0515, homicidiostaxa0515, dcol = "blue", xlab="Taxa População Carcerária/100khab", ylab="Taxa de Homicídios/100khab") and it returned something like this: I'm an undergraduate in a Brazilian law college, and I really have no clue on how to read this graphic. Mounting questions pop up in my head, but I'll have to ask them later.
