One point is, like you said, visual aid. Most programming languages (and even frameworks) have conventions on how to capitalize variables, names, etc. Also, it enforces using uniform names everywhere, so you don't have a mess with the same variable referred to as "var", "Var" or even "VaR". I can't remember of ever having bugs related to capitalization, so that point seems kind of contrived to me. Using 2 variables of the same name but different capitalization to me sounds like a conscious attempt to shoot yourself in the foot. Different capitalization conventions almost everywhere signify objects of completely different type (classes, variables, methods and so on), so it's pretty hard to make such a mistake due to the completely different semantics. I'd like to think of it in this way: what do we gain by NOT having case-sensitivity? We introduce ambiguity, we encourage sloppiness and poor style. This is a slightly subjective matter of course.
