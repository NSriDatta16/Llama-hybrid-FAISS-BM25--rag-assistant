Glmer result interpretation of mixed effects and intercept

I am having trouble interpreting my mixed-model results. I am a biologist and not really good at statistics yet. I have done a mixed-model using binomial family, as the dataset I am working on is proportional. I want to know if the proportion of diseased larvae is affected by the element type (C, H, W), the distance (D1, D2, D4), and by the combined effect. Looking at the result from the mixed model and comparing them with mean values for the groups, it does not make sense to me how element H:distanceD4 can have a significant effect, as the highest mean is for actually for elementW:distanceD4. The mean values for combined effects: How can I interpret the results and is there a possibility for me to have values for element C D1, element C D2, and element C D4, as I understand they are under the intercept. Would really like a simple explanation how to interpret mixed-model results. proov > summary(proov) Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: cbind(diseases.larvae, no_dis) ~ element + distance + element * distance + (1 | LS) Data: PB15_Fu AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 206.3 230.6 -93.2 186.3 74 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.0145 -0.5601 0.3253 0.5598 1.5617 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.
