Random forests generate trees using a random subset of predictor variables at each split, and more typically they are used where there is a large number of predictors. Part of the robustness of random forests (for datasets with many more predictors) comes from this random selection, repeated many times. The function's default for the number of variables to use in each tree is the square root of the number of variables for classification, or the number of variables divided by three for regression . As you only have two predictors, this works out as 1. I suggest you try passing in this parameter (mtry) as 2 so that both are included each time: ldeathRandomForest
