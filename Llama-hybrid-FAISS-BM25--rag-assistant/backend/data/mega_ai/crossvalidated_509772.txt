What do the values for initialization method mean in statsmodels simple exponential smoothing?

I'm trying to use Statsmodels' simple exponential smoothing for time series analysis. There are various methods available for initializing the recursions (estimated, heuristic, known). Can someone please explain what each of these options means? Thank you!
