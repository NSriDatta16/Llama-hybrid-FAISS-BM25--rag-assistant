Why would you reinvent the wheel? There are many implementations for both sides that do a very good job and are well tested. What feature do you miss in let's say Postfix (server) and Outlook (client)? If you still want to start, ask yourself how to create TCP Sockets and read/write to them how to do connection and thread pooling how to implement a state machine what are you doing with related topics? (SPF, DKIM, mbox storage, Maildir storage) what are you going to use for user authentication and authorization (... enter hundreds of other things here ...)
