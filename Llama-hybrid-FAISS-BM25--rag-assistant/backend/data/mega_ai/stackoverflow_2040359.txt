jquery sortable cannot be dragged outside of accordion

I have 2 connected sortable lists. One is inside an accordion. When I try to drag items from the sortable in the accordion, the helper disappears as soon as I get outside of the accordion. I can drop to one of the other connected sortables and the item will display, but it just doesn't display while I'm dragging. The accordion also scrolls down if I drag and item down. I can drag & drop items from either of the other list wherever I need and it works fine. How can I make items not disappear while dragging them from inside an accordion to the outside of it? I've already tried the containment option but that seems to have no effect. Here's code to expose the problem that I've taken from these examples: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists I want to be able to drag items from the accordion into the sortable list. I can actually drop them into the list, but they disappear while I'm dragging them outside of the accordion. Accordion Sortable Failure Test $(function(){ $(".sortable").sortable({connectWith: ".sortable"}); $("#accordion").accordion({ header: "h3" }); }); Sortable Row 1 Row 2 Accordion First Lorem ipsum dolor Second Phasellus mattis tincidunt nibh.
