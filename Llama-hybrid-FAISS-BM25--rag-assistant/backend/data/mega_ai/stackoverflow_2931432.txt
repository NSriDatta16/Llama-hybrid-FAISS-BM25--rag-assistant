Approach to Selecting top item matching a criteria

EDIT: my apologies, this was a MSSQL2008 issue. I have a SQL problem that I've come up against routinely, and normally just solved w/ a nested query. I'm hoping someone can suggest a more elegant solution. It often happens that I need to select a result set for a user, conditioned upon it being the most recent, or the most sizeable or whatever. For example: Their complete list of pages created, but I only want the most recent name they applied to a page. It so happens that the database contains many entries for each page, and only the most recent one is desired. I've been using a nested select like: SELECT pg.customName, pg.id FROM ( select id, max(createdAt) as mostRecent from pages where userId = @UserId GROUP BY id ) as MostRecentPages JOIN pages pg ON pg.id = MostRecentPages.id AND pg.createdAt = MostRecentPages.mostRecent Is there a better syntax to perform this selection?
