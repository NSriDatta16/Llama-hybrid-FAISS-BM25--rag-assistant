Ok, after your edit, here's a version that does exactly what you want: jsfiddle.net/PcD8n jsfiddle.net/AcPxx I took the liberty of tinyurl-ifying your images, as they made the code unwieldy. Also, for conciseness, I removed the wrapper tags. You can add them back if you like. Finally, I removed the id s from the cyclers, as they weren't necessary in the context of the code you gave us.
