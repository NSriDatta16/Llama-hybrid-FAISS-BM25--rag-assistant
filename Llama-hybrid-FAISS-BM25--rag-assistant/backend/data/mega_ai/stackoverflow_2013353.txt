Change UITableViewCell appearance when drag handle is pressed

I'd like to change the appearance of a cell when the user tap the drag handle. I searched in the documentation, forums and google, but I can't find a method or an event that say when the drag icon is pressed. Any help will be appreciated! Thanks
