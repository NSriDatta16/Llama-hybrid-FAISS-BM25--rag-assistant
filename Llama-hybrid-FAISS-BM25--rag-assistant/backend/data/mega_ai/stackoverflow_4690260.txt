If you do not wish to share your data among other applications there is no need to use a content provider. There is no advantage to using one other than providing a common interface to sharing the data. Yes a service is the best way. However you will more than likely need to get the service to start a thread to do the data retrieval. To get your service started at regular intervals, use a BroadcastReceiver and an AlarmManager . Register the BroadcastReceiver and an intent-filter in your manifest.xml. Use the AlarmManager to fire a PendingIntent which will be picked up by your BroadcastReceiver which will then start your Service which would in turn start your Thread or AsyncTask to retreive the data and write it to your database.
