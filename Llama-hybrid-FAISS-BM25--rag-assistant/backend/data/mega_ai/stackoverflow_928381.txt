This error message is generated by the C Run Time Library, CRT. Which version of the CRT are you using? I would start by determining what my call stack was when this error is generated. You can grep the CRT source code to find every place the error would be returned. I would also look at any in place in my code that calls TLSAlloc to see what I am putting into thread local storage and why.
