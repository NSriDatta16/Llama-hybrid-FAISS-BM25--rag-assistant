App Engine Development Server Does Not Reload Code When Changed

I'm working on a python app that will run on top of Google App Engine. I setup my app up with the following directory structure: approot/ app.yaml index.yaml myapp.py controllers/ some_controller.py some_controller1.py models/ views/ ...etc... My problem is that the development server will not always automatically reload my code when I make changes even though Google's documentation says it will. The only time it does reload my code is when the change I make is in the top level directory of my app. Anything in a subdirectory (e.g. controllers) is ignored. I have to stop and start the server every time a change is made. I find this really impedes my progress in development, especially since there is no restart button, you actually have to hit stop and then start. Is there a remedy for this or am I just doing it wrong? I really like having a well organized project and would rather not dump all my files in the top level directory.
