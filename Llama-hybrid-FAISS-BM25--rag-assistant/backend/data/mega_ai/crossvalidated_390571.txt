Assuming that by "type of logistic regression" you mean binary, ordinal or multinomial, it depends on the nature of your dependent variable. If agreement for each person is a dichotomy - agree vs. not - then you want binary logistic. If agreement is ordinal - e.g. agree completely, agree somewhat, did not agree at all (or it could be a variation of this) - then ordinal logistic is a good start. If agreement is a count (days per week) then you don't want logistic at all, but some sort of count regression. Poisson or negative binomial would be starting places. And if agreement is measured some other way, then please clarify by editing your question.
