Variables to be included in multiple imputation

1) Do we include all the variables during multiple imputation regardless of their missing value status or include only the ones which have missing values for multiple imputation 2) is it good to do a univariate analysis in the binary logisitic regression by running regression one variable at a time and then picking variables that are less than 0.2 in p value and then run them in the multivariate form of binary logistic regression?
