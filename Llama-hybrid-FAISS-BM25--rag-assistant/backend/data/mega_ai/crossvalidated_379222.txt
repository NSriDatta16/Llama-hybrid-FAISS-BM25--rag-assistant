How do I use a random forest regression once trained

Similar questions have been asked on these two posts: random forest how to use the results and How to use random forest for regression after it is trained but I feel like the replies didn't give proper answers. In python, I was able to use a random forest regression to predict a variable and the test data was quite positive. So now I'm interested in using it for later usages and wellâ€¦ how do I do that exactly? Unlike a linear regression model where you just get the coefficients and you build a new model with these coefficients, how do you build a new model with the random forest? When I build this new code (that will be use by others), do I have to add the initial training data that I had in order to predict new incoming outputs? It seems a bit silly to do, no? Thank you!
