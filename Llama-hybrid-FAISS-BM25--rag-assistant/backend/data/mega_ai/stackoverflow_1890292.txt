Why would you want to use Perl? You'd miss out on everything the iPhone SDK gives you, and you wouldn't be in the iTunes App Store. If you are trying to use Perl because it's the only language you know, just bite the bullet and learn Objective-C. Use the right tool for the right job. Despite how much I enjoy working in Perl, I don't think it's the answer to every problem. However, if you did want to use the Perl route, you could use it to drive an HTML-based app. You end up installing a mini-website with local storage, etc, on the iPhone. Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is in O'Reilly's Open Feedback Publishing System, so you could see how to do that for free. Perl might be a tiny, server-side component of that.
