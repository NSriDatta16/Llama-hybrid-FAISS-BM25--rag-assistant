TCP Event Monitor in .NET

I have a SysTray application that needs to know when a browser runs into an Internet TImeout/Connection Not Found/etc... error. At the port level, this could be anything from network is unusable to network not found, etc... I do NOT need to see every TCP packet flowing across the network but I do need to know about TCP/Port/WinSock (whichever works) events flowing across all ports. Ideally, I would avoid WinPCAP as this is a distributable software product and people tend to dislike WinPCAP on their computers. I am using .NET 4.0 Full - can somebody please point me in the right direction?
