How to add a folder with multiple libs and a folder with multiple headers into your project with Qt?

So my problem is next: I need to connect to my project Boost, FFMpeg, OpenCV and OpenAL. I have putted all .lib files for tham into some C://libs/ and headers and additional source into C://headers/ and C://src/ so I have this 3 folders I will need to cnnect to my project... I am so very new to qt and I am starting to read books on it and stuff but by now I have not found info on connectimg additional libs and source folders for projects... And If you happen to know how to do what I am asking fore I have one more question - I have a folder called C://dlls/ with dlls I need to be placed into folder with .exe file how to add such to .pro file? I found something like unix:LIBS += -L/usr/lib -lboost_regex win32:LIBS +=C:/Qt/2010.02.1/qt/lib/libboost_regex.lib but here they connect a file - not folder and only a lib - no headers=(
