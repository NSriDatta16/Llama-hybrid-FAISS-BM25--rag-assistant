I would think that should be packed[j] = ... , not packed[i] . And as chrisaycock notes, you can just write the whole packed array, you don't need a loop: write(openWriteFile, packed, sizeof packed); And you should avoid all those literals ... you have 3 instances of 7, one instance of 8, and one instance of 6, when you should have a single defined constant and use that + or - 1 as appropriate. Also jCount is uninitialized. EDIT: Here's some code without those problems: #define PACKEDSIZE 7 // Why 7? unsigned char packed[PACKEDSIZE]; //compression storage int i, jCount = 0; int j = 0; int bufferLength = sizeof(unpacked)/* /sizeof(char) ... not needed because sizeof(char) is 1 in all conforming implementations */; //loop through the buffer array for( i = 0; i
