I'm usually a fan of transforming data to Normality (see here , here , and here ). However in this case I +1 @Peter Flom's comment on rather than fitting the data to the model, choose an appropriate model for the data. In particular, the help page ?Decathlon says that the data was filtered for Totalpoints >= 6800 , i.e., you observe a sample from a truncated distribution (the right tail), not the full marginal distribution. That means a) a continuous transform won't be able to deal with this truncation elegantly (you have a built-in discontinuity at $T = 6800$ ) and b) w/o knowing too much about what type of ANOVA inference you want to do, most likely a plain vanilla ANOVA will be severely biased / invalid given the truncated nature of your data. FWIW some interesting patterns emerge when you look at how athletes perform over time. This might also be relevant for your analysis. # 'Rafael Cardoso Pinto' appears twice in 2004. Must be a data error. Using first appearance as unique value. data_wide = reshape(Decathlon[, c("DecathleteName", "yearEvent", "Totalpoints")], idvar = "DecathleteName", timevar = "yearEvent", direction = "wide") row_names dim(data_wide) [1] 2709 22 That is the dataset contains a total of 2,709 athletes across 22 years (1985 - 2006). A heatmap is useful to visualize any patterns: library(superheat) superheat::superheat(t(data_wide), heat.na.col = "white") And interestingly enough, a couple of common-sense patterns clearly emerge here: as I mentioned above, the data is truncated at $>=6,800$ (dark blue) athletes that perform bad in their first year (dark) tend to not compete again in the future if athletes don't perform too bad in their first year, they tend to return they typically stay around for a couple of years until they drop out again (too old to compete) some athletes show clear improvements over time (vertical spikes that start green and turn into light-green / yellow as time increases) This is actually quite an interesting dataset to work with and lots of questions arise by just looking at this plot (e.g., forecast performance of athlete $i$ for years that they will compete in future; impute missing values when athletes were missing a particular year -- maybe NMF? --).
