I have spoken on this at a different forum the ASA Statistical Consulting eGroup. My response was more specifically to data mining but the two go hand in hand. We statisticians have snubbed our noses at data miners, computer scientists, and engineers. It is wrong. I think part of the reason it happens is because we see some people in those fields ignoring the stochastic nature of their problem. Some statisticians call data mining data snooping or data fishing. Some people do abuse and misuse the methods but statisticians have fallen behind in data mining and machine learning because we paint them with a broad brush. Some of the big statistical results have come from outside the field of statistics. Boosting is one important example. But statisticians like Breiman, Friedman, Hastie, Tibshirani, Efron, Gelman and others got it and their leadership has brought statisticians into the analysis of microarrays and other large scale inference problems. So while the cultures may never mesh there is now more cooperation and collaboration between the computer scientists, engineers and statisticians.
