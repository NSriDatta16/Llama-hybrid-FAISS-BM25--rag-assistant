Well there are three things as i see it with this question : 1) In your derivation when your taking the variance of the terms inside Rho should get squared and you should end up with the expression .. i didnt consider the auto covariance earlier ..sorry about that $$ Var(\overline{x}) = \frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}{N} \frac{1}{1 - \rho^2} + \sum\limits_{t=0}^{N-1}\sum\limits_{t\neq j}^{N-1}\frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}{N^2} \frac{1}{1 - \rho^2}\rho^{|j-t|}$$ 2) In your code you have calculated the variance of xbar ... for the standard error the code should include taking the sqrt of the answer given 3) You have assumed that the white noise has been generated from a (0,1) distribution when in fact the white noise only has to have constant variance .. i dont know what values of the constant variance R uses to generate the time series ... perhaps you could check on that .. Hope this helps you :)
