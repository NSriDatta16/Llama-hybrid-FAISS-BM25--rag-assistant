You need to use A\\B\\C (as in most languages, in AS a string literal with an unescaped \ creates an escape sequence by combining with the next character). I have a feeling that you are not generating the dynamic string properly. If the string is supposed to be a path then it should contain a separate \ character in between path fragments by escaping the backslash using \\ .
