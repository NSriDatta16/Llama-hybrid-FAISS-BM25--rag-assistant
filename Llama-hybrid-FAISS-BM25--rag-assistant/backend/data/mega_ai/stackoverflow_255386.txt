@ Simon made a lot of excellent points, I'll just add a few and re-iterate/emphasize some others: Use the right datatype for the Timestamps - make sure the DBMS has the appropriate precision. Consider queueing for the capture of events, allowing for multiple threads/processes to handle the actual storage of the events. Separate the schemas for your transactional and data warehouse Seriously consider a periodic ETL from transactional db to the data warehouse. Remember that you probably won't have 50 transactions/second 24x7x365 - peak transactions vs. average transactions Investigate partitioning tables in the DBMS. Oracle and MSSQL will both partition on a value (like date/time). Have an archiving/data retention policy from the outset. Too many projects just start recording data with no plans in place to remove/archive it.
