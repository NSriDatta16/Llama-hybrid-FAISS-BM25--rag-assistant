Information used for prior updating

Suppose that we have the following model $logit(p[i])=a_{0}+a_{1}x_{i}$ with $i=1,2$ and $x_{0}=0 ,x_{1}=1$ and we want to use bayesian inference so we have to use priors for $a_{0},a_{1}$ And we are given the information that $p[1]\simeq =0.5$.So my idea in order to plug this information in bayesian inference is the following: $$logit(p[1])=a_{0}\Rightarrow \frac{p[1]}{1-p[1]}=a_{0}=1$$ So if $a_{0}$ had for prior a Normal distribution ,with the previous knowledge now will be $a_{0}\sim norm(1,\sigma^2)$ Is my assumption correct ??
