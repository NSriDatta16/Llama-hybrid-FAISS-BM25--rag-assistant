How can I detect blocks of text from scanned document images

ORIGINAL IMAGE: GOAL: I want to separate texts into individual paragraphs by placing bounding boxes over them (as shown above). I tried it do this via traditional computer vision approach using opencv. I plotted character level bounding box Next, I gray-scaled the image, binarized it. Applied dilation And finally placed bbox over the dilated image. This is what I get: > #Morphological Transformation kernel = np.ones((3,4),np.int8) dilation = cv2.dilate(im_bw, kernel) cv2.imwrite('dilated.png', dilation) Plotting rectangular box ret,thresh = cv2.threshold(im_bw, 127,255,0) image, contours,hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh,cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL,cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE ) for c in contours: rect = cv2.boundingRect(c) if rect[2] Since the image is scanned image plus the line-spaces between them are small I couldn't able to segment them based on paragraphs. How can I get my desired result?
