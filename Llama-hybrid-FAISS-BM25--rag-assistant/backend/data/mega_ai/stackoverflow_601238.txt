From Firebug Tutorial - Logging, Profiling and CommandLine (Part II) : (the examples there are good) Columns and Description of Profiler Function column : It show the name of each function. Call column : It shows the count of how many a particular function has been invoked. Percent column : It shows the time consuming of each function in percentage. Time column : It shows the duration of execution from start point of a function to the end point of a function. Avg column : It shows the average execution time of a particular function. If you are calling a function one time only, you wonâ€™t see the differences. If you are calling more than one time, you will see the differences. The formula for that column is Avg = Own Ttime / Call; Min column and Max column : It shows the minimum execution time of a particular function. File column : the file name of file where the function located.
