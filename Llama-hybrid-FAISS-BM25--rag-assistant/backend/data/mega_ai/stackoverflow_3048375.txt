Opera Browser: prevent mousewheel scrolling?

I just buit a website that works good on any browser even ipad but in Opera I noticed a weird thing: The website is built with a div layer on top z-index:999, body is overflow:hidden, and you can't scroll, but underneath the div there is a long text that goes way underneath the viewport... The strage thing is that even if in any browser I was able to keep this effect, in Opera if I use the mousewheel you can keep scrolling...! ...argh.. do you know any hack/solution for this?
