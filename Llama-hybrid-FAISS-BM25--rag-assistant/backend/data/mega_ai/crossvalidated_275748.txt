S.O.S Beginner in Data Science and Needs Guidance

I hope I'm in the right place to post my first query here, and to to be brief, I'm an electrical engineering student, working on a task of "Monitoring electrical machines through Partial Discharge data using an AI technique" but I'm struggling in all directions, what AI technique to use - I'm planning to use ANNs but still need your advice -, which one works best with my problem (continuous electrical signal - voltag, pressure, tempreture ...- as inputs, and decision making - state of the system, mean time to failure, as output (classification, forcasting) What to use, Matlab (which i'm familiar with), or Python. GPU and Cloud computing Now, what's more important for me, where to get some practical example for solving problems like mine in (matlab or/and Python) I admit that my question may not be well formatted, but still hope to get some guidance thanks for all
