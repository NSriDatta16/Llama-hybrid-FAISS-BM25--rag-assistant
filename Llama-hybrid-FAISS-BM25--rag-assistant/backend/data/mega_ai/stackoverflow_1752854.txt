Partcover and Typemock integration

I was wondering if someone has some ideas about how to integrate typemock and partcover. We have unit tests which use typemock in our c# sharepoint based application and we would like to run them via partcover and be able to see the coverage details. I have been able to run the typemock tests via partcover, however, partcover is not able to display the coveraged details for the code that was tested? The way I have gotten the tests to run via partcover is to make Partcover run the Typemock runner which in turn runs MSTest. My partcover browser settings are as follows: ExecutableFile: *Path to typemock*\TMockRunner.exe Working Directory: *A folder that already exists* Working Arguments: *Path to MSTest*\MSTest.exe /noisolation /testcontainer:*Path to DLL* Any ideas would be great especially on how partcover retrieves coverage details. Thanks.
