The GD image library in PHP is fast, but this comes down to the question of which is more of concern on your system: CPU or storage? Resizing from a single image is light on storage but heavy on CPU. If you don't have a vast number of images or traffic, it could make for a small backup archive. On the other hand if storage is not a problem (and it shouldn't be these days) you can easily do what Ã“lafur Waage or Andre Miller suggest and store them separately.
