What is the point of using MissingIndicator in Scikit-learn?

I have recently discovered Sklearn's MissingIndicator but still wondering how could it improve the usual machine learning work. Clear that from sklearn.impute import MissingIndicator indicator = MissingIndicator() X_mask = indicator.fit_transform(X) could result in X_mask as boolean indicator array of missing values in original X . But how could it be utilized actually beyond that it keeps track where imputed values are? I know that flagging NAs in a separate column per features could be useful for learners but here X_mask is not combined with the imputed X so this is seemingly not the point. Similar question arises with putting MissingIndicator in the ML pipeline: transformer = FeatureUnion( transformer_list=[ ('features', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')), ('indicators', MissingIndicator())]) What is the point to add the pure mask array to the imputed array here?
