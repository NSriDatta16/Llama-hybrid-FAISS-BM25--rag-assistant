scale_pos_weight using XGBoost's Learning API

I see it is possible to add a weight for unbalanced problems in XGBoost's Scikit-Learn API through scale_pos_weight . Does it have an equivalent in the Learning API ? If not, is there a reason behind this? Could this corrective factor/weight also be somehow implemented using the learning API?
