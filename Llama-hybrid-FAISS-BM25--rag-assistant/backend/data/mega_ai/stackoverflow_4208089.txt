Why is ASP.NET forms authentication setting cookies on a static image request?

I have an ASP.NET (MVC) website that is serving static content (images) as well as dynamic content from the same domain. The site uses forms auth, and has a login controller. There have been some very strange / irregular issues with people finding themselves logged in or out at random intervals, and we've tracked it down to an issue with a reverse proxy caching an image file that has a set-cookie response header that sets the auth cookie. Once this is cached, everyone then gets the same auth cookie, which leads to some very weird outcomes. My question is - how on earth would an image get a set-cookie header in the first place? What is the ASP.NET forms authentication module doing to cause this - surely it sets the cookie on the main HTML content response. I get that the auth cookie is then sent with all subsequent requests to the domain, but I cannot figure out how the cookie is set in the first place. (BTW this issue may also be the culprit in at least two existing large ecommerce sites that are suffering from similar problems, with no solution, so it would be a good one to solve). The response is shown below (taken from fiddler). HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400,max-age=86400 Content-Type: image/png Last-Modified: Thu, 04 Nov 2010 16:00:52 GMT Accept-Ranges: bytes ETag: "0528474397ccb1:0" Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 Set-Cookie: my-auth-cookie=6BC25F1EF71989466A48C0120E7739E; path=/; HttpOnly Date: Wed, 17 Nov 2010 17:15:08 GMT Content-Length: 15790 Update: additional info - we are using IIS 7.5 on Win2008 R2, 64bit, and the app is running under an app pool that is using the integrated pipeline / .net 4. Update 2: I am not looking for a solution to the problem, we have one already. I am looking for an answer to the question, which is why it happened in the first place? Please don't answer telling me about subdomains or how cookies work! Update 3: adding in the request: GET https://www.example.com/sprite.png HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com Connection: keep-alive Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache Accept: application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.44 Safari/534.7 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 Cookie: my-auth-cookie=6BC25F1EF71989466A48C0120E7739E;
