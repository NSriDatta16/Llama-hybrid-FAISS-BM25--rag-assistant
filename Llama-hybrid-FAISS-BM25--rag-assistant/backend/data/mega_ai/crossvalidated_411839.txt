The formula interface for regression functions in R would allow you to automatically generate n-way interactions very simply. Unfortunately this results in a combinatoric explosion. You could take your original code and simply add what might appear to be an exponentiation operator but in reality is an interaction constructor.: multicox That's going to result in 5 one way terms and 10 2-way terms. 30 cases is not sufficient for this task. You might get away with 300 for the 2 way case, but the 4-way proposal you ask for would be impossible with this approach. You could even eliminate the one-way terms with: multicox I think some sort of penalized tree structured approach with dimensional reduction strategies like principal components or random forest would be possibly useful. I suspect you could find additional methods by searching on supervised classification, perhaps in that section of https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Multivariate.html You might also want to consider Bayesian networks. There is an R package "bnstruct" for analysis of networks that looks interesting although I have no experience with it. (It's on my TODO list.). There's also a "bnlearn" package that has been used to investigate gene networks in cancer cohorts . I suspect again that this would not be feasible for datasets of size only 30. Again suspect a need for sample sizes in the +300 range. BioConductor package: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/coexnet/inst/doc/coexnet.pdf
