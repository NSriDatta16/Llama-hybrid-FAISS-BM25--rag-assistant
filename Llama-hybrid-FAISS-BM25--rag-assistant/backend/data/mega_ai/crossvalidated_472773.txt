Best ML method/algorithm for prediction of varying data?

As the title says, I'm looking for a Machine Learning method/algorithm that can help me predict a dataset in the future. I only have about 100 data points and would like to predict as far in the future as I can , being...say..less than 20% off from the actual data. e.g. if the data in the future is 100, then my prediction should be from somewhere from 80 to 120. Of course, This data is daily, so as you can imagine, it varies quite a lot. e.g. one day the datapoint is ~ 180 and the next it's ~ 1200. I don't think there will be a very accurate method for this kind of data, but I have to try. I have multiple other datasets that are [closely]/[almost directly] related to this dataset. I would like to use those datasets to maybe try and have a closer prediction, if there is such a method. Another thing, I am a newcomer to machine learning, and tried my best to think of ways to predict the data. I thought of neural networks, but realized it wouldn't even apply to the problem. For now, I just have a basic polynomial regression model. Basically fitting a curve to the data and looking at the curve to predict what the data will be, which seems quite basic and..not accurate.
