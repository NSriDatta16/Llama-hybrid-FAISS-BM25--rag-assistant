The answer might be given in even simpler terms: the multiple regression has one step more than the pca if seen in terms of linear algebra, and from the second step the instability comes into existence: The first step of pca and mult. regression can be seen as factoring of the correlation-matrix $R$ into two cholesky factors $L \cdot L^t$ , which are triangular -and which is indifferent to low or high correlations. (The pca can then be seen as a rotation of that (triangular) cholesky-factor to pc-position (this is called Jacobi-rotation as far as I remember) The mult. regression procedure is the to apply an inversion of that cholesky factor $L$ minus the row and column of the dependent variable, which is conveniently in the last row of the correlation-matrix. The instability comes into play here: if the independent variables are highly correlated, then the diagonal of the cholesky factor $L$ can degenerate to very small numeric values - and to invert that introduces then the problem of division by nearly-zero.
