A couple of things. First, as @Xi'an points out, flat priors are not non-informative, as all priors contain some specification analogous to some type of information (see @Xi'an's previous answer here for more information). Second (and in light of the first point), I cannot think of a good reason why doing a sensitivity analysis is not a good idea. Sure, as $n \rightarrow \infty$ , the impact of the prior on the likelihood diminishes. However, even with an absurdly large sample, I would still conduct a sensitivity analysis and place it in an Appendix. Finally, for more information on the use of priors in mplus , I recommend MacCallum, Edwards, & Cai (2012) and Smid & Winter (2020). References MacCallum, R. C., Edwards, M. C., & Cai, L. (2012). Hopes and cautions in implementing Bayesian structural equation modeling. Smid, S. C., & Winter, S. D. (2020).
