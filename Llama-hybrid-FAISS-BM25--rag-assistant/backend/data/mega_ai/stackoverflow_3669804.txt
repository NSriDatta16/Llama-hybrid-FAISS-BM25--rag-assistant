Measuring NSString lines, words, etc

I am trying to calculate the closest text position in a string (text of UITextView) from a CGPoint. I wonder if some methods in NSString are useful for this? I would appreciate a good explanation of the following methods. Because I think they are useful here. I read the docs but I don't really understand what they do ;( NSString instance methods: – getLineStart:end:contentsEnd:forRange: – lineRangeForRange: – getParagraphStart:end:contentsEnd:forRange: – paragraphRangeForRange: Thanks in advance
