How to prove that new data fits old PCA

I have an old dataset, for which i perform PCA, show its significance (non-randomness). Now I have new data (obtained in a bit different conditions). And I want to say that independently from different conditions I may still have the same principal components. I perform PCA for joined dataset and obtain very similar (but not equal) loadings. I have a first idea just to map new data on old PCs and prove, that PCs explain sufficient amount of variance. The main problem here - I do not understand how to calculate explained variance for mapped data. Usually I use just output from function. Second idea to sample observations and plot histograms for loadings. Then I will show, that they are similar, but I have no ideas how to compare these histograms numerically. Do You have better ideas?
