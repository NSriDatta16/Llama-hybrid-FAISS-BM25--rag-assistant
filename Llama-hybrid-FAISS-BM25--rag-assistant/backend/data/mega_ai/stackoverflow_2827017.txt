Update frequency Cache invalidation is a hard problem, see: Cache Invalidation - Is there a General Solution? As far as I can see, you need to decide how often you want search bots to recrawl your site, rather than how often things are actually changed; if a user's page may contain information they want to remove at short notice, then you want the search bot to re-crawl within a couple of days, even though profiles are changed rarely on average. Keeping an up-to-date map Since the speed of your website now figures in its Google PageRank, it's worth updating a static file ready to serve up to the spiders. Perhaps have one script that continually updates a db table with sitemap entries, and another that periodically regenerates the static file(s) from the db table. That way, there is always a static version available for the spiders and it can all happen asynchronously. Static pages on App Engine I forgot that you can't have static page files on App Engine. According to this SO question , the best way is to use generate your file and push it to memcache. Also see the documentation on using memcache with App Engine
