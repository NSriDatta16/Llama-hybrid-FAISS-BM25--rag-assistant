The wikipedia page is always a good place to start. I've also found what appear to be a couple sets of course notes on the subject meant to serve as an introduction to statistical quality control: A gentle introduction to the subject that was used as a chapter for a course at the "Center for Innovation in Mathematics in Teaching" is here . Another pretty gentle introduction to the subject, but there appears to be much more content here with more advanced topics in the later part of the notes than in the first link. These appear to be notes used for an introductory course in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research taught by Prof. Robert C. Leachman - IEOR 130 - at the University of California at Berkeley is here . Some nice general notes on statistical process control with R examples that were used as lecture notes for an Applied Statistics course taught by A. Di Bucchianico at Technische Universiteit Eindhoven in the Netherlands are here . There are also a couple of other more application specific resources: Some notes on statistical quality control in the context of optimizing software inspection A paper about statistical quality control in the context of clinical trials These were some resources I was able to find quickly so there's probably much more out there if you search things like 'statistical quality control tutorial' or possible replacing the word 'tutorial' with 'course' or 'notes'.
