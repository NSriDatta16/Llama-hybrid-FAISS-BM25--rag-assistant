Instead of (a) you also see practitioners using a multinomial logit (rather than ordered logit) for the first step. In (b) you would typically censor the distribution rather than truncate it. Also, I wouldn't use a distribution for discrete data but a distribution for continuous data, e.g., a normal distribution (censored at both 0 and 1). Additionally, there are other similar extensions like the "ordered beta regression" proposed by Robert Kubinec in Political Analysis , see: doi:10.1017/pan.2022.20 .
