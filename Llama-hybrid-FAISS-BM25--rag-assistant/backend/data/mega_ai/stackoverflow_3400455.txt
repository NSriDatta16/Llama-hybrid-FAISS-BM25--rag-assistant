Actually if you've already organized everything into layouts, then you might be able to just bind the top level layout container(s) width and height to the scene.width and scene.height. I don't think top level layout controls are managed by anything, so you may be safe just setting width and height of the layout control directly. If that doesn't work then you might have success binding the layoutInfo width and height. Ideally you want to use layout management before resorting to binds. Excessive binds can be a performance problem, and can lead to slow redraws as you are resizing. In this case you can probably just use binds for the top level container, and then all of the children of the top level container should resize accordingly. At least I think that should work.
