Any difference in regression models can be reduced to differences in the latent model (e.g., linear vs. exponential), regularizer (e.g., $L^p$ norm), and loss function. So you can have subtle differences by keeping some of these three parameters fixed while modifying the rest. My understanding of a BI trend line is that it assumes an affine latent model without saying anything about the regularizer or loss function (though I'd assume it's the MSE unless stated otherwise). In the data science world, you should also state what loss function and regularizer you used if you want to be clear.
