Simple, Custom Parsing with c++

I have been reading SO for some time now, but I truly cannot find any help for my problem. I have a c++ assignment to create an IAS Simulator. Here is some sample code... 0 1 a 1 2 b 2 c 3 1 10 begin 11 . load a, subtract b and offset by -1 for jump+ 11 load M(0) 12 sub M(1) 13 sub M(3) 14 halt Using c++, I need to be able to read these lines and store them in a "memory register" class that I already have constructed... For example, the first line would need to store "1 a" in register zero. How can I parse out the number at the line beginning and then store the rest as a string? I have setup storage using a class that is called using mem.set(int, string); . int is the memory location at the beginning of the line and string is the stored instruction. Edit: Some Clarifications: I must use standard libraries the grammar for the input file is here: http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~seker/courses/2150/iascode.pdf The loader will overwrite duplicate line entries. That means the first line 11 in the sample will be overwritten by the second.
