How to control the cost of misclassification in Random Forests?

Is it possible to control the cost of misclassification in the R package randomForest ? In my own work false negatives (e.g., missing in error that a person may have a disease) are far more costly than false positives. The package rpart allows the user to control misclassification costs by specifying a loss matrix to weight misclassifications differently. Does anything similar exist for randomForest ? Should I, for instance, use the classwt option to control the Gini criterion?
