When can the lower bound of a confidence interval be used?

I'm performing analysis on the data found in the NHANES package in R. One of the vectors describes the estimated number of days that participants drank alcoholic beverages. I want to classify them as Alcohol_Disorder/No_Acohol_Disorder. The 95% confidence interval is (65.30, 72.36). I feel compelled to subtract each number by 15 and THEN classify based on whether the new number is greater than 416 (drinks 8 drinks per week). Thoughts? How does my thinking sound?
