Your current mechanism is very fragile - it won't work for signed assemblies (as the hash will change) or if you need to replace one resource with a larger one (as all the other offsets may move). It also has issues in terms of character encodings and the general mechanism to find the right point in the file anyway, but those are relatively unimportant given that I don't think the approach is appropriate to start with. If you need replaceable resources, I'd put them in a different file altogether, which doesn't have the relatively delicate format of an assembly.
