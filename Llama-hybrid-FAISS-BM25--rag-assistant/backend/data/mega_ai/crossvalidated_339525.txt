Yes, although there are some possible issues of heteroscedasticity. You might consider some suitable transformation of the outcome, like a log which is useful for modeling concentrations. You can also use a generalize linear mixed model. Probit and logit models with a binomial link can be used to model "S"-shaped curves that relate exposure to your outcomes (the %s) and take the variance to be the mean * (1-mean). Non-linear least squares can also be used, a common thing in pharmacokinetic studies. This is an approach one might take. Knowing more about the design can help others answer this more intelligently. It depends on power, design, and model accuracy. If you fit a fixed or random effect for ligand, you account for their mean differences. Whether there are interactions between ligand and other factors can be tested. Otherwise, I don't know what effect you mean.
