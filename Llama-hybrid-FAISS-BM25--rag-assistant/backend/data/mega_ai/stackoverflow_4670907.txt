Set the title of Navigation Bar created in Interface Builder

I have a modal view controller whose view comes from a XIB. I want it to have the same look and feel as the rest of my navigation based app, but it's not a view that's pushed to the navigation stack, it's presented modally. I dragged a UINavigationBar in and made it an outlet, but it doesn't have a title property to set. I have two fields that can bring up this modal view, and I want the title set differently depending on which one creates the modal view.
