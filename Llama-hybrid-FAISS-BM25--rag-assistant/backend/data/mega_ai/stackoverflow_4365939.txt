Unicode named Folder shows ? in wscript prompt

I am facing problems with Unicode named folders. When I drag the folder to the script, it doesn't show the path of the folder properly. Simple VBScript (this is just a portion of it): Dim Wshso : Set Wshso = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell") Dim FSO : Set FSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") If WScript.Arguments.Count = 1 Then If FSO.FileExists(Wscript.Arguments.Item(0)) = true and FSO.FolderExists(Wscript.Arguments.Item(0)) = false Then Alert "You dragged a file, not a folder! My god." & vbcrlf & "Script will terminate immediately", 0, "Alert: User is stupid", 48 WScript.Quit Else targetDir = WScript.Arguments.Item(0) Wshso.Popup targetDir End If Else targetDir = Wshso.SpecialFolders("Desktop") Alert "Note: No folder to traverse detected, default set to:" & vbcrlf & Wshso.SpecialFolders("Desktop"), 0, "Alert", 48 End If If it is a normal path without Unicode characters, it's fine. But in this case: Directory: 4minute (포미닛) - Hit Your Heart Then it will show something like 4minute (?) - Hit Your Heart And if I do a FolderExists it can't find the dragged folder. Is there any workaround to support Unicode named Folders? Thanks! I'll edit if this is not clear enough
