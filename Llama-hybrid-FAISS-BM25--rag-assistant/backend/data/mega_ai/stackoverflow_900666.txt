System() calls in C++ and their roles in programming

I've often heard that using system("PAUSE") is bad practice and to use std::cin.get() instead. Now my understanding of system calls is that they take a string which they enter into a system command line and talk with the OS, so PAUSE is a DOS command that pauses the output in the command window. I assume this works similarly with Mac and unix with different keywords, and using system calls is discouraged because of a lack of cross OS compatibility. (If I'm wrong with any of this, please correct me) my question is this: When is it appropriate to use system() calls? How should they be applied? When should they NOT be applied?
