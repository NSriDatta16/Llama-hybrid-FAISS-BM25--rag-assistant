There is a major problem of imbalance in your dataset, the classes are in the ratio 15:85. Also the data is lesser, but firstly you will have to address the problem of imbalance. That is probably the root cause of the underfitting of your data. Tweaking some parameters might give you better results, but I dont think you will experience any significant improvement until you address the formerly mentioned isssue. Edit : I mainly use CNNs for text classification, and in experience have always found it performing at par or better than RNNs.
