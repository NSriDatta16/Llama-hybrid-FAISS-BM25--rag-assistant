Arithmetic using summary means of the MCMC chains, differ from when I do the arithmetic directly using each row of the MCMC chains

I am trying to calculate the 'absolute risk difference' and 'needed to treat' (NNT). NNT is 1/(absolute risk difference) where the absolute risk difference is just the rate of an event in one intervention minus the rate of an event in another intervention. I have the rates of the events in two interventions calculated in MCMC chains. Based on the MCMC summaries: the mean rate of events in intervention1 is 0.13 and the mean rate of events in intervention2 is 0.17. If I manually calculate the absolute risk difference using these summary numbers written above I get 0.17 - 0.13 = 0.04 which makes sense. If I mannually calculate the absolute risk difference using the 4 chains (excuse my noob coding below) I get the same answer which again makes sense. # the absolute risk diffeence is the difference between the rate of # intervention1 and intervention2 RD However, when I go to calculate NNT based on the same absolute event rates calculated above, I get unexpected summary statistics and I'm not sure which ones to go with. Calculating NNT based on the mean event rate numbers above I get 1/(0.17-13) which = 1/0.04 which =23 and sounds about right in the context of the absolute event rates. However when I calculate NNT using the 4 chains I get a dramatically different answer, and this answer does not seem to align with what we would expect based on the absolute risk difference. # 1 over the absolute risk difference NNT
