How to express the form of a Logistic Regression when a categorical predictor has more than 2 levels

Like let's say my predictor X has four levels, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Fitting a logistic regression will generate estimates of $\beta$ for x = 2, x = 3, and x = 4, and I understand that each of these estimates reflects the odds ratio of that level of x to the reference level of x = 1. My question is, how do I express that model in a general form? I don't think this is correct: $\log\frac{\pi(x)}{1-\pi(x)}=\beta_0+\beta_1x + \beta_2x+\beta_3x$ ...because this would imply that I could set different values for each x, which I cannot. I'm not allowed to do x=2 AND x=3, for example. But then this ALSO seems incorrect: $\log\frac{\pi(x)}{1-\pi(x)}=\beta_0+\beta x$ ...because I have multiple slopes here, not just a single $\beta$ . So how do I actually write this formula?
