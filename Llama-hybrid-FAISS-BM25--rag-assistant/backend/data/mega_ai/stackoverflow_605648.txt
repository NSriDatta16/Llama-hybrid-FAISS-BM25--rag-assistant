Database Network Latency

I am currently working on an n-tier system and battling some database performance issues. One area we have been investigating is the latency between the database server and the application server. In our test environment the average ping times between the two boxes is in the region of 0.2ms however on the clients site its more in the region of 8.2 ms. Is that somthing we should be worried about? For your average system what do you guys consider a resonable latency and how would you go about testing/measuring the latency?
