Posting as an answer as too long for a comment: The reason you're seeing the central limit theorem crop up here is because your returns at each time point are independent. I think what you want to do and what you're saying you want to do aren't quite the same. If you simply had a time series of distributions that you wanted to match, then you could use the method Dupire used in order to determine the local volatility surface. This allows you do create a function \hat{\sigma}(S_t,t) such that the diffusion process: $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{S} = \mu(t) \mathrm{d}t + \hat{\sigma}(S_t,t)\mathrm{d}W_t$$ produces a probability distribution as a function of time that matches your requirement. The above is simply the Local Volatility model, which sits on top of GBM and has $\mathrm{d}W_t$ distributed normally. What you're looking to do is essentially the same, but with an added twist - you're augmenting the returns. This will meaningfully change the maths, and mean much of the derivations won't apply, but that doesn't really matter, as you can just back solve. What you're essentially looking to do is the following: $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{S} = \mu(t) \mathrm{d}t + \hat{\sigma}(S_t,t|\bar{x})f(\mathrm{d}W_t)$$ or $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{S} = \mu(t) \mathrm{d}t + \hat{\sigma}(S_t,t|\bar{x})\mathrm{d}\tilde{W}_t$$ where $f(\mathrm{d}{W}_t) = \mathrm{d}\tilde{W}_t \nsim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ , where $\hat{\sigma}(S_t,t|\bar{x})$ is your local volatility for your given formulation of $f$ , and $\bar{x}$ are you volatility model parameters. IMO, as soon as you start moving into this realm, then the maths gets very difficult, and it's easier to instead just write your montecarlo code and then throw the whole thing through a solver to obtain some fit params for your local volatility formulation.
