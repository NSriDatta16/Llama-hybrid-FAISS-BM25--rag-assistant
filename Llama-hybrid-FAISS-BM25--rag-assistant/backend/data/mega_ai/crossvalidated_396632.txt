When to include a variable as a mediator or a predictor

I'm trying to understand the different models for investigating a variable of interest (mindfulness facets) against an outcome variable (anxiety). I notice that there are two possible ways for me to investigate this but I'm having trouble understanding why you would choose one model over the other, or what the difference is in what these models would tell me about the mindfulness facets? For example if I want to find out more about the relationship between specific facets of trait mindfulness (such as 'Acting with Awareness') and Anxiety. What are the reasons for; including mindfulness as the mediator between known predictors of anxiety (such as Dysfunctional beliefs, as the IV) and anxiety (as the DV)? 'dysfunctional beliefs' ----> 'trait mindfulness' -------> anxiety including trait mindfulness as the predictor and anxiety as the outcome variable? 'trait mindfulness' -------> anxiety including 'dysfunctional beliefs' as the mediator between trait mindfulness and anxiety? 'trait mindfulness'------> 'dysfunctional beliefs' -------> anxiety My supervisor is encouraging me to undertake the first example, with 'trait mindfulness' as the mediator, as he argues that mindfulness in this example explains the process by which 'dysfunctional beliefs' result in 'anxiety' - however my understanding is that the mediation model suggests a causal relationship and my argument here would be that low trait mindfulness causes 'dysfunctional beliefs' which result in 'anxiety', not that dysfunctional beliefs cause trait mindfulness.. Alternatively is mediation not the right way to be thinking about this problem?
