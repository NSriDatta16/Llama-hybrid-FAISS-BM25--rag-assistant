One relevant area is principal components analysis. It only applies if $f$ is linear, but from what you say this is the case. The first principal component might be just what you want. @whuber asks good questions in his comments. You need to think through at some point what statistical variation there is in $S$ and how to incorporate that into your model when you look at different candidates for $f$, but I suspect something along the lines of PCA and the literature around it will get you in the right direction.
