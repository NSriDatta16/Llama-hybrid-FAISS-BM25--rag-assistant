Recommendations for dropdown menu items that are too wide?

What kinds of options do I have when a dropdown menu is faced with text that is so wide that extending the menu's width to accommodate is not feasible? i.e. It breaks the page layout, or just looks too ugly if the dropdown is adjusted to fit the long item. Truncation? Truncation plus full hover text? Don't allow items that long? Anyone encountered any elegant solutions to this? Thanks.
