Although theoretically the DTBOOK markup (for the text content) can be styled with CSS in supporting web-browsers, or even dynamically transformed with XSLT, in reality it is common practice to transform the DTBOOK to plain old HTML when opening the DAISY book. There's a standalone XSLT transformer available as part of the DAISY Pipeline open-source production tool: http://data.daisy.org/projects/pipeline/doc/scripts/DTBookToXhtml.html Cheers, Dan
