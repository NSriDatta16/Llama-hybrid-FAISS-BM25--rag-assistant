it may depend upon whether you are using MyISAM or InnoDB tables, but i would run the OPTIMIZE after truncating the table. This should ensure space is reclaimed and it will run very quickly. When you insert your batch of data it should all insert in order and not be fragmented anyway, and since it's a fresh insert there will be no space to reclaim. If it's a small dataset it may not matter too much, but on a large dataset doing the OPTIMIZE after the insert could also be quite slow.
