Upgrade database from SQL Server 2005 to 2008 â€” and rebuild full-text indexes?

I upgraded from Sql Server 2005 to Sql Server 2008. I backed up the data in SQL Server 2005, and then I restored in SQL Server 2008. Next, I found the catalog under "Storage->Full Text Catalogs", and I right-clicked on it, and am trying to rebuild the Full-Text Catalog. The database is only 600mb. However, it keeps running for hours, and never semes to finish.
