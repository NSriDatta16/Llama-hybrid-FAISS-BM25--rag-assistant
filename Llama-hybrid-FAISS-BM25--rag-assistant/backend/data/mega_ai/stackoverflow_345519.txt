If you right-click on the table in the designer and choose properties, the Delete, Insert and Update are grayed out. I am not sure if you can supply alternate Delete, Insert and Update methods... But if your question is about inserting, updating and deleting values in your tables, once you drag a table onto your dbml designer you are able to insert, update and delete using linq in your code. There is nothing else that needs to be done to the dbml.
