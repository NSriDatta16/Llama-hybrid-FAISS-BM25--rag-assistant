I solved a similar problem by applying the changes as described in https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/changeset/3081/trunk/opencv/modules/imgproc/src/segmentation.cpp I recreated the dll file by creating the openCV.sln project as described in http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/VisualC%2B%2B_VS2010_CMake The last parameter should indeed be different from 0 as well.
