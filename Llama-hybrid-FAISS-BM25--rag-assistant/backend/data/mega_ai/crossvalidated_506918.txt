logistic regression and linear regression have the same output

I have a dataset that contains 20000 chess matches. Using two variables from this dataset, I created one logistic regression and one linear regression. the first variable was whitewon: has 1 for every match white won and zero for every match black won. The second one was turns: the number of moves played in the match. The two models I created from these variables have the same output. How is that possible?
