Your problem is that gtkmozembed.h is not found in the standard include file lookup path (well, the error does tell you that pretty obviously). On my system it lives in $(include)/gtkmozembed/ , so you have two options Change the path of the included file in your source #include or manually add the path to the lookup path gcc `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-2.0` -I/usr/include/gtkmozembed test.c -o test You should go with option 1). This will tell gcc where to find the include file, but as pointed out by Matthew this is not enough: you will most probably also need to add more information for linking and required additional includes. Thankfully gtk-mozembed comes with a pkg-config file, so you can get all the needed information like you did for gtk+-2.0 with pkg-config --libs --cflags mozilla-gtkmozembed-embedding or combined with the other call gcc `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-2.0 mozilla-gtkmozembed-embedding` test.c -o test You should also (just for kicks) have a look at what pkg-config does. The part in "`" is just what is return by the shell when executing that command. On my machine: $ pkg-config --libs --cflags mozilla-gtkmozembed-embedding -DXPCOM_GLUE -fshort-wchar \ -I/usr/include/xulrunner-1.9.2 -L/usr/lib/xulrunner-devel-1.9.2/lib -lxpcomglue (line breaks added by me). The -I parts just adds additional needed directories to the include file lookup path -- they were emitted because you called with --cflags . The entries with -lxpcomglue is due to calling with --libs and ask for linking against this library, i.e. libxpcomglue.so . It is located in /usr/lib/xulrunner-devel-1.9.2/lib . The rest are a define and a gcc flag needed for gtkmozembed.
