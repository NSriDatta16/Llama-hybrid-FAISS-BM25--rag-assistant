Can random forest detect squared terms?

In Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models Kuhn and Johnson mention (chapter 7) that random forest can be used to detect interaction between variables, e.g. x1*x2. My question is. Can random forest be used to detect squared terms x1^2. If so, how would you do that?
