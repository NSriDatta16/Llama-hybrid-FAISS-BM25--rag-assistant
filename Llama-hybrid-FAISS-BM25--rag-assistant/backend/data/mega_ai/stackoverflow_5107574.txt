Suggestions for Organizing Project Collections and Team Projects

Our company has decided to start using Team Foundation Server 2010 for our development process. I am having trouble deciding on how to structure our Collections and Team Projects. We have a total of 9 developers, all working on different projects at different times. It seems like half of what I read says to use as many collections as you want, while the other half says to limit the number of collections. What is your approach when creating/managing several projects that don't necessarily interact with each other? Is it best to put stuff in separate collections or is it wise to keep the number of your collections low? Any help is appreciated.
