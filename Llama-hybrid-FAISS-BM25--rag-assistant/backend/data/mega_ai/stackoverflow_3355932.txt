Why are you using user agents instead of just feature detection? I presume you are looking for geolocation capabilities on the client, so why not simply check that: function isGeolocationSupported() { return !!navigator.geolocation; } See the GeoLocation API spec and a HTML5 site with more examples. Also, I wouldn't add jQuery for this very feature as even 24K is a lot for mobile devices. You can use the Selectors API to query the text inside the span elements using: var links = document.querySelectorAll("a.main"); for(var i = 0; i Here's the same without the Selectors API. var canQueryByClass = 'getElementsByClassName' in document; var canQueryByTag = 'getElementsByTagName' in document; if(!(canQueryByClass && canQueryByTag)) { // hopeless client, no need to check further. } var links = document.getElementsByClassName("main"); for(var i = 0; i See a working example . â€‹
