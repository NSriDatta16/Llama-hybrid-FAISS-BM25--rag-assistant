The effectiveness of features in your data depends on the "information gain" from that feature. The more the information gain, the better is the feature for your classification. I'm not exactly sure whether SVMs support such a technique to evaluate features, but you can look for the Decision Tree classification method. It calculates the entropy of the features, which then helps in calculating the information gain. From those calculations, you can easily find out which feature is effective to classify the test data.
