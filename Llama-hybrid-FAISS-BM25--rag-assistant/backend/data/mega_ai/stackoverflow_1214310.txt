If you cannot write tests for everything the next best thing I would suggest is measuring your coverage using some coverage tools like cobertura . This will atleast ensure you are covering most of your code using some black box testing. Measuring coverage is very important when the code base grows otherwise it will be impossible to keep track of how good your test suite is.
