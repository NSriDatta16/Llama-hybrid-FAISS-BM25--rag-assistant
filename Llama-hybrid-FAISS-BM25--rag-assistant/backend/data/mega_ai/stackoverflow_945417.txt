Why not just take the heat on backing up the whole directory once and take advantage of the incremental backing up provided by rsync and rdiff and its cousins, you won't waste diskspace where they are backed up to because they'll be perpetually unchanged. Backing up the whole thing is simpler, and has substantially less risk for errors. Trying to selectively backup some files and not others is a recipe for not backing up what you need without realizing it, then getting burned when you can't restore a critical file. Otherwise you should reorganize your source directory so there is less 'decision making' in your backup script.
