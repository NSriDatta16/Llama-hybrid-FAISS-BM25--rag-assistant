Elegant solution to multiple select inputs?

Multi-part problem here that's been bugging me for ages. I'm somewhat of an amateur FYI and you can see the live site here: http://artsparkcc.com/enroll.html As you can see the site is an enrollment form for parents entering their kids in art classes. It works fine but a lot of parents have been complaining that they would like to enroll in multiple classes at once. Currently the form uses the CGI email script to email the form vars directly to the admins through a text file template. I'm having a hard time coming up with a lightweight solution. I've checked for some jquery multiple-select plugins but none of them work nice with my CGI email setup and I currently don't have the time to rewrite the whole page just for multiple selects. Parents need to be able to enroll in as many or as few classes as possible, and the input result needs to be able to cleanly be sent to the admins for recording. I thought about just making them all a big minefield of checkboxes but it looks ugly as sin and I'd like to keep the selects. Any ideas? Thank you in advance.
