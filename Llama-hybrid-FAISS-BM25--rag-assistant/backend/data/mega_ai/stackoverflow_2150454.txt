I realize this is not exactly what you asked for but just want to tell you about my setup because I think it's not practical to continue to sync the dev database to production once you go live. You're probably going to want to make changes to your dev database for testing which are not always easy to revert. Building your content (products, etc) in the live environment and occasionally copying the database back to development I find works very well. For my project I have built my live environment by installing Magento from scratch and just checked out the directories from SVN at these points: /app/code/local/MyOrg /app/design/frontend/default/myorg /skin/frontend/default/myorg Any customizations you make should be in one of these directories. I manage this directory manually on the live server: /app/etc/modules You only need to create a file there if you create a new module yourself.
