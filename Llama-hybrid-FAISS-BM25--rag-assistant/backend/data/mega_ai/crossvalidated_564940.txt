Logistic regression vs. ordinal logistic regression, which one to use?

I am quite puzzled by the logistic regression results with three outcome categories (0,1,2) ; 0 is no feelings, 1 is slightly happy, 2 is extremely happy . I tried both (1) logistic regression and ordered the outcome (2) using ordinal logistic regression through MASS::polr The summary from (1) looks like this: Call: glm(formula = FeelingOutcome ~ Dosage + Age + factor(Sex.x) + factor(Race.x) + TestPeriod, family = binomial, data = TestSet, na.action = "na.exclude") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7767 -1.1058 0.6135 1.0088 2.0481 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.457e+01 1.455e+03 0.010 0.9920 Dosage -1.981e+00 8.145e-01 -2.433 0.0150 * Age 4.434e-02 2.494e-02 1.778 0.0755 . factor(Sex.x)Male 6.504e-01 4.544e-01 1.431 0.1523 factor(Race.x)Black -1.670e+01 1.455e+03 -0.011 0.9908 factor(Race.x)White -1.513e+01 1.455e+03 -0.010 0.9917 TestPeriod -1.413e-04 1.319e-04 -1.072 0.2839 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 146.34 on 105 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 130.71 on 99 degrees of freedom (2 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 144.71 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 14 The statistics showed moderate significance of Dosage association with Feeling Outcome. However, when I use ordinal logistic regression, the strange number showed: TestORdinalLR ctable Value Std. Error t value p value Dosage -1.270935e+00 0.0948121344 -13.4047742 5.669557e-41 Age 3.844785e-02 0.0138925651 2.7675126 5.648587e-03 factor(Sex.x)Male 1.799269e-01 0.3784498549 0.4754313 6.344796e-01 factor(Race.x)Black -1.670944e+01 0.3947162775 -42.3327766 0.000000e+00 factor(Race.x)White -1.536035e+01 0.4342894383 -35.3689268 5.131513e-274 TestPeriod -4.578557e-05 0.0003773869 -0.1213226 9.034355e-01 0|1 -1.432219e+01 0.0395987756 -361.6826279 0.000000e+00 1|2 -1.365826e+01 0.1579986481 -86.4454177 0.000000e+00 I saw a whopping p-value change from 0.0150 to 5.669557e-41 . Intuitively, I know I should use ordinal logistic regression, but from the results, the logistic regression seems more realistic? Here's the data distribution (I flipped the x and y for visualization):
