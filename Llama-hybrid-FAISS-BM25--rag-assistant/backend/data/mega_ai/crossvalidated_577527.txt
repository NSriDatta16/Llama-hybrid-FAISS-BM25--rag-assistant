I wish I could find a more formal reference for this, but it makes sense to me to apply a logit transformation to your response variable (logit(x) = ln(1 / (1 - x)) to produce a response variable that's akin to the link in logistic regression. Then, can fit with ordinary least squares. Bear in mind, this will only be valid for response values greater than zero and less than 1. The interpretation of the coefficients will be similar to how you interpret coefficients of a logistic regression. You could transform them to log-odds if you prefer, or you can evaluate their effect on the untransformed response given a baseline value of the link function. This approach will allow variables with positive coefficients to never produce a response value >= 1, but rather "squeeze" the prediction closer and closer to 1. Vice versa for negative coefficients and zero. Again, wish I had a better reference. Would be very interested to see if there is more formal guidance on this, and if OLS is valid on the transformed response variable, or if there's some sort of MLE approach that's better.
