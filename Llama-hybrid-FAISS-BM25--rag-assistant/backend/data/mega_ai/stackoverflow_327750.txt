Once you get into MVC, it can be worthwhile to explore patterns beyond the "Gang of Four" book, and get into Martin Fowler's " Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture ." The Registry pattern can be useful to make well-known objects available throughout the object hierarchy. Essentially a substitute for using global data. Many MVC frameworks also employ the Front Controller and the Two-Step View patterns. The "Model" in MVC is best designed as the Domain Model pattern, although some frameworks (led by Rails) conflate the Model with the ActiveRecord pattern. I often advise that the relationship between a Model and ActiveRecord should be HAS-A, instead of IS-A. Also read about ModelViewController at the Portland Pattern Repository wiki. There is some good discussion about MVC, object-orientation, and other patterns that complement MVC, such as Observer .
