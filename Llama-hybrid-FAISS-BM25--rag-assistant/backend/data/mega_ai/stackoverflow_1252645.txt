I'll take a look at trying that. I've also tried to implement the IStorage interface into an IDataObject interface using unmanaged code and still aren't having any luck. (The Interface is also used to get Outlook messages that are dragged and dropped and works fine.) That format is most definatly one of the formats i get back from calling e.Data.GetFormats(); I'll take a look at that link. Thanks
