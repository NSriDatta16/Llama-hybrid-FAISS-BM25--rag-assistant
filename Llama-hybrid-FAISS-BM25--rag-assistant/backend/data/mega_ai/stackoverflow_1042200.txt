NGen and Gacutil best practices

I've been working on a WinForms application which has about 5 referenced assemblies - written by us, and about 8 referenced assemblies by third parties (we wont be hoping to update them in the future unless something goes terribly wrong - Infragistics/DevExpress components!). Our startup times are a little too high on cold boots, what I'm wondering is whether adding them to the Gac and ngen'ing them is the way to go. When we're installing into the NGen cache, does it need to be in the gac too? Whats the connection between the two? Which should I be aiming for? We have one exe, I'd do an ILMerge but I'm not sure that will work in our scenario - long story. Also, is it possible to get how much memory my exe is taking - much like the Java applications do (like Netbeans!)
