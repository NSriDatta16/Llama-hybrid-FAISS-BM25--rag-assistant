I'm not exactly sure how to do this properly in Access, but here is an idea of making sure that there is always at least one row in the result set: SELECT * FROM Test WHERE role >=101 AND division IN (1,2,4) UNION SELECT 1 as ID, 1 as division, 'Dummy' as Name, 100 as role FROM Dual UNION SELECT 1 as ID, 2 as division, 'Dummy' as Name, 100 as role FROM Dual UNION SELECT 1 as ID, 4 as division, 'Dummy' as Name, 100 as role FROM Dual (Basically, this statement adds a Dummy record for each division. Dual is a dummy Oracle Table with just one record. I'm sure that there is a more elegant way of adding the records in the union, but I hope that the idea comes across.) Then, run you count(ID) group by division on this recordset (may be a temporary query), and subtract the dummy record from the count (so the select clause would be SELECT division, count(ID)-1
