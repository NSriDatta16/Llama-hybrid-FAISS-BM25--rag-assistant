Any value to a programmer to understand the CPU in more depth?

It recently occurred to me that I (and I think most people) learned computer programming starting with something like Visual Basic. I began to wonder if we had started at the lower level first if it would be easier now. Do you think it is any value as a programmer to understand things like how a CPU works, the basic instructions, and things like that? I mean after all aren't we really talking to it in the end? If we started at the CPU level and taught from there up we might find that we can understand how to manipulate it at a high level easier.
