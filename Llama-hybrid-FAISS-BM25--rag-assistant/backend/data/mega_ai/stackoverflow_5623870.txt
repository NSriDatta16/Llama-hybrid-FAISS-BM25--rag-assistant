1901-12-12T05:00:00Z for example I can't test it right now, but DateTime 's constructor may be able to accept your format without needing createFromFormat . I can't really tell from the documentation. Try try { $date = new DateTime('1901-12-12T05:00:00Z'); } catch (Exception $e) { echo "Arggh! ".$e->getMessage(); die(); } echo $date->format('Y-m-d H:i:s'); and see what happens, paying special attention to whether it understands the Z properly (i.e. makes it a UTC time). DateTime uses 64 bit numbers internally on any system, and has no range limitations. As said, from 5.3 on, you will be able to use createFromFormat which can parse any date expressed by one of date() 's placeholders. This is the optimal way, because you force it to parse a specific pattern, instead of guessing it.
