Instead of using tags, you can use any element with the id attribute: Content Skip to content EDIT, found you a source (albeit it's Wikipedia ;-)): Alternatively (and sometimes concurrently), with the name or id attributes set, the element becomes a target. A Uniform Resource Locator can link to this target via a fragment identifier. Any element can now be made into an anchor by using the id attribute,[2] so using is not necessary. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Anchor
