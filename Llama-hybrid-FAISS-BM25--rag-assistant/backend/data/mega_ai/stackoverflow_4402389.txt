I don't know a whole lot of theory about parsers, so forgive me if this doesn't fit the bill, but there is Ragel. Ragel generates state machines. It's (perhaps most famously?) used by the Mongrel HTTP server for Ruby to parse HTTP requests. Ragel targets plain C (amongst others), but all of the state machine data is either static const or stack allocated, so that should alleviate some important concerns with C++ exceptions. If special exception handling is required, Ragel doesn't shy away from exposing its internals. (Not as complex as it may sound.) Unicode should be possible, because input is an array of any basic type, usually char , but probably short or int in your case. If that doesn't do, you can even replace the array iteration with your own mechanism for getting the next input item/token/event.
