How do I move a Web References from one project to another in VS2010?

I'm doing some solution housecleaning and want to move a few web references from one project to another. VS2010 will not let me drag/drop them from one project to another. What is the easiest way to move them? If it matters these are old-style asmx web services, not WCF services.
