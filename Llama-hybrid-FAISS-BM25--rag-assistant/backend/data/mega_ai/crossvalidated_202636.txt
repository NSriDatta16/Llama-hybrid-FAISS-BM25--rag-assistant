Sampling from Posterior without MCMC

I want to sample from the posterior density $f(x \mid y)$ which is related to the prior density $f(x)$ and likelihood density $f(y \mid x)$ via Bayes' rule: $$ f(x \mid y) = \frac{f(y \mid x) f(x)}{c} $$ where $c$ is a normalizer. Let's say both the prior and likelihood are very simple and I can sample from them directly using standard techniques, e.g. Gaussian. Specifically, say $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma_1^2)$ and $Y \mid X = x \sim \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma_2^2)$. I can then sample from $f(x)$ directly, and given this sample can obtain a sample from $f(y \mid x)$ as well. Is there some method to use these samples to obtain a sample from $f(x \mid y)$? As I understand, MCMC would be used if the posterior is "difficult" to sample from, but it seems it should be easy in this case.
