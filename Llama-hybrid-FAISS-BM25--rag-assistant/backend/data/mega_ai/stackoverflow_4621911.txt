Need to implement an image selection dialog of web-based images

I am developing a chatting/messaging app and I want to let the user select an image that they've stored online (i.e. picasa, photobucket, flickr, etc) which will be shown as part of the chat User Interface for anyone that is chatting with the user. For example: User_A is messaging/chatting with User_B. User_B will see a small thumbnail image of User_A User_A will see a small thumbnail of User_B. note: my web server is facilitating the text exchange between the two users. At first I thought I would implement a photo upload function in my app and store the photo's on my server that each client would download. But then I realized that this is just re-inventing the wheel because there are now a lot of online picture sharing services. So I want my server to simply store the URL of the images that User_A and User_B have selected - my app is notified of the URL's and downloads the pictures. However, how is this implemented ? (Specifically, the image selection to obtain the URL in a userfriendly manner) I've visualized the following userfriendly use-case... user opens the options activity in my app and pushes the button to select an image to present in the chat UI. an intent dialog is shown with all of the possible image hosting services installed on the mobile phone (picasa, photobucket, etc) - but local storage shall not be shown. the image picker of the chosen application is shown and the user chooses the image. the image picker closes and returns the URL to my app. If this can't be implemented, then my only alternative (that I know of) is to have users copy'n'paste the URL of the image they want to use - which is not userfriendly on mobile devices. Any help is greatly appreciated.
