Why does using ASP.NET OutputCache keep returning a 200 OK, not a 304 Not Modified?

i have a simple aspx page. Here's the top of it:- Now, every time I hit the page in FireFox (either hit F5 or hit enter in the url bar) I keep getting a 200 OK response. Here's a sample reply from FireBug :- Request Headers:- GET /sitemap.xml HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost.foo.com.au User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-au,en-gb;q=0.7,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Cookie: If-Modified-Since: Tue, 01 Jun 2010 07:35:17 GMT If-None-Match: "" Cache-Control: max-age=0 Response Headers:- HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: public Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Expires: Tue, 01 Jun 2010 08:35:17 GMT Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Jun 2010 07:35:17 GMT Etag: "" Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 X-Powered-By: UrlRewriter.NET 2.0.0 X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319 Date: Tue, 01 Jun 2010 07:35:20 GMT Content-Length: 775 Firebug Cache tab:- Last Modified Tue Jun 01 2010 17:35:20 GMT+1000 (AUS Eastern Standard Time) Last Fetched Tue Jun 01 2010 17:35:20 GMT+1000 (AUS Eastern Standard Time) Expires Tue Jun 01 2010 18:35:17 GMT+1000 (AUS Eastern Standard Time) Data Size 775 Fetch Count 105 Device disk Now, if i try it in Fiddler using the Request Builder (and no extra data) I also keep getting the same 200 OK reply. Request Headers:- GET http://localhost.foo.com.au/sitemap.xml HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Fiddler Host: foo.com.au Response Headers:- HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: public Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Expires: Tue, 01 Jun 2010 07:58:00 GMT Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Jun 2010 06:58:00 GMT ETag: "" Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 X-Powered-By: UrlRewriter.NET 2.0.0 X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319 Date: Tue, 01 Jun 2010 06:59:16 GMT Content-Length: 775 It looks like it's asking to cache it but it's not :( Server is a localhost IIS7.5 on Win7. (as listed in the Response data). Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong?
