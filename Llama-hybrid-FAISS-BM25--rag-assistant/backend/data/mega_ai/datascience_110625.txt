What you describe is feature engineering, or specifically handcrafting feature. Specifically, sequence detection is the indeed the term for crafting features like "team X lost their last 5 games". If you think about it, you get sequential data if you order transaction data by time. Basket and association rule analysis are classical methods which study this kind of problem. Modern deep learning domain would point you to the class of sequential models e.g. RNN and LSTM.
