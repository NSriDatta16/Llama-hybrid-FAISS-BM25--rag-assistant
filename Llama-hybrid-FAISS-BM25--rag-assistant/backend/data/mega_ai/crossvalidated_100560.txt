Is linear kernel SVM performance between features indicative of RBF kernel SVM performance?

I have feature set 1 and feature set 2. If a linear kernel SVM performs better ("better" meaning greater classification accuracy) when using feature set 1, does this guarantee that a properly tuned rbf kernel SVM will also perform better using feature set 1? Thanks for the help.
