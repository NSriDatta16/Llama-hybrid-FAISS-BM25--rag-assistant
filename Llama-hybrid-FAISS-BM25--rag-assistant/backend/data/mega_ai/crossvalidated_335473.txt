For a convex function it does not matter where to start. The objective function for linear regression using squared loss or least absolute difference loss are convex functions. For non-convex functions, such as neural network, where to start matters a lot. Because even with infinite computing power and time, the gradient decent approach can still stuck with local minima or saddle point . There are many work to discuss how to initialize neural network weights.
