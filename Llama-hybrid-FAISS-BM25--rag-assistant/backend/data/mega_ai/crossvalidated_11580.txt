What is nonparametric logistic regression based on locally weighted scatterplot smoothing?

Recently, I read an article regarding the association between age and lymph node metastases . The authors stated that: "Because a nonlinear relationship between age and lymph node involvement was expected based on existing literature, lymph node involvement was also regressed on age using nonparametric logistic regression based on locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (lowess)." Could someone explain what is nonparametric logistic regression based on locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (lowess)?
