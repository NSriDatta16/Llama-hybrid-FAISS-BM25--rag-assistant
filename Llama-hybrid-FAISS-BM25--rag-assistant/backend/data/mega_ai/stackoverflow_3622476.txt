A list of C habits not to carry over into Perl 5: Don't declare your variables at the top of the program/function. Declare them as they are needed. Don't assign empty lists to arrays and hashes when declaring them (they are empty already and need to be initialized). Don't use if (!(complex logical statement)) {} , that is what unless is for. Don't use goto to break deeply nested loops, next , last , and redo all take a loop label as an argument. Don't use global variables (this is a general rule even for C, but I have found a lot of C people like to use global variables). Don't create a function where a closure will do (callbacks in particular). See perldoc perlsub and perldoc perlref for more information. Don't use in/out returns, return multiple values instead. Things to do in Perl 5: Always use the strict and warnings pragmas. Read the documentation ( perldoc perl and perldoc -f function_name ). Use hashes the way you used structs in C.
