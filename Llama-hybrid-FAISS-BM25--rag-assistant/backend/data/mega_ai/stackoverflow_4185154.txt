This statement by JoaoPSF is incorrect: (and SVN isn't good at making/storing diffs of binary files, it saves the entire new version of the file) See this quote from How does Subversion handle binary files : Note that whether or not a file is binary does not affect the amount of repository space used to store changes to that file, nor does it affect the amount of traffic between client and server. For storage and transmission purposes, Subversion uses a diffing method that works equally well on binary and text files; this is completely unrelated to the diffing method used by the svn diff command.
