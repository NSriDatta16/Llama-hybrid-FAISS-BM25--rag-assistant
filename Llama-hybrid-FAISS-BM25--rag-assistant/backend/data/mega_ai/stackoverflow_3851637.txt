UITapGestureRecognizer Stops touchesEnded

I'm trying to make an iPhone app that is controlled by touch. I also want a powerup to be activated when the user double-taps. Here's what I have so far: UITapGestureRecognizer *powerRecognizer = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(usePower)]; powerRecognizer.delaysTouchesEnded = NO; powerRecognizer.numberOfTapsRequired = 2; powerRecognizer.numberOfTouchesRequired = 1; [self.view addGestureRecognizer:powerRecognizer]; [powerRecognizer release]; But the problem is, when I double-tap, my touchesEnded:withEvent: method only fires once, but my touchesBegan:withEvent: method fires twice. Since touchesBegan: sets a timer and touchesEnded: invalidates it, then when touchesEnded: only fires once, the timer is still running. How can I fix this?
