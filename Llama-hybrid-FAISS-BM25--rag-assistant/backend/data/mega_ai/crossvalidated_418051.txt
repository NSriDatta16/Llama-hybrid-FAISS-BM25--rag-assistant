What you are describing is a multivariate logistic regression , NOT a multiple logistic regression. Note that by convention: multivariate implies >1 dependent/target variable multiple implies >1 independent/predictor variable and only 1 dependent/target variable This important difference is frequently confused, so be careful when you read papers using the terms. Also note that if the 5 properties (i.e. dependent variables) are uncorrelated, you will not benefit from a multivariate analysis; you might as well use 5 separate logistic regressions in this case.
