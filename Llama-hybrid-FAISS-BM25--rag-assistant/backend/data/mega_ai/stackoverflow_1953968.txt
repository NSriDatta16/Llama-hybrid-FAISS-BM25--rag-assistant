I'm not 100% sure what it is you are trying to do, but I think I can supply a few code fragments that may help you. This will cycle through the sheets in an active workbook and allow you to do something based on whether or not the sheet is visible: j = ActiveWorkbook.Sheets.Count For i = 1 To j Select Case Sheets(i).Visible Case xlSheetVisible 'Do something if the sheet is visible Case Else 'Do something when the sheet is not visible End Select Next i To get the next available row there are many different ways. One of the easiest is simply this: next_row = Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).row + 1 This assumes that column A will always have a value in any data rows. If this is not the case you may want to try this: next_row = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count + 1 Neither is bullet proof, but it should at least give you a start.
