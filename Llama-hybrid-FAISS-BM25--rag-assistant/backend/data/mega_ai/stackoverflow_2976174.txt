Organizing Lots of Data in Search Results

I'm working on a pretty basic web app (not much more than CRUD stuff). However, the requirements call for a bunch of data to be displayed with each item in the search results - IDs, dates, email addresses, long descriptions... too much to fit neatly into a simple grid, and too dissimilar to make them flow together (like the natural language example from this article .) Is there a design pattern for attractively displaying many descriptive fields with each search result? (Please don't tell me to just remove some fields from the results; that's not an option for this project.)
