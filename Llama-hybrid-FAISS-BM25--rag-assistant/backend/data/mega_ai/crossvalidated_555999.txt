Idea or reference for sample size calculation

I have a question about sample size calculations under the Bayesian setting, and would like either some ideas/suggestions, or reference papers that might help. In general, my problem is as follows. I have a population of computer parts of which some proportion of the parts will be defective. I would like, say, for no more than 1% of the parts to be defective. Here, I consider a part to be defective if the corresponding measured value $X$ > 10. Now, if I have, say, 1,000,000 of these computer parts then I could test 99% of them to see if the defect rate is higher than 1% (which I don't want to do). However, I want to only test a subset of the parts to be able to make the "no more than 1% defective parts claim" with some level of certainty. Now, I would like to approach this problem from the Bayesian point-of-view, and assume that the distribution of measurements $X$ follows some distribution (say, Normal( $\mu$ , $\sigma^2$ )) and associated prior $p(\mu,\sigma^2)$ . Under the Bayesian paradigm how does one proceed with sample size estimation for this scenario? I.e., how do I choose a sample size such that I have some level of certainty that the $Pr(X>10) , for example. Also, I don't want to treat the variable as binary since I do have continuous measurements $X$ that I can leverage.
