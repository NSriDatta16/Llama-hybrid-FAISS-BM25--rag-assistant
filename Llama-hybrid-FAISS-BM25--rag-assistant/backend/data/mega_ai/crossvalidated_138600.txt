R power.prop.test and power equation in the difference between proportions

I am looking into the formula built into the R function power.prop.test{stats} and I am stuck trying to understand the following calculation: p.body Shouldn't sqrt((p1 + p2) * (1 - (p1 + p2)/2)) ($\sqrt{(p_1 + p_2) (1 - \frac{p_1 + p_2}{2}))}$) really be sqrt((p1 + p2)/2 * (1 - (p1 + p2)/2)) ($\sqrt{\frac{p_1 + p_2}{2} (1 - \frac{p_1 + p_2}{2})}$) since we seem to be trying to be working with the average of proportions and multiplying complements?
