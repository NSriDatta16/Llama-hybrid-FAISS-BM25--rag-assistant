If data has no noise can a neural network achieve 100% accuracy?

If you have a function that you want a neural network to learn, and you have sufficient examples of data with the right coverage, and there is no noise in the data, then is it reasonable to expect to achieve a (nearly) zero error rate, i.e. 100% accuracy, with a neural network?
