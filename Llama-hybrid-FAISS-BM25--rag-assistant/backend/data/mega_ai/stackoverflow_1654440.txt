It may depend on how many people are editing the code and for what purpose. In my own code (which is nevertheless for public view) I may feel free to add some personal comments, perhaps using 'I'. In a communal project the comments should aim at a communal style and 'I' may be out of place. Note that comments are fragile and many modern authorities (e.g. Clean Code) suggest that functions and fields should carry meaningful names. But, of course, there are many places where explanatory comments are still vital.
