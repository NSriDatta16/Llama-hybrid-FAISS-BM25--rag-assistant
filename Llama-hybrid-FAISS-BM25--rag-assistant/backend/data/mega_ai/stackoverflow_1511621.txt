Where can I find a Lisp reader in C?

I have a Lisp reader written in Java that I'm thinking of translating into C. (Or perhaps C++.) It's a fairly complete and useful hack, so the main issue is doing the dynamic-storage allocation in a language without garbage collection. If someone has already thought this through I'd rather borrow their code than figure it out myself. (C is not my favorite language.) Of course, having a Lisp reader makes no sense unless you're planning to do something with the things you read, so perhaps I should have phrased the question, Where do I find a simple Lisp core written in C?, but in my experience the hardest unavoidable part of writing a Lisp (somewhat surprisingly) is the reader. Plus, I don't want to have a garbage collector; I'm anticipating an application where the list structures will be freed more or less by hand.
