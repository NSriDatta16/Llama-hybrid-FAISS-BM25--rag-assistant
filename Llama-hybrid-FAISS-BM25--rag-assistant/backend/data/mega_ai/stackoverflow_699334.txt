How do I get rid of mid spaces in an environment variable

How do I get rid of mid spaces in an environment variable? Suppose I have the following for loop fragment that get the free disk space size of a certain disk. for /f "tokens=3" %%i in ('dir ^| find "Dir(s)"') do set size=%%i would result something like this C:\>set size=129,028,096 I would like to get rid of delimeters as follows. for /f "delims=," %%i in ('echo %size%') do set size=%%i and resulted something like this set size=129 028 096 How can I get it with no mid spaces or delimiters with native tools?
