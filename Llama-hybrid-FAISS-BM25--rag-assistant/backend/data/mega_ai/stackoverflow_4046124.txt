When you "delete" memory, you are basically returning the allocated memory back to the heap. This just means that the data structure used to organize heap memory is updated to indicate that the memory is now available to use. It is not cleared out or anything like that. You are accessing memory that still exists, but belongs to the operating system at this point. This is undefined behavior. EDIT: And by the way, a seg fault occurs when you try to read memory from a segment that you do not have read permissions for. In a flat memory model this probably means you tried to read memory in kernel space; probably because you dereferenced a bad pointer.
