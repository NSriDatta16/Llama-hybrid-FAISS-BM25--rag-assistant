I'm not sure if I understand correctly the reasons why you ruled out PCA, but a possible approach would be to use a dimension reduction technique on each group of variables, maybe including their interaction $Z$ if it makes sense. Then, use the dimensions of each group as features in your regression model. As you mention categorical variables with more than two values, instead of PCA I'd suggest to use multiple correspondence analysis as a dimension reduction method, as it is designed specifically to work with categorical data. Another approach would be to just model interactions, without using dimension reduction at all. However, modeling all possible interactions doesn't seem to be a good idea (I mention that, as you say in a comment "There are many other ways to define a $Z$ , and that's what I am looking for"). Anyway, with all possible interactions, your dimensionality issue would still be there. Keeping only the interactions and omitting the main effects is probably not appropriate to solve this dimensionality problem. Edit following your comment : including all possible interactions in your model and applying stepwise regression on it (in order to keep only the significant interactions) would lead to the same problems associated to stepwise regression. Unfortunately, as you mention, dimension reduction (MCA, PCA) could make your model lose a good part of its predictive power. In your place, I'd simply try to model interactions based on domain knowledge -but I guess this is a problem to you as your initial question is about not having to model these interactions "by hand".
