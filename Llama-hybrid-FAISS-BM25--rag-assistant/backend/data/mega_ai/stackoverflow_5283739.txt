This is an aspect that was not covered by previous HTTP specifications but has been addressed in the later HTTP development : If the server returns a response code of 300 ("multiple choice"), 301 ("moved permanently"), 302 ("moved temporarily") or 303 ("see other"), and if the server also returns one or more URIs where the resource can be found, then the client SHOULD treat the new URIs as if the fragment identifier of the original URI was added at the end. The exception is when a returned URI already has a fragment identifier. In that case the original fragment identifier MUST NOT be not added to it. So the fragment of the original URI should also be used for the redirection URI unless it also contains a fragment. Although this was just a draft that expired in 2000, it seems that the behavior as described above is the de-facto standard behavior among todays web browsers. @Julian Reschke or @Mark Nottingham probably know more/better about this.
