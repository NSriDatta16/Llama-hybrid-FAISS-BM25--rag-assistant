T-Testing, test if one average exceeds another at the 5% level

I struggle with following question: It is now considered that house prices are rising again following the recent slump. Given that in 2008 the average price of a standard 3 bedroom house was €215,000. A sample of 25 similar houses in 2013 gave an average price of €275,000 with a standard deviation of €50,000. Test to determine if the average price for the houses in 2013 exceeds the average price in 2008 at the 5% level. Yes\No answer only, will receive zero marks. NOTE: NO dataset is provided. This is an assignment question which of course I don't want you to do it all for me!! I'm bit confused as can't figure out what equation/formula to use. As reference I'm using my slides notes and Statistics boook (James McClave, 2014) 12th edition. I'm using this formula: http://www.nursingplanet.com/biostatistics/inferential_statistics_t-test.html Student t-testing calculating t-statistic for comparing means. Any help hints/tips would be appreciated! Thanks!
