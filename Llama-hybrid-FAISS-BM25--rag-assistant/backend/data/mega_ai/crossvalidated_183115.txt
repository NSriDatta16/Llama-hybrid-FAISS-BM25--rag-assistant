The posterior beliefs about the parameters are represented by the posterior distribution $\pi(\theta|\mathfrak{D})$ if $\mathfrak{D}$ denotes the data. This is a distribution conditional or dependent on the data. Since this distribution is too complex to envision as such, we use simulation techniques to understand it. For instance, MCMC simulation produces an outcome $(\theta^{(t)})_t$ that is approximately distributed from $\pi(\theta|\mathfrak{D})$ and with correlated entries. They are therefore dependent . Hence the answer to your question is that the approximation technique creates dependence, but the posterior beliefs themselves are not associated with any sort of dependence, except on the data $\mathfrak{D}$. It is important to distinguish the inference part from the simulation part as they partake of fundamentally different concepts.
