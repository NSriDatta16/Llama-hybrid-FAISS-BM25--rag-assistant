Does PCA create new features or give weights to old ones?

I know that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the eigenvector of the covariance matrix. It is used as a tool for dimensional reduction. What I am confused about is whether the PCA give weights to original features in order to find out which features explain the data the most or does it come up with new set of abstract features that explain the greatest variance in the data set.
