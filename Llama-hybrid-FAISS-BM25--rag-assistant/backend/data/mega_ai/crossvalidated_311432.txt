You have what is called repeated-measures , which is typically modeled using mixed-model s. I'd encourage you to look through questions carrying these two tags and maybe look at some textbooks. In your specific case, you have a binary response, so a mixed logistic regression would be appropriate. In R, you can use the lme4 package for this. Alternatively, you could use ML tools like CARTs or Random Forests, including the ID for each observation as a feature. The question then is whether you want to classify a response from a new user or from one that you have seen in your training data. In the first case, your ID feature would contain a previously unobserved value, and your ML tool might choke on this. Mixed models can deal gracefully with such a situation.
