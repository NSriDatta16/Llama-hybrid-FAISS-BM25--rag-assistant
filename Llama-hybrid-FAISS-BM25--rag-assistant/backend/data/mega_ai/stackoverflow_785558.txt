As others said, option #1 is better as naming follows how one would use those concepts in a sentence without sounding weird. However, I think you should also pay attention the business domain that you're modeling to name your variables. A concept may be referred to with a very unique name or terminology in a particular business domain that would not sound right when used in a sentence out of that business domain. If this is the case, then I would go with the terminology that the business domain is using so that the code is expressed in business domain terminology. This helps developers getting familiar with the business domain and also makes communications with clients easier as everyone speaks the same language. For example, in this particular case, if I notice that the business documents and cliens are using due amount instead of amount due in referring to a payment expected, I would go with due amount.
