You need to convert the images to PNG with proper alpha transparency as WPF does not provide color key transparency functions without resorting to WritableBitmaps or custom BitmapSources. This application can convert your bmps to proper transparent PNGs by selecting the Magenta color key: http://transparentpng.codeplex.com/releases/view/54303
