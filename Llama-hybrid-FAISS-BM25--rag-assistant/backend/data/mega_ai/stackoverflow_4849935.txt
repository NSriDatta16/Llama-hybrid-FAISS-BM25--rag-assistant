What is the right Java collection to use in this case?

I need to hold a large number of elements (500k or so) in a list or a set I need to do high performance traversal, addition and removal. This will be done in a multithreaded environment and I don't care if I gets to see the updates done after traversal began (weakly consistent), what Java collection is right for this scenario?
