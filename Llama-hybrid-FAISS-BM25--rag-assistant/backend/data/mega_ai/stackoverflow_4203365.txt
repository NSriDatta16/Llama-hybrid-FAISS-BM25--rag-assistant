Visual Studio 2010 vs Visual Studio 2005 for C++

My department writes a mixture of Windows, Linux and cross platform (RHEL Linx and Windows Server 2003) C++ code for in house applications. We use the STL and Boost 1.39. VS2010 is now available in my organisation. If we were to move to VS2010 I'd have to make a significant business case for it. What would some of the most noticable benefits we would see from the move? Do you think it would be worth the time cost to move? Update Given the size of our code base and the cross platform nature of our code, I'm mainly interested in what the new IDE offers, e.g. how good is the intellisense (say, compared to VS for .net). Does the intellisense work well for very large code bases? What's the refactoring support like? How is raw IDE performance? What is the debugger like, i.e. if I hover over a pointer to a collection of smart pointers is it relatively easy to see what's in the collection? Thanks in advance
