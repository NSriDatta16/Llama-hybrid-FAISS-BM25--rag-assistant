Relying on settings.DEBUG is the most elegant way AFAICS as it is also used in Django code base on occasion. I suppose what you really want is a way to set that flag automatically without needing you update it manually everytime you upload the project to production servers. For that I check the path of settings.py (in settings.py) to determine what server the project is running on: if __file__ == "path to settings.py in my development machine": DEBUG = True elif __file__ in [paths of production servers]: DEBUG = False else: raise WhereTheHellIsThisServedException() Mind you, you might also prefer doing this check with environment variables as @Soviut suggests. But as someone developing on Windows and serving on Linux checking the file paths was plain easier than going with environment variables.
