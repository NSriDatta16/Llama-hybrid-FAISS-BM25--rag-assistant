No offense, but this might be a "if you only know a hammer, every problem looks like a nail"-type of situation. Artificial neural networks aren't a good solution for everything. If you simply calculated a pixel-by-pixel mean squared difference between the stored images and the "forge candidate", you could probably get judge image similarity more reliably. I'd also suggest resizing all images to e.g. 50x50 pixels and performing a histogram equalization before comparing them. That way you could ignore image resizing and global brightness contrast changes.
