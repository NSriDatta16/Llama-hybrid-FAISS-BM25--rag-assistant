Generalised version of your problem: Let $\mathcal{A} \equiv \{ a_1, ..., a_n \}$ be a multi-set of $n \in \mathbb{N}$ age values (which are non-negative real numbers, allowing for duplication), and suppose these ages are ordered as $a_1 \leqslant ... \leqslant a_n$. Consider two independent random variables $A, B \sim \text{IID U}(\mathcal{A})$ that are distributed uniformly on these ages; $A$ represents the true age of a person and $B$ represents your arbitrary prediction. The prediction error of this prediction is $|A-B|$. The expected prediction error is: $$\mathbb{E}(|A-B|) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i,j} |a_i-a_j| = \frac{2}{n^2} \sum_{i This is the expected prediction error for a single guess of age for a single person, but if you take the average prediction error over a group of people, it will have the same expected value (by the linearity of expectations). In the special case where you have ages $\mathcal{A} = \{ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 \}$ you obtain: $$ \sum_{i which gives an expected prediction error of $\mathbb{E}(|A-B|) = 35 / 18 = 1.9 \dot{4}$. Again, this value is the expected prediction error for a single guess for a single person, but you will get the same expected value if you look at the average prediction error for a group of people.
