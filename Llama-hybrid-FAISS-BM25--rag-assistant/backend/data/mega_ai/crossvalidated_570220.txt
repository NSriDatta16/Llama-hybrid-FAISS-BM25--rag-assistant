If you are referring to frequentist statistics, in that case, when you repeat an experiment, and construct the 68% confidence level confidence interval each time, then 68% of those intervals should contain the true value. The true parameter is fixed, and does not follow a distribution - the confidence intervals do. If you are referring to Bayesian statistics and credible intervals, then the posterior distribution of the parameter depends on the prior and on the likelihood.
