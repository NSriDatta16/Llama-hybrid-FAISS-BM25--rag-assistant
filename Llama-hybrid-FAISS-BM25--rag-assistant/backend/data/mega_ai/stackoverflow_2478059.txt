From what I can see here, your request IS being processed on the server, and the response is being returned, but if you want it to be processed/evaluated you must add a callback function to the $.ajax call, in which you tell it what to do with the response. $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: '/jsrender', data: "id=" + $.fragment().nav.replace("_link", ""), success: function(response) { eval(response); } }); You can find all the available parameters for jQuery's $.ajax call here . I also recommend using Firebug (or equivalent, if your not using Firefox) to debug your ajax requests. It has a console tab in which you can see every XHR request that was made, what were the request/response headers, posted data and response status code. Also, there is no need for sending the authenticity_token because you are doing a GET and the token is required only on non-GET requests.
