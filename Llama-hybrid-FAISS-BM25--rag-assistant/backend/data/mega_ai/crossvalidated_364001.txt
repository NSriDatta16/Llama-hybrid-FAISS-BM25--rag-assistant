Is convolution neural network (CNN) a special case of multilayer perceptron (MLP)? And why not use MLP for everything?

If convolution can be expressed with matrix multiplication ( example ) Can we say convolution neural network (CNN) is a special case of multilayer perceptron (MLP)? If yes, why people do not use a big enough MLP for everything, that let the computer to learn to use the convolution by self?
