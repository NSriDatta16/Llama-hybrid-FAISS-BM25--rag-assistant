Help Interpreting Coefficients to Logistic Regression

I am reading through the book Practical Statistics for Data Scientists and I am on a section covering logistic regression. In this section the book covers how the coefficients to the logistic regression function are on the log-odds scale. As an example, there is some R output that specifies (among others) a coefficient called payment-to-income-ratio that is 0.07974. The author gives an example regarding a change in X and what the means that I cannot follow. It says: For example, the effect of increasing the payment-to-income ratio from, say, 5 to 6 increases the odds of the loan defaulting by factor of exp(0.08244) ~ 1.09 Where did .08244 come from? Why is it not exp(0.07974) since that is the coefficient value and the increase is by 1 unit? I am sure I am missing something very obvious. . .
