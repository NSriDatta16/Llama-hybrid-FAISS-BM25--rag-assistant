If you search by string, you should use a question mark as a placeholder, i.e. return mDb.query(DATABASE_TABLE, new String[] {KEY_NAME, KEY_WEEK, KEY_TOTAL}, KEY_NAME + "=?", new String[] { name }, null, null, null, KEY_WEEK + "DESC","10"); Or else it will break if the name contains spaces or special characters. (If you really don't want to you the question mark, you need to put the string in quotes or double-quotes, but using a question mark is far more elegant and safe.) Also: There is no space between "DESC" and the key you're sorting by. Use " DESC".
