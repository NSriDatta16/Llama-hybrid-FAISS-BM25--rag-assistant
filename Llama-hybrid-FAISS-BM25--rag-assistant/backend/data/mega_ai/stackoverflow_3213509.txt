With location and any link ( ) elements on the page, you get a load of properties that give you specific parts of the URL: protocol , host , port , pathname , search and hash . You should always use these properties to extract parts of the URL in preference to hacking about with href and probably getting it wrong for corner cases. For example, every solution posted here so far will fail if a ?query or #fragment is present. The answers from Rob and digitalFresh attempt to cope with them, but will still fail if a / character is present in the query string or fragment (which is valid). Instead, simply: var pagename= location.pathname.split('/').pop();
