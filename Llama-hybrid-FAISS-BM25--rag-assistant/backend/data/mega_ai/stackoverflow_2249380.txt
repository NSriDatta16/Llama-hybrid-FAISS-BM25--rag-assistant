I wouldn't suggest a central wiki for collaboration (aside from internal specific stuff). But for sharing information found online you should encourage people to use one of the many existing systems for this. Google Reader has a really nice sharing and commenting mechanism. Delicious would also be a good fit for what you want. There's no reason to try to create a walled garden inside your organization for content that is being created outside of it. The system you create will not be as good as the ones that already exist and that will kill adoption.
