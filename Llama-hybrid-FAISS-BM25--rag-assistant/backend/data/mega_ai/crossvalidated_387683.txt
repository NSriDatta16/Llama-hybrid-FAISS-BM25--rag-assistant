Denoting random variable $\theta$ with capital $\Theta$?

It is common practice to denote random variables with a capital letter $X$ and the realization with a small $x$ . But how about in Bayesian statistics? The parameter $\theta$ is a RV, so shouldn't it be written as $\Theta$ and only its realization as $\theta$ ? This is quite confusing for me and no book or whatsoever has ever written a capital $\Theta$ for the parameter... So I'm wondering if I am wrong
