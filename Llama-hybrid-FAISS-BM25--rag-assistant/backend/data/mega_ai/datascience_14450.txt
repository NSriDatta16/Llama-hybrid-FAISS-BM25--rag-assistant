How to search collection of podcasts (.mp3 files)?

I have a collection of podcasts, in particular the "Talkingmachines" Podcasts ("Human conversation about machine learning"), see http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/ There are 22 episodes, each 1 hour long. MP3 files are available on my local disk. Now when I want to search the audio files for the episode where they talk about, say, the kmeans++ algorithm , what should I do? Specifically, I want to search for that episode where a male voice (Ryan) talks about kmeans++ in the first half of the podcast. Again, what should I do? Is there a desktop tool available that can do this search? Should I upload the files to some webservice that can do audio recognition?
