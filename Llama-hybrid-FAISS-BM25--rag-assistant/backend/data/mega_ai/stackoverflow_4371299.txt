i agree with @Hogan and @middaparke... if the schemas are the same, you shuol dput it in one instance. unfortuantely it is impossible to tell from here if your schemas would benefit from reusing most of those million rows or not, if normalized well, the ncertinly it would be beneficial. it is also impossible to tell how difficult any changes to the applications would be based on this change. unfortunately, it sounds like you have a large customer base with working applications, and therefore momentum to keep going in that direction - which thros you into the realm of sucking it up and dealing with it by automating the management of so many db's... not the way you would do it from scratch - but maybe cheapest since you are where you are.
