Using a conventional Machine learning approach to tackle this problem will lead to a lower accuracy of your model. This could easily be solved by using Deep learning , more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) . There is no need to feature engineer on your signature images if you are using a convolution network for feature extraction. But although using convolution network, I would like you to reconsider your methods and logics because there are a number of factors that come into play while accessing a signature. The physical act of signing a signature requires coordinating the brain, eyes, arms, fingers, muscles and nerves. So every signature needs not be same everytime. Refer to these papers before you model your classifer.
