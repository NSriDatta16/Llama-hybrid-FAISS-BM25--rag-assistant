Bayesian optimization integer set constraint

Given an ordered input set of boolean values $S$ of length $|S|$ , I want to minimize a function $f(S)$ while maximizing the number of $True \in S$ constrained by $|True \in S|$ $\ge$ $threshold$ I understand this is NP-hard to manage with the $2^{|S|}$ possible inputs, but know some of them will be nonsensical. Is there a way to frame this problem as a bayesian optimization problem for generating a set of booleans which minimize $f$ in such a way that I can avoid most of this parameter space?
