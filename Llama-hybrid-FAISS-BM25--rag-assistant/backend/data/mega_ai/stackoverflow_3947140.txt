If your application is at all web based or has access to the HTTP protocol, another option I would suggest for the client/server model in addition to the excellent ones already suggested by Jared Par , is to leverage HTTP through a web service (or similar) for communication. For example ASP.NET web services . MVC using Restful architecture . or even jQuery/AJAX on the front end (or a similar library) if your presentation layer is web based.
