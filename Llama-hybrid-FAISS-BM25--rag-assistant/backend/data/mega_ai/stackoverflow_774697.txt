Ok, a coworker and I came up with a solution that works for us. Instead of reengineering our entire build process to not delete any class or jar files, we use this procedure: Build new artifacts. Use jardiff (part of jnlp ) to compare changes from previous build. If the diff jar that jardiff produces has no changes, get artifact from previous build. Yeah, I know it sounds kludgy, but it sure beats rewriting build script to take this into account. Also, we can do a completely clean build on a fresh machine (in the case of server failure), and this process will ensure that only actually updated jars are produced.
