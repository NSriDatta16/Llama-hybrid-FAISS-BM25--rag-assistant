Use jQuery Form Notifier - it is one of the most popular jQuery plugins and doesn't suffer from the bugs some of the other jQuery suggestions here do (for example, you can freely style the watermark, without worrying if it will get saved to the database). jQuery Watermark uses a single CSS style directly on the form elements (I noticed that CSS font-size properties applied to the watermark also affected the text boxes -- not what I wanted). The plus with jQuery Watermark is you can drag-drop text into fields (jQuery Form Notifier doesn't allow this). Another one suggested by some others (the one at digitalbrush.com), will accidentally submit the watermark value to your form, so I strongly recommend against it.
