Why might it be better to plan to repeat experiments within your lab (each with its own analysis) instead of designing and analysing a single larger experiment properly? And if repeating experiments is a preferable approach, how would you design that 'meta-experiment' (number and nature of repeats) and how would you report it? There are several reason for doing repeat biological experiments within a single lab. First, there are almost always uncontrolled unknown factors in biological experiments that can vary among repeats. (I've spent the past 5 decades being fooled in many ways by Mother Nature.) You might set up a massive multi-block design to be performed all at once, not knowing that the results depend on one particular uncontrolled factor. Then even you, let alone another lab, might not be able to repeat the results later. The separate repeats at least provide a bit of assurance that some otherwise uncontrolled factors are being averaged over. Second, many biology labs have only a handful of staff. Graduate students often have to do all the experiments by themselves. It can be impossible in practice to carry out the type of massive multi-block design that you have in mind. In those circumstances, doing simpler experiments over a course of days to weeks is more practical. Third, given the problems with reproducibility of life-science studies , I'm not sure that the extra stringency of requiring a "significant" result multiple times in the same lab is a bad thing. The design of a multi-repeat study depends on the type of experiment and the expectations of the specific scientific peer group. The design and expectations might differ, say, between animal experiments and cell-culture studies. The way to report repeated experiments also depends on the nature of the study. Some types of study might well be handled by treating the repeats as blocks, as suggested in the question. Others are best documented by illustrating details of a single representative experiment in the main text, specifying the total number of repeats, and perhaps showing the other repeats in supplementary material.
