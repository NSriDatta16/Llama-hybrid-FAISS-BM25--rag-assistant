How to highlight current rendered line at mouse pointer, in HTML? (Not table/rows)

I want to highlight the current line when mouse moves, is it possible? It's not table rows, just plain text in paragraphs. I'm writing a reading helper plugin for Google Chrome , to help browsing within a big chunk of text.
