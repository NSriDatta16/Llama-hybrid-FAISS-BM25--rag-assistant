The ternary conditional can make code cleaner and more elegant, and most importantly, help you put emphasis on the right things and avoid repeating yourself. Consider using them, but do not make the code less readable by doing so. In VB.NET: 'before refactoring If x = 0 Then ' If-Then-Else puts emphasis on flow control label = "None" Else label = Foo.getLabel(x) ' If-Then-Else forces repeat of assignment line End If 'after refactoring label = If(x = 0, "None", Foo.getLabel(x)) ' ternary If puts emphasis on assignment Note that "it is less readable" is not the same thing as "I'm not used to seeing that".
