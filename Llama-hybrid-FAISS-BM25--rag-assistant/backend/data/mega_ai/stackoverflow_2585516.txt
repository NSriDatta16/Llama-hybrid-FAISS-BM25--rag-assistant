You need to save STDOUT before reopening it: open(SAVE, ">&STDOUT") || die "Can't save STDOUT\n"; ... open(STDOUT, ">&SAVE") || die "Can't restore STDOUT\n"; You can also use a dynamic variable to "save" STDOUT (but this might require reorganizing your code): do { local *STDOUT; open(STDOUT, "..."); ... }; # STDOUT is restored here Finally, you can use backticks to capture the complete output: $x = `iperf.exe ...`;
