Sun's Application Server has been superseded by the community app server, GlassFish. The JavaEE download page only has two JavaEE6 download links and both contain versions GlassFish v3. Chances are you only need the web profile, but download the full version if you aren't sure. Note that GlassFish is just the reference Application Server. You also have other Application servers, such as Apache Geronimo and Oracle Weblogic... as well as ones that are just servlet containers, like Apache Tomcat and Jetty. These types should correspond to GlassFish's normal and web profiles respectively. These other servers only require a JRE to run applications, or the JDK to develop for them. Side Note: GlassFish v3 is the only JavaEE 6-compliant server... JavaEE 6 is brand new. The others should be JavaEE 5 compliant. Also, JavaEE is the new name for J2EE, as sun tries to move away from the Java 2 name.
