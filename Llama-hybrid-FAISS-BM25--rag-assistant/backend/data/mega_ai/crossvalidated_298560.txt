Is stl a good technique for forecasting, instead of Arima?

I have a long time series(data at hourly level, for 6 years). The data is showing an hourly, a weekly, a monthly as well as a yearly trend. For this data, should I try stl (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) or arima ? I am using R for analysis and have used arima in the past. But I am not sure which technique, to use in this case, considering the data has multiple level of seasonality. My second question is more generic. Do people, working in time series forecasting, actually use stl for forecasting purpose? I, am of the opinion, that stl is a good technique for understanding the data, and arima is a better technique for forecasting. Is this understanding correct?
