Currently the name "histogram" is a misnomer. You can find evidence of that in the README . The meaning of the histogram interface might change some day as they said there. However, this is what it currently means. The graphs in your question mix different runs of TensorFlow. Instead, look at the following graphs that display only one run: First what I'd like to say is that the curves themselves represent percentiles . I will borrow the picture from here : which means that the curve labeled 93% is the 93rd percentile, meaning that 93% of the observations were below the value ~0.130 at the time step 1.00k. So the graph gives 3 things of information, the percentage of observations bellow a certain value according to some think curve at every time step of the computation of the Neural network training (at least in this case its what the steps mean). This gives you a feel of the distribution of values of your network. There are also the minimum and maximum values to get a sense of the range of values during training. So the y-axis tells you the value you are interested and the curve tells you the percentile and the x axis at the step. So if you have: $$ (x,f_i(x) = y)$$ it means that at the step x according to the percentile curve $i$ there are less than $i$% of the values bellow the value y.
