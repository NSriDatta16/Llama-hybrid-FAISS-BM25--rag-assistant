Which ML to use for search suggestion?

Problem: I want to create a program to organize text information and fast access to relevant documents. I would like to train a ML model to analyse the current situation and to suggest the next action. The Workflow should look like this: Model gets document type and document text.(Let's say its a Bill from Mr. M. Learning) Then the model should suggest based on previous actions what the user wants to do next (e.g the user opened this bill and was coming from the unpaid bills tab of the application) In this case the model should suggest to send a reminder to M. Learning or open his previous bills etc. I hope the problem I would like to solve is clear. The goal would be to have a network for every document which knows where to go next based on previous actions. I thought of using reinforcement learning and reward the model if a user actually uses a suggested action. Maybe combining it with natural language processing for document analysis? Question: I would like the model to continue to collect usage data from the user and continue **unsupervised** learning. Is this the way to go or are there models that are more suitable for my purpose? Any advice is highly appreciated! Thanks in advance!
