Q: How would you stop scripters from slamming your site hundreds of times a second? A: You don't. There is no way to prevent this behavior by external agents. You could employ a vast array of technology to analyze incoming requests and heuristically attempt to determine who is and isn't human...but it would fail. Eventually, if not immediately. The only viable long-term solution is to change the game so that the site is not bot-friendly, or is less attractive to scripters. How do you do that? Well, that's a different question! ;-) ... OK, some options have been given (and rejected) above. I am not intimately familiar with your site, having looked at it only once, but since people can read text in images and bots cannot easily do this, change the announcement to be an image. Not a CAPTCHA , just an image - generate the image (cached of course) when the page is requested keep the image source name the same, so that doesn't give the game away most of the time the image will have ordinary text in it, and be aligned to appear to be part of the inline HTML page when the game is 'on', the image changes to the announcement text the announcement text reveals a url and/or code that must be manually entered to acquire the prize. CAPTCHA the code if you like, but that's probably not necessary. for additional security, the code can be a one-time token generated specifically for the request/IP/agent, so that repeated requests generate different codes. Or you can pre-generate a bunch of random codes (a one-time pad) if on-demand generation is too taxing. Run time-trials of real people responding to this, and ignore ('oops, an error occurred, sorry! please try again') responses faster than (say) half of this time. This event should also trigger an alert to the developers that at least one bot has figured out the code/game, so it's time to change the code/game. Continue to change the game periodically anyway, even if no bots trigger it, just to waste the scripters' time. Eventually the scripters should tire of the game and go elsewhere...we hope ;-) One final suggestion: when a request for your main page comes in, put it in a queue and respond to the requests in order in a separate process (you may have to hack/extend the web server to do this, but it will likely be worthwhile). If another request from the same IP/agent comes in while the first request is in the queue, ignore it. This should automatically shed the load from the bots. EDIT: another option, aside from use of images, is to use javascript to fill in the buy/no-buy text; bots rarely interpret javascript, so they wouldn't see it
