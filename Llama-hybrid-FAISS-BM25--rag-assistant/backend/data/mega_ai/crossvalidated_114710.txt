Forcing continuous data into aggregate form loses you much statistical power, is all but certain to introduce bias (especially when nonlinear relationships exist), and induce logical fallacies if imputing biased relationships back to continuous phenomena. So: why aggregate unnecessarily in the first place? And: why not simply collect and analyze data on continuous phenomena as though they were continuous? For example, why not move to a regression context with continuous predictors? Then, what you are aiming for is decent coverage of your measurements across the range of all your predictors of interest, particularly making sure you get enough observations in the extremes.
