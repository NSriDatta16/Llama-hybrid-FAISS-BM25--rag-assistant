There are two reasons why this is not working. As Lucero says matching $ will only match a line feed and your test string has a carrage return as well as line feed at the end of each line. The second reason is that you are attempting to match b at the end of a line and your test string only has one line that matches this requirement, the first two lines end with >. What I suspect you want is something more like this: b(?=(?: )?\r?$)
