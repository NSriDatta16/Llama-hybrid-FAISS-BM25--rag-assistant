In the context of iPhone development, Property Lists are a key-value store that your application can use to save and retrieve persistent data. All iPhone applications have at least one of these by default, the Information Property List : The information property list is a file named Info.plist that is included with every iPhone application project created by Xcode. It is a property list whose key-value pairs specify essential runtime-configuration information for the application. The elements of the information property list are organized in a hierarchy in which each node is an entity such as an array, dictionary, string, or other scalar type.
