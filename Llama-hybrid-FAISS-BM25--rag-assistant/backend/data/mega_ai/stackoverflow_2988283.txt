I tend to agree with the "it can't be done" camp. At least not 100%, but it can probably be done "good enough" to keep the average user in line. And if it can be done then it probably has been done. Did you check Torry's Delpi300, etc (maybe even sourceforge, although you might have to translate into Delphi). http://www.google.com.sg/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=How+to+generate+unique+serial+number+of+machine+in+Delphi actually looks promising
