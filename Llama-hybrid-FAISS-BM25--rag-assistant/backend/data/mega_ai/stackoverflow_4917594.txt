VIM - Fastest way to yank an awkward text block

I am using VIM 7.1.314 and would like to yank the names (chris, robert, ben) in the code shown below as fast as possible - how would I achieve this? Note the names are always aligned (regardless of users number). user 1: chris (05/04/1984) user 2: robert (11/12/1991) user 3: ben (5/25/1993) Also note, I'm looking for a solution where there is hundreds of names so scalability is important.
