WSDL Definition Problem

We have been given a .wsdl file (listing below) which we will be using to generate c# code for use in our app. When I load the file into xmlspy I get the following error attribute 'type' in message part 'organisation' (message 'getOrganisationResponse') refers to type 'organisation' which is not defined within the WSDL file! It says it can't find the type but this is defined in the section at the top of the file, so I'm not sure why it does not find it. Any help would be appreciated Cheers Richard
