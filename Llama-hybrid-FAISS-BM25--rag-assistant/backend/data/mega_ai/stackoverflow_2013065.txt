i think you can solve your problem by defining the result transformer and the result set names, if in some way you can access the Criteria that being generated you can avoid anonymous object. the problem is that the property names and column names are not the same, and when using projection nhibernate/linq to nhibernate does not check what the column name and the property name. so if u'll define them by yourself in the result properties (i think its called result set) in the criteria before you execute the query it should work. it's pretty simple, give it a try
