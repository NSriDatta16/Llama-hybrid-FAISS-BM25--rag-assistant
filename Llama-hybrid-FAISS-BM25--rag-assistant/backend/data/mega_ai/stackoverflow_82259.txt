HTML drag and drop sortable tables

Ever wanted to have an HTML drag and drop sortable table in which you could sort both rows and columns? I know it's something I'd die for. There's a lot of sortable lists going around but finding a sortable table seems to be impossible to find. I know that you can get pretty close with the tools that script.aculo.us provides but I ran into some cross-browser issues with them.
