What is a good software package to create a FAQ site?

I am looking for a faq software package that would allow me to create a Q&A site. I looked at some of the similar questions but I didn't find anything suitable. Does anyone have any suggestions? My wishlist: Prefer a non-wiki solution Windows/.NET solution would be ideal but not required Doesn't matter if solution is commercial/open source Ability to sort questions by category/topic/tags Support for embedding images within text Option to rate answers RSS Feed, if possible Ability to assign related questions Something like this http://kb.mediatemple.net/ would be perfect.
