I think the answer would be "yes" in this case, and the reason I would answer in the affirmative is because it is reminiscent of the Voltage Meter story. In short (paraphrasing from Computer Aged Statistical Inference ), an engineer measures the voltages on a batch of 12 tubes using a voltmeter that is normally calibrated $$ x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,1) $$ Here, $x$ is a given measurement and $\mu$ the truth batch voltage. The measurements range from 82 to 99, with an average of 92. The engineer reports 92 as the estimate of $\mu$ . The next day, he discovers a glitch in the voltmeter such that any voltage over 100 registers as $x=100$ . Though none of his measurements were effected, his estimate (the sample mean) would not be unbiased in future realizations of $\bar{X}$ from the actual probability model. How does this apply to ridge? Assuming the minima of the loss function is within the constraint, the estimates $\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ are still technically biased in the same way that the sample mean would be biased in the voltmeter example above.
