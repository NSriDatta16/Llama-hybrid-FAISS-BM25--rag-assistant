I think you should really start a "real world application" as suggested here. You will see that a real project requires a bit more than just knowing the language. I suggest you find some simple problem you had issue with, and make a software that solves that issue. For example, if you want some kind of software that checks RSS feeds every 5 minutes and makes a little pop-up as soon as a new one comes along. Or you want a program that will let you do simple presentations by just dragging a few pictures in. Then whatever you choose, start by making the simple solution to the problem and extend from there (like do different settings, extra features etc.)
