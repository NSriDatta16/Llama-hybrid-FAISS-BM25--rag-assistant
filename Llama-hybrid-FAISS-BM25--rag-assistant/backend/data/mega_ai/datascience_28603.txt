It doesn't matter, with or without flattening, a Dense layer takes the whole previous layer as input. The spatial structure information is not used anymore. Some Neural Network implementations might not be able to map a spatial structure directly into a dense layer, which is why you would need the Flatten in between. Mathematically it is exactly the same in this case. EDIT: As I expected, in the source of Keras it mentions that if the rank is higher like with convolutions, they implicitly Flatten it first.
