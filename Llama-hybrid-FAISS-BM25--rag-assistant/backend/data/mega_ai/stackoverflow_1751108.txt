You are using 'Detailed' with dm_db_index_physical_stats. This will show the non-leaf levels as well as the leaf levels of the indexes. Is the fragmentation for the leaf levels (leaf_level = 0), for non-leaf levels (leaf_level > 0), or both? If the fragmentation is at the non-leaf level, this is less of a problem, or no problem. If you still want to get rid of all of the fragmentation, try adding PAD_INDEX.
