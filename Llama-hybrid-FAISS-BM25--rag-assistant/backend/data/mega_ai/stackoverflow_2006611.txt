How to leverage development tools

I want to learn how to make best use development tools such as - Maven, SVN, and Eclipse. While I know how to use these tools separately, I'm interested in learning how best to use them in concert to make development more efficient and effective. A couple of example questions follow: Once you've created a project using maven, what aspects of the "maven project" do you add to the repository? Rather than using each of these tools separately, i.e. using maven to create project, using svn to add project, using eclipse to checkout project. Is there a way to combine those steps into a single step or plugin? Basically, I'm looking for insight and feedback on HOW you've used the aforementioned tools in concert for efficient and effective development. *Note: If you have experience with other versioning systems (CVS, GIT, etc.) and/or IDEs, please share your insight as well; feel free to substitute them in-place of the ones I've specified. Thanks.
