It is implementation dependent. When Date as a "constructor" is passed a string object, it tries to build a date with its parse method ( Date.parse ). That method shall parse strings returned by Date.toString() and Date.toUTCString() , which both return formats varying with the implementation. And this is how the ECMAScript standard says it should be. I remember reading this in "the Rhino book" (Tommy Flanagan's great javascript book). In practice, it might very well turn out everyone except IE does it the same way, but I haven't tested thoroughly. Also, it is a bit much if IE tries to parse whatever one throws at it and produces a Date object out of ascii soup.
