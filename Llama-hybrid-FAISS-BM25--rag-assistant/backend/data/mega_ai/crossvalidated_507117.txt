How to obtain the Gaussian conditional pdf, as discussed in section 2.3.1 in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Bishop?

From Statistical Inference of Casella, a conditional pdf is obtained through the joint pdf by the following equation, (1) $$ p_a(x_a | x_b) = \frac {p(x_a, x_b)}{p_b(x_b)} $$ In section 2.1.3 of PRML, the author did not mention explicitly the equation, but I guess he using the same approach. The author obtain the conditional mean and covariant matrix by directly manipulating the quadratic form of the exponent of the joint pdf. I understand how he obtain the conditional mean and covariant matrix, but since he does not explain how to obtain the corresponding Gaussian pdf, I have no idea if that pdf is equal to (1). This are the derived conditional mean and covariant matrix derived from the joint pdf, and other relevant vectors and matrices The result conditional mean of $x_a$ , given $x_b$ $$ \mu_{a|b} = \mu_a - \Lambda_{aa}^{-1} \Lambda_{ab} (x_b - \mu_b) \\ $$ The resulted conditional covariant matrix $$ \Sigma_{a|b} = \Lambda_{aa}^{-1} \\ $$ The random vector $$ x = \binom{x_a}{x_b} \\ $$ The joint mean $$ \mu = \binom{\mu_a}{\mu_b} \\ $$ The joint covariant matrix and its inverse $$ \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma_{aa} & \Sigma_{ab}\\ \Sigma_{ba} & \Sigma_{bb} \\ \end{bmatrix} \\ \Lambda = \Sigma^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \Lambda _{aa} & \Lambda _{ab}\\ \Lambda _{ba} & \Lambda _{bb} \\ \end{bmatrix} \\ $$ The quadratic form of the exponent of the joint pdf $$ (x - \mu)^T \Sigma (x - \mu) $$ (2) The general multivariate Gaussian pdf on a random vector $X \in R^D$ $$ N(x | \mu, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{0.5D}} \frac{1}{|\Sigma|^{0.5}} \exp\big(-0.5(x-\mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu) \big) $$
