Choosing error for a linear regression model when simulating data for a bayesian sample size determination

Background: I am writing a grant and trying to get a sample size estimate for a Bayesian linear regression. I am trying to link a brain measure to a change in a behavioral measure. So the model is really simple: Y ~ bX + e, where Y is change and X is the brain measure. Question 1: Based on previous research I know the means and sd's of both Y & X. Can I use these values to choose a realistic e for simulations, or at least a reasonable lower bound? Or is there a better way to go about this? Question 2: I plan to fit a Bayesian linear regression to the data with varying b. I'll then choose the b where 89% credibility interval does not cross 0 as the minimum detectable association with a given N. Does this make sense? Thank you in advance!
