This is a question of estimation within a linear mixed effects model. The problem is that the variance of the grand mean is a weighted sum of two variance components which have to be separately estimated (via an ANOVA of the data). The estimates have different degrees of freedom. Therefore, although one can attempt to construct a confidence interval for the mean using the usual small-sample (Student t) formulas, it is unlikely to attain its nominal coverage because the deviations from the mean will not exactly follow a Student t distribution. A recent (2010) article by Eva Jarosova, Estimation with the Linear Mixed Effects Model , discusses this issue. (As of 2015 it no longer appears to be available on the Web.) In the context of a "small" dataset (even so, about three times larger than this one), she uses simulation to evaluate two approximate CI calculations (the well-known Satterthwaite approximation and the "Kenward-Roger's method"). Her conclusions include Simulation study revealed that quality of estimation of covariance parameters and consequently adjustment of confidence intervals in small samples can be quite poor.... A poor estimation may influence not only the true confidence level of conventional intervals but it can also make the adjustment impossible. It is obvious that even for balanced data three types of intervals [conventional, Satterthwaite, K-R] may differ substantially. When a striking difference between the conventional and the adjusted intervals is observed, standard errors of covariance parameter estimates should be checked. On the other hand, when the differences between [the three] types of intervals are small, the adjustment seems to be unnecessary. In short, a good approach seems to be Compute a conventional CI by using the estimates of variance components and pretending a t-distribution applies. Also compute at least one of the adjusted CIs. If the computations are "close," accept the conventional CI. Otherwise, report that there are insufficient data to produce a reliable CI.
