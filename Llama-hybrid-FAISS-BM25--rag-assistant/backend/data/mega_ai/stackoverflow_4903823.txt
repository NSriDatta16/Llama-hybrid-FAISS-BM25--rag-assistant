Can Jetty be used as a Java EE lightweight application server?

In the scope of deploying small Java EE web applications at various client sites, I am searching for an easy application server solution. I think I remember hearing that it was possible to use Jetty as a JavaEE 6 lightweight application server but I can't seem to find more evidence on this right now on the web. Knowing that my development environment is JSF2 + RichFaces, CDI (Weld) and JPA 2 => NO EJBs at this point), is Jetty a possible solution for me? If yes, could you point me to some docmentation or specific keywords helping me? If no, what other lightweight Java EE 6 application server should I use?
