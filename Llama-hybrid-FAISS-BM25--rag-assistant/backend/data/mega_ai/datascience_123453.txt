As mentioned in the comments, most machine learning research is disseminated via conferences, the top three being NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR (this is a subjective opinion). But of course, journals do exist and might be more suitable for some type of publications. In my (again subjective) opinion, good options are JMLR and JAIR. For your particular case, I'd maybe recommend another journal which I do not have experience with, but which seems to be suitable for the type of publication you have in mind: TMLR . It focusses on short articles and technical correctness, while still having high quality standards and a proper, rapid, and even double-blind peer review process.
