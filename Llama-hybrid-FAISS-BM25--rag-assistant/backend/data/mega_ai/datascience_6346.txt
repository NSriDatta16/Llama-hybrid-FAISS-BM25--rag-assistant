If you want an application-oriented book, consider Christopher Bishop's Model-Based Machine Learning . He has more technical books that are well regarded. If you are looking for lots of code, Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers is an option. Another introductory book with a more statistical bent is An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R . Again, the authors have a well-regarded technical version of the book.
