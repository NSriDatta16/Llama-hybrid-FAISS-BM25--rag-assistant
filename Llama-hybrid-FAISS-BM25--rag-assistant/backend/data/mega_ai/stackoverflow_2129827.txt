Silverlight 3 Books

I am looking for a good book on Silverlight 3, for myself and my development team. We are all experienced .NET developers, but with virtually no exposure to Silverlight. This site on Silverlight.Net lists the following books on Silverlight 3 development - Silverlight 3 Programmer's Reference by J. Ambrose Little, Jason Beres, Grant Hinkson, and Devin Rader Beginning Silverlight 3 by Robert Lair Silverlight 3 Jumpstart by David Yack Game Programming with Silverlight by Michael Snow Introducing Microsoft Silverlight 3 by Laurence Moroney Pro Silverlight 3 in C# by Matthew MacDonald Accelerated Silverlight 3 by Jeff Scanlon and Ashish Ghoda Essential Silverlight 3 by Ashraf Michail I was hoping to get a few comments on each, and some overall recommendations. Note that previous SO questions on Silverlight books have all been about Silverlight 2.
