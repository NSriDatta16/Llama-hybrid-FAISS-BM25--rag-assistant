You could use the categorical variable with its 500 levels as is, but then use regularized logistic regression. In Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? one idea is to used the fused lasso, but there are other possibilities. I cannot see how the power-law distribution is relevant, and your idea of merging all but the 10 most frequent levels is problematic. That two levels both have low frequency in no way indicates they have the same effect!
