The problem is that Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that outputs the probability of an input belonging to a class. So you cannot use Naive Bayes to achieve what you want. To get 'in-between' values you need to use a regression algorithm instead. I'm not sure what library you're using, but try to use regression versions Knn and SVM models instead.
