PCA for probability vectors

Is there a procedure equivalent to principal component analysis (PCA) for probability vectors? I have an n-by-m array where every column sums to one, and all entries are positive. PCA works in principle, but doesn't really make sense, since it implies that my data comes from a mix of Gaussian distributions. I would like to use something more "honest".
