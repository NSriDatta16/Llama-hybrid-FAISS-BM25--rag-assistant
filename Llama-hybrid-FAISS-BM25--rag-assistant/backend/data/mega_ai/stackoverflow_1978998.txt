I can't easily help you with finding the strength, but I can make it a bit harder, since it also depends on the platform you want to use. For example if you need to install python packages on Gentoo (GNU/Liunx) based computers, you can easily use g-pypi to create ebuilds for all packages which use distutils (rather: a setup.py). That way they get completely integrated into your system and can be added, updated and removed like all your other tools. But it naturally only works for Gentoo-based systems. Also you can use yolk to find out about all packages installed via easy_install on your system (not only on Gentoo). When I write code, I simply use distutils (because it allows building portage ebuilds very easily) and sometimes basic setuptools features, or organize my programs so people can just download and run them from the program folder (ideally just unpack the source archive / clone the repository somewhere). This isn't the perfect solution, but until the core python team decides which way they want to move, I don't want to fix onto a path (anymore) which might disappear.
