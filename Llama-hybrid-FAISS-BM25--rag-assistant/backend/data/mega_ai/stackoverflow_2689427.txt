Sometimes these distributivity laws, and other axioms of modal logic, are easier to grasp if you use the comodalities, which are the De Morgan dualities of given modalities. The comodality of necessity is then necessity. For a to coknow P means that a does not know not P : intuitively it means that a 's knowledge does not contradict P , so a could learn P without coming to know a contradiction. Say Ca P if a coknows P . Then using classical logic, distributivity is equivalent to: Ka(X or Y) -> (KaX or CaY) This form is often easier to handle that the form with implication in formal manipulations.
