The RFC 2396 section 4 says: When a URI reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from the URI by a crosshatch ("#") character, consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed. As such, it is not part of a URI, but is often used in conjunction with a URI. That is, the fragment won't be visible for the web server so you'll have to look for some other method as mod_rewrite is a no go. Depending on what language you are familiar with, you can install HTMLUnit if you're a Java dev or you could try to write a proxy and use it to fetch the parsed content by, i.e. Jaxer or a Firefox instance. I used Jaxer and is pretty easy to implement the crawlable ajax pages after you get used with the Jaxer API (which isn't complicated at all)
