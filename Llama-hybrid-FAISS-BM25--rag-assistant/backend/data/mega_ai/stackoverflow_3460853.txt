Storing data for web application in python dictionary

Is it feasible to store data for a web application inside the program itself, e.g. as a large dictionary? The data would mostly be just a few hundred short-ish text blocks (roughly blog post size), and it will not be altered/added to at all by the users (although I would want to be able to update it myself every so often). Up until now I've been looking at standard database storage solutions, but since (for this set of objects at least) they will not be modified, is it possible simply to store them as a dictionary? Or are there serious downsides I have not considered? Thanks.
