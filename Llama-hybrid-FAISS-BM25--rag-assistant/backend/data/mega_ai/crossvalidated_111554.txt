Reported error rates on neural networks

It is common to depict the error rates of types of neural networks in a table, for example, see the MNIST website . However, because of the non-determinism caused by weight initialization the actual error rates may vary even under a single setting of hyperparameters. My question is therefore: what statistic over multiple runs is usually depicted? Are the reported error rates the mean error rates? Are they the minimum error rates?
