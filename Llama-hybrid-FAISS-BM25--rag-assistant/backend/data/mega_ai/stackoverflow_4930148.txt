By the way I am using "ImageIcon". I assume this means you are adding in image to a JLabel and are then adding the JLabel to a JPanel. so I want, if I drag any image that should appear above all the other images You need to add a MouseListener to the JLabel. When you click on the label then you can reset its Z-Order to 0. This will cause the label to be painted last and so it will be on top of all other labels on the panel. So the basic code in the MouseListener would be: panel.setComponentZOrder(label, 0);
