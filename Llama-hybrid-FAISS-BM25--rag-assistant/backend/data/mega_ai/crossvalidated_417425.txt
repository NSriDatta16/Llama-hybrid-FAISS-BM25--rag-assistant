Waiting time distribution parameters given expected mean

I have a set of healthcare providers serving patients. In a given amount of time, a specific provider can see only a certain amount of patients, depending on the medical procedure and other variables. A patient, since the booking of the procedure, is seen by the doctor after a certain amount of days, again specific to provider, procedure etc... I have a data set in which for each provider, for a given amount of time, I know how many patients have been seen and what was the average waiting time. I want to simulate more patients for each provider and their individual waiting times. I assumed that the number of patients seen in the given time can be modeled as a $\sim Poisson(\lambda)$ with lambda depending on provider and procedure characteristics and amount of time. I modeled the average waiting time as $\sim lognormal(\mu_{global}, \sigma)$ with parameters as a function of the same variables of before plus the log of n.patients. Finally, I'm modeling the simulated new patients waiting time as $\sim Gamma((\mu/SD)^2, SD^2/\mu)$ with $\mu$ predicted from the model above and $SD$ chosen using domain knowledge since I don't have past information on individual waiting times. I would like to know if I choose the right distributions given the problem at hand.
