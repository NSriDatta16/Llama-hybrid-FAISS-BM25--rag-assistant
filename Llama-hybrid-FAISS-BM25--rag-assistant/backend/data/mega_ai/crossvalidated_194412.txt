What it mean by Training SVM

I am new to image processing. As my project I am doing "image classifier using SVM". I have the idea of my final software "I select some image and give it as input to my software and it will classify that image. If I give the image of an animal it will classify it to cat or snake suitably" When I google about it it says "First you need to train SVM". What it mean by Training SVM? What is the actual input to SVM in my case (image classification)? SVM is just a classifier how it classify images. Is it necessary for me to covert image to any particular format?
