Random forest probability for selecting members

I used random forest to predict whether a player will be selected for taking part in the Olympic Games, and 0 represented for not selected and 1 for yes. I got the prediction result, for example,Amy is 0 ,Bobby is 1 and Cindy is 1; Q1:how to judge whether Bobby has higher probability of being selected or c is more likely to be selected; for example, rank the people whose final prediction result is 1, The first person is the one who had the highest probability to take part in the Olympics.Q2: I am not sure whether use random forest is correct, I tried logistic regression before but there are 17 variables and they are highly correlated. Therefore, I used random forest. Is there a better method ? Thanks a lot. Have a nice day! I tried the function below in r > prob=predict(fit_rf,shujuu,type="prob") > prob 0 1 1 0.196 0.804 2 0.188 0.812 3 0.224 0.776 4 0.240 0.760 5 0.232 0.768 6 0.172 0.828 7 0.240 0.760 8 0.184 0.816
