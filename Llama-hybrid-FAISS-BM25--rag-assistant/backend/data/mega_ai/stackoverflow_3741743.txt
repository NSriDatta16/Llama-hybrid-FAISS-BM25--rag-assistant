I would stay away from embedded in most cases, especially if you're depending on another jQuery plugin. Some cases to consider: What if I'm already using that plugin, a newer version, an older one? At best you're adding the download weight twice, possibly a different version At worst you're breaking my code :) What if I'm trying to debug, is a bug in your plugin?, the other?, still yours because you included it? Which author do I contact? There are few upsides to this besides saving a few tags, which should be cached on the client anyway...and in my case as well as many others (like SO) the scripts get compressed into one or a few requests. Most jQuery plugins require dependencies to be added with their own tags, in this case by not going with what most do serves more to confuse or complicate rather than save time. Personally, I'd stay away from the embedding, but to each their own.
