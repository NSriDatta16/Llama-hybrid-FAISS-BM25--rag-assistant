JQuery: Manipulating the Request Params in .submit()

Is there a way to can access and manipulate the POST params after a form submit has been made. To be more specific, in my submit event handler, how can I do something like $("#form").submit() { //access the request params and manipulate them here return true; } instead of the following hack which I find to be not that elegant. $("#submit_button").click() { // Construct the Request 'params' manually $.post("/foo/action", params, redirectIfSuccess); }
