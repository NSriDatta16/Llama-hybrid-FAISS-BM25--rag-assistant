Use theme() You should always call your theme functions via the theme() function, as you show in your first example: theme('MyFunction') . If you don't do this, you're crippling the Drupal theme system and not allowing other module developers to effectively override your output. When writing your own theme functions, don't forget to use hook_theme (explained here ) to register your theme function with the theme registry. If you don't do this, calling theme('MyFunction') won't work. Never hurts to clear caches after initially registering the function, either. Example of why it's important For example, in your theme's template.php, you can define your own theme_image function to override how Drupal core handles images. You'd name your function name_of_theme_image and get to work overriding what it returns. If theme_image weren't always called as theme('image') , you wouldn't be able to leverage this overriding behavior, because theme() acts as the single point of entry and delegator of theme functions. The same is true of your theme functions.
