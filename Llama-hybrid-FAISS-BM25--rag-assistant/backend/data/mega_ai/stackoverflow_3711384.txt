HTML webpages to Wiki pages translator

I am looking for a HTML to wiki website translator. Basically I want to publish the coverage reports generated by cobertura to my google code website. But google code only suuports wiki pages, so if someone can point me to a HTML website to wiki pages (linked together) translator I can publish my coverage reports.
