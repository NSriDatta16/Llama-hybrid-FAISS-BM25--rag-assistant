Models you should consider, depends on the type of the response variable (Qualitative or Quantitative). (Assuming your response is quantitative) Other than the ones you've already used, you may try out almost any regression model (Linear regression, Lasso regression, Kernel regression, Gaussian process regression, Linear least Square regression, and so on, except Logistic regression as it is for categorical responses).
