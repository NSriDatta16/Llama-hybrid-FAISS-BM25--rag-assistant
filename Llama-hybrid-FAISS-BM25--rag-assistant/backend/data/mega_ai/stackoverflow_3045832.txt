How can i use RotateAnimation to rotate a circle?

I want my circle image (ImageView) to rotate as the user touch and drag it. If the user drags it to the right, it should spin right and vice versa. Like when you spin a DJ disc, if you know what i mean. I've played around a bit with OnTouchListener and RotateAnimation but i'm getting nowhere. Any ideas?
