If you are interested in the sum of payouts then, as @Glen_b suggests, variance gets larger with more repetitions of the experiment: $kVar_n$ after $k$ repetitions. If you are interested in the average payout, then variance is $\frac{Var_n}{k}$ after $k$ repetitions. Since you say: [variance] should get proportionally smaller as this activity goes on. I guess you are interested in the average. This also assumes independence.
