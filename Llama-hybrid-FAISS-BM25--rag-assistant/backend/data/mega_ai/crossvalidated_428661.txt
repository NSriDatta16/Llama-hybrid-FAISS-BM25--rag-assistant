What is the "Monte Carlo" part in MCMC algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling?

I know that Monte Carlo is used to approximate an integral by sampling. I also learnt MCMC algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling but I don't know where the "Monte Carlo" part is in those algorithms. Those algorithms are just sampling.
