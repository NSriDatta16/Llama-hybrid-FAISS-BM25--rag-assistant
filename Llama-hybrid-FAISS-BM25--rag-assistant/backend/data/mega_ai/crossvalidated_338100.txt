Golden rules of designing a good convolutional neural networks

What are the rules of designing a good convolutional neural (such as VGG [1], Inception [2] Resnet[3], DenseNet[4] and so on...) network from scratch? What would be a recipe to start designing your own architecture? Many meta-learning and architecture search algorithms (e.g, [5]) break-down the architecture design task into a simpler form. I wonder if a more general instruction can be gathered for researchers to follow. I would appreciate it if you can provide a step-by-step guideline. Let's see if we can gather some useful tips and put them into test in here! I will then follow these instructions and design a new architecture and will post the results in here.
