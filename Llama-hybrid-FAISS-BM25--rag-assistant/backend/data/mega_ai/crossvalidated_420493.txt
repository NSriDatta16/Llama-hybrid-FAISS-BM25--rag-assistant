Great Question ! "Could I combine my ARIMA forecast with this prior information somehow to form an ensemble forecast?" I have been involved with a commercial time series forecasting package called AUTOBOX and have incorporated delphi-type predictor series where the user provides probabilities of intervals and this is then used to monte-carlo a family of possible values for future values of input series where the user normally delivers 1 point estimates based upon perfect knowledge. The "realizations" developed this way are then inter-joined with the arima simulations providing a family of ensemble forecast values for the dependent series that might also be effected by possible anomalies identified in the analysis stage via Intervention Detection schemes. You should be able to program this with this advice as I have done. This problem/opportunuties arises quite naturally when the predictor series distribution can be "pre-guessed" such as alternative hypotheses for the price of oil for the next period. Armed with priors like this one can select from alternative offerings those with the greatest expected reward.
