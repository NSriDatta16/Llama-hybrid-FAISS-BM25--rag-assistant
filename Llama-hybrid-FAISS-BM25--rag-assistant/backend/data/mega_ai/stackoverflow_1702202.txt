I tend to keep the backing fields together at the top, but then I do that with method variables too. Perhaps its a carry over from some of the older languages where variable declaration was always the first step, but it just seems more organized to me than declaring variables inline as needed. If you don't like declaring variables at the top, the closest I've seen to your "ideal" style would be: private int _integer1 = 0; public int Integer1 { get {return _integer1;} set {_integer1 = value;} }
