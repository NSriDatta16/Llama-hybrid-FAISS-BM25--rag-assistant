Multiple system account creation: Is LDAP what I'm looking for?

I need to create/suspend user accounts for the following systems for when our department hires/dismisses employees: Bug Tracker (Mantis) Email (Google Apps) SVN Shopping Cart (Magento) Terminal/SSH Access (CentOS) For some reason I have the thought that LDAP is what we're looking for... and we have the ability to drive all of this from Active Directory if need-be. I don't mind doing a lot of development if necessary; I just need to know if it can, indeed, be done!
