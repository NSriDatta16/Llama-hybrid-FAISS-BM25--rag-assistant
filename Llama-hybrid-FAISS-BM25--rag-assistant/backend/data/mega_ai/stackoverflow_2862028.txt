I hope you're automating this too... run it all with Cucumber / SpecFlow and WatiN / WatiR via continuous integration like TeamCity (it's free for small time usage) or CruiseControl (less preferable)... so everytime your build runs, it delegates the acceptance tests to each virtual box. With TeamCity, you can setup a build agent on each virtual box and have TeamCity delegate a specific build (Example: Build: Acceptance Tests Virtual Box Windows 7).
