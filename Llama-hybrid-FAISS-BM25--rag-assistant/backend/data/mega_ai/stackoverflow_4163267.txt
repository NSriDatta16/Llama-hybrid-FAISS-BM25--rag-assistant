If your element doesn't have to be interactive you can just use a VisualBrush . If it has to actually move from one place to the other and keep working as usual you'll have to either duplicate your control or attach/detach it. To my knowledge there's no "elegant" way of doing this - you'll have to go through normal means, such as Children.Remove/Add (if its parent is a panel), etc.
