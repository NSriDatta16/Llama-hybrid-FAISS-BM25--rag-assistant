HTTP Cache Headers

I have some javascript code that loads images dynamically in a web page: imageSrc = pid.toString() + '/' + imageName + '/' + num.toString(); //imageSrc = pid.toString() + '/' + imageName; The first line works fine, but using the second line causes the images to not change after being loaded. I used firebug to capture the headers from the server: Content-Length 43 Allow GET, HEAD Expires Sun, 28 Jan 2007 00:00:00 GMT Server CherryPy/3.1.2 Pragma no-cache Cache-Control no-cache, must-revalidate Date Sun, 13 Feb 2011 21:12:31 GMT Content-Type image/x-png And I've also added the line to the head of the web page. The problem occurs in firefox, IE, and chrome, so I think it must be a fundamental problem, and not a browser issue. Any help would be appreciated.
