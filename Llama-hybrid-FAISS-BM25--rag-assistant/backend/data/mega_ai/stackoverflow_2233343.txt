Coverage report for ASP.NET web site pages

I have taken on an ASP.NET web site where the client is using the web server as a code repository, i.e. removing a page from the site involves not linking to it any more. There are a stupendous number of unsused files, and I would like to archive these off and arrive at a lean git repository of only files used by the active site. How can I get usage or coverage data that will tell me, over an agreed upon period, i.e. a month, which pages are being hit? I know there are many ways of doing this in ASP.NET, and even in plain IIS, but I'd like some suggestions on a convenient and simple way of doing this.
