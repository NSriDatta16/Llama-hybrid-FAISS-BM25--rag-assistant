How can we detect People Name and his Designation/Role from a sentence using Deep learning?

Let's say for a paragraph like: Satya Nadella is Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft. Before being named CEO in February 2014, Nadella held leadership roles in both enterprise and consumer businesses across the company. Another tech giant company is HP and Dion J. Weisler is President, Chief Executive Officer, Director of the Company. Previously, he served as Executive Vice President of the Printing and Personal Systems Group of Hewlett-Packard Company from June 2013 to November 2015. This will be as an input for deep learning model. And detected people and designation would be like: [Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer] [Dion J. Weisler, President] Any idea how we solve this challenge and what should be the best deep learning algorithm for it?
