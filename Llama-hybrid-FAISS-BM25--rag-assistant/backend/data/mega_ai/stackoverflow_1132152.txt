If you need good data analysis toolkit, you can spend some time and try R --- free software statistics/data analysis toolkit. It has pretty good graphic capabilities, especially via ggplot2 package for static graphics and ggobi for dynamic data exploration. Data import/export pretty easy too --- R can import csv/tsv, or Excel data via ODBC and so on. Pretty good introduction in exploration data analysis with R and ggplot Introduction to R Data Import/Export It takes some time to learn, but after that you are not limited with tool capabilities: R can handle plenty of analysis tasks: from simple data crunching, pivoting. aggregation tasks to advanced statistics/machine learning methods: clustering/classification/ regression etc. If you more more interested in data transformation with simple calculations, you can use some kind of Extract-Transform-Load toolkit, such as Talend Open Studio .
