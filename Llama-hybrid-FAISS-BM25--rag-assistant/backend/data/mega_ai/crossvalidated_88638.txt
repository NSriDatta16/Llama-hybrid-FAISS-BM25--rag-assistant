Have you thought about using Tukey's folded logs, as in $$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{A + 1/6}{A+B + 1/3}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \ln \left(1 - \frac{A + 1/6}{A+B + 1/3}\right)$$ You can justify this type of transformation with some Bayesian arguments . For example, here's some date illustrating this transformation: A B ratio flog 100 0 1 3.1992975 1 0 1 .97295507 0 1 0 -.97295507 0 0 . 0 0 25 0 -2.5086399 0 75 0 -3.0557337 50 100 1/3 -.34574233 One of the things I really like about it is that $A=100,B=0$ has a higher value than $A=1,B=0$ even if the proportions are both 1. The disadvantage of this approach is that the coefficients will be hard to interpret. If you have a different prior, you can adjust accordingly .
