In the answers there (if I understood correctly) I learned that within-subject variance does not effect inferences made about group means and it is ok to simply take the averages of averages to calculate group mean, then calculate within-group variance and use that to perform significance tests. Let me develop this idea here. The model for the individual observations is $$y_{ijk}= \mu_i + \alpha_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$, where : $y_{ijk}$ is the $k$-th measurement of individual $j$ of group $i$ $\alpha_{ij} \sim_{\text{iid}} {\cal N}(0, \sigma^2_b)$ is the random effect for individual $j$ of group $i$ $\epsilon_{ijk} \sim_{\text{iid}} {\cal N}(0, \sigma^2_w)$ is the within-error In my answer to your first question , I have suggested you to note that one obtains a classical (fixed effects) Gaussian linear model for the subjects means $\bar y_{ij\bullet}$. Indeed you can easily check that $$\bar y_{ij\bullet} = \mu_i + \delta_{ij}$$ with $$\delta_{ij} = \alpha_{ij} + \frac{1}{K}\sum_k \epsilon_{ijk} \sim_{\text{iid}} {\cal N}(0, \sigma^2) \quad \text{where } \quad \boxed{\sigma^2=\sigma^2_b+\frac{\sigma^2_w}{K}},$$ assuming $K$ repeated measurements for each individual. This is nothing but the one-way ANOVA model with a fixed factor. And then I claimed that in order to draw inference about the $\mu_i$ you can simply consider the simple classical linear model whose observations are the subjects means $\bar y_{ij\bullet}$. Update 12/04/2014 : Some examples of this idea are now written on my blog: Reducing a model to get confidence intervals . I'm under the impression that this always work when we average the data over the levels of a random effect. In the answers there (if I understood correctly) I learned that within-subject variance does not effect inferences made about group means and it is ok to simply take the averages of averages to calculate group mean, then calculate within-group variance and use that to perform significance tests. I would like to use a method where the larger the within subject variance the less sure I am about the group means or understand why it does not make sense to desire that. As you see from the boxed formula, the within-variance $\sigma^2_w$ plays a role in the model for the observed group means.
