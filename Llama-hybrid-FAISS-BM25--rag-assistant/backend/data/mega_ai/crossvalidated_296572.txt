What is the difference between Econometrics and Machine Learning?

In my understanding, econometrics estimates partial ( ceteris paribus ) correlations with the aim to primarily estimate causal relations . For that, it normally uses the whole dataset that is available. Econometrics can be parametric and non-parametric. Meanwhile, machine learning is not interested in causality, but in "fit" with the aim of primarily produce predictions . For that, it normally splits the dataset between the training and the prediction sets. Machine learning can also be parametric and non-parametric. This is what I can make of the core of these two disciplines, but I am sure there is plenty more to it. I am primarily interested in their differences. Can anyone provide a good guide on this please?
