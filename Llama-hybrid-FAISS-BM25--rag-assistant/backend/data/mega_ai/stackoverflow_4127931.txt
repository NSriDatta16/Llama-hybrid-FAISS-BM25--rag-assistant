You may use a "Two URL Merge" in order to merge changes from Foo.c on 'trunk' into your branched and renamed Bar.c . cd branch/B svn merge http://www/svn/svnroot/branches/B/Bar.c http://www/svn/trunk/Foo.c Bar.c Whereas branch/B is a working copy. To finally remove the conflict developer A and B should agree on the same filename. Using different files for the same code might not be desirable. EDIT: From looking at how 'other' vcs approach this issue, I would like to quote from the paragraph 'Renaming files and merging changes' : If I modify a file, and you rename it to a new name, and then we merge our respective changes, my modifications to the file under its original name will be propagated into the file under its new name. (This is something you might expect to “simply work,” but not all revision control systems actually do this.) Maybe a reason to give Mercurial a try.
