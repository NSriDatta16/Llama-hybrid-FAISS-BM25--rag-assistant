how to load a web start application into eclipse rcp

I have a Webstart Apps/jnlp in which I would like to add into an already made rcp client. Can I integrate the web start application into the RCP so it will appear under the menu toolbar so if it was clicked it will load ithe application.If so How will I go about doing that, would it need to be place into as a plug-in? Thanks for any help!
