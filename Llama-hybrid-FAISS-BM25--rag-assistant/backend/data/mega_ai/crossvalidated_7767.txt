I just took a look at some of my neural networks; the weights in those look normally distributed. One possible argument is that each weight is the sum of IID delta values during backpropagation, so they will be Gaussian (due to the central limit theorem). This argument involves making some simplifications; for example the summed deltas are probably not independent of each other during backpropagation.
