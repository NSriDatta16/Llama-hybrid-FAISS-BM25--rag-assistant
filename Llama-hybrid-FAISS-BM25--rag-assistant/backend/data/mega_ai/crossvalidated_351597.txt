I'm not familiar with FBProphet, but Box-Cox is often used with ARIMA time-series models. Box-Cox won't reduce the variance of your data but it can make it more normally distributed and reduce the heteroskedasticity in your model. (See here and here ) If you will be modeling your time series data using ARIMA or a linear model this could be important.
