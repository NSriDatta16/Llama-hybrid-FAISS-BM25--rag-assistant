I had a similar problem and was told to consult Chapter 4 of Regression Models for Time Series Analysis by Benjamin Kedem and Konstantinos Fokianos. I have not yet gotten around to digesting this book, but it looks highly relevant (though fairly technical) as far as I can tell. I also wonder if this can be handled in a GLM framework with Poisson family, a log link function, and Newey-West standard errors . This is one line of code in Stata (after tsseting your data) and perhaps fairly doable in other packages. Here's a link to an old Stata Technical Bulletin article by James Hardin with the variance formulas for the probit, logit, and poisson. Perhaps one of the time-series mavens can comment on whether this would be a terrible idea.
