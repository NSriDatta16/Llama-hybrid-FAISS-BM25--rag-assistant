Relationship between p-values and effect size

I did a Wilcoxon signed rank test to understand whether there is a difference in average sales in 9 different counties. There are multiple pairs of counties that are significantly different. Would it be fair in this case to say that p-values are representative of the effect size? i.e.: the pair with the lowest p-value differs the most in average sales?
