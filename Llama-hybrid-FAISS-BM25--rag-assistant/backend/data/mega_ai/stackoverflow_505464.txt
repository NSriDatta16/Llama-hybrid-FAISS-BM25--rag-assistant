JSON is shorter, so it will use less space in your database. I'd probably use it instead of XML or writing my own format. On the other hand, searching for matches will suck - you're going to have to use "where json like '% somevalue %'" which will be painfully slow. This is the same limitation with any other text storage strategy (xml included).
