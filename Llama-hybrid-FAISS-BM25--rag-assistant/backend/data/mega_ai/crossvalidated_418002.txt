Firstly, it is pretty dubious to exclude studies, because their results mismatch your model. If the studies fit all your inclusion criteria, I suspect many people will feel uncomfortable about removing them to reduce betwen study heterogeneity in outcomes. Secondly, if the between study variability is estimated to be zero (on the boundary of the parameter space) in a random effects model, there are multiple ways of dealing with that. One common option in maximum likelihood approaches is to treat the parameter as if it were known to be exactly zero, which is what the software you use seems to do. With Bayesian approaches (either maximum-a-posteriori with boundary avoiding priors or with proper priors and looking at other posterior summaries) this is - in my personal opinion - handled in a more natural manner, but then you of course have to set priors and we know that in a meta-analysis with few studies the prior for the between-study heterogeneity can be quite influential.
