WCF: Retrieving MethodInfo from OperationContext

Is there an elegant way to get the method that will be executed on a service instance from MessageInspector/AuthorizationPolicy/some other extension point? I could use OperationContext.Current.IncomingMessageHeaders.Action but I hope there's some way to do it without manually matching SOAP actions with OperationContracts. What I'm trying to do is examine the method's attributes before it executes.
