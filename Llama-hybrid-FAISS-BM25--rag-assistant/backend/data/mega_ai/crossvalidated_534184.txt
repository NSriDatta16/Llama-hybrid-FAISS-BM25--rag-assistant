As you have described the situation, what you have is a binomial regression model (total A versus not-A counts per teacher) with year of teacher graduation as the only predictor. Although you have an ID value for each teacher, you seem to have only 1 entry (cumulative counts) for each teacher rather than entries year-by-year, so that ID doesn't even need to be included in the model. You don't have a correlation structure of outcomes over time that would require special care in a time-series regression (or at least, without year-by-year values for the $y_i$ , you can't address them). The only question is how you want to model the predictor of teacher year of graduation. If there's a large enough range of years you could simply treat it as a continuous predictor. In a logistic binomial regression, to allow for non-linear associations between log-odds of having given A grades and time since teacher graduation, you could model that predictor flexibly, for example with restricted cubic splines. That way you get an overall test of the significance of the model and tests of the significance of the non-linear terms. If there are only a few years of teacher graduation in your data, you might be better off evaluating it as an ordered categorical predictor. The above regression approach naturally takes into account things like years having different numbers of teachers graduating, even down to 0-teacher years (at least for the continuous model). The results will tend to be more weighted toward years that had a greater numbers of teachers and toward teachers who have given out greater numbers of grades. What your model doesn't take into account is the teachers who have left the field since graduation. That could wreak havoc with interpretation of your results. For example, say that stricter teachers who give out fewer A grades get so much blowback from parents of their students that they tend to resign in disgust. Then an observation of a higher A -grade proportion with longer time since teacher graduation might represent a type of survivorship bias . I understand that this question represents a hypothetical to represent your actual situation, but survivorship bias needs to be considered in any study involving time durations up to an observation time. In terms of an "effect size," with a logistic regression you would need to decide whether to keep model results in the original log-odds scale or translate to, say, a probability scale. Depending on the results of your modeling there might not be a single "effect size" that covers all the data, so you might need to provide illustrative examples. A plot of predicted results versus year of teacher graduation, with confidence intervals, would be important to show.
