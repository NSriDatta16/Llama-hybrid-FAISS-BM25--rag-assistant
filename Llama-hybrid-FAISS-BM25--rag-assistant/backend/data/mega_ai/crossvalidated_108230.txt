Approach for mapping consumer preferences

I have this web application where I need to map consumer preferences based on some input information and individual choices. My goal is to create a list of product recommendations and evaluate the level of “importance” of these products with respect to the user. From my research so far I realize that there are several ways to address this problem. For instance there is the classical marketing research approach that involves modeling individual utility functions and econometric models. Alternatively, there’s the machine learning approach with learning based algorithms. There might be others I’m not aware of. Which would be the best approach in this case? Are there other alternatives? I really could use some direction on the best way to go.
