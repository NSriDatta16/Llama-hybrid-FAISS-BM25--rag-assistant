Poisson process, time and probabilities

An average of n birds fly through an area, in an hour, following a Poisson process. (I think this means the hours don't matter; there's no influence in the number of birds that fly through, at different parts of the day, hypothetically. Correct me if I'm wrong.) P1 is the probability that exactly m birds fly through between 12:00-14:00 (2 continuous hours). P2 is the probability that exactly m birds fly through between 15:00-16:00 and 17:00-18:00 (a total of 2 hours still, but not together). Please notice m is the same for both situations. Are the probabilities of P1 and P2 the same or I'm assuming something that's wrong? Thanks! (Please tell me if you need more information, I can make it up)
