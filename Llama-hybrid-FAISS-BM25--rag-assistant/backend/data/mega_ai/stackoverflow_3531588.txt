memcached as an Object store in Rails

I am using Memcached as an Object Store with my Rails application where I store search results which are User objects in memcached Now when I fetch the data out I get the Memcached Undefined Class/Module Error. I found a solution for this problem in this blog http://www.philsergi.com/2007/06/rails-memcached-undefinded-classmodule.html before_filter :preload_models def preload_models Model1 Model2 end which recommends pre-loading the models before hand. I would like to know if there is a more elegant solution to this problem and are there any drawbacks in using the preloading technique. Thanks in advance
