A posterior distribution has a higher variance than the uniform prior?

I am working on some Bayesian inversions with MCMC chains, the posterior of one of the (known to be bad) parameter came out to have (slightly) larger variance than the uniform prior it started with, I am not really sure how to explain this result mathematically, I doubt that it is a numerical error. If any of you could provide any explanation or related reference would be great! FYI, the following figure is the posterior (histogram) I am referring to: histogram of posterior The variance of these posterior samples is 1.7539 The uniform prior is prior~U[0.002, 4.5], which has a variance of 1.6860
