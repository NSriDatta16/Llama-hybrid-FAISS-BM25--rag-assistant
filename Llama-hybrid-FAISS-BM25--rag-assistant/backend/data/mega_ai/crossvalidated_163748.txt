Best way to model this data, qfit or fpfit? How to get equation?

So I have this relationship, which is obviously not linear. The purpose is to see if there is (and what kind of) a relationship between FRAG (test score) and MD-R (mm^2/s). There are other covariates like age and gender that I would like to account for, ideally, but I don't know how if I can't do normal linear multiple regression. The distribution was not normal after testing with Shapiro-Wilk. What is the best way to describe the relationship? Here, I have fitted a qfit line, which doesn't look too bad, but it seems to be like the slope should be bigger, and the upper observations don't seem like outliers. Do you think qfit is a good choice here? fpfit doesn't come up too different. Also, how do I get the equation of this line? Finally, how to I do a qfit with covariates and get the equation? (there may be an interaction that causes these outliers to be higher I guess and I would like to see that). Thanks a lot.
