Would anyone be able to help me interpret the dendrogram in the picture?

The dendrogram was obtained using SPSS, the Nearest Neighbor method alongside the Squared Euclidian Distance. It groups together glass fragments from 3 different origins but I have difficulties with the number of clusters, can anyone help? Thank you in advance!
