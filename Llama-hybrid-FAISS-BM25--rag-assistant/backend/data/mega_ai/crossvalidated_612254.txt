I think that's the following: You got to put the eval_set being equal to the set you are going evaluate the model in that moment. It means that if you are testing if some model gotten from XGBOOST its better than other, the eval_test would be the validation, that set that you splitted to make the hyperparameter search. In a Nested Cross Validation for example, in the inside fold would be the "internal test set" and when you got to evaluate for performance of that model, you would use as eval_set the "external test set". It's like to giving t√¥ XGBOOST that given some unseen data, he'll have a tip for not training too much based on that unseen data, whoever could It be this unseen data, validation or test data. For hyperparameter search it's like you are telling for all different models generated via hyperparameter search the following "okay guys, you all are training until you are not improving anymore on this validation set"
