Every field has their own variation of "data science," so I would suggest choosing a subject that interest you and going from there. I can't offer what the go to subject is for your particular interest. A graduate degree that would "get you where you want to go" is quite a personal understanding, so I can' answer that. But what I will say is, from my own personal experience, when I graduated with my undergrad degree in economics, I was really interested in data science, and economics allowed me to use data science in a field I'm really interested in. So I applied to Ph.D programs to further my knowledge and am using data science extensively in many different forms of analysis. My suggestion is to apply to graduate degrees that have interesting subject matter to you and will allow you to use data science as understanding. You would fit well in an economics degree because of your background :)
