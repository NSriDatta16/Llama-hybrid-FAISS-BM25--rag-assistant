Is there any opensourse set of components or some framework for creating Flex mxml graphs (Node-based UIs)?

Is there any opensourse, free set of components for creating Flex mxml graphs? like aviary Peacock style ones (source: peacockwiki at sites.google.com ) with at least Drag, drop, and connect generators so each graph element could have (source: peacockwiki at sites.google.com ) or something like that. Framework should be opensource (like GPL, LGPL etc) BTW : I found one wary bacic made by Erno Aapa with Degrafa but I would really love to see something much more Flex 4 - mxml oriented and frienfdly. So blog articles, Google code projects, anything - please help
