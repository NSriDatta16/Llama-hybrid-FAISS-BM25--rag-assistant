Handling an embedded view inside a ListView?

I have a quite problematic UI layout to implement, and I'm not sure if it's even possible using standard UI widgets. It looks something like this: Picture 1 The green, lined thing is supposed to be a ListView, and the red rectangle is another View. This red View should be scrolled with the ListView, as if it's part of it. Some list-elements should also be narrower, because that embedded View gets in their way. Could you please recommend any ideas? Can this be done somehow with the Android UI framework? I was thinking about some kind of a floating View above the ListView, which reacts to the List's scrolling events too, but it doesn't seem like an elegant solution. Thanks
