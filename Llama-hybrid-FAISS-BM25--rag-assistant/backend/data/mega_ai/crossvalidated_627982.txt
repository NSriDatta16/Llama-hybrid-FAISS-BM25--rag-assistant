What is the activation function of a feedforward neural network that corresponds to GLM?

I am reading a slide which says GLM are neural networks. https://owars.info/mario/2020_Wuthrich.pdf The authors showed that if you have an exponential function as the activation function of a very simple 1-layer neural network, then it corresponds to Poisson regression, which is a type of GLM. My question is: for the general GLM, what should be the corresponding activation function if the GLM were represented as a neural network?
