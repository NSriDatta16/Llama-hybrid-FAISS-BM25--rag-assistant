Machine Learning/Text Analysis/Algorithm Pointers

I'm looking for a reference or point in the right direction since I'm not too familiar with machine learning or algorithms. I'd prefer to work in R, but I could also do Python. Any reference to a specific package I could use would be great. So I have a list of Senate bills and their descriptions that are one or two sentences long. I have a subset of bills that also have accompanied bill types (ie "budget", "immigration", etc). I want to create an algorithm that will assign a bill type(s) to the other subset of bills that don't have bill types. I would want to be able to do this by using the underlying relationship between descriptions and bill types for the first subset and apply it to the second so that I can predict bill type from bill description. Does this make sense? Any advice would be welcome!
