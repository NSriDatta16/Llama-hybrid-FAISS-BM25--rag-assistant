Sorry I don't know the correct answer, but... Do you have a business case for wanting to do that? Are your customers complaining that files aren't stored where they expect? Are your applications crippled in some way because you store files in non-standard locations? If not, I don't see a reason for spending time and budget to redo your file storage strategy just to meet "best" practice. If your programs just work, then IMHO you should leave them alone and spend money and time on things that matter.
