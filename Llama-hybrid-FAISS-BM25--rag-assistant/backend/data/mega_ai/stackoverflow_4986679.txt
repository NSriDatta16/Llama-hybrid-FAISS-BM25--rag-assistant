Using sendAsBinary with ASP.Net MVC

I'm trying to use the following to allow a user to drag photos onto a page and have those photos uploaded. http://alex-tech-adventures.com/development/x-html--css--javascript/97-drag-and-drop-upload-using-html5-with-firefox.html Now I've been trying to get the model binding working of this but thus far haven't had much luck with anything built in. Does anyone know how I could get this to work??? As a backup, I know I use the InputStream to pull the sent data out as a string and then sdserialize into my object... var stream = this.Request.InputStream; var result = ""; using (var reader = new StreamReader(stream)) { result = reader.ReadToEnd(); } var serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer(); var typedObjectResult = serializer.Deserialize (result); But I'm having converting the image part of the message into a byte array and then saving that off to a file. The string content of the image looks like this. data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4RjhRXhpZg........3Xuve9de6//9k= How do I save this as an image? Should I just be able to write the byte array to a file? But my main concern is getting the model binding right. Cheers
