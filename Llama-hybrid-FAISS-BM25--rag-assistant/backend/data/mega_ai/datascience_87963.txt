There is not going to be a pretrained classifier for article/not article because different people will have different definitions of article/not article. The first step is define article/not article for your specific use case. That can be done two ways: Series of rules - List criteria for article/not article, Then encode those rules in a program. For example an article does not contain the phrase "Terms of service". This strategy works well for deterministic, narrow definitions that do not change. Train a binary classifier - Label thousands of webpages as article/not article. Then preprocess them so they are amenable for machine learning. Then fit a binary classifier, Naive Bayes classifier is a common first choice. This strategy works well for probabilistic, complex definitions that can change.
