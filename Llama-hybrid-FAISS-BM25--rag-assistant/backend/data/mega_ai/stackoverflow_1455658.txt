If you are on a Linux-based server, you can use sys_getloadavg , which will get you the system load average : Returns three samples representing the average system load (the number of processes in the system run queue) over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes, respectively. This should be better than using a "snapshot" of the CPU-load at a given instant : the 1 minute and 5 minutes values are quite interesting, as they give you an average value for a short period of time. It also gives takes into account more that only the CPU load -- for more informations, you can take a look at the Load average page on wikipedia . But note that this function is not implemented on windows platform. Which mean you'll have to make that call conditionnal, depending on the underlying operatinf system.
