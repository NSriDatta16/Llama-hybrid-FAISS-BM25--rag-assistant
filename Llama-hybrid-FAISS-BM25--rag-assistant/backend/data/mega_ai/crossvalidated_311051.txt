What is the best machine learning approach for this problem?

Please forgive my ignorance, however I would like to explain this problem and get some advice on how to approach it. Let's say that I have the following training inputs, where word , x , and y are the data, and class is the classification that the data has been put into, with 0 being unclassified - Training 1 word, x, y, class 56, 48, 23, 0 91, 12, 44, 2 74, 45, 23, 0 91, 76, 48, 1 Training 2 word, x, y, class 49, 48, 45, 0 84, 16, 12, 2 10, 45, 23, 0 72, 76, 48, 3 84, 18, 12, 0 10, 45, 23, 1 24, 79, 48, 0 And I would then like to provide the following test data, to be classified - Test 1 word, x, y 64, 36, 45 84, 16, 12 95, 45, 23 72, 76, 88 22, 18, 12 What might be the best approach to this problem?
