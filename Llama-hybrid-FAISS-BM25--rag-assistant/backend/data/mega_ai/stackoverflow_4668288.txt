It depends entirely on what you're wanting to display : and is for page layout is for displaying tabular data (such as data points etc) The days of using for whole page layouts is gone - and you should be discouraged for using them for this reason. HTML tags are meant to be semantic . This means describing the data it contains - not how to display it (this is for stylesheets to handle)
