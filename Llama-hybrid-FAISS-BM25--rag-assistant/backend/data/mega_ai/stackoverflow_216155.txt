How to Safely Accept Pasted Code in PHP

I want to allow users to paste and HTML fragments (video players) via an HTML form. The server-side code is PHP. How can I protect against malicious pasted code, JavaScript, etc? I could parse the pasted code, but I'm not sure I could account for all variations. Is there a better way?
