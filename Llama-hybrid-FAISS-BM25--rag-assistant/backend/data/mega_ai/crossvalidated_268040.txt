A more mathematical explanation is that the space $l^p$, consisting of all series that converge in p-norm, is only Hilbert with $p=2$ and no other value. This means that this space is complete and the norm on that space may be induced by an inner product (think of the familiar dot-product in $R^n$), so it's a little nicer to work with.
