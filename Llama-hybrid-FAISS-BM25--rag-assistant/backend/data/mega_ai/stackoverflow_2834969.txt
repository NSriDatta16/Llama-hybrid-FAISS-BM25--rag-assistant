I actually just ran into this problem in my own project. One option is to purchase a tool that does precisely what you're looking for. If you do something like that, you're more likely to get something that's full-featured, well-supported, and has a lot of nice bells and whistles to make your job easier. However, as both Svisstack and george9170 pointed out, there are already tools within the Visual Studio development environment. Here is how I'm proceeding: I use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio's Diagram editor to perform the dragging and dropping of tables. This works fairly well, although it's a bit more cumbersome to work with than some of the tools I investigated. (For the record, the reason I didn't use the tools I investigated was the cost.) Once I develop the tables in the diagram, I tell MSSMS to generate the tables. I then use the Database Publisher (it comes with VS2008 and VS2010) and I connect with the database. Using LINQ to SQL, I let the magic work behind the scenes so that I can utilize the various objects which will interact with the database. If I'm not explaining this well, check out the two links below. It should make things more clear. Using Database Projects for Visual Studio NerdDinner - An ASP.NET MVC tutorial, but with good information on LINQ to SQL. By using LINQ to SQL (as described in the second link), your users should be able to build queries against the database fairly easily. It's not drag and drop, but it's very simple and straightforward.
