Comparing a UITouch location to UIImageView rectangle

I have the following code to determine if a touch is within an image view in my table cell. However, it doesn't work. I compared the two with CGRectContainsPoint however, it doesn't work. Here is the code: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // Declare the touch and get it's location UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:self]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(myImageView.frame, touchLocation)) { NSLog(@"Tapped image view"); } } Thanks for the help!
