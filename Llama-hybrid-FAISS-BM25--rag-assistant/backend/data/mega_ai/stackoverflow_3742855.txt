Python openssl problem

I'm trying to write a simple mail retrieval program in python. It seems the connection is getting established. But when I try to authorize it with the username, I don't get a reply from the server. Can anyone tell me what is going wrong here? import socket, sys from OpenSSL import SSL ctx = SSL.Context(SSL.SSLv23_METHOD) print "Creating socket" s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) print "done" ssl = SSL.Connection(ctx, s) print "Establishing Connection" ssl.connect(("pop.gmail.com", 995)) print "done" print "Requesting Documents" print "done" try: buf = ssl.read(4096) except SSL.ZeroReturnError: print "1" sys.stdout.write(buf) ssl.send("USER username") try: buf2 = ssl.recv(4096) except SSL.ZeroReturnError: print "2" sys.stdout.write(buf2) ssl.send("PASS secret") try: buf3 = ssl.read(4096) except SSL.ZeroReturnError: print "2" sys.stdout.write(buf3) print "connected" ssl.close()
