Almost Perfect Accuracy in Both Training and Validation Sets, but Nothing Showed Up in All But One of the Classes' Saliency Map

My convolutional neural network (with 5 layers: first 3 are Conv2D, last 2 are FC's) to classify four different classes of protein images resulted in very high accuracies and low losses in both training and validation datasets (>0.99 for accuracies and Nevertheless, when I plotted the saliency maps to determine the important features for each class, the saliency maps of the first three were empty, i.e., saliency scores were all zeros or close to zero. The saliency map of the fourth class, however, showed numerous dots (the highest saliency was 1.0) at the expected pixels/regions. So my question is whether I was doing something wrong or the final saliency map is the saliency map for the whole classification? Can it also be due to the fact that my model was too simple or not run long enough (50 epochs for now)?
