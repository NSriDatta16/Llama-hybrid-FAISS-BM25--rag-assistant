How do I customize the print layout of a SharePoint list item?

i need to be able to produce a "pretty" printout of an individual list item's values, with the goals being: get rid of all navigation organize data as it would appear on a typical paper form (a customer requirement) i'm avoiding using InfoPath at this time due to other issues (which i'll post separate questions for...) for example , i have an individual list item that normally displays similar to the following DispForm.aspx example : i need a printed version ( PrintForm.aspx ??) that will display similar to the following example : from what i can tell, i can't do this just by modifying/creating custom CSS. it also seems that i can't quite do this just by creating my own "print" version of DispForm.aspx . any suggestions, ideas, links would be very helpful.
