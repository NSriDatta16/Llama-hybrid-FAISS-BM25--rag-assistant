False positive in Multi class Image classification

I am training a neural network with some convolution layers for multi class image classification. I am using keras to build and train the model. I am using 1600 images for all categories for training. I have used softmax as final layer activation function. The model predicts well on all True categories with high softmax probability. But when I test model on new or unknown data, it predicts with high softmax probability. How can I reduce that? Should I make changes in model architecture or data?
