Dragging an item from a QTableView/QSqlTableModel

I want to be able to drag an item (actually a whole row) from a QTableView that has a QSqlTableModel as it's model. QSqlTableModel::flags(const QModelIndex &index) doesn't return Qt::ItemIsDragEnabled. Does that mean the only way I can get this to work is if I subclass QSqlTableModel and reimplement the flags() method? Thats seems like overkill just to drag the item.
