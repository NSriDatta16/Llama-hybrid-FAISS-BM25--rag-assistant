I don't believe that Magento is certified for PHP 5.3 There are a slew of issues with 5.3 on the Magento forums, the fixes involve hacking the core Magento code which isn't recommended. I would suggest that you rollback to PHP 5.2 which will fix your immediate issue and be safer with Magento in general. --------- EDIT --------- If rollback to 5.2 isn't an option, you could download the package manually using ./pear download magento-community/Lingotip_Translate and then exploding the tarball yourself. Place the app , skin and other folders as seems appropriate and go for it. Obviously, you are choosing to void your warranty in bypassing the installer, and your mileage may vary. good luck :) You will need to have run ./pear mage-setup . in your magento install dir previously.
