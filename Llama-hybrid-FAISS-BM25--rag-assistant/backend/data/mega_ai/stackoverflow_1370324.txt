I figured out how to do it ... very similar to Craig Stuntz's answer, but the difference is in how you reach the RouteData. Using ControllerContext.RouteData.Values does not work in a regular method used this way (it does from the original controller, but not from a base one like I built), but I did get to the RouteData by overriding the OnActionExecuting method: protected override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext) { string agentID = filterContext.RouteData.Values["agentID"].ToString(); OtherMethodCall(agentID); }
