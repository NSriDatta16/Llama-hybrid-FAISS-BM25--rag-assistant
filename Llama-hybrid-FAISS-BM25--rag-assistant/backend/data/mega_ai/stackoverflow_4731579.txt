My name is Dave DeLong . Allow me to point out a couple of significant items from my profile : 37.5k reputation - I am a worthwhile and significant contributor to the Stack Overflow community. 572 consecutive days visited - Not only am I obsessed to Stack Overflow, I am sadistically addicted to it. This includes answering questions via the hospital wifi while my wife was in labor. I have a answer/question ratio of 51.08. So for every question I ask, I answer over 51 questions. Each of my answers averages over 3 upvotes (31.9 rep/answer). I have consistently averaged a gain of ~60 rep/day. Behold the linearity . My expertise in the areas of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch development would add a rich dimension to the moderators on the site. Significant badges earned: Strunk & White, Pundit, Guru. Gold badges in "iphone" and "objective-c", and a silver badge in "cocoa" (~70 votes away from the gold badge). I'm the author of a comprehensive and open source Objective-C framework ("StackKit") for accessing the Stack Overflow API. http://stackkit.com I wear my Stack Overflow t-shirt to work . ‚Üê this should be all the proof you need. In case it's not already obvious, I love Stack Overflow! I love the community of learning and exchange, and hope that I will be considered as a worthy contender for moderatorship.
