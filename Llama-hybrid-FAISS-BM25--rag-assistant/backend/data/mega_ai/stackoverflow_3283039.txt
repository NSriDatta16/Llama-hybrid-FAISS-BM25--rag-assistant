TSQL strip date from datetime

What is the best way to strip the date from a DATETIME so only time is left to do a comparison? I know I can do the following: CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), GETDATE(),8)) But this involves convert and characters. If I wanted to check whether a time (including minutes) was between two other times stored in DATETIME columns, is there an elegant way to do this without having to rely on converting to character strings?
