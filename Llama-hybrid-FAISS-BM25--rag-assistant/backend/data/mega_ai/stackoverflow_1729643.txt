Follow the following procedure and get Code Coverage results; -Add a new test project to the solution -Remove all the existing classes (Database test, ordered test etc..) so that you are only left with the unit test class (UnitTest1). -Remove all useless comments and crud code from the test class so that you are only left with a test method (no comments, not even the TestContext) -Add a reference to the silverlight versions of “System.dll”, “System.Windows.dll” to the test project. (usually located under “C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v2.0\Reference Assemblies\” (remove existing reference to system.dll if you need to first) -Add a reference to the project under test -You can now write tests against the object model (standard classes) Cheers, Ref: http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2008/12/27/unit-testing-in-silverlight-land-with-typemock-isolator.aspx
