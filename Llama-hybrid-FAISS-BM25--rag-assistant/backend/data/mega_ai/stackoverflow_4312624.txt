Maven assumes it doesn't make any sense to have more than one version of a module at once. It assumes that a newer version replaces the older version. If it doesn't it is not the same module. I suggest you give the newer module a different name and make sure it has different packages to avoid choising a random module. In general Maven tried to encourage good application design and deliberately makes it difficult to do things it has determined to be a bad idea.
