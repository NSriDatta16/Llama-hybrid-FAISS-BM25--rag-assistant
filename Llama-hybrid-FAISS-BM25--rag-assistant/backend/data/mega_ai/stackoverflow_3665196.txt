How can I use an Image List to draw C# dragging outside of my own windows

I am using C#'s inbuilt drag and drop via Control.DoDragDrop(). I use an Image List and ImageList_DragMove and friends to move a semi-transparent image around, tracking with the mouse. (See my reply in this thread for more information). How can I make the ImageList track the mouse when it is outside my windows? I only receive mouse position messages in OnDragOver(), and only when the mouse is over one of my Windows. The drag is going to another instance of my application, and I would like the ImageList to go the whole way, including over the desktop. I guess the basic problem is that DoDragDrop runs its own little message loop. Windows Explorer gets this done so I know it is possible. I suppose I could start a thread to keep track of the mouse or write my own drag/drop message loop, but I am hoping for an easier way.
