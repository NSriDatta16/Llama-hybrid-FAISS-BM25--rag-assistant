No, this is not customary. Your time series may be an intermittent-time-series : demand is often zero and sometimes nonzero. In this case, leading zeros would just represent bona fide zero demand. Removing them would bias your forecast upward. Conversely, your leading zeros might result from padding a series with zeros, and represent an artifact of data munging. In this case, you should of course remove them. You need to understand where your data comes from and what has been done with it in order to know what to do with it. If your series starts with a "long" string of zeros and there are "few" zeros after, then you probably have the second one of the two cases above, and you could remove the zeros with a certain level of confidence. Appropriate values for "long" and "few" will depend on your time series, especially on its time granularity and what it actually represents. You should also remove the zeros if they are physically impossible or at least highly implausible, e.g., if they represent humidity measures taken someplace wet. Bottom line: subject matter expertise is pretty much indispensable here. Incidentally, you write that "this does not always yield the best results in terms of RMSE or MAPE". Be aware that the RMSE and the MAPE are usually minimized by different point forecasts. See Why use a certain measure of forecast error (e.g. MAD) as opposed to another (e.g. MSE)? . I have an upcoming invited commentary on the M4 forecasting competition, which should soon appear in the International Journal of Forecasting and which discusses this further. If you are interested, I can send you the manuscript.
