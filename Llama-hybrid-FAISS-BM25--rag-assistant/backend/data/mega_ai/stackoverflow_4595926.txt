A resonably normalized model (3NF/BCNF) provides the best average performance and the least amount of modification anomalies for the largest number of scenarios. That's big, so I would start from there. As your requirements are fuzzy, it's seems like the most sensible option. Actually, the most sensible thing would be to go over the requirements until they are a bit more "crisp" ;) Also, if you could get your hands on a few early extracts from your data provider you could experiment with it and get a feeling for the data distributions (not all people live in one country, and some countries holds more people than others. Not all people have children, and the number children per person is vastly different depending on the country). This is a major point and it is crucial that the optimizer can make good decisions. Other than that, I agree with everything Walter said and also gave him my vote.
