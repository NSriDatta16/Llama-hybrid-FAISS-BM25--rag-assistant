LINQ Average TimeSpan?

I have a database table that contains entries for start time and end time of an event. I would like to take those entries and find the average length of an event. The subtraction is no problem. However, when I try to get the average value, the compiler complains. Here is my current LINQ query: public TimeSpan? getAverageTime() { return (from EventTime in db.EventTimes where EventTime.EventTimesID > 0 select (EventTime.TimeEnd - EventTime.TimeStart)).Average(); } I also tried .Sum() and .Aggregate() so that I could have something to work with, but none are accepted. What is the best method for accomplishing my goal?
