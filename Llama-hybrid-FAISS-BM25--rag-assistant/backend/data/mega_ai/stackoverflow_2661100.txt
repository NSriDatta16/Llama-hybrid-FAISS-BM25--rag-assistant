What about using a HashMap ? Insertion, deletion, and retrieval are all O(1) operations. If you wanted to sort everything, you could grab a List of the values in the Map and run them through an O(n log n) sorting algorithm. edit A quick search has found LinkedHashMap , which maintains insertion order of your keys. It's not an exact solution, but it's pretty close.
