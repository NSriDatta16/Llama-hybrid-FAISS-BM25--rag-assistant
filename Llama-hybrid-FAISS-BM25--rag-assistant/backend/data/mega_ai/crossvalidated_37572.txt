To concretize the suggestion of the previous reply, you first want to estimate the Markov probabilities - assuming it's Markov. See the reply here Estimating Markov Chain Probabilities You should get a 4 x 4 matrix based on the proportion of transitions from state A to A, A to B, etc. Call this matrix $M$. $M^2$ should then be the two-step transition matrix: A to A in 2 steps, and so on. You can then test if your observed 2 step transition matrix is similar to $M^2$. Since you have a lot of data for the number of states, you could estimate $M$ from one half of the data and test $M^2$ using the other half - you are testing observed frequencies against theoretical probabilities of a multinomial. That should give you an idea of how far off you are. Another possibility would be to see if the basic state proportions: proportion time spent in A, time spent in B, matches the eigenvector of the unit eigenvalue of M. If your series has reached some sort of steady state, the proportion of time in each state should tend to that limit.
