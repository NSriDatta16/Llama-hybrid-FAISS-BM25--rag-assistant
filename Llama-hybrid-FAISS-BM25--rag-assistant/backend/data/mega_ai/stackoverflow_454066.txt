Small discrete steps is what I'm most comfortable with, though at some points it can be a test of my self-control to reign in what could be a refactoring blood-bath. If I notice any improvements (no-matter how large) that could be made, I make a note of them and consider how it'd be split up into individual refactoring tasks. Plus, having a saga of changes in the commit message doesn't help. NB. The code-base I work on is quite old, and full of those mystical bugs named after scientists. With large portions still lacking anything near even 50% test coverage it would be careless to get carried away.
