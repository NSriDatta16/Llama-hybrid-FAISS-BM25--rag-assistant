De Morgan's law is useful for reducing it to a normal form, e.g. Disjunctive normal form (DNF) or conjunctive normal form (CNF). Basically this means that it's either DNF: (a and b and c) OR (e and f and g) ... or CNF: (a or b or c) AND (e or f or g) .... You can throw the NOT's in at the lowest level. I agree with the previous posters that you should optimize for readability and comprehension.
