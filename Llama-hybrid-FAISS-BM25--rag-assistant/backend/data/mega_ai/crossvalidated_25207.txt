Help choosing the optimal time series analysis package

I am developing an app for time series analysis that should support the following: Exponential Smoothing ( Holt-Winters ) Box-Jenkins curve fitting (straight line, quadratic, exponential, growth) multiple regression Croston's intermittent demand model and discrete data models new product forecasting (Bass diffusion) Are you familiar with open source stat packages other than R , that supports these models? ( Python ?)
