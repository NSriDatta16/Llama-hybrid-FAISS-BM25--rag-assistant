Let's say you have a data warehouse that collects data from many points in the company. Hopefully you have a few dimensions that have business folks designated as "dimension owners." These are the people that have a stake in the organization of data in the dimension. They are responsible for keeping things like hierarchies and lists up-to-date but these collections aren't populated with operations data that come from transactional systems, they're business terms and groups and descriptions that the business speaks. This is their natural business language. East Sales Team, Small Business, High Risk, Print-Ad Promotion 25, etc. The point is your data warehouse is built from 99% operations/transactional stuff but it's the business arrangements that makes it all sensible for your users and you need a place to capture it. You certainly can make a web app. You can use an Excel file. Whatever. But you can also use a SharePoint list. Where SharePoint is attractive for this is when the environment already exists (and thus SUPPORTED), when your requirements aren't extensive, i.e., referential integrity not required, you don't have the resources to create a new web app, the business users are already familiar and comfortable with SharePoint, you need it yesterday, etc. So I'm not talking here about writing code and compiling libraries to be installed on SharePoint. I'm just trying to present a reasonable "right time and place" for it to be used. BTW - Here's a very handy how-to on pushing and pulling data between SharePoint lists and SSIS .
