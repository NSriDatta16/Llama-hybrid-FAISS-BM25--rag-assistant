Building a report from a runtime generated datatable

I have a datatable with some data I have read from a CSV file (you helped me yesterday with that, thanks). Now, I want to show a report with some columns of that datatable. It would be easier if I could see the fields and select them from the report designer: I'd just have to drag them to the columns. The problem is that this datatable is generated in runtime, so I can't use the designer. How could I do that? How to make a report with data generated in runtime, and then visualize it in a reportviewer? Thanks in advance!
