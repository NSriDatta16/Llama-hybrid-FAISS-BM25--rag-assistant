Easy SQL Syntax NOT LIKE with AND operators seem to be ignored

Thank you so much for helping! Nothing I seem to do works here. What I want to do is remove rows with a certain value in a certain column. Like so: Where SegStart_Date between getdate()-90 and getdate()-1 And q.Center not like 'Collections Center' And q.Center not like 'Cable Store' And q.Center not like 'Business Services Center' And q.Center not like 'Escalations' Yet all my attempts to NOT are futile as the query returns rows with them anyway. What did I do wrong here? The whole query is provided below: Select segstart, CASE --when hour is = 0 and min 30 then 30 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 0 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('30' as int) --when hour is 1 and min 30 then 130 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 1 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('130' as int) --when hour is 2 and min 30 then 230 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 2 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('230' as int) --when hour is 3 and min 30 then 330 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 3 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('330' as int) --when hour is 4 and min 30 then 430 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 4 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('430' as int) --when hour is 5 and min 30 then 530 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 5 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('530' as int) --when hour is 6 and min 30 then 630 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 6 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('630' as int) --when hour is 7 and min 30 then 730 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 7 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('730' as int) --when hour is 8 and min 30 then 830 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 8 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('830' as int) --when hour is 9 and min 30 then 930 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 9 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('930' as int) --when hour is 10 and min 30 then 1030 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 10 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1030' as int) --when hour is 11 and min 30 then 1130 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 11 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1130' as int) --when hour is 12 and min = 30 THEN CAST('1230' as int) --when hour is 13 and min 30 then 1330 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 13 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1330' as int) --when hour is 14 and min 30 then 1430 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 14 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1430' as int) --when hour is 15 and min 30 then 1530 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 15 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1530' as int) --when hour is 16 and min 30 then 1630 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 16 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1630' as int) --when hour is 17 and min 30 then 1730 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 17 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1730' as int) --when hour is 18 and min 30 then 1830 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 18 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1830' as int) --when hour is 19 and min 30 then 1930 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 19 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('1930' as int) --when hour is 20 and min 30 then 2030 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 20 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('2030' as int) --when hour is 21 and min 30 then 2130 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 21 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('2130' as int) --when hour is 22 and min 30 then 2230 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 22 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('2230' as int) --when hour is 23 and min 30 then 2330 WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, segstart) = 23 AND DATEPART(MINUTE, segstart) >= 30 THEN CAST('2330' as int) ELSE Null End as Interval, FiscalMonthYear, SegStart_Date, dialed_num, callid, Name, t.Queue AS 'Xferto', TransferType, RepLName+', '+RepFName AS Agent, SupLName+', '+SupFName AS Sup, MgrLName+', '+MgrFName AS Manager, q.Center, q.Queue AS 'Xferfrom', e.anslogin, e.origlogin, t.Extension, transferred, disposition, talktime, dispsplit From CMS_ECH.dbo.CaliforniaECH e INNER JOIN Cal_RemReporting.dbo.TransferVDNs t on e.dialed_num = t.Extension INNER JOIN InfoQuest.dbo.IQ_Employee_Profiles_v3_AvayaId q on e.origlogin = q.AvayaID INNER JOIN Cal_RemReporting.dbo.udFiscalMonthTable f on e.SegStart_Date = f.Tdate Where SegStart_Date between getdate()-90 and getdate()-1 And q.Center not like 'Collections Center' And q.Center not like 'Cable Store' And q.Center not like 'Business Services Center' And q.Center not like 'Escalations' And SegStart_Date between RepToSup_StartDate and RepToSup_EndDate And SegStart_Date between SupToMgr_StartDate and SupToMgr_EndDate And SegStart_Date between Avaya_StartDate and Avaya_EndDate And SegStart_Date between RepQueue_StartDate and RepQueue_EndDate AND e.transferred like '1' OR e.disposition like '4' order by center
