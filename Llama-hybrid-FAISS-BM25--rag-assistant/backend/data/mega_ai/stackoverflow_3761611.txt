To do this correctly for any arbitrary sentence you would need to perform natural language analysis of the source sentence. You may want to look into the SharpNLP library - it's a free library of natural language processing tools for C#/.NET. If you're looking for a simpler approach, you have to be willing to sacrifice correctness to some degree. For instance, you could create a dictionary of trigger words, which - when they appear in a sentence - are replaced with synonyms from a thesaurus. The problem with this approach is making sure that you replace a word with an equivalent part of speech. In English, it's possible for certain words to be different parts of speech (verb, adjective, adverb, etc) based on their contextual usage in a sentence. An additional consideration you'll need to address (if you're not using an NLP library) is stemming. In most languages, certain parts of speech are conjugated/modified (verbs in English) based on the subject they apply to (or the object, speaker, or tense of the sentence). If all you want to do is replace adjectives (as in your example) the approach of using trigger words may work - but it won't be readily extensible. Before you do anything, I would suggest that you clearly defined the requirements and rules for your problem domain ... and use that to decide which route to take.
