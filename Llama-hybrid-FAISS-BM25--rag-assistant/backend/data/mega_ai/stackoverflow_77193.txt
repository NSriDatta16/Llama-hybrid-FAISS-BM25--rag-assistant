How do you justify Refactoring work to your penny-pinching boss?

You've just written a pile of code to deliver some important feature under pressure. You've cut a few corners, you've mashed some code into some over-bloated classes with names like SerialIndirectionShutoffManager.. You tell your boss you're going to need a week to clean this stuff up. "Clean what up?" "My code - its a pigsty!" "You mean there's some more bug fixing?" "Not really, its more like.." "You're gonna make it run faster?" "Perhaps, buts thats not.." "Then you should have written it properly when you had the chance. Now I'm glad you're here, yeah, I'm gonna have to go ahead and ask you to come in this weekend.. " I've read Matin Fowler's book, but I'm not sure I agree with his advice on this matter: Encourage regular code reviews, so refactoring work is encouraged as a natural part of the development process. Just don't tell, you're the developer and its part of your duty. Both these methods squirm out of the need to communicate with your manager. What do you tell your boss?
