Statistical models for Obesity data

I have a data on obesity status of women in a country. This data is based on across sectional study. Now I want to find the determinants of obesity among the women. Here dependent variable is binary "obese=1/non-obese=0" based on BMI values. There are several co-variates like women age, education, occupational status, food habit, number of children, place of residence children etc. Can I use Structural Equation Model to find out the risk factors for obesity among women? or Logistic regression is the best option? Is there any other approach to do this?
