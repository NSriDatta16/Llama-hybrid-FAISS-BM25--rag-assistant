SharePoint Field Forcing Links To be Relative

Ive got Note field with FullHTML turned on. I'm trying to storage an image tag with src that points to the server I'm currently on. I set the field to: I then immediately try to read the value back out, and I get: SharePoint has graciously stripped it's own servername out of the url to make it relative. This is going out in an e-mail so I need it to be absolute. Anyone know how to stop this behavior?
