The problem with using neural networks is that you need a robust set of training data--that is, you need to have lots of examples of people using multiple accounts where you already know that's what they're doing. Furthermore, if the people you're trying to identify have ever played a role-playing game, they'll probably be able to make themselves seem quite a bit different if they want to. So, if people are acting just like themselves and you have a pretty good training data set, then you stand a chance. You should probably start with methods used by forensic linguistics . But I suspect that what you'll probably end up doing is identifying people who are sort of similar to each other. Good for a matchmaking site, perhaps; not so cool for most other things. (For example, I would think this would be a perfectly dreadful way to try to find members of Anonymous in other guises.)
