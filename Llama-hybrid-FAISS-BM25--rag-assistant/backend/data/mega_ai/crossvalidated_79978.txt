Seems like an interesting project, and that does seem reasonable, though with some caveats. So here's some thoughts I have. First, you will encounter right-censoring, that is, there will be reported bugs that are still not resolved past the end of your dataset. You absolutely cannot just use the resolution time of resolved bugs and ignore the unresolved bugs - this will give biased results. You could strictly enforce a set observation time (eg/ 1Y past the date the issue is opened); check the resolution status as a binary variable (resolved/not resolved) at the end of that period; and then run a logistic regression. However this potentially loses a lot of information, most obviously status after the cut-off period, and since things like number of mentions (and rate of mentions) during the observation period varies over time, you lose that information as well. Given that you only have 24 hours or so, I'd go with this. Probably the "most correct" way to approach this is to treat it as a survival analysis problem, and use something like a cox proportional hazards model with time varying covariates; with bugs that are still not resolved at the end of your dataset set as censored. Your data would be something like one (binary - resolved/not resolved) observation per day/week/month per bug, and the relevant measured covariates for that day/week/month. I'm not too familiar with these, so I'll avoid further discussion. Second, don't use a ratio as a explanatory variable when the two underlying variables are available! Use the two underlying variables and an interaction term instead. Consider the models $Y = \beta_1A + \beta_2B+\beta_{12}AB$ $Y = \beta_{12}AB$ The second model is implied when you only utilize the ratio. There are quite a few good answers to the question of excluding main effects while including an interaction.
