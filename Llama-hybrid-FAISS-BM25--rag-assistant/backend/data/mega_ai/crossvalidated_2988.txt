Sample size calculation for univariate logistic regression

How does one calculate the sample size needed for a study in which a cohort of subjects will have a single continuous variable measured at the time of a surgery and then two years later they will be classified as functional outcome or impaired outcome. We would like to see if that measurement could have predicted the bad outcome. At some point we may want to derive a cut point in the continuous variable above which we would try to intervene to diminish the probability of the impaired outcome. Any ideas? Any R implementation.
