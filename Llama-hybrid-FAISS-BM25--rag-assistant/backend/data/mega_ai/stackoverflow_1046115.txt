IMHO app.config is not a very convenient way of storing config data, mostly for those two reasons : You have no control over the location of the file You can't define your own structure to organize configuration settings I prefer to use my own configuration class, which I load and save using XML serialization. You still get the benefits of strong typed settings, and it's much more flexible since you can define any structure you want
