You could add some additional logic around your reflection call which tries converting your Integer.class (or whatever) into the corresponding primitive class, and then repeatedly looking up the method until you get a match. If you have Apache Commons Lang, then the wrapperToPrimitive method will do this conversation for you, but writing it yourself is trivial. Perform getMethod as usual If nothing found, then look for any parameter types which have corresponding primitives For each combination of those, perform another lookup until something sticks. Not elegant, and for methods with a lot of primitive parameters, it might even be slow.
