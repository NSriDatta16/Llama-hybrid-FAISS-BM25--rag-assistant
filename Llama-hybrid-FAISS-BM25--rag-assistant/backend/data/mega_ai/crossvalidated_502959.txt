Let's say the Hausman test favors the fixed effect model. Why might you still be interested in using the random effects model? The random effects or multilevel model allows a degree of flexibility in modeling that is much messier and in some cases impossible to implement in the fixed effect model. Examples include: Random slopes for the association between lower level variables and the outcome, which allow you to investigate whether the within-group association varies across groups. A classic example is growth curve modeling whereby the linear (or quadratic) rate of change in the outcome, codified by a continuous time variable) is allowed to vary across individuals or groups. In the fixed effect model, you can get at this in a crude way by interacting the lower-level variable with the cluster dummy variables. If you have a lot of groups, you have a lot of interactions. Related to the above, random effect models allow for interactions between within- and between-level predictors, which are sometimes called cross-level interactions. To investigate these in a random effects models requires three parameters - a random slope for the lower-level predictor, the covariance between the random slope and random intercept, and the fixed effect term for the interaction. This is not possible to investigate in the fixed effects modeling framework because all cluster-level variables are thrown out. Investigation of different within- and between- associations for lower-level variables. Here the interest is investigating whether a within-cluster association is different than the between-cluster association. This is sometimes termed contextual effects modeling and also allows you to identify cases of Simpson's paradox . An example is the association between exercise and having a heart attack. While exercising, one is at higher risk for a heart attack, but on average, individuals who exercise a lot tend to have lower risk for a heart attack. Relatedly, adding in the cluster means of lower-level variables takes care of the endogeneity problem at level 1 often used as a reason to prefer fixed effects models. Prediction - random effects models employ empirical Bayes prediction of the random intercepts and slopes. This is great because the procedure corrects for the reliability of the group's prediction. Smaller groups get pulled toward the sample average prediction.
