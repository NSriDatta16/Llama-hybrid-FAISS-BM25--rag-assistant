undefined reference error

i got undefined reference error from my main function, but i can not find the problem. my files are: //Student.h #ifndef STUDENT_H #define STUDENT_H #include #include class Student{ public: Student(std::string &line); ... virtual void evaluateValue(){} virtual ~Student(){} .... }; #endif //HeStudent.h #ifndef HESTUDENT_H #define HESTUDENT_H #include "Student.h" class HeStudent : public Student{ public: HeStudent(std::string line) : Student(line){ ... } static int AgradesCount; static double Aaverage; virtual void evaluateValue(); virtual ~HeStudent(){} }; #endif for each .h file there is his .cpp file. i've got also a main.cpp file which contains the main and in the main i create: Student stud = new HeStudent(line); i don't know if it's necessary but i included the Student.h and the HeStudent.h and i get some long error and it said: HeStudent::HeStudent(std::basic_string , std::allocator >)]+0x22): undefined reference to `Student::Student can anyone tell me what is the problem?
