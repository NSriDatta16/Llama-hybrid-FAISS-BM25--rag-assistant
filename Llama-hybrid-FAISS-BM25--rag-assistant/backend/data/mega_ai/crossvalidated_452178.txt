How are the variance of an estimate to $\int_Bf\:{\rm }d\mu$ and the deviation of $f$ from the mean $\frac1{\mu(B)}\int_Bf\:{\rm d}\mu$ related?

Let $(E,\mathcal E,\mu)$ be a probability space, $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb N_0}$ be an $(E,\mathcal E)$ -valued ergodic time-homogeneous Markov chain with stationary distribution $\mu$ and $$A_nf:=\frac1n\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(X_i)\;\;\;\text{for }f\in\mathcal L^1(\mu)\text{ and }n\in\mathbb N.$$ Suppose we're estimating an integral $$\mu f=\int f\:{\rm d}\mu$$ for some $f\in\mathcal L^1(\mu)$ and that $$\sqrt n(A_nf-\mu f)\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}\mathcal N(0,\sigma^2(f))\tag1$$ with $$\sigma^2(f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}n\operatorname{Var}[A_nf].$$ Assume that the support $B:=\{f\ne0\}$ is "small", but $\mu(B)>0$ . Now let $$f_B:=1_B\left(f-\frac{\mu(1_Bf)}{\mu(B)}\right).$$ Instead of $\sigma^2(f)$ we could consider $\sigma^2(f_B)$ which, by definition, should tell us something about the deviation of $f=1_Bf$ from its mean . If our concern is the minimization of the asymptotic variance of our estimation of $\mu f$ , does it make sense to consider $\sigma^2(f_B)$ instead of $\sigma^2(f)$ ? How are $\sigma^2(f_B)$ and $\sigma^2(f)$ related? Background : My actual concern is that I need to estimate $\lambda(hf)$ for a variety of $\mathcal E$ -measurable $h:E\to[0,\infty)$ , where $\lambda$ is a reference measure on $(E,\mathcal E)$ so that $\mu$ has a density $p$ with respect to $\lambda$ and $\{p=0\}\subseteq\{f=0\}$ . Now the support $E_0:=\{p>0\}\cap\{h>0\}$ is very "small" and you may assume that $h=1_{\{\:h\:>\:0\:\}}$ . I want to estimate $\lambda(hf)$ using the importance sampling estimator . Say $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb N_0}$ is the chain generated by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with target distribution $\mu$ , $(Y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is the corresponding proposal sequence and $Z_n:=(X_{n-1},Y_n)$ for $n\in\mathbb N$ . If the proposal kernel is denoted by $Q$ , we know that $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ has stationary distribution $\nu:=\mu\otimes Q$ . Now, in light of the special form of the to be estimated integral $\lambda(hf)$ , I thought it might be tempting to consider the Markov chain corresponding to the successive times of its returns to the set $E\times E_0$ . To be precise, let $\tau_0:=0$ and $$\tau_k:=\inf\left\{n>\tau_{k-1}:Y_n\in E_0\right\}\;\;\;\text{for }k\in\mathbb N.$$ Assuming that $E\times E_0$ is a recurrent set for $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ , we know that $\left(Z_{\tau_k}\right)_{k\in\mathbb N}$ is again an ergodic time-homogeneous Markov chain with stationary distribution $$\nu_0:=\frac{\left.\nu\right|_{E\times E_0}}{\nu(E\times E_0)}.$$ I wondered whether it makes sense to build an estimator using $\left(Z_{\tau_k}\right)_{k\in\mathbb N}$ instead of $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ or if this would gain nothing.
