You can mix variable transformations as you wish. If log-transforming one variable and square-root-transforming another works for you, do it; donâ€™t let the fact that they are different transformations stop you. However, do note that feature normality is seldom a requirement of machine learning models. In fact, none of the ones that come to mind for me require it (though I think about GLM and GLM-oid models like neural networks a lot more than I think about most others).
