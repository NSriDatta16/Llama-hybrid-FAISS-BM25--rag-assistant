Do linear or logistic regression models adjust for the correlation between groups?

Suppose I have an ANCOVA model with a continuous dependent variable, $y$ , and a four-group predictor (control/reference, treatment A, B and C), coded as 0,1,2 and 3. $$ y = \beta_0+\beta_1 \text{dummy}_1+\beta_2 \text{dummy}_2+\beta_3 \text{dummy}_3+\epsilon $$ Can we safely assume that the standard error (SE) of the mean differences (SEs of the beta coefficients; each treatment vs control) are adjusted for the correlation created because all treatment groups share the same reference group? Cheers! Jacob
