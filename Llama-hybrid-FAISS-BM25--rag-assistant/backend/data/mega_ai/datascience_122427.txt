Regression model in Python for engineering equipment end of life prediction - improvements and suggestions

I am trying to build a ML prediction model that uses the calculated remaining part life, machine power consumption, and other related process parameters specific to the equipment in question, to determine a model that will be able to predict part life based on power consumption. I have followed the following steps to build the current model: import data Check for null values in the data and drop these rows Visualized the data and seen that its a linear trend between part life (Y) and power consumption (X) (figure 1) Used StandardScaler to normalize the data Split my data into X and Y dataframes I checked the correlation on X data and there is a very strong correlation (all are greater that 0.85). For this reason, I have used Ridge Regression Split my data into train and test splits Fit the data to the ridge regression model using a value of alpha to be 1 From these steps, this is the output I am getting (Figure 2) I have just started with machine learning and I am the only one in my company working on this. Please could you advise if I have followed the correct steps, used the correct logic and where I could improve my modelling for this example?
