There is an another simple option to add a control into Toolbox is, Create a new toolbox tab in the VS Toolbox. Say for e.g. "My Own Control". Drag the assembly which has your control into the newly created tab and drop it . You can see your control added in your Toolbox. Main advantage of this method is, if you have more than a control in your single assembly, you do not need to search in the Add Components dialog and choose them. VS will do it for you and will add all those automatically in Toolbox. Hope this helps.
