It's very complicated. No knows the true oracle function. We just see patterns and guess functions and hope that our guesses are close enough to the unknown oracle. We test our guesses by previous data that we had the chance to also observe their output, and based on that we guess again that since our function have reasonably guessed past data correctly it hopefully might also guess future data correctly. You may use short-term data, long-term data, mid-term data, or do time series analysis by which time is more granular. I think long-term data gives you the general stable seasonal patterns (like seasonal patterns), and short-term data give you the more granular patterns (like daily or monthly weather prediction). But I am not sure about any of this.
