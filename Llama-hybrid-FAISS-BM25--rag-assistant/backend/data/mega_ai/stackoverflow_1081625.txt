A single table query can be cached by the SQL engine. MySQL and its ilk do not cache joined tables. The general rule for performance is to use joins only when necessary. This encourages the DB engine to cache table indexes aggressively and also makes your code easier to adapt to (faster) object databases--like Amazon/Google cloud services force you to.
