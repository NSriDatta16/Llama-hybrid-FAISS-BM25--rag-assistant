Depends what field of data science you want to be in, and what you find most enjoyable. Its entirely possible to be a data scientist with just a physics degree. I did IT because I was interested network analytics, I know people who did psych because they wanted to do people analytics. Business degree to do marketing analytics. If I was to do it again I would major stats, minor comp sci. Because really understand statistical concepts would be a huge plus, and having some programming skills is a huge plus to put you ahead of the pack.
