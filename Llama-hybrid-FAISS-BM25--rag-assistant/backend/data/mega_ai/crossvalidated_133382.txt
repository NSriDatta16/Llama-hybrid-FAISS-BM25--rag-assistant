Try finding the common factors, and model these factors. For instance, you could run PCA , and see if there's a few factors that explain the variance of your 300 series. It is possible that you may find a handful of principal components explain a huge chunk of the variance of all 300 series. In this case you'll model these few factors only. Then you can recover the original series from factors.
