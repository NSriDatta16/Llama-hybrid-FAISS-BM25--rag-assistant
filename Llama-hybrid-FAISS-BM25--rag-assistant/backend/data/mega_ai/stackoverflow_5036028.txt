Symbol or Convention for Representing Endianness?

Is there a symbol, or some other convention, for indicating the endianness of a value/variable/what-have-you in technical writing? That is, if I wanted to describe an algorithm or formula, and represent that formula as a mathematical expression (e.g. X = P + 2 / Y), is there a way of indicating the endianness of one of the variables? For example: The following formula shows you how to calculate a the new pointer value, npnt . When working with the old pointer value, stored in the INT variable pnt , keep in mind that it is stored little-endian, while new and offset are big endian. In order to perform mathematical operations using the value of pnt , you must change pnt to be big-endian. INT pnt = 0x1722 INT new = 0x900F INT offset = 0xF600 npnt = offset + new - pnt This is just a random example. The main thing I am concerned with is the formula itself - without the paragraph explanation above, there is no indication of the endianness of each variable in the formula. The solution I came up with would be to superscript an arrow symbol to the variables like so: npnt → = offset → + new → - pnt ← Or, better yet, put the arrows directly above the variable names (which I can't quite do using the limited HTML of SO). Is there a convention for that? Or is this something that is just never done because I'm describing/representing things wrong in the first place?
