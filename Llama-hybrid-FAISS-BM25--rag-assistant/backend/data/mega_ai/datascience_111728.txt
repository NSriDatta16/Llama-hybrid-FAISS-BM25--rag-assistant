Algorithm for optimally removing items for improving a nearest neighbors embedding

Let's say that you embed a collection of items belonging to multiple classes into a multidimensional space for predicting unseen future items by K Nearest Neighbors. And in a particular scenario it is okay to remove some items from the collection in order to improve the k-nearest neighbor classification that you get from the multidimensional embedding of the collection. What may be particular terms, algorithms or applicable areas of research that may fit this scenario? Naively, one could prune away items which fail to correctly classify from the embedding or which participate many times in wrongly classifying other items by being their (incorrect class) closest neighbor until some overall accuracy measure is reached, but obviously this is an optimization problem. Are there any known algorithms applicable to this use case?
