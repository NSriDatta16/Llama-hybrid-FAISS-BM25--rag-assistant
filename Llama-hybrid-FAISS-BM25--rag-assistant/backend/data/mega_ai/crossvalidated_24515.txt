This question cannot be answered generically. It even depends on the multi-class classification strategy that you are using (i.e. one-vs-one, one-vs-rest, ...). Personally, I would use an SVM and choose an multi-class strategy that fit my problem and my computational resources. A nice paper how to do that is: Reducing Multiclass to Binary: A Unifying Approach for Margin Classifiers Erin L Allwein, Robert E Schapire, Yoram Singer in Journal of Machine Learning Research (2001) If you want every class of your dataset to be equally important you can either use the quick and dirty hack of cloning datapoints in the smaller classes until each class has the same number of datapoints or you could use an SVM implementation that allows you to set different penalization constants C for each class.
