RewriteCond is applied to exactly one rewrite rule. To match all user agents containing 'mobile' in it's name .* - 0 or more any character should be used in ^.+mobile.+$ statement. RewriteRule by default doesn't include query string - [QSA] flag should be used to include query string. RewriteRule uses regexp - you should use \. to escape dots. RewriteRule automatically saves query string the same, if not specified another. UPDATED: Complete .htacess : RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*mobile.*$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.php $1iphone.php [L] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*mobile.*$ [NC] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1iphone.php [L]
