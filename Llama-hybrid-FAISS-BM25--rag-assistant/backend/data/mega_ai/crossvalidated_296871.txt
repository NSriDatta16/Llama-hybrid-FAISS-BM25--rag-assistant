What time series statistical model can help me check lagged influences among different series?

When I was talking with a friend, he told me that it is possible to estimate the effect of some variable (a rise, for example) at time $t$ would impact another variable in time $t + n$ where n could be 2,3,4,5... by some $\beta$ parameter. I am wondering if this type of relationship that is estimated by VAR (Vector auto-regression) can solve by analyzing the parameter estimations and forecasting; and through Impulse response analysis. Is that the case? If not, what sort of models can estimate this lagged effect across different variables?
