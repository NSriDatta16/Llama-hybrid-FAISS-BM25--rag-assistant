Big O Notation Homework--Code Fragment Algorithm Analysis?

For homework, I was given the following 8 code fragments to analyze and give a Big-Oh notation for the running time. Can anybody please tell me if I'm on the right track? //Fragment 1 for(int i = 0; i I'm thinking O(N) for fragment 1 //Fragment 2 for(int i = 0; i O(N) for fragment 2 as well //Fragment 3 for(int i = 0; i O(N^2) for fragment 3 //Fragment 4 for(int i = 0; i O(N) for fragment 4 //Fragment 5 for(int i = 0; i O(N^2) for fragment 5 but the n * n is throwing me off a bit so I'm not quite sure //Fragment 6 for(int i = 0; i O(N^2) for fragment 6 as well //Fragment 7 for(int i = 0; i O(N^3) for fragment 7 but once again the n * n is throwing me off //Fragment 8 for(int i = 1; i O(N) for fragment 8
