Android align Image Buttons on a curve?

I have a series of buttons on a main menu. Instead of the standard side by side, or one on top of the other, I'd like them to be aligned around a semi-circle. Since I can't drag and drop the buttons to the place I'd like to in the designer, I was wondering the best way to do this? Can I do it in the XML, or would it be best to do it programatically?
