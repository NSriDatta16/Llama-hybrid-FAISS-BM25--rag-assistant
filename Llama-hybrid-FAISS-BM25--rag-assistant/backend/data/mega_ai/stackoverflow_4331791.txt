I think your approach with Taxonomy Access Control may be work, but assigning users to a taxonomy for the proper permissions would require a bit of custom code. Using Organic Groups might provide more robust access out of the box (each shop is a group, and products are then published in that group), but you would need to theme a lot of the defaults away in order to hide the forum/wall-of-news workflow that OG comes with out of the box (this can be done with the hooks OG provides). The advantage here is that to add product managers to a shop, you would simply make them the group administrator (a shop could have more than one admin this way). You would set each group as public (so all products are visible), but only grant permission to edit nodes in the group to the admin of that group. Group admins would also be the only ones with permission to create product nodes, which would be setup as group nodes (this is done at the node-type edit screen, or at the OG admin screen).
