.NET User Agent parsing

Comparing the following User Agent strings for different browsers: IE8 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0 ; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; InfoPath.3; .NET4.0E) Firefox 3 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16 Chrome 10 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.204 Safari/534.16 I see there is consistency between Firefox and Chrome in displaying the Browser name (in bold in samples above), however IE shows it at an entirely different location in the string... How does the HttpBrowserCapabilitiesBase class parse this string? And how can I use this parser (or a custom one) to work with the Wurfl repository? (E.g. I cannot find User_agent="IE6" anywhere in the repository while this is used on Win mobile) These are the variables from the .NET HttpBrowserCapabilitiesBase class in the Request object.
