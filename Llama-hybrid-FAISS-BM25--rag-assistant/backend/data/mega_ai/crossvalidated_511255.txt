Wilcoxon signed-rank test for count-proportions?

Let's say that I have several agents able to take action A or B, and I am interested in showing that taking action A is more likely . So I have a table that looks something like A B 10 2 14 6 ... ... where each row corresponds to the actions taken by a single agent over the course of the experiment. The columns are not normally distributed and are paired by rows, so I am using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. I get different p-values depending on whether I treat the data as counts, or as probabilities/proportions (i.e. normalizing by row sums, so the first row becomes $10/12\approx0.833$ , $2/12\approx0.166$ ). My question is, which is more appropriate? Thanks!
