Model averaging parameter estimates for glmer models using AICmodavg in R

I encounter the following error trying to calculate model-averaged parameter estimates across a set of GLMM models using the AICmodavg package version 2.3.1. in RStudio(version1.2.5) ERROR: Error in fam.link.mer(i) : object 'fam.type' not found My code: modavgShrink(cand.set = all.glmer[cand.models], parm = "Nosocomial") where all.glmer is a list of models and 'cand.models' specifies which models to choose. However, the error persists regardless of which models are assessed. all.glmer was derived as follows: all.glmer Example model from candidate list The most complicated model in all.glmer looks like this (notice family and link are reported): Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Adaptive Gauss-Hermite Quadrature, nAGQ = 0) [glmerMod] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: cbind(Resistant, NotResistant) ~ 1 + Nosocomial + Commensal + Zoonosis + Humantransmission + NaturallyCompetent + Bactericidal.Static + Pathogentype + TransmissionType + ResearchEffortPath + AntibioticDate + ResearchEffortAntibiotic + EnvrionmentalReservoir + DrugUseTotal + Conjugation + (1 | PathogenName) + (1 | Antibiotic) + (1 | DrugClass) Data: ..3 AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 56958.03 57052.34 -28459.02 56918.03 805 Random effects: Groups Name Std.Dev.

Why is AICmodavg unable to pull out fam.type? Thank you Amrita
