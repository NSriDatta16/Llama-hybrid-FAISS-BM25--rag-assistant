If you take the approach of "remove things until it won't compile" you need to be very careful about transitive runtime dependencies. If there's a good quality test suite, it can help, but you'll certainly need to run a test coverage tool like Cobertura to make sure that enough of the code is getting tested to exercise your full dependency graph. How much code are you talking about? The review-based approach suggested by Joeri frankly seems the best to me; it has the added advantage of making you at least superficially familiar with all parts of the system. If you're just inheriting a big project, this is something you should probably take the time to do anyway.
