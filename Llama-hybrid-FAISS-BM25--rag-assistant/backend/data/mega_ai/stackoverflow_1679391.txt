How to combine DataTrigger and EventTrigger?

NOTE I have asked the related question (with an accepted answer): How to combine DataTrigger and Trigger? I think I need to combine an EventTrigger and a DataTrigger to achieve what I'm after: when an item appears in my ListBox, it should flash for a few moments if the item is 'Critical' then it should remain highlighted Currently I have a DataTemplate that looks like this: The idea is that an EventTrigger animates the Highlight border's opacity between 0 and 1 and back again repeatedly when the item is first loaded, drawing the user's attention to it. The DataTrigger determines the number of times to animate. If the view model reports that the item IsCritical then the animation occurs 5.5 times (such that it ends at opacity 1), otherwise it occurs 5 times (ending at opacity 0.) However the above XAML doesn't work because the DataTrigger's setter fails with: Child with Name 'LoadedAnimation' not found in VisualTree. Fair enough. So, shy of using a custom value converter or putting the animation count on the view model and binding to it, what are my options?
