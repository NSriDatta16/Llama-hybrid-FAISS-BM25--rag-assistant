Text classification problem using Python or R

I am a novice in machine learning and new to NLP. I am looking for ideas on how to solve the below two problems. I have a dataset with two columns, "Titles" and "Description". Titles column has names of clinical lab tests and description column has description about results of corresponding laboratory test( can be seen below). There many titles specific to a particular lab test. Title Description Complete blood test RBC: Normocytic and Normochromic COMPLETE Blood test\ Platelets: Adequate on the smear Blood glucose COLOUR - COLOURLESS Complete blood picture WBC: Total and Differential counts are within normal limits I have only shared a small part of the data frame. Problem 1: I have manually grouped the similar looking titles. For example, I have grouped the titles in the above data frame as "Blood Test". Is there a way to use NLP technique to group similar looking titles ( As shown below). Problem 2: Based on the description, i have manually labeled a particular outcome for a lab test as normal or abnormal. Again i am looking for a way to do this without having to manually label the outcome (As shown below). Title Description Outcome Blood Test RBC: Normocytic and Normochromic Normal Blood Test Platelets: Adequate on the smear Normal Blood Test COLOUR - COLOURLESS Normal Blood Test WBC: Total and Differential counts Normal Any suggestions or resources to help me get started would be appreciated.
