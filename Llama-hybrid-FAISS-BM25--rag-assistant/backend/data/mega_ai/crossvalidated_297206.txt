The most natural and intuitive measure of association/similarity between two nominal variables with the same categories is Dice coefficient which, for nominal data, is equal to the average co-occurence aka average match occasions ak–∞ relative agreement size. Here discussing similarity measures between individuals when attributes are nominal I explained it - how it can be computed from dummy data or from counting co-occurence instances. Presently we want to compute Dice between variables, not individuals. This situation is simply that one transposed. Let us borrow the example data from that linked answer and compute Dice between columns A fnd B rather than between every two rows. For speed & economy, we'll use co-occurence or match counting approach, not dummy data approach. So, simply flag, in each row, whether the two variables codes match (1) or doesn't (0). Then sum and divide by the number of rows. ID A B Match 1 2 1 0 2 1 2 0 3 3 2 0 4 1 1 1 5 2 1 0 --- Sum=1 Dice = 1/5 Equivalent way to compute Dice will be through AxB frequency crosstabulation. Sum the diagonal frequencies (the trace) and divide by the total table frequency. Crosstab B 1 2 3 _______ 1| 1 1 0 A 2| 2 0 0 3| 0 1 0 trace=1, total=5 Dice = 1/5 The association measure is the matching association/similarity measure between nominal variables. I.e. it is based on the obvious fact that since we have two nominal variables with the same categories, the ground of association is only whether two values in a row are same or not same. Note please that a number of other popular measures for binary data, when applied to dummy data (and nominal data are representable as dummy data) are linearly related to Dice. Measures based of crosstable Chi-square statistic (Cramer's V or Phi coefficient) won't do because they treat boosted count in any cell as the sign of that association is present. But we are interested only by boost in diagonal cells because they are "matches". Cohen's kappa is equal to $[Dice-Pr(e)] / [1-Pr(e)]$, where Pr(e) is the hypothetical value of random relative agreement (whereas Dice is the observed relative agreement), $Pr(e) = \sum(R_iC_i)/N^2$, where Ri and Ci are marginal counts in row i and in column i and N is the total count.
