How to disable Browser Caching for a specific View in ASP.NET MVC Environment?

I want to disable Browser Caching in a specific View. I tried Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); in a controller that returns the View, but that does not work. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you.
