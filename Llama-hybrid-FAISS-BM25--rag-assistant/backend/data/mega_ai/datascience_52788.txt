Sounds okay. However, I assume you make a prediction for each fold and average them to test the accuracy? There are basically three ways to tune hyperparameters. Random search (as you do), gridsearch (search over a range of values), and Bayesian optimization. The latter can be much more efficient. Here is a good resource for BO: http://krasserm.github.io/2018/03/21/bayesian-optimization/
