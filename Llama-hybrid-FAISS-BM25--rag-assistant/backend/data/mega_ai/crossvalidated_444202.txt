As @Dimitris Rizopoulos notes in another answer, were you to model the age categories as random effects you would be assuming that the coefficients for the age categories represent a sample from an underlying normal distribution. Think about whether that is a realistic or a useful assumption. In terms of being a realistic assumption, what is the underlying normally distributed population from which you would be sampling? It can be OK to have a random effect represented in your data by just a few samples from an underlying normal distribution, which might appear to be a discrete distribution. As the paper linked in a comment by @kjetil_b_halvorsen shows, it's possible to use a discrete distribution to mimic that underlying normal distribution. But would that represent your situation well? Given human lifespans, there is only a handful of non-overlapping 10-year age windows. So I question whether that's a realistic assumption in your case. In terms of being a useful assumption, I would suspect some important systematic relationship between age and the number of sick days per month. People tend to get sicker as they get older. A systematic relationship like that would not be captured by treating coefficients for age categories as a sample from a normal distribution. A systematic relationship of a predictor with outcome is better handled by modeling as a fixed effect, most simply as a categorical factor (without the restriction to sampling from a normal distribution implicit in the random-effect model), maybe better as an ordered categorical predictor, and probably best as a flexibly modeled continuous predictor, as @Dimitris Rizopoulos also suggested. There is, however, one important random effect you should be taking into account: the individuals in your sample. As you say in your second edit: one person is in several groups over the year with different amounts of sick days and a different salary so the individuals in your data would seem best to be modeled with random effects in some way. Although modeling with a discrete random effect might not be useful for frequentist modeling in your situation, a Bayesian model would be quite amenable to your desire to treat a discrete predictor as a random effect. In Bayesian modeling parameter values are assumed to represent samples from underlying probability distributions. As the Wikipedia page puts it: In Bayesian inference, probabilities can be assigned to model parameters. Parameters can be represented as random variables. Bayesian inference uses Bayes' theorem to update probabilities after more evidence is obtained or known. In Bayesian modeling the fixed versus random distinction thus can disappear. If you wish to model a random effect based on some discrete distribution that would be quite natural. You would not have to assume an underlying normal distribution as tends to be the default for frequentist regression models. In a frequentist approach I suppose you could consider specifying a particular type of distribution for random effects sampled from a discrete distribution. You would then have to specify the form of the likelihood to optimize based on the nature of that distribution, and deal with the ML versus REML issue in the optimization.
