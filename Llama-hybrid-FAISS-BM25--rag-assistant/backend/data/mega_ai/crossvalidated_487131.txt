For practical purposes it's better to calculate residuals as "actual minus predicted": When trying to guess what the physical cause of an outlier data point might be, it gives a better intuitive sense to have an unusually large positive observed value have a large positive residual, and this is precisely what you get when you calculate the residual in the usual way as "actual minus predicted". See also Stephan Kolassa's summary above of four arguments for "actual minus predicted". The textbooks from which I learnt always taught residuals were (Observed - Expected), in line with Fisher historically as noted by @Aksakal, and contrary to Gauss as noted by @NickCox. Philosophically this corresponds to assuming our model is perfect, and observed deviations from our model are random errors. Although the reverse (predicted minus actual) is equivalent for mathematical purposes, in philosophical terms it would be assuming the data is perfect and the model inadequate...which is true but not helpful and might lead to boring discussions over the scientific method, statistical testing and Bayesian thinking. In terms of popularity, references to "Observed minus Expected" residuals are listed more than twelve times as often as the reverse in a Google search today, so O-E ("actual minus predicted") is clearly still the "standard".
