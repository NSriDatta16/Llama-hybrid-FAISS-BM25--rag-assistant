LINQ is only incidentally about databases. It's really Microsoft's idea of a more comprehensive abstraction for structured data access in general. But since it's first manifestation was LINQ-to-SQL, that's the first perception people have had. And of course developers, especially those not too comfortable with SQL, have loved it. But I'd consider it more an alternative to SQL than to the other items you mentioned. Should you start using LINQ? I'd say first read the Microsoft site info and see if you agree with it conceptually. I think it's a good conceptual idea, Microsoft has bright people working on it, and there's not much competition. So as long as you're firmly on-board as .NET organization, you'll probably like it. There's some indication that the non-Microsoft world will eventually join too, timing undetermined.
