Oh sweet! You were very close, but close enough the get me the answer. To apply all filters, the return true needs to move outside the foreach loop (shown below). But yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for. One question, or comment. What really threw me about this function was the x variable. I had to run and debug the code to figure out that the x was going to be of type . I've never seen a variable that didn't have a type or var declaration before and that really threw me. Can you explain a bit the C# rules for allowing the variable x without any kind of declaration? Very elegant solution by the way. static Func CombineWithAnd (IEnumerable > filters) { return x => { foreach (var filter in filters) { if (!filter(x)) { return false; } } return true; }; }
