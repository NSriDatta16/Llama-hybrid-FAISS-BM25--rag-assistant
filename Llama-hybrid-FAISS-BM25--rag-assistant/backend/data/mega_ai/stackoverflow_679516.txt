Leaving aside the refactoring issue, AspectJ (or similar) seems the easiest way to transparently catch/report these exceptions. You should be able to configure such that it'll weave the try/catch around the method calls even if you add new ones (the code block above would, I suspect, be quite fragile in the face of someone modifying that code without fully understanding the rationale behind it)
