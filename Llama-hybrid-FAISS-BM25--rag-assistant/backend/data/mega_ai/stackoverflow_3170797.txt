First off I'd suggest using non-obtrusive Javascript. I presume you're trying to sort the list of links and keep track of their position. jQuery has built-in support for sortable/draggable functionality like this. Also, this rails cast shows how to create such sortable lists (although it uses Prototype JS framework).
