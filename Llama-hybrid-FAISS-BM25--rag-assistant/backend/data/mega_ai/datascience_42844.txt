I have found the solution. And I've written the code for it, for anyone interested please check: https://github.com/offchan42/superkeras/blob/master/permutational_layer.py It's an implementation from a paper. It's about pairing all 2 inputs and use the model that takes in 2 inputs. The model are shared and the output of them are summarized using average. This preserve the permutational invariance in every layer while also making the input sees each other all the time.
