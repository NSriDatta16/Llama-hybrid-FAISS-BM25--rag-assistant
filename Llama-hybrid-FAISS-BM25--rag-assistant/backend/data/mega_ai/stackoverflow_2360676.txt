I'm assuming you are talking about the event bubbling aspect of it. It would be helpful to see your HTML for the said span elements as well. I can't see why you'd want to change the core behavior like this, I don't find it at all annoying. I suggest going with your second block of code: $('span').click(function (){ doStuff2(); doStuff1(); }); Most importantly I think you'll find it more organized if you manage all the events for a given element in the same block like you've illustrated. Can you explain why you find this annoying?
