If you are worried of having many command on you MainWindow ViewModel and using a ribbon, you could try giving a separate ViewModel for every tab you have. In an application I'm currently developing, for example, I separated each ribbon tab into a separate UserControl (which extends RibbonTabItem, because I'm using the Fleent Ribbon). Those views have their on ViewModels. Actually, those ViewModels are dependency injected using a MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework) importing constructor, as well as the tabs are dependecy injected to the MainWindow using its importing constructor. While this approach is probably a gigantic overkill, it has some flexibily. Note that referencing to command on a certain tab from the MainWindow itself isn't a problem, because the MainWindow's ViewModel can have a tab's ViewModel dependency injected into itself and expose some commands of it; or some command can come in form of a specific ViewModel that is injected into all the ViewModels that need it (the latter is probably the cleaner...)
