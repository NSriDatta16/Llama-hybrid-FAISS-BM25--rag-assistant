Classify the main semantic relation of a sentence using keras

I tried to ask in SO, but they told me to ask here. I have a big dataset like this: RELATION SENTENCE color The cat is black color My dog is white place Des Moines is in Iowa place Des Moines is the capital of Iowa is-a Des Moines is a city is-a 3D printer is a type of printer is-a New Beetle was a car by Volkswagen ... I need to build a classifier that, given a sentence, returns a relation as accurately as possible. I have already programmed something with keras (python), but in this case I really don't know where to start from. For the moment I only realized that an important feature could be the order of the words in the sentence, but I don't know how to explot this. Do you have some hint? E.g. about features, embeddings, hidden layers. May LSTM be a good NN? Why? I hope this is not too broad, but I just need some hint.
