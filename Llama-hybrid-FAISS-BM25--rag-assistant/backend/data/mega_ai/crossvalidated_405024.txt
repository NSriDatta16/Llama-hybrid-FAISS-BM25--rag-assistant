What Null hypothesis does vegan::anova.cca(by = "terms") test against?

I ran a distance-based Redundancy Analysis with the vegan R-package. Statistical significance of axes and explanatory variables can be tested with the anova.cca() function. Form Legendre et al. 2011, I know that the test of the individual axes tests "The null hypothesis for the test of significance of the jth axis is H0: the linear dependence of the response variables Y on the explanatory variables X is less than j-dimensional". But what is the null hypothesis when testing environmental variables? -- Legendre, P., Oksanen, J., & ter Braak, C. J. F. (2011). Testing the significance of canonical axes in redundancy analysis. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2(3), 269â€“277.
