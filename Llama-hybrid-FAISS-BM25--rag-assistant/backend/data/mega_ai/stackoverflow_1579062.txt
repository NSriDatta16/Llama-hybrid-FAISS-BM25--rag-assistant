There is also another problem with structs and it is the alignment of data members on different platforms. If you want a stable and portable solution, you can solve this by implementing "serialize" method for your data structure in such a way that serialize will produce byte stream (or more commonly, output to the byte stream). Then, you can use hash algorithm with the serialized stream. In such a way, you will be able to solve the problems you mentioned by explicit traversion of your data. As other additional features you will get ability to save your data onto hdd or to send it over the network. For the strings, you can implement Pascal type storage where length comes first.
