"Periodical" ACF

I'm working with a time series data set in R. I've removed the trend and the seasonality but the ACF of the residuals has a "periodical" shape: What does this mean? I've tried with both a multiplicative model and an additive model. I'm trying to identify what ARIMA process my time series could correspond to. I'm sorry if the question seems trivial, it's my first time trying to make data fit a model.
