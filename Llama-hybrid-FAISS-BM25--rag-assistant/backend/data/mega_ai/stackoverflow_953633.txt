In Flash, what's the difference between the SWF header FPS and the Stage FPS?

In ActionScript, what's the difference between the SWF header FPS and the Stage FPS? From what I understand, the Stage FPS is initially copied from the SWF header FPS, but is that all the header FPS is for? Can it ever override the Stage FPS? Just to clarify, I set the header FPS using the SWF metadata tag - [SWF(frameRate="60")] - and the Stage FPS using "stage.frameRate = 60". Also, where can I find a good description of the way Flash handles the set FPS? I'd like to know if it's a limit, an average, a target, etc.
