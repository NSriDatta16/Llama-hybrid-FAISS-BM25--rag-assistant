Expression for the prior predictive density for a multivariate normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown variance?

I am trying to find the expression for the prior predictive density for a multivariate normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown variance. In the short document Bayesian Inference for the Multivariate Normal is given for a single observable $w$ : As you can see, the expression for a single observable is a multivariate T-distribution. However, I want the expression for the entire data set $w_1, w_2, ..., w_N$ . As you can see, it is stated: If we sum up the sample density over the N observations we get the marginal likelihood, or model evidence [here, sample density refers to the prior predictive density for a single observable] [here, marginal likelihood refers to the prior predictive density for the entire data set]. I don't see how the expression for the entire data set can be the sum of N multivariate T-distributions. I suspect it is instead a single multivariate T-distribution. Perhaps by "sum", the author means something else. It would be great if someone can give the expression for the entire data set. Thanks, MM P.S. In the text book Bayesian Theory by Bernardo and Smith, they give the following table: My suspicion is that the expression for the marginal likelihood p(x1, x2, ..., xn) is obtained from p(x) by replacing k in the multivariate student t-distribution with k * n. Am I right?
