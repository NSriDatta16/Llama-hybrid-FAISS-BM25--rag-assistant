The question is unclear as making inference on a sum of observations $$S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ is meaningless since $S_n$ is observed . If the problem is to make inference on a parameter $\theta$ driving the law of the observations given $S_n$ , i.e., assuming only $S_n$ is observed, said inference must rely on the likelihood $\ell_n(\theta|s_n)$ of the observation, namely $S_n$ . There is nothing specifically Bayesian in the problem, but the posterior distribution on $\theta$ would then be $$\pi(\theta|S_n=s_n) \propto \pi(\theta) \times \ell_n(\theta|s_n)$$
