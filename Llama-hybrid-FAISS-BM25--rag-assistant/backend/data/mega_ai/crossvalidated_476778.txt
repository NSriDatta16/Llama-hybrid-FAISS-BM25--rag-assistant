CLT applies to continuous distributions (e.g., trivially for sampling from a normal distribution). One requirement for CLT is that the population is stationary so that it even makes sense to talk of, say, the mean of the population. (Technical note: you can actually have a degree of non-stationarity as specified by the Lindeberg Condition and still achieve convergence — yet the question remains if the resulting normal distribution is relevant to your question) If the underlying characteristics of your sample space are changing then you are dealing with a non-stationary population. In this case, does it even make sense to ask about the population mean? Normally, you’ll need to account for the evolution of the system using the tools of time series analysis — de-trend, remove periodic/cyclical behavior, etc so that you are back to sampling from a stationary distribution and have firmer ground to interpret your results.
