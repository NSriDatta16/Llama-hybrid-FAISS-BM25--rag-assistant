Why doesn't logistic regression pull the predictions to the mean?

Below is the toy example (a logistic regression with 2 categorical predictors) set.seed(1) y=round(runif(150)) x1 = round(runif(150)+.2) cat = c(rep(1,30), rep(2,70), rep(3,50)) cat = factor(cat) x2 = model.matrix(~cat)[,2:3] data = data.frame(cbind(x1,x2,y)) logistic = glm(y~x1 + cat2 + cat3, data=data,family = "binomial") preds = predict(logistic, data,type="response") data$predictions = preds > # Global mean > mean(data $y) [1] 0.4933333 > # Prediction > mean(data$ predictions[data $x1==1 & data$ cat2==1 & data $cat3 == 0]) [1] 0.4433128 > # Group mean > mean(data$ y[data $x1==1 & data$ cat2==1 & data$cat3 == 0]) [1] 0.4489796 I thought the prediction should be pulled closer to the global mean by the intercept compared to the group mean but it is not the case here. Intuitively, the reason I think so is because here we use data from all groups to build 1 model instead of separate models for each group. Therefore the predictions will be influenced by all observations across all groups and I feel like that influence should make the predictions closer to the global mean. I think my understanding is wrong. Really appreciate any help.
