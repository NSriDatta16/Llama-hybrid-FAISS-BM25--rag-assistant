Mapping CSV to a Model

I am writing a simple CSV to XML processor in Java. I am using JAXB to generate a model in java from a DTD. I need to process the CSV format into this model, and then marshall it into the XML that complies to the DTD. I am using JAXB to marhall the data from the Java model to the XML. I have to write the CSV-Model mapping myself. At the moment, I can think of no better solution than to straight map the CSV to the Java model by reading it in and assigning it to the model in code. Is there a more elegant solution to this that you can think of? Perhaps some reusable mapping library etc? Thanks in advance.
