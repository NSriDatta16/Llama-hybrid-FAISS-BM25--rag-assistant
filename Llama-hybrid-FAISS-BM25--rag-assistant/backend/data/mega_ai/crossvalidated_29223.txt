In addition to King's answer that the research organization should retain the IDs but keep them separate from the real identities, there are other measures you should put in place to protect the anonymity of the findings in a situation like this: the client should never have access to the raw data, so even if they could connect the ID to the real identity, they couldn't connect it to the survey findings you need to have clear policies when you can report what level of detail about the data. For example, quantitative data shall not be reported on groups of less than 5; open-ended response comments will not be reported on groups of less than 25, etc. identifying information disclosed in reports should be kept to a minimum. For example, things like work department, job title groups, etc. should only be included where it is relevant for the purpose at hand.
