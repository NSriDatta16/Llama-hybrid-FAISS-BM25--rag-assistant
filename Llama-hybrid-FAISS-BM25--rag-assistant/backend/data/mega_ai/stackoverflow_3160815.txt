Single developer process/practice/infrastructure recommendations

So, I'm about to embark on a fairly lengthy, time consuming project that could net me some good results/rewards - and I'd like to give everything the attention and focus it deserves. I will be the sole developer, and I'm experienced in that capacity (about 13 years in the industry). I've just never had to be responsible for EVERY choice so I'd like to throw this out there for some feedback. This is going to be a website. Dev Tools on Win x64 workstation: VS2010 SourceGear Client FileZilla UltraEdit SQL 2008 Mgmt Studio I will have my own DB Server machine also, which will run SQL 2008 for both the web DB and will host the Soucegear repository DB. I'd like to have an automated build process that includes pulling the latest code from the repository checking it against rules (ala FX Cop) compile the code running a series of tests against the new compilation (unit tests?) Any suggestion on tools to do these tasks? Should I just write & execute scripts to do certain steps? Backups! - I'd like the source code repository and web files, graphics, media, etc. for the site backed up regularly. I use Mozy for my own personal backups - is there something more suitable for this kind of backup? Windows Home Server or something like that perhaps? Lastly - what am I not thinking of that needs to be on my radar? For example, I plan on using jQuery but only have limited experience with it - any good javascript tools besides VS2010? How to most web devs test their sites across the plethora of browsers available? Should I use minify-ing tools for the web content - which are best? I've built plenty of web sites & applications before - this is just my first real "commercial" venture and I'd like it be founded in solid practices.
