How to represent a Board Panel in Java for a game?

I wanna fix a 2D board for a game. I've already fixed other panels for the Gui and everything goes well. But the panel for the board cant be printed on the window. I'm a bit confused about it as i think i've followed the same ideas as for the others panels i need. Here's what i've done: EDIT : what I'm trying to do is fix a board panel for the game according to the dimensions of the it,hold every square in an array in order to use it after wherever it;s needed. I draw each little square of it with the method draw and put it back to the panel. So, each square on the board is a panel. This is the idea. But as u can see. There are troubles/errors on it. EDIT: code updated. just found a part of the problem. i thought first that i had set background to squared, but i didnt. with this one it appears on the panel a wide black "column". Unfortunately,still none squares. :( One More EDIT: Also,i realized that draw method is never called. when i put the draw method in the following method i can see the squares but they remain small. I redefine them with setSize but still no change. How can I use paint method to edit the panels properly???? As it is now it can't. Even it can't return an object(eg panel) as it's polymorphic void! /** *Method used to construct the square in the area of the *gui's grid. In this stage a GUISquare array is being constructed, * used in the whole game as *a mean of changing a square graphical state. *@param squares is the squares array from whom the gui grid will be *constructed. *@see getSquare about the correspondance beetween a squareModel and * a GUISquare. */ private void initBoardPanel(SquareModel[][] squares){ BoardPanel.setLayout(new GridLayout(height ,width )); //set layout SquareRenderer[][] Squares; JPanel[][] grid; Squares=new GUISquare[height][width()]; grid=new JPanel[height()][width()]; for (int i=0; i IMPLEMENTED BY SQUARERENDERER: /** * Transformer for Snake/Ladder * This method is used to display a square on the screen. */ public void paintPanel(int i,int j) { JPanel panel = new JPanel(); panel.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); JLabel label1 = new JLabel("Move To"+myGame.getSquares()[i][j].getGoTo()); JLabel label2 = new JLabel(""+myGame.getSquares()[i][j].getSquare()); JSeparator CellSeparator = new JSeparator(orientation); panel.add(CellSeparator); panel.setForeground(Color.ORANGE); panel.add(label2, BorderLayout.NORTH); panel.add(label1, BorderLayout.CENTER); }
