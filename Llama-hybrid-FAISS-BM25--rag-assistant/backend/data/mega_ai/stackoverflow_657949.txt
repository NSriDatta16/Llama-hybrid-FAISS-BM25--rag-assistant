I think your organisation's decision to restrict its application to users of Internet Explorer is a business choice, and whilst it may be short sighted, I'd hardly regard it as an ethical or moral issue. Now if your company was advocating clubbing baby seals or spraying toxic waste into the sea I think I might be taking another look at my career options. Those are real 'ethical' and 'moral' issues. If the job pays well and they treat you nice then suck it up.
