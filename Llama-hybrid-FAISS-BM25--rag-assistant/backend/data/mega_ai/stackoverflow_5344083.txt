Scratch is a graphical drag-and-drop language developed by MIT. It is used in a number of grade schools and other educational institutions to teach principles of programming. It primarily focuses on developing games or other graphics-intensive applications, but it can be used for other tasks as well. The code interface consists of 'blocks' that are dropped into the editor window and then hooked together to perform tasks. Manipulation of 'sprite' objects is main focus of the language.
