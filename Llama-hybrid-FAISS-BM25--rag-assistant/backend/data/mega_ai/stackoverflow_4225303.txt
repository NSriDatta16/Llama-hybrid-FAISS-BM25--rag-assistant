What about authorization? I'm using this plugin with Restful authentication for authentication. With it I define roles and where it can access, and give a role to each user. The user log in and the controller (or the view) checks the user's permissions and respond properly (you'll need to code a bit, but it's the most elegant and safer way, I think).
