Is there an ldap server implementation that can query smtp for usernames/passwords?

My organization does not have a central LDAP server, but they do have a mail server. Is there some software out there (open source, hopefully) that acts as an LDAP server on the front end, but can query an SMTP instance on the fly to populate with users and passwords and present that as LDAP?
