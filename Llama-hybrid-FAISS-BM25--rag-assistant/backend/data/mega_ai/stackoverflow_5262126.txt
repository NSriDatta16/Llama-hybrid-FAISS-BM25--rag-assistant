I recently built something for our organisation more as a cache-buster for use with IE than anything else. If you could check your output script has the following in it, somewhere at least:- response.setHeader("Pragma", "public"); response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "max-age=0"); response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=\"" + yourfilenamehere + "\""); Hope this is of some help anyway. The content-disposition thing seemed to be the one that was flaking IE out to be fair, but the caching ones are just practice in my opinion when pulling a file from disk. Good Luck with your fix!
