Disable browser cache for entire ASP.NET website

I am looking for a method to disable the browser cache for an entire ASP.NET MVC Website I found the following method: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(System.Web.HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); And also a meta tag method (it won't work for me, since some MVC actions send partial HTML/JSON through Ajax, without a head, meta tag). But I am looking for a simple method to disable the browser cache for an entire website.
