At the end of the day, the primary driver for most businesses is results i.e. making money. If the business sees that it can achieve the desired outputs necessary for the operation without spending thousands on software but through "shadow IT", then I can only see it being encouraged. I feel that that it is part of our job as developers to point out the pitfalls in operating in this fashion. The pros of "shadow IT" could be cost - less expensive whilst the people writing the software may not be software experts, they are likely to be domain experts and have an intrinsic knowledge of how a piece of software should function. depending on how the IT is organized, "shadow IT" may be able to respond faster to changes and business needs than the core IT can. And the cons software produced may not be well designed to be extensible, handle errors correctly a d all other aspects that come from experience in software development. the software may not be well supported or, due to the way in which it has been produced, there may be no support at all.
