You are using a bad approach to solve your problem. You say: what structure is the best to solve (your problem) You first, must model that data want save and how must be organized the data, I'll suggest use a Entity Relationship Model that is commonly used in database design. And WHEN you have the diagram return to the code editor to describe in C++ how to represent that model. Then you'll able to choice which data structure are the best to you. I suggest look into STL ones, aren't beautiful, but are very efficient and you won't need reinvent the wheel :)
