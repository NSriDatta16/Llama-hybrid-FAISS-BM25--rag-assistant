Can I calculate stdev from a list of stdev values?

I'm working with a list of performance metrics. Each row represents some # of observations of one leg of the course/route/etc. So each row/leg will have a best (time), worst, avg and stdev. Adding together the best, worst and average values to get the course/route level totals makes intuitive sense to me, but I'm not so sure about stdev. I don't have the individual data points, only the aggregated "per-leg" values. Can I use the values I do have to calculate a valid stdev for the overall course/route?
