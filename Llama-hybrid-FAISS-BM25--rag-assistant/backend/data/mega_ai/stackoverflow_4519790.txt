To start: load test and turn on the MySQL slow query log . Some other suggestions: If staying with separate tables per category use UNION ALL instead of UNION . Reason being UNION implies distinctness, which makes the database engine do extra work to dedupe the rows unnecessarily. Indices do add a write penalty, but what you describe probably has a read-write ratio of at least 10 to 1 and probably more like 1000 to 1 or higher. So index. For the two queries you describe, I would probably create three indices (you'll need to study explain plans to determine what column order is better). usrid and status status and title status and description (is this an indexable field?) Another note on indices, creating a covering index , that is one that has all your columns, can also be a useful solution if one of your frequent access patterns is retrieval by primary key.
