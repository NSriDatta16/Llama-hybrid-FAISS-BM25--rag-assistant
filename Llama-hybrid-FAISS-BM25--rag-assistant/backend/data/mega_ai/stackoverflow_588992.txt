Replace f(x_r) by f(x_r_i) (read: f evaluated at x sub r sub i ). The r_i are chosen uniformly at random from the interval [x_1, x_2] . The point is this: the area under f on [x_1, x_2] is equal to (x_2 - x_1) times the average of f on the interval [x_1, x_2] . That is A = (x_2 - x_1) * [(1 / (x_2 - x_1)) * int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x)\, dx] The portion in square brackets is the average of f on [x_1, x_2] which we will denote avg(f) . How can we estimate the average of f ? By sampling it at N random points and taking the average value of f evaluated at those random points. To wit: avg(f) ~ (1 / N) * sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_r_i) where x_r_1, x_r_2, ..., x_r_N are points chosen uniformly at random from [x_1, x_2]. Then A = (x_2 - x_1) * avg(f) ~ (x_2 - x_1) * (1 / N) * sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_r_i). Here is another way to think about this equation: the area under f on the interval [x_1, x_2] is the same as the area of a rectangle with length (x_2 - x_1) and height equal to the average height of f . The average height of f is approximately (1 / N) * sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_r_i) which is value that we produced previously.
