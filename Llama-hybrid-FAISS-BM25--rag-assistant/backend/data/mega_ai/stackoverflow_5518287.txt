If you have never branched your project you should be working out of project/trunk/src. If you're switching to Eclipse look into Bazaar integration. I am using svn. I just checkout the entire project using Eclipse SVN perspective and the resulting project structure resembles the SVN repo. You just have to understand trunks/branches/tags to get it organized correctly.
