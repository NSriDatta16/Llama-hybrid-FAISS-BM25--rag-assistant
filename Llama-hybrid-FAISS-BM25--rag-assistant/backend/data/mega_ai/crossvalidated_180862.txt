It is a very common mistake that most people do and i can see it here also (done by almost everyone). Let me explain it in detail... Logistic Regression and linear Regression model, both are parametric model as well as Machine Learning Technique. It just depends on the method you are using to estimate the model parameters(theta's). There are 2 ways of finding model parameters in Linear Regression and Logistic reg. Gradient Descent Technique : Here we starts by assigning random values to the parameters and find cost function(error). In each iteration we update our parameters and minimize cost function. After certain number of iterations, cost function reduced to desired values and corresponding parameters values are our final values. This is what a machine learning techniques supposed to do. So, if You are using Gradient Descent technique, Logistic regression can call as a machine learning technique. By using Least Square Method: Here we have direct formula to find our parameters (some matrix algebra is required to understand the derivation of this formula) which is known as normal equation. Here b represents parameters X is design Matrix. Both Methods have their own advantages and limitations. To get more details: follow coursera Machine Learning course still running. I hope this post might be helpful .. :-)
