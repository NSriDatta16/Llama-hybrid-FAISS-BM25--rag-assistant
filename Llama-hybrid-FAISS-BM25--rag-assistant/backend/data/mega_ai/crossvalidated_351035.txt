Why does Deep Q-Learning have "do nothing" actions?

In DeepMind's paper on Deep Q-Learning for Atari video games ( here ), they have a parameter 'no-op max' which is the maximum number of "do nothing" actions to be performed by the agent at the start of an episode. What's this for? And is this for some specific episodes or for all episodes? I mean for some games, if the agent does do anything, it will lose immediately and the episode doesn't continue to a point that this agent can take some actions. Thanks
