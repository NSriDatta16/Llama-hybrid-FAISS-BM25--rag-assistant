You forget to mention the most important aspect of the question: how much you care about quality . If you dont care exactly how the values of the sources pixels are smashed together to create the destination pixel the fastest is (at least in almost all cases) the one that produces the worst quality. If youre tempted to respond with "the fastest algorithm that still yields very good quality" you have essentially covered the entire algorithm field that deals with just imagesampling/resizing. And you already outlined your initial idea of the algorithm: Avg of first five pixels of first source row will give first pixel of dest, Calculating the average value for each channel on the source pixels could be seen as trivial, are you looking for example code that does that? Or are you looking for someone to challenge your initial draft of the algorithm with something even faster?
