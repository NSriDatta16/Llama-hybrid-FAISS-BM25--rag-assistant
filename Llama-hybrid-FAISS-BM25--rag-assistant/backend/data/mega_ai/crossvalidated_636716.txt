Setting up a particle filter for a deterministic system with stochastic, time-discrete observations

I have a deterministic process $x(t)>0$ for $0 , governed by an ODE for which I want to do parameter inference in a Bayesian sense. The process is hidden but I have $n$ stochastic observations every time interval $\tau$ ( $n = T / \tau$ ) distributed as a Poisson: $y(m\tau) \sim Poi\left(\int_{(m-1)\tau}^{m \tau}x(t)dt\right)$ for $m = 1, 2,\dots n$ . I model this with an time-varying parameter $\theta(t)$ in the ODE such that it is constant between every pair of observations: $\theta(t) = \theta_m$ for $(m-1)\tau Currently, I do the inference with Metropolis-Hastings (MH) over the $n$ values of $\theta_m$ . I have identical priors and transition rates for all $\theta_m$ . I integrate the ODE over the whole span $0 and calculate the likelihood analytically from each trajectory $x(t)$ . My issue is this: MH takes MANY iterations to converge and the samples for the last few $\theta_m$ 's are autocorrelated unless I thin them out to a very high degree. I am wondering if this could be set up more efficiently using SMC/PMCMC to fit the $\theta_m$ 's sequentially in time but I have little experience with these techniques. The fact that the hidden process is deterministic (except for the random $\theta$ from the prior) is throwing me off as I try to follow this book https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bayesian-filtering-and-smoothing/C372FB31C5D9A100F8476C1B23721A67 Any insights greatly appreciated.
