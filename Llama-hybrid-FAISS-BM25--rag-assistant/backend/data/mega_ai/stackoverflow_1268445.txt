If you add your configuration file to the svn:ignore property, then it won't be committed when modified: svn pe svn:ignore . The best way to manage this is to organize your config files so that the common stuff is in one file, checked in to svn, and the line that has to flip per machine is in its own file, included into the main config file. Then that local config file is added to svn:ignore.
