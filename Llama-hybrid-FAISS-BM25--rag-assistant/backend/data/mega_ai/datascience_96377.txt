Most probably it will introduce a bias in the estimation of Shapley value. However on average this should not pose a problem. Taking the average value (ie arithmetic mean) of a feature, over a given dataset, in no way guarantees that is the most probable or characteristic value, unless the distribution is of a specific kind (eg normal). So taking another reference point might introduce bias, but on average given random means, it should not pose a problem. The above is a deduction not a detailed analysis.
