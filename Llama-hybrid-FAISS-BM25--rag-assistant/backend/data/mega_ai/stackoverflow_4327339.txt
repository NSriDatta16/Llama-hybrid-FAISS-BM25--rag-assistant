drawable vs. drawable-ldpi/drawable-mdpi

All the Android docs mention the "drawable" directory. However, when I create an Android project in Eclipse, it doesn't create a "/res/drawable" directory, but it does create "/res/drawable-ldpi" and "/res/drawable-mdpi". I imagine those have something to do with pixel resolution, but what's exactly going on here? When I've stepped through the tutorials, I've manually created a "drawable" directory and put my resources in there, but did I need to? Do references to "/res/drawable/" work if only "drawable-{l|m}dpi" are present?
