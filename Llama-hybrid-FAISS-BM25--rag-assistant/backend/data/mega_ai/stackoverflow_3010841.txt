Is there a Visual Studio 2010 Add On for Tabbed Multi-Monitor support

In Visual Studio 2010 you can drag tabs out to separate windows but you can not collect them together as additional tabbed elements. Is there a VS 2010 add-on to allow you to group your extra windows into tabs? It would be really nice to have a set of tabs on each of my monitors.
