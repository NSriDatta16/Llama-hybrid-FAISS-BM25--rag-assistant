Exception when using strncpy

The following code fragment ends in an exception when executing the strncpy function: #define MAX_FILENAME_LEN 127 typedef struct { unsigned long nameLength; char name[MAX_FILENAME_LEN + 1]; } filestructure; char *fileName; strncpy( fileName, filestructure->name, MAX_FILENAME_LEN ); *( fileName + MAX_FILENAME_LEN+1 ) = 0; Ayone an idea what could go wrong? In the filestructure I have a filename that is 50 characters long so it is within the bounds... I am really a bit lost what could cause the problem in this simple code fragement...
