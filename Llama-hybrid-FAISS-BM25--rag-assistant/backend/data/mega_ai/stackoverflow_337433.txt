These are the three different ways I have found helpful to flag something that needs to be addressed. Place a comment flag next to the code that needs to be looked at. Most compilers can recognize common flags and display them in an organized fashion. Usually your IDE has a watch window specifically designed for these flags. The most common comment flag is: //TODO This how you would use it: //TODO: Fix this before it is released. This causes an access violation because it is using memory that isn't created yet. One way to flag something that needs to be addressed before release would be to create a useless variable. Most compilers will warn you if you have a variable that isn't used. Here is how you could use this technique: int This_Is_An_Access_Violation = 0; IDE Bookmarks. Most products will come with a way to place a bookmark in your code for future reference. This is a good idea, except that it can only be seen by you. When you share your code most IDE's won't share your bookmarks. You can check the help file system of your IDE to see how to use it's bookmarking features.
