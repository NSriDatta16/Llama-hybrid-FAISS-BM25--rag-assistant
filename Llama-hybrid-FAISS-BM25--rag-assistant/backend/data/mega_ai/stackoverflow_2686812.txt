NSOpenGLView in NSSplitView

When i put an NSOpenglView in NSSplitView, a problem occurs while dragging splitter. The openGLView and SplitView are resizing asynchronously. i found a solution in apple mail list thread http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/samplecode/GLChildWindowDemo/Introduction/Intro.html and i found a solution with some carbon calls. but now i get link error (only in release mode). so i'v got two questions - is there any cocoa way to fix the splitter - gl problem? if no - how can i fix carbon linker errors in release mode?
