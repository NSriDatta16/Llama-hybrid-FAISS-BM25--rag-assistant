Standard classification models will disregard the ordered nature of your target variable, which loses information. My first approach would be an ordered logit model, which is an extension of ordinary logistic regression to multiple ordered categories, like your age buckets. I didn't find a straight duplicate, but previous threads with the "ordered-logit" tag may be helpful, and of course, there is much more material on these models out there.
