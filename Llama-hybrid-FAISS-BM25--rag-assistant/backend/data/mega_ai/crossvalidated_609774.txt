How to interpret a 95% CI: 1.00-1.00 with a p-value = 0.004

I am performing a missing data analysis from a modified (the original data has been modified for the purposes of teaching) Randomised Control Trial. The missing variable of interest is "prior use of aspirin before randomisation" . There are eight other variables in the dataset. The key variable of interest for this post is "systolic blood pressure" . Comparing those with missing data for systolic blood pressure with those not missing data for systolic blood pressure gives me the following mean systolic blood pressures: Not Missing (158.7) Missing (160.6) Univariate logistic regression (previous aspirin as the outcome variable - Yes/No, systolic blood pressure as the exposure variable) gives me an OR = 1, a significant p-value=0.002, but a 95% CI: 1.00-1.00. Similarly, multivariate regression gives me an OR = 1, p=0.004, but a 95% CI: 1.00-1.00. How should I interpret this? Can I say that there is a statistically significant difference in the systolic blood pressure of those that are missing data for previous aspirin use (160.6) compared to those with data for previous aspirin use (158.7)? If so, how should I understand the apparent oddity in the confidence interval? Is it simply because of the accuracy (number of significant figures) in the OR reporting? Thanks
