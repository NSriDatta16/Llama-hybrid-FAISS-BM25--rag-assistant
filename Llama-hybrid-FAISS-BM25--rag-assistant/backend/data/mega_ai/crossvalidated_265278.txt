The question can be generalized to how to select the right model to certain data. To some degree the question is equivalent to flowing question: if I have some 1 dimensional data, should I fit it with Gaussian or mixture of Gaussian. I have a related answer here. Markov chains vs. HMM Also for choosing the right model, we can do "knowledge driven" or "data driven". And a related discussion can be found here. How to chose the order for polynomial regression? If we want to do "data driven", Using MM or HMM is depending the nature of the data. In general, HMM is more "complex" (check the bias variance trade off ) than MM. Therefore, if we have sufficient data, and can make sure we are not over fitting, HMM is better. Note, choosing between MM and HMM have little thing to do with Number of Observed Stages . We can have a super complicated binary string data, that requires a HMM with many hidden stages. On the other hand, we can also have a simple data with multiple possible outcomes, that using MM is sufficient.
