Is there a Language Model that can accept huge corpse of tabular data and answr questions about?

I have been researching Language Models that can work with tabular data. My main goal is to have a model to answer simple questions about my data. An example is having household sales data and asking simple questions like "What was the average sales during the last 2 months?". One of the best models I have found so far is TAPAS . However, it has limitations regarding the size of tabular data. My data size is approximately 1 million rows with 10 columns. Is there a robust model that can perform the mentioned task or is there an alternative approach to this problem?
