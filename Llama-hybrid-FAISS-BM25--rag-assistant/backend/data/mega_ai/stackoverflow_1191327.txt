Compact Framework in WinCE and performance

Anyone know relative performance hit for using the full as opposed to compact WinCE framework? We are contemplating using the full to get the ability to do drag and drop, etc. but not if it's a huge hit to processing ability. Any guesstimates about the difference? Uses x% more processor?
