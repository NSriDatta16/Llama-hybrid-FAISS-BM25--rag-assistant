Minification Minification does improve performance for two reasons: Reduced file-size (because it removes comments and unnecessary white spaces), so your script loads faster. Even if it is embedded into the . It is parsed faster, since comments and white spaces don't have to be explicitly ignored (since they're not there). Combining I've written quite a few HTML/JavaScript AIR applications, and from personal experience, combining files won't make a difference. In fact, it's good practice to separate the script based on certain criteria (classes, global functions, SQL functions, etc.). It helps keep them organised when the project becomes too big. Obfuscation Obfuscating is usually a combination of minification and renaming variables. It involves using eval to blow up the code again. This reduces performance for obvious reasons, but it depends on the size of your code. I'd suggest running tests to understand this best for your specific situation.
