I did an NLP course last term, and it came pretty clear that sentiment analysis is something that nobody really knows how to do well (yet). Doing this with unsupervised learning is of course even harder. There's quite a lot of research going on regarding this, some of it commercial and thus not open to the public. I can't point you to any research papers but the book we used for the course was this ( google books preview ). That said, the book covers a lot of material and might not be the quickest way to find a solution to this particular problem. The only other thing I can point you towards is to try googling around, maybe in scholar.google.com for "sentiment analysis" or "opinion mining". Have a look at the NLTK movie_reviews corpus. The reviews are already pos/neg categorized and might help you with training your classifier. Although the language you find in Twitter is probably very different from those. As a last note, please post any successes (or failures for that matter) here. This issue will come up later for sure at some point.
