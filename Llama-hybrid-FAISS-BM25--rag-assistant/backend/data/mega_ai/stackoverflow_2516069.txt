i've had a good deal of success with the Developer Express grid in the past. In fact i chose it as the grid component of choice over many other 3rd party grid vendors including Infragistics. Not that Infragistics is bad at all. During my research i concluded, as you have, that it was an overly "heavy" component. DexEx also lets you buy the source code affording you the chance to make it even lighter or customizing further. Link: http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/WinForms/Grid/
