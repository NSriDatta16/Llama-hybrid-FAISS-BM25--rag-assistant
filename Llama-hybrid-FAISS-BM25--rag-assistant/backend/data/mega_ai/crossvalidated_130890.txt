Randomized procedures is used sometimes in theory because it simplifies the theory. In typical statistical problems, it does not make sense in practice, while in game-theory settings it can make sense. The only reason I can see to use it in practice, is if it somehow simplifies calculations. Theoretically, one can argue it should not be used, from the sufficiency principle : statistical conclusions should only be based on sufficient summaries of the data, and randomization introduces dependence of an extraneous random $ U $ which is not part of a sufficient summary of the data. UPDATE To answer whuber's comments below, quoted here: "Why do randomized procedures "not make sense in practice"? As others have noted, experimenters are perfectly willing to use randomization in the construction of their experimental data, such as randomized assignment of treatment and control, so what is so different (and impractical or objectionable) about using randomization in the ensuing analysis of the data? " Well, randomization of the experiment to get the data is done for a purpose, mainly to break causality chains. If and when that is effective is another discussion. What could be the purpose for using randomization as part of the analysis? The only reason I have ever seen is that it makes the mathematical theory more complete! That's OK as long as it goes. In game-theory contexts, when there is an actual adversary, randomization my help to confuse him. In real decision contexts (sell, or not sell?) a decision must be taken, and if there is not evidence in the data, maybe one could just throw a coin. But in a scientific context, where the question is what we can learn from the data, randomization seems out of place. I cannot see any real advantage from it! If you disagree, do you have an argument which could convince a biologist or a chemist? (And here I do not think about simulation as part of bootstrap or MCMC.)
