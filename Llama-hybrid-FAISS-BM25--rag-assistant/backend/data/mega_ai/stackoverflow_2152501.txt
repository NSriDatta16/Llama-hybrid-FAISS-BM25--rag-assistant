best approach for Logging/Error Handling framework for a C# .NET v3.5 application? (enterprise library / log4net / ?)

I'm working on a .NET v3.5 winforms app and would like to leverage some support for: a) logging (to file & to perhaps windows events) b) error handling / exception handling framework - to assist in distinguishing messages that can be shown to user versus handled within the code and logged c) a bonus extra would be how to capture/buildup serious errors to me via a server side web-service (similar to firefox when it asks you to feedback issues to the developers) - however if this doubles the complexity of what I'm asking for drop this requirement Things I'm aware of include: log4net - seems popular but not sure if it helps with my requirement b) enterprise library - which I've looked at however it seems a bit heavy (like overkill) thanks
