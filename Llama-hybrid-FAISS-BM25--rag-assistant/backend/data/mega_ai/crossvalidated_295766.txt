You Only Look Once (YOLO): Convolutional Neural Network

This question refers to the YOLO architecture (figure 3). In their architecture they define a convolutional layer 7x7x64-s-2 followed by a maxpool layer 2x2-s-2 . These transform an input of 448x448x3 into a tensor of 112x112x192 , using a kernel of 7x7 in the convolutional layer. Can someone please clarify this notation 7x7x64-s-2 ? I'm assuming s-2 refers to stride of 2. Then is 64 the padding?
