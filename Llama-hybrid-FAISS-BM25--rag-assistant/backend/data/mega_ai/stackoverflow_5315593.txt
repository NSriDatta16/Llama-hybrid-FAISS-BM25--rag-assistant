Most likely you want to use a space-filling-curve or a spatial index to reduce your 2D problem to a 1D problem. For example you can combine the lat/long pair with a z-curve or a hilbert curve. I use for myself a hilbert curve to search for postcodes. You can find my solution at phpclasses.org ( hilbert-curve ).
