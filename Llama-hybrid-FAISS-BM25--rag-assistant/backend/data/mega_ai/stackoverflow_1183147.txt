I have two iPhone developer accounts that I work with, so instead of two accounts and two people, it's two accounts and one person. Unfortunately, being the same person both accounts ended up with the same Agent name (and it appears nearly impossible to change this - my case requesting the change has been open with Apple for months). This resulted in two sets of keys and certificates and the keys have the same name. This causes problems in Xcode, both in the Organizer and in code signing. I filed bugs on these 6635822) some time ago, but ended up just now finding a work-around for both problems. I wrote it down in a blog entry in case it'd be helpful to others. http://geekanddad.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/work-around-for-multiple-iphone-dev-account-and-code-signing-and-xcode-organizer-problems/ Update: Jan 2010: it looks like Apple has addressed this with their certificate generation - User Names now seem to have a number appended to them in parenthesis (e.g., My Name (A340D)). I have not tried to regenerate certificates on previous accounts to see if they get this hash added, but newly created ones are having this added. Update: Feb 12 2010: Yes, if you regenerate the certificate on the account it appends a number to the name and this whole issue is a non-issue. So you can just have one keychain and all your certificates there now - thanks apple!
