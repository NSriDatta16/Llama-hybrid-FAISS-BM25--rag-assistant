I'm short on time so can't give a full detailed answer, but in brief, here are my suggestions. Instead of using onDestroy() , use onPause() . That's guaranteed to get called; according to the official documentation on Lifecycles, only onPause() is guaranteed. onStop and onDestroy are not. onSaveInstanceState and onPause are similar. Both get called when the app leaves the foreground (i.e. it enters the potential danger zone for being killed), but the difference with oSIS is the temporary bundle it provides. onPause doesn't provide any data storage mechanism, but if you're using a database than you already have one. According to the documentation, there isn't a guaranteed order to which one gets called first. Point 3) That's exactly what oSIS is meant for Point 4) You could make a 'temporary row' in your database, i.e. save temporary data to row 1, but whenever a save is properly made, row 1 gets blanked. Then in your onCreate(), check whether row 1 has real data or is empty. (If your columns can't be empty, then use pre-determined placeholder values that wouldn't ever appear as part of normal use.)
