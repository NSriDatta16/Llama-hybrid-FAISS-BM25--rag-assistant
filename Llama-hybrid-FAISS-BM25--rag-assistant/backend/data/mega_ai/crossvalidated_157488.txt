How to setup for really deep convolution model

I'm rather new to deep learning and convolution network and got some basic models to run. However, when I tried to build a deep CNN model (i.e., more than 14, 15 layers) the error rate does not seem to decrease even after several epochs. So I wonder what could be the problem and how to overcome it?
