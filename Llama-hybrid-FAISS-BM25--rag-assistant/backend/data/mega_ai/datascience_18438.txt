Ideally you'll end up with a dataset where each class is fairly represented, with enough data for each class to enable suitable predictive performance. As you currently have no labels, any kind of stratified sampling is unavailable to you. Random sampling will get you the 10K samples you need, but there's no guarantee you'll get fair representation for each of your classes. Assuming you were to use this approach it would make sense to continue to label the samples until you have decent representation for all classes. There is no guarantee regarding balance and also no guarantee that it will cover the majority of the variance of your dataset in feature space either. An alternative sampling approach that is able to capture a majority of the variance of the data in feature space should hold up with better performance/generalisation. There are a few variations of how this could be done but you could try a clustering approach. Cluster your points in feature space and then instead of sampling randomly, sample from each cluster in turn. So draw a random point from the first cluster, then second, then third etc until the last cluster, and repeat if necessary. Label them in this order and keep an eye on the counts for each class as there is always the chance a class is not well represented by this approach. Another potential drawback in this approach is selecting the number of clusters. You could aim for the number of classes in the dataset or go with anything up to 10K clusters. An additional variant on this would be the strategy for selecting a sample from the clusters: instead of choosing a random point, choose the sample closest to the centroid; or if choosing multiple points from a cluster, order the samples via distance from centroid and sample uniformly from this. Active learning is a semi-supverised approach that may be the most useful choice in this instance. When labelling, once you've got some decent coverage for each of your classes try an active learning approach to selecting which samples to label next.
