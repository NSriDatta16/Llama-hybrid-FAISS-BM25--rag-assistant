Information out of the hat matrix for logistic regression

It is clear to me, and well explained on multiple sites, what information the values on the diagonal of the hat matrix give for linear regression. The hat matrix of a logistic regression model is less clear to me. Is it identical to the information you get out of the hat matrix applying linear regression? This is the definition of the hat matrix I found on another topic of CV (source 1): $H=VX ( X'V X)^-1 X' V$ with X the vector of predictor variables and V is a diagonal matrix with $\sqrt{(π(1−π))}$. Is it, in other words, also true that the particular value of the hat matrix of an observation also just presents the position of the covariates in the covariate space, and has nothing to do with the outcome value of that observation? This is written in the book "Categorical data analysis" of Agresti: The greater an observation’s lever- age, the greater its potential influence on the fit. As in ordinary regression, the leverages fall between 0 and 1 and sum to the number of model parameters. Unlike ordinary regression, the hat values depend on the fit as well as the model matrix, and points that have extreme predictor values need not have high leverage. So out of this definition, it seems we can not use it as we use it in ordinary linear regression? Source 1: How to calculate the hat matrix for logistic regression in R?
