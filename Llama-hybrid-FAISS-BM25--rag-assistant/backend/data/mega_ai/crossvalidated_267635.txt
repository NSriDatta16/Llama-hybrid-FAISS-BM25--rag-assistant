Dimensionality Reduction in Cross Validation

I am working with a dataset with 41 features and a class label. To enhance the runtime, I decided to do Dimensionality Reduction also. I am doing Cross-Validation also. I used PCA for reducing the features at the very beginning and then feeding the features to Classifier and Cross-Validation. Is this the right way? Any inputs on this will be appreciated.
