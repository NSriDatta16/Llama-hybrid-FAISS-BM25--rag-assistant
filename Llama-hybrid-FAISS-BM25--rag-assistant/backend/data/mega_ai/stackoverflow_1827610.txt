Finding a wave graphic inside an image

I need some help with an algorithm. I'm using an artificial neural network to read an electrocardiogram and trying to recognize some disturbances in the waves. That's OK, and I have the neural network and I can test it no problem. What I'd like to do is to give the function to the user to open an electrocardiogram (import a jpeg) and have the program find the waves and convert it in to the arrays that will feed my ANN, but there's the problem. I did some code that reads the image and transforms it into a binary image, but I can't find a nice way for the program to locate the waves, since the exact position can vary from hospital to hospital, I need some suggestions of approaches I should use.
