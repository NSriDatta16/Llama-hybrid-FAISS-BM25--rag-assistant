I agree with the options "OMG Ponies" presents but not for his conclusion in this case. Use the bit column! Having a single bit assigned to hold the data gives one six other Y/N/O and a single Y/N storage locations for free. When one uses the Bit data type always define at least on bit as non null so SQL will reserve a place in the data page for the values.
