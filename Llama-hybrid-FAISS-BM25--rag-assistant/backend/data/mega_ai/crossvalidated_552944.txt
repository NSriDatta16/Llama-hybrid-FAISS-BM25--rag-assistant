Which predictive models output the posterior distribution?

In a supervised learning context, the posterior distribution of the target given the predictors is often discussed in foundational treatments of the subject. One way this comes up is in decision theory, which makes use of the said posterior distribution to produce the prediction, given some cost function. In practice, which learning models actually output the posterior distribution? It appears popular decision-tree models and their implementations, such as XGBoost, and neural-network models do not readily output this distribution.
