DCGAN celebA strange results

I am trying to generate attributed faces using DCGAN. Therefore I changed the code of the original implementation to use celebA instead of mnist. After 15 iterations I am getting the following results: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pgrbb.png Here can you find my modifications to the original DCGAN implementation: 1) Read the celebA attributes self.celeba_labels = [] with open("./list_attr_celeba.txt") as celeba_labels_list: #Skip header next(celeba_labels_list) next(celeba_labels_list) for celeba_label_line in celeba_labels_list: #Prepare label list image_label = celeba_label_line.split() image_label = image_label[1:] image_label = map(int, image_label) image_label = [0 if label == -1 else 1 for label in image_label] self.celeba_labels.append(image_label) 2) Use them as sample labels (like mnist) sample_labels = self.celeba_labels[0:self.sample_num] 3) Use them as batch labels (like mnist) batch_labels = self.celeba_labels[idx*config.batch_size: (idx+1)*config.batch_size] Why isn't the network producing faces as results?
