Way to Treat Python single vals and lists of vals identically?

I'm running into this problem often: I'm creating a function that needs to perform a series of operations on a value, whether that value be a single value or a list of values. Is there an elegant way to do this: def convert_val(val): do a series of things to each value, whether list or single val return answer or list of answers rather than what I've been doing?: def convert_val(val): if isinstance(val, list): ... do a series of things to each list item, return a list of answers else: ... do the same series, just on a single value return a single answer One solution would be to create a sub_convert() that would do the series of actions, and then just call it once or iteratively, depending on the type passed in to convert(). Another would be to create a single convert() that would accept the arguments (value, sub_convert()). Other suggestions that would be more compact, elegant and preferably all in one function? (I've done several searches here to see if my issue has already been addressed. My appologies if it has.) Thanks, JS
