K-Means clustering in the analysis of Word2vec embeddings

I have a yelp-review dataset. I have done a word2vector embedding on the text column of the yelp-review. I am using unsupervised leaning K-means and PCA & TSNE to visualise the data. I have got 6 clusters which are well separated. Now I want to create a "Word-Cloud" with respect to each of the cluster labels. Can one one give an idea how to do that. Thank you.
