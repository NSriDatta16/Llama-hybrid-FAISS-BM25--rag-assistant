mysql multi-column search

I have a table like this: +-------------------+---------------+ | description | colour | +-------------------+---------------+ | Macrame Dress | Washed Black | | Darcelle Gilet | Dirty Shellac | | Darcelle Cardigan | Washed Black | | Let It Rot Vest | Optic White | | Let It Rot Crew | Washed Black | | Let It Rot Crew | Optic White | | Battalion Short | Somme | | Seine Dress | Washed Black | | Seine Dress | Cocomotion | | Odette V-neck | Linen Marl | +-------------------+---------------+ I want search it for "black dress" and it only return rows 1 & 8. If I type in "black", it will return rows 1, 3, 5 & 8. Dress should return rows 1, 8 & 9. Can anyone think of a really elegant, beautiful bit of sql that will take any number of search words and return the most concise result set. I can think of some pretty ugly ways to do it, but they upset my karma.
