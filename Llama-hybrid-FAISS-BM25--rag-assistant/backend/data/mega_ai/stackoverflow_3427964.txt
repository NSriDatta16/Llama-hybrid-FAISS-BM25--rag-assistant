You can detect the click on your form even when the application doesn't have focus if you subscribe for the MouseClick event. Then, when you click your form, you'll get the callback whether the form previously had focus or not. Then you can simulate the click on the control that you want. This isn't a terribly elegant solution, but it should work. You do have to make sure that the click doesn't get sent to your toolbar button twice.
