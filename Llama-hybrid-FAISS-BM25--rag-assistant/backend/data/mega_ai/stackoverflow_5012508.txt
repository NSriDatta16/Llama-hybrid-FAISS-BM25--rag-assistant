Unless you have some reason to target pre-Donut devices (now only 4% of the devices according to http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html ), then you should put your bitmaps in one of the -Xdpi directories. The generic "drawable" directory is a synonym of "drawable-mdpi" for compatibility reasons, but a modern well-written app should be putting its drawables in a directory matching the density they are designed for.
