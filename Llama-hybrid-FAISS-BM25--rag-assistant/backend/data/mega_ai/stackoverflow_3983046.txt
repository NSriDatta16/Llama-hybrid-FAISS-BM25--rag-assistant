I really enjoy TestDriven's re-run. It's great for spelunking into a problem, setting breakpoints, running tests, making changes, re-running, etc. If the last time you ran the test you had it "Test with > Coverage" or "Test with > Debugger", then that's the setting it uses for repeat. The closest Resharper comes to that is Resharper_UnitTest_RunCurrentSession which will run whichever tab is selected in the "Unit Test Sessions" window. It won't repeat the last test run's mode (run or debug), or run only the tests from the session that were run the previous time. You can bind a keyboard shortcut to Resharper_UnitTest_RunCurrentSession via Tools > Options... > Environment (section) > Keyboard (section). The full command name is Resharper.Resharper_UnitTest_RunCurrentSession . Adding it to the context menu is different for Studio 2008 and Studio 2010, but both get started from Tools > Customize. Update for R# 6: There is now a ReSharper.ReSharper_UnitTestSession_RepeatPreviousRun command that does exactly what we hope it does.
