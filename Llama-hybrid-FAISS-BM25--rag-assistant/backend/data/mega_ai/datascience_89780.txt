For the latest practices of deep learning architectures, I follow the Kaggle latest Competition's notebooks . Say, for example, In the recent finished Cassava Leaf Deasese Computer Vision Competition, People are sharing the experimental notebooks on different State of the art Architectures Like Vision Transformer(Various versions pretrained - vit_large_patch16_384 , vit_base_patch16_384 etc. models), Facebook's Data-efficient Image Transformers , EfficientNet ( Noisy Student version , Imagenet Version) and etc. https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ this book undoubtedly one of the great book. But for the latest practices if you follow the Kaggle notebooks you get a good explanation with codes. I suggest you, Explore this Notebooks Section of the Casava Leaf Disease Classification Contest to get more Models and Various recent new released Loss Functions and so on.
