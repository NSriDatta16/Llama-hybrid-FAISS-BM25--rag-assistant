There are various algorithms for anomaly detection like LOF, Isolation Forest, SVM etc. You can easily explore them on sklearn or pycaret. Further, if you are aware of the threshold values for the data, then insert them in the data so that model can easily detect them. Also, while training the data discard the Sample id and time column, otherwise it will consider them into calculation.
