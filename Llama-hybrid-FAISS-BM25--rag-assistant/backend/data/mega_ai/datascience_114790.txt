So this is not time series in my mind. There is no correllation between observations. In weather, if it rains tomorrow, we might imagine its more likely to rain today. This is not the case here, each observation is in random order and we could endlessly shuffle the observations and not fundemntally change the problem. This problem could be formulated under an optimal stopping approach. The idea is you can stop early and take an action. When you do you take this early stop to maximize expected long term succcess. Think about dating as an example. Most people eventually stop early (before death) and marry therefore stopping dating.* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping *exceptions apply of course.
