How to store data when there is no schema?

I'm trying to figure out what is the right choice of data storage in a project I'm starting up right now. I want to store data that is the output result of powershell scripts. This means that an administrator of my app will be able to write a powershell script that will execute on a number of hosts and they will post the results back to a data store. I then want to query that store in a flexible manner. Let me clarify. The data that comes back from the powershell job is not a proper object but a key/value collection of properties of objects. So there is no real object to serialize. Let's say I tell 100 hosts over a WCF service to execute the two powershell commands Get-Service and Get-Process and they will then post back the results to my data store. I don't know the schema of this data beforehand. The point is not PowerShell nor WCF, but how would you store data that at the time of storing the schema is not known. And querys will be created manually via some GUI afterwards based on the data that has been stored. Afterwards I would like to be able execute a query like "Get a list of all hosts that have service X running and process Y running" ? I'm looking into at nosql databases as an alternative to relational DBs but not sure what is best. Thankful for any input. /Linus
