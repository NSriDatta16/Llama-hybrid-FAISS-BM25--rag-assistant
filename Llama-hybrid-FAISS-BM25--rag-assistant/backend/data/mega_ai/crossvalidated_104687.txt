My first thought would be to use a mixed model. Why, in your 3rd paragraph, do you say this does not seem coherent? You do not, as far as I can see, have three versions of the scale. Using the averages does not make much sense to me, whether with ordinal regression or anything else. By doing this you are throwing away lots of information. Such an analysis will have much less power than other tests.
