The functional form of the model is going to be very important here. In fact there might be interaction effects between the treatments ( sensitivity of breaking to bending might depend on whether it has been put through fire before ) and hence you need to use a non-linear functional form So, instead of a form like: $$y=\beta_{fire}x_{fire}+ \beta_{bending}x_{bending} + .. $$ you might want to use a form: $$y=\beta_{bending-fire}x_{bending}x_{fire} + ..+\beta_{fire}x_{fire}+ \beta_{bending}x_{bending} + .. $$ You should start with this simple linear model and then move on to random forests since they will automatically create these interactions if they are important
