The logistics regression cut off for threshold has nothing to do with the R program ( or any other programming language). Threshold is a value for probability which you think is desirable as per the model you are building. Example, in a model where you want to classify an email as a spam/ not spam using logistic regression. After you train your model on numbers of email data and test your model on another set of email data. Now, by understanding how well your model is classifying the email into spam / not spam the value of threshold is set. To start with try to get rmse for the model and then set up the threshold value.
