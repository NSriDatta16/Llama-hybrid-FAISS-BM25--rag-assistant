Difference between a single unit LSTM and 3-unit LSTM neural network

The LSTM in the following Keras code input_t = Input((4, 1)) output_t = LSTM(1)(input_t) model = Model(inputs=input_t, outputs=output_t) print(model.summary()) can be represented as I understand that when we call model.predict(np.array([[[1],[2],[3],[4]]])) the (only) LSTM unit first processes the vector [1], then [2] plus the feedback from the previous input and so on until the vector [4]. In other words $x_1 = [1], x_2 = [2], x_3 = [3], x_4 = [4]$. I don't understand how the following neural network would process the same input sequence [1],[2],[3],[4] input_t = Input((4, 1)) output_t = LSTM(3)(input_t) model = Model(inputs=input_t, outputs=output_t) print(model.summary()) In this NN we have three LSTM units. How do they process the sequence [1],[2],[3],[4] ? Are they interconnected with each other? Do they process the input sequence in parallel or does a one unit process the input sequence and later its input is fed to the second LSTM unit and so on? Could someone schematically using this picture explain the whole process?
