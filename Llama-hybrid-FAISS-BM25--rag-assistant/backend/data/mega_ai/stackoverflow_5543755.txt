Javascript Object Literal Notation - Creating mixins (sort of)

For lack of a better title... Is it possible to do something like this in JSON? var obj = { a : 'a constant', b : a + ' and b constant' } Update: Doesn't work - this.a returns undefined I know this will work but it looks rather ugly and convoluted: var obj = { a : 'a constant', b : (function(){ return this.a + ' and b constant'; })() } And here's what I have currently: var obj = { a : 'a constant', b : 'a constant and b constant' } I know of the other ways that some have commented upon and I sincerely thank them for responding. However, they don't look simple or elegant. The only issue I have with my current implementation is that if value of 'a' ever gets updated, search-n-replace has to done in many places (I say many because there are more properties that derive from 'a') instead of one.
