As Bj√∂rn writes , it depends heavily on your field. SPSS is extremely common in psychology, and of course people like to stick with the tool they know, so SPSS is also pretty common in functions that have many psychologists, like HR. If you plan on working in such a field, SPSS is a pretty safe bet. However, R and Python have been gaining ground in general statistics and data science, as per publications like the Rexer Data Science Survey . If you may want to go deeper into data science, I would definitely recommend you learn at least one of the two, perhaps rather more Python than R (which is preferred by the more statistical community). R would also be a good thing to know in psychology. You can do everything SPSS does in R. The learning curve is steeper, true. But R forces you far more to actually understand what you are doing, rather than click a couple of buttons whose names sound promising and then hunt through the output for $p , which SPSS tempts you to do.
