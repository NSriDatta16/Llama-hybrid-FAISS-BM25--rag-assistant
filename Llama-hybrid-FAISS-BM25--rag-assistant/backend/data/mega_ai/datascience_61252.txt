Should I have "normal" sampled data in my dataset?

I am busy working on a project to find the reasons why kids in normal households are doing badly in school. I have a dataset of which consists of kids that live in environments where the family is middle class, has access to necessary facilities and the kid is not suffering from any disorders but is failing grades in school. It is understandable for kids that has a poor living condition to have problems at school but for kids that has all the necessities in life to do at least average in school, needs a bit more research. Now that I have this dataset, does it make sense to add kids with the same living environments that are doing ok at school to the dataset? I am planning to use SOM for data mining if that helps.
