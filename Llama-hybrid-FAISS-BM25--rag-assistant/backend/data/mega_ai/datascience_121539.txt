See the gpt4all issue #374, "How to train the model with my own files" . One comment there says: My understanding is that embeddings and retraining (fine-tuning) are different. If you just want extra info, you can embed, if you want new knowledge or style, you probably need to fine-tune. which cites: "GPT4All Story, Fine-Tuning, Model Bias, Centralization Risks, AGI (Andriy Mulyar)", ยง "Fine Tuning Options" (@35:12) .
