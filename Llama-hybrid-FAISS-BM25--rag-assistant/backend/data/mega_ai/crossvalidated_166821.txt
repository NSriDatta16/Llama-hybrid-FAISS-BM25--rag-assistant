Fitted value in GARCH(1,1) is the same as original data

I am trying to remove the volatility of my sample time series by fitting the GARCH(1,1) model with Gaussian innovations.The time series I use is the log returns on the daily closing value of S&P 500. My code and result are following: >library(fGarch) >fit res head(res) [1] -0.0050919672 0.0023355948 -0.0003280802 0.0015576128 [5] 0.0001095798 -0.0017182582 > fitvalue head(fitvalue) 1 2 3 4 -0.004874592 0.002552970 -0.000110705 0.001774988 5 6 0.000326955 -0.001500883 > head(dataex0[,8]) [1] -0.004874592 0.002552970 -0.000110705 0.001774988 [5] 0.000326955 -0.001500883 >fittedvalue head(fittedvalue) 1 2 3 4 5 6 1274.351 1274.351 1274.351 1274.351 1274.351 1274.351 Is my code wrong? Why the fitted value is exactly the same as the original data? I also tried fit@fitted at the end, but the output is different but repeating one value.
