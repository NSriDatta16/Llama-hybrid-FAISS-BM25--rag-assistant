I could recommend OXID e-Shop . We've been a doing a number of e-Commerce sites based on it and chose it over Magento, XT-Commerce etc al. Best things I like about OXID are speed and features. Templating is SMARTY based. We got our first sites up and running in 1-2 hours, while Magento took a full day. Good luck! Ashant
