Multinomial logistic regression or something else?

I have a dependent/response variable that is categorized into 7 different levels with 1 being least significant and 7 being most significant. I have 20 plus independent/predictor variables that are nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio data that I want to utilize. I know I cannot use regular logistic regression because my dependent/response variable is not binary. I am pretty sure I need to use multinomial logistic regression but am unsure. Any ideas?
