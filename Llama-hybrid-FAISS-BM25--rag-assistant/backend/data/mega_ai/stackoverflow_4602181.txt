Try this: wget -nd -r -P /save/location -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png http://www.somedomain.com Here is some more information: -nd prevents the creation of a directory hierarchy (i.e. no directories ). -r enables recursive retrieval. See Recursive Download for more information. -P sets the directory prefix where all files and directories are saved to. -A sets a whitelist for retrieving only certain file types. Strings and patterns are accepted, and both can be used in a comma separated list (as seen above). See Types of Files for more information.
