Are you sure that you'll actually need as many as 4000 characters? If 1000 is the practical upper limit, why not set it to that? Conversely, if you're likely to get more than 4000 bytes, you'll want to look at nvarchar(max). I like to "encourage" users not use storage space too freely. The more space required to store a given row, the less space you can store per page, which potentially results in more disk I/O when the table is read or written to. Even though only as many bytes of data are stored as are necessary (i.e. not the full 4000 per row), whenever you get a bit more than 2000 characters of nvarchar data, you'll only have one row per page, and performance can really suffer. This of course assumes you need to store unicode (double-byte) data, and that you only have one such column per row. If you don't, drop down to varchar.
