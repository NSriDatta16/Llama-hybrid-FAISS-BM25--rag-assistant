As @Neall said, you need to initiate an XMLHttpRequest and return the data to the client. There are many ways to do this and I don't know the framework you are referring to, but in general, you initiate the XMLHttpRequest passing some parameters -if needed- to a web method, for example, and then return the data in JSON format. When you issue the request it usually has a callback function for success and one for error. On the sucess event, you parse the JSON response and do whatever you need to do with it. Look at here, for example: http://elegantcode.com/2009/02/21/javascript-arrays-via-jquery-ajax-to-an-aspnet-webmethod/
