As a base reference you could try to directly merge the three data sets by interlacing them and then analyzing this new data set. First you need to do a linear transformation on each data set individually so they have the same mean and variance (mean=0 and variance=1 is the simplest choice). Then you transform the x-scales of the three data sets by $x \mapsto 3x+1, 2, 3$ respectively. If you now look at the union of the three data sets you have created one new data set merged out of the three individual ones. Next I would apply the moving average again (with a window length of now 6000) and compare the numbers and locations of peaks and throughs with the results on the three individual data sets and see whether this gives anything useful.
