IronPython / IronRuby IronPython in Action will do a better job explaining this (and exactly how best to use IronPython) that can possibly be accommodated in a SO answer. I'm biased -- I was a tech reviewer and am a friend of one of the authors -- but objectively think it's a great book. (No idea if IronRuby is blessed with a similarly wonderful book, yet). As you want "one specific way per answer" (incompatible with SO, which STRONGLY discourages a poster posting 25 different answers if they have 25 "specific ways" to indicate...!-): prototyping in order to explore some specific assembly or collection thereof that you're unfamiliar with (to check if you've understood their docs right and how to perform certain tasks) is an order of magnitude more productive in IronPython than in C#, as you can explore interactively and compilation is instantaneous and as-needed. (Have not tried IronRuby but I'll assume it can work in a roughly equivalent way and speed).
