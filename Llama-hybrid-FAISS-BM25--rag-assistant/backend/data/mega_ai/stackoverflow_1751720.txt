Late answer, but one could avoid the processing altogether by using an AJAX-based solution; there wouldn't be an issue with including a nonce with this processing scheme, but by using an asynchronous query which, on success, redirects the user, the requests are not repeated by refreshing, pressing back, or anything other than clicking the button. It is also easy to implement a mechanism that prevents the button from either being pressed twice or being "locked up" if something happened during the request by embedding into the handler for the request (whether high level with PrototypeJS or jQuery or low level with your handrolled function) the mechanisms to enable and disable the button when the request completes and first fires, respectively.
