An script that accepts a command

#!/bin/sh #My script echo "Are you sure you want to reorganize your files?" echo "Type y or Y to continue. Anything else will stop the process" read response if [ "$response" = "y" ] || [ "$response" = "Y" ]; then mkdir video mkdir audio mkdir text mv -v *.txt text >> log.txt mv -v *.wmv video >> log.txt mv -v *.mov video >> log.txt mv -v *.mpg video >> log.txt mv -v *.mp3 audio >> log.txt mv -v *.wma audio >> log.txt echo "Yay, it worked!" else echo "Nothing happened." fi I wrote the script above to organize files into subfolders. For instance the music files will go into an audio folder. Now I would like to take a step further and make it more global.I would like to allow the script to accept a command line argument, which is the folder that contains the unorganized files. This should allow the script to be located and run from anywhere in the file system, and accept any folder of unorganized files. Example: organizefiles.sh mystuff/media // subfolders would go inside "media" the folder media contains all of the media files. Thank you!
