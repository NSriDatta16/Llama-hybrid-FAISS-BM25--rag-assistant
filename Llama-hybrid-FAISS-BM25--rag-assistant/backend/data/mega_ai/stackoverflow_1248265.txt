Most implementations of JavaScript don't support creating getter/setter properties so it wouldn't be super useful on the web. However there are some implementations that do. Here's an example in Mozilla's implementation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Defining_Getters_and_Setters EDIT: Let me just clarify, writing getters/setters is syntactic sugar over the use of a getFoo()/setFoo(foo) style property. It is for the developer's benefit. IMO, for a web app (due primarily to IE's lack of support) it isn't quite realistic just yet. While IE market share is dropping, depending upon your demographics in a widely public app, a lot of your visitors at this point still won't have support for them.
