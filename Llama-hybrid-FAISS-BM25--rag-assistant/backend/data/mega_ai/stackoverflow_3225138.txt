Matplotlib: plot multiple graphs using same figure, without them overlapping

I have a class which I use to plot things then save them to a file. Here's a simplified version of it: import matplotlib matplotlib.use('Agg') import matplotlib.pyplot as plt class Test(): def __init__(self, x, y, filename): fig = plt.figure(1) ax = fig.add_subplot(111) ax.plot(x, y, 'D', color='red') ax.set_xbound(-5,5) ax.set_ybound(-5,5) plt.savefig('%s.png' % filename) test1 = Test(1,2, 'test1') test2 = Test(2,4, 'test2') Here are the results: test1 test2 The problem is that the test2 image also has the point from test1. The graphs are generated dynamically in a loop so I can't hardcode the figure number. I could make a counter and pass it to the class constructor but I was wondering if there's a more elegant way to do this. I tried deleting the test1 object but that didn't do anything.
