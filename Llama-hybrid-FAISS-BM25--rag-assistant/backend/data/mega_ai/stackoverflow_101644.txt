Examples: . . . In Java Non-Iterative Loops: Non-Nested Loops: . . . The Index is a value. . . . using i , as you would in Algebra, is the most common practise . . . for (int i = 0; i Nested Loops: . . . Differentiating Indices lends to comprehension. . . . using a descriptive suffix . . . for (int iRow = 0; iRow foreach Loops: . . . An Object needs a name. . . . using a descriptive name . . . for (Object something : somethings) { // LOOP_BODY } Iterative Loops: for Loops: . . . Iterators reference Objects. An Iterator it is neither; an Index, nor an Indice. . . . iter abreviates an Iterators purpose . . . for (Iterator iter = collection.iterator(); iter.hasNext(); /* N/A */) { Object object = iter.next(); // LOOP_BODY } while Loops: . . . Limit the scope of the Iterator. . . . commenting on the loops purpose . . . /* LOOP_DESCRIPTION */ { Iterator iter = collection.iterator(); while (iter.hasNext()) { // LOOP_BODY } } This last example reads badly without comments, thereby encouraging them. It's verbose perhaps, but useful in scope limiting loops in C.
