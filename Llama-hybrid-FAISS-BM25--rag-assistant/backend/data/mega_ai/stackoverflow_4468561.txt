Distribution Profile not visisble in XCode

I know this may seem similar to other questions on here but just here me out. I'm trying to submit an iOS app to the store for a client, but cannot get his Distribution profile to show up in Edit>Project> Code Signing menu. I have downloaded and installed it. The strange thing is that it appears in the "Organizer." I have cleaned the project repeatedly and deleted my distribution profile. I'm on the verge of reinstalling XCode and the iOS SDK and am hoping that there is a better and faster way to solve this problem. Please advise.
