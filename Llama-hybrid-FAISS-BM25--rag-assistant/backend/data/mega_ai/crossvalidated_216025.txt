Categorical PCA: Merge categories based on Transformation Plots?

A tutorial on categorical pca (CATPCA) (Linting et al. 2012) explains that a decision to merge categories of an ordinal variable can be made based on the category quantification ("none of the transformation plots show extreme category quantifications, merging categories is not necessary." P.22). The process of determination is not very clear or intuitive to me. How do you determine whether merging categories is warranted based on transformation plots? SPSS CATPCA produces a separate category quantification output but it is unclear how one gleans this info based on the transformation plots specifically.
