To measure the network performance, iperf is the best tool I have seen. I do not believe this will be helpful in solving your problem, however. You aren't going to be able to size a NAS solution based on the network performance. Transferring a file using the same protocol the NAS would is certainly more relevant for this case. Still, not helpful. You can assume that any modern machine can transfer data at over 90% of the link speed. (whether involving the local storage or not, unless there's a problem or significant other load). A dozen reasonably modern clients should be able to crush a fairly powerful NAS. You really need to simulate real-world load. That's basically imposssible. You need to approach sizing your NAS solution from a different perspective. The capabilities of the clients really aren't relevant.
