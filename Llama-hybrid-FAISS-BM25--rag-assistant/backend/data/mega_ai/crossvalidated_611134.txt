The other answers have this exactly correct, but I'll explain why it seems so surprising. The trick is that the way the problem is posed hides the goalposts a little bit. We know we have a tiny sample and a high-confidence CI, but the problem sort of glosses over the fact that when choosing even just 5 individuals, the width of the "max-min" range will usually be quite large . It should not be terribly surprising that we can confidently claim that the median is within some very large range. We are likely treading into the territory of "statistically significant, but practically useless". Even very small samples can be used to make conclusions of arbitrary statistical confidence simply by relaxing the width of the tested interval. Here, the sampling approach naturally gives us a large interval, which might be the surprising part. A knee-jerk reaction might be to think that a small sample size and high-confidence CI are incompatible and cannot be observed together. But given any sample size at all, you can build a CI of any confidence you want, so long as you make it wide enough. What's surprising here is just how wide of a range you get, on average, when selecting only 5 individuals from the population. Choosing 5 individuals from any distribution at all results in a range that covers, on average, the middle two thirds of the population! And since this method tends to put the range nearer the middle than the extremes of possible values, the chance of containing the median individual is even higher than percentage of the population covered. With that knowledge, it shouldn't be surprising to define a range using a method that usually covers a majority of the population , and be quite confident that the median is in that range. Yes, we have a method that reliably generates a range that contains the median, but that range is so large that it usually contains most other observed values, too. It's already unlikely to pick 5 individuals and find a range that covers less than 50 percentiles of the population, and even less likely to have that sub-majority range land entirely on one side of the median, which is the only way you can avoid containing the median.
