+1 to comments above about graphing interaction. An initial approach to thinking about a three-way interaction is that it is saying that the pattern of results contained in the interaction between A and B depends upon the level/value of C. The following is framed in a linear regression kind of framework, but conceptually similar to e.g. logistic regression. This assumes that you're happy with thinking about two-way interactions, of course :-) Let's say there are three predictors, A (continuous), B (categorical), and C (categorical). A two way A*B interaction would indicate that the slope of A (relating to the outcome) depends on the level of B to which an individual belongs. In this context, a three way A*B*C interaction would indicate that the A*B interaction (previously discussed differential slopes of A on the outcome according to group of B) depends on the group of C to which one belongs... Things are much more complex if there are two continuous/ordinal predictors in the interaction (usually too complex to conceptualise: I would be interested to hear others' opinions on this.)
