Architecture Question

I have a situation where I need to propose a solution along with stack of technologies that need to be used for the below business case Business Case: I am receiving a car manufacturing data set from various car manufacturing companies, the data set for each car model is different and have different number of attributes but I do receive them in csv files every 2 minutes. I need to choose a particular storage format so that it is easy to query by each car model and based on the model, i select, i should be able to display the different features of that car model. Is there a recommended architecture for this type of data analysis?
