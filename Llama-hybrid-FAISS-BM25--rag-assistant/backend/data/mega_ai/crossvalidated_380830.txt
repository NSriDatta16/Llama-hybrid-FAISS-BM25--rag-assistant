Why data points are thought as random variable

I'am currently following a basic statistics course and a machine learning course. I try to understand what is covariance. In general, books define covariance as follows: Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together. Okay, I got the definition, I understood the formula of covariance etc. However, when I search on the web to find an example where covariance calculated, I found a video on youtube . Starting from 43 seconds in that video, she tries to find the covariance of set of 4 data points. This is the part I confused. How the random variables are related with data points ? Is it because these data points are sampled from a distribution we don't know and if we talk about a distribution there have to be a random variable ? If this is the case, isn't it a continuous random variable ? Is it possible to calculate the covariance of 2 continuous random variables in the same way as it is done for discrete random variables ?
