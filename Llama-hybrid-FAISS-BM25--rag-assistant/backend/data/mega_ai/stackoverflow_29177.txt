DoDragDrop and MouseUp

Is there an easy way to ensure that after a drag-and-drop fails to complete, the MouseUp event isn't eaten up and ignored by the framework? I have found a blog post describing one mechanism , but it involves a good deal of manual bookkeeping, including status flags, MouseMove events, manual "mouse leave" checking, etc. all of which I would rather not have to implement if it can be avoided.
