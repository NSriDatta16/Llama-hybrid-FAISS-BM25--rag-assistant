Are the elements part of the SubTree of your canvas? or outside of the canvas? If they are within then you could probably use the Capture method that takes a CaptureMode . Mouse.Capture(elementToCapture, CaptureMode.SubTree); Alternatively, you should look at the DragDrop class and consider using the Drop event instead?
