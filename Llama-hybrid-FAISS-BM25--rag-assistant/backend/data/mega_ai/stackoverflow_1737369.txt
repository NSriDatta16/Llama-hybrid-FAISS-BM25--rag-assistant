get touch coordinates (in the form of 0-480 and 0-320)

i dont get how to translate the coordinates of the iphone. if i make a single touch i get the coordinate. if i make a touch and keep it and release it it shows the difference of the starting and end point. how do i get the absolute position of the touch? thanks! -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; NSLog(@"X: %f",location.x); NSLog(@"Y: %f",location.y); } I want to resize an image with touch and drag(only the height)
