What is the colloquial name for the "look elsewhere" effect?

The particle physics community tends to report the significance of a discovery by first calculating the p-values over a range of hypotheses (i.e. values of mass for the hypothetical particle), and then correcting for the " look elsewhere effect ". As far as I can tell, this is particle physics jargon referring to the tendency of multiple trials to produce a significant p-value, even if the null hypothesis is true. But this is such a basic principle in statistics. Sure, it's ignored (much to the annoyance of any competent scientist) for reasons ranging from incompetence to propaganda, but it's still extremely well known. The problem: I can't get any good results typing "look-elsewhere effect" into Google. There must be some other, more colloquial, name for this, anyone know what it is?
