What I've done is to make sure that to the extent that it's possible, all errors get caught before the PDF generation begins. That way you can send back a plain old set of form errors, or whatever. Once you've started sending back an attachment like that, the browser isn't going to pay attention to anything else. If you absolutely can't find errors before you get into generating the PDF file, I think the only thing you can do is to embed the error messages in the PDF itself (unpleasant, I know).
