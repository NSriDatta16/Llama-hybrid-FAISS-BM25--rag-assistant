The principle of your model would be analogous to the one of a Denoising Autoencoder . In this kind of Autoencoders, you train a Network to reconstruct an image from a deteriorated version of it. You need something similar to that: training a convolutional Autoencoder to "get a circle out of an input ellipse". You can take a look at this implementation of a Denoising Autoencoder on the Keras website. I think that's a good start.
