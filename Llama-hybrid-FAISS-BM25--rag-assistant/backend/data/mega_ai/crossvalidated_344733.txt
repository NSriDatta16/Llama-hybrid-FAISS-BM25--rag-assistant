If you want to actually run some such methods I'd recommend looking at scikit-learn's manifold package. It contains methods like Locally Linear Embedding, Isomap, Local Tangent Space Alignment and spectral techniques (the ones based on Laplacian of kNN graph). In addition to that, the page I linked also contains explanations, links to relevant articles and computational complexity. There is also a recent algorithm that was compared to t-SNE by its authors - UMAP ( Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ). It uses tougher math than algos from sklearn.manifold , but it should be interesting as the authors suggest it is fundamentally faster than t-SNE.
