@grand_chat has the correct maths, I'm just growing in a comparative example to help illustrate what the issue is in different terms that will hopefully help understanding. We're working with fractional terms here, similar to say miles per gallon. If we average mpg over set units of time we get very different results compared to over set units of fuel or distance. If we travel 10 minutes at 50 mph achieving 50mpg then 10 minutes at 60 achieving 30 mpg and we then want to calculate the average fuel efficiency for the journey. Time based average (with one minute representing a unit of time) is $(50*10+30*10) /20 = 40 mpg$ But the distance we travel is $50/6 + 60/6 = 18.33 miles $ given that ten minutes is 1/6 th of an hour The fuel we use is $(50/6)/50 +(60/6)/30=1/6+2/6 = 1/2 gallon$ This means our average mpg is in fact $18.33/(1/2)=36.66$ Because the total variance is different in every fold you would need to account for this in the averaging to maintain the monotonic relationship. Since it is present in the R2 calculation but not the RMSE then you can get rank switching by not accounting for the total variance in each fold
