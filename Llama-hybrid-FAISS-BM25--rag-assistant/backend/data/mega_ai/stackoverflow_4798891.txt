Compiler generates javascript files, not java files. They are in your war directory, under your modules name. Each generated javascript file is optimized for different browsers in different language (if you are using internationalization module). If you create your own classes with native javascript, you may specify which implementation should be used with certain user-agents, so deferred binding works with your custom code as well.
