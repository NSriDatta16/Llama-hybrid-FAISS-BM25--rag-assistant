Programmaticaly prevent Vista desktop search (WDS) from indexing pst files placed on mapped network drives

After several days and multiple attempts I didn't find any 100% solution for this trouble. My search and investigation scopes: Direct access to registry: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search\CrawlScopeManager\Windows\SystemIndex\WorkingSetRules HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows Search\Gather\Windows\SystemIndex\Protocols\Mapi HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search\Gather\Windows\SystemIndex\Sites\ and other keys... Windows Search 3.X interfaces like ISearchManager using Microsoft.Search.Interop Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook classes: NameSpace, Store AD policies (useless, no effect :( Preferred technologies: VB.NET, C#. This solution must be deployed within a large organization (about 5000 wokstations). Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
