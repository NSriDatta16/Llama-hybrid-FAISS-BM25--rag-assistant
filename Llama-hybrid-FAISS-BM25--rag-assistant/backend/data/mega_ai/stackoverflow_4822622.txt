If disabling log output is what you want, add a logback configuration file to src/test/resources which discards all output. If you need to do this for multiple modules in the same reactor build, consider using the maven remote resources plugin . This plugin is used to retrieve JARs of resources from remote repositories, processes those resources, and incorporate them into JARs you build with Maven. A very common use-case is the need to package certain resources in a consistent way across your organization.
