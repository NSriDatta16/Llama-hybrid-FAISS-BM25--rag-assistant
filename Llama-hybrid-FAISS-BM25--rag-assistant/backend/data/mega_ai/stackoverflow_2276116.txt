Xcode Interface Builder: Z-Index, Z-order of a button, image, UI element, etc?

I'm dragging things around in an Xcode Interface Builder Storyboard... I'd like to specify whether an image is in front (like an indicator) or behind a button (like a background). I don't see any z-index property as I'm used to seeing on other environments. If there isn't a z-index property, what is the best way to go about what I'm trying to accomplish?
