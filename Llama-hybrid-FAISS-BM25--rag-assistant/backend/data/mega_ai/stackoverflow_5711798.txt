Assuming both tables are equivalent in terms of index, row-sizing and other structures. Also assuming that you are running that simple SELECT statement. If you have an ORDER BY clause in your SQL statements, then obviously the larger table will be slower. I suppose you're not asking that. If X = Y, then obviously they should run in similar speed, since the query engine will be going through the records in exactly the same order -- basically a table scan -- for this simple SELECT statement. There will be no difference in query plan. If Y > X only by a little bit, then also similar speed. However, if Y >> X (meaning Y has many many more rows than X), then the LIMIT version MAY be slower. Not because of query plan -- again should be the same -- but simply because that the internal structure of data layout may have several more levels. For example, if data is stored as leafs on a tree, there may be more tree levels, so it may take slightly more time to access the same number of pages. In other words, 1000 rows may be stored in 1 tree level in 10 pages, say. 1000000 rows may be stored in 3-4 tree levels in 10000 pages. Even when taking only 10 pages from those 10000 pages, the storage engine still has to go through 3-4 tree levels, which may take slightly longer. Now, if the storage engine stores data pages sequentially or as a linked list, say, then there will be no difference in execution speed.
