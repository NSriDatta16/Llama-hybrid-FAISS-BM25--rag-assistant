You can redirect on failure, to another task that does nothing, ie a script that just returns true. To do this, add the new script task, highlight your FTP task, a second green connector will appear, drag this to the script task, and then double click it. Select Failure on the Value drop down. Obviously, you'll then need to handle real failures in this script task to still display right in the Job history.
