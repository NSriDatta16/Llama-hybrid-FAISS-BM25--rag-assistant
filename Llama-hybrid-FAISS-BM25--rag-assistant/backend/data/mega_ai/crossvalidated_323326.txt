PCA: Should I work with rotated score or originals score?

I am currently trying to find the meaning of principal components of my data. I find the raw loading very hard to interpret, because the first components drags a large part of the total variance (50 %). So I decide to do a varimax rotation for a easier interpretation of my components. I work in R, and with the psych packages, I can have to access to rotated scores too. Does this scores, have the same meaning of unrotated raw scores ? Should I just do a rotation for interpretation of components loadings, and project my observations in the unrotated space ? Thanks !
