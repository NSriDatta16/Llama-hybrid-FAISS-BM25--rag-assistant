I haven't seen any examples to predict code using encoder-decoder methods (but you probably can!). However, " The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks " by Andrej Karpathy outlines how RNN models can be used to generate source code for $\LaTeX$ documents and the Linux kernel, so that method should be just as effective at the HTML/XML task.
