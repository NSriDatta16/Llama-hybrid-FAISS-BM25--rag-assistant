Which statistical model should I apply when the DV is a count variable?

What is best statistical model to assess effect of habitat type and year (categorical factors), and plant species percent coverage (%), as independent variables on the dependent variable: insect abundance (count)? I have zeros in my data and the DV is not normally distributed.
