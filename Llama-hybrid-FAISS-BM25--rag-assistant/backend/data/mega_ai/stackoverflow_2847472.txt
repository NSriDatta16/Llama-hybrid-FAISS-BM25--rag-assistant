First off, Tcl 8.3.5 is ancient and relatively slow. Upgrading to 8.4 or 8.5 (if you can) will see performance improvements (exactly which is faster depends on what your script is doing). Secondly, SQLite support is typically done through a loadable package (conventionally called sqlite3 ). You'll want to get a build that works with the oldest version of Tcl you're supporting (simply compiling in stubbed mode – I think that's default anyway – against the oldest Tcl version you want to support should be fine) and then put that in a directory (as a full install of the package) that you have on your code's auto_path . One of the nicest ways to do this is to get hold of a tclkit single-file-executable for Linux and to embed the sqlite3 package together with your in that; that's good because you can get everything together in one place so that users can't disrupt things easily by setting environment variables or other such nonsense. There is more help on doing this at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1379577/… Thirdly, mixing databases and NFS (or any other networked filesystem) is not recommended due to the difficulties with distributed locking and ensuring a proper flush to permanent storage during transaction COMMIT. Ensuring data integrity under those conditions is just plain difficult!
