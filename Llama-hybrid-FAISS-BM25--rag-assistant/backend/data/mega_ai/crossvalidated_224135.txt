Logarithmic loss = Logistic loss = log loss = $-y_i\log(p_i) - (1 -y_i) \log(1 -p_i)$ Sometimes people take a different logarithmic base, but it typically doesn't matter. I hear logistic loss more often. FYI: How is logistic loss and cross-entropy related? Thesaurus for statistics and machine learning terms When is log-loss metric appropriate for evaluating performance of a classifier? Multi-class logarithmic loss function per class
