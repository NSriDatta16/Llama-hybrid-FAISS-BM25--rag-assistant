You need a high precision timer. In case of Visual Studio use QueryPerformanceCounter . If the precision is still not enough, use compiler intristics: #include #pragma intrinsic(__rdtsc) unsigned __int64 ticks = __rdtsc(); See info on that intristic here . Both solutions are Windows only, the latter is probably MSVC only. I can post a similar solution for GCC/Linux if needed.
