Thanks for your suggestions Michael. I could indeed fix my graphic issues by using the following code: [bubbleView setImage:[bubble stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:165 topCapHeight:30]]; Instead of using 3 separate images to create chat bubbles I can now use 1 image and it stretches gracefully. A very nice suggestion indeed :) Even though I didn't seem to have much speed issues, I did rewrite my code partially as you suggested, mainly by constructing the main part of the cells in the cell initializer part of the code. I did notice a minor speed improvement, perhaps it's more noticeable on a device (as compared to the simulator). Currently I still draw my images using ImageView (as you might notice), I'll look at [UIImage drawInRect:] whenever I need more speed in rendering. Thanks for your suggestions, much appreciated.
