if you want to set the flash background colour then you have to use the bgcolor setting in embedding, or add it to swfObject with the 6th value ( see here ). if you are using a transparent flash etc then the colour is defined by your html/CSS content. have a check of your background or background-color settings for the div you are embedding it into.
