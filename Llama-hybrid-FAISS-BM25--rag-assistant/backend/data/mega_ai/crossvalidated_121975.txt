Can we learn 3d features using Autoencoder?

Typically, we use Autoencoder to learn 2d features on 2d images (e.g. pen-strokes of digit). For example, if I have 10000 3d 31x31x31 images (e.g. car images). I unroll each of the images, i.e. 31x31x31 to 29791. So, I have 29791x10000 as my input vectors. If I run unsupervised learning---autoencoder on it with 100 hidden units, can I obtain 100 distinct 3d features? Will the 3d optimal activation equation(in term of weights) for each feature be the same as 2d ones?
