I think you are right. The best way to achieve what you are describing IMHO is to place URL's of links you want to open in new windows into an array, using return false; in order to prevent actually opening link and then to use some sort of loop to open all of them. I took a liberty of putting together few lines of jQuery code that will do what you have described: $(document).ready(function() { var $hash = new Array(); // We create new Array $('a').click( function(){ // On each click to element if ( $(this).attr("data-pack") == "true" ) { // check wether this is one of the links we use $hash[$(this).attr("id")] = $(this).attr("href"); // We add href value into $hash object $(this).css("color","green"); // Way to mark selected ones $(this).attr("data-pack", "selected"); // Change data-pack property value to selected return false; // We don't want to execute this yet } else if ( $(this).attr("data-pack") == "selected" ) { // In case you change your mind and want to unselect $(this).attr("data-pack", "true"); // Change data-pack property back, thanks to Ambrosia pointing it out in the comment $(this).css("color","red"); // We mark it as unset delete $hash[$(this).attr("id")]; // Remove it from hash return false; } }); $("form").submit( function(){ // After we submit for (var i in $hash) { // Go trough $hash window.open($hash[i]); // And open window for each member } return false; // We don't actually want to submit form, just open new windows :) } ); }); HTML would look something like: Page Title data data data data ordinary link
