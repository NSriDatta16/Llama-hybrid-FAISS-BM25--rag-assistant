With the WCF REST Starter Kit, you should be able to create a method that returns an XElement as its return value: [WebHelp(Comment = "Returns order state based on client and order number")] [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "OrderStatus")] [OperationContract] public XElement OrderStatus(q_order_status request) { ..... } In that case, your method implementation could look something like this: public XElement OrderStatus(q_order_status request) { return new XElement("q_order_status", new XAttribute("error_id", 0), new XElement("client_acr", "client acr value"), new XElement("order_acr", "order acr value") ); } This would return an XML fragment like this: client acr value order acr value This way, anything really is possible - it's totally up to you how and what to create in terms of XML structure.
