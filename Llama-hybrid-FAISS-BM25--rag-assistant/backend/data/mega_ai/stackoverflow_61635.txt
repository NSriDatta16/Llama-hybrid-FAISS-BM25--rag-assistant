"Beautifying" an OS X disk image

When I downloaded Skype, I noticed that, in place of a normal "disk image" icon, there was a custom icon, and when I double clicked on the icon, the window used a colorful image as the background, prompting me to drag the skype icon into the applications folder. How can I do that with my applications? Thanks, Jason
