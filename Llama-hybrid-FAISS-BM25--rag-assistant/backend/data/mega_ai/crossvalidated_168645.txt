Machine Learning: What are the types of data set?

Is there a classification of the type of data sets in machine learning problems? I am specifically interested in classification problems. I know a large number of algorithms like SVM, NN, Decision Trees, etc exist for classification problems. I wonder if some properties of data set (like presence of natural clusters, number of training instances, type of input, etc) would give in-sights on which algorithm would work best for the problem.
