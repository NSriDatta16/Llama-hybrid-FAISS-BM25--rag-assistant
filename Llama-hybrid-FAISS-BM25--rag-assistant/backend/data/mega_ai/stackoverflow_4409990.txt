php elegance keys unsetting

I need to remove from an array some keys. $array = array('a' => 'a', 'b' => 'b', 'c' => 'c'); unset($array['a']); unset($array['b']); How can I do this more elegance? Maybe there is a function like this array_keys_unset('a', 'b') ? I don't need array_values or foreach . I only want to know is it possible. Thank you in advance. Sorry for my english and childlike question.
