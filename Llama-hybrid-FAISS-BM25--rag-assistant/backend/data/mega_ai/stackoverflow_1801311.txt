Magento Fatal Error: Call to member function getSku() on a non-object

I have come across a bizarre error in the Magento shop I'm developing and despite my inquiries online, it appears no one else has ever seen this exact error under the same circumstances. Lemme 'splain. The full text of the error message is this: Fatal error: Call to a member function getSku() on a non-object in /path/on/server/app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Product/Option/Type/Select.php on line 221. Now, others have gotten this error message--it was addressed and supposedly fixed in the 1.3.1 roadmap ( http://www.magentocommerce.com/roadmap/release/1.3.1 ). However, the circumstances of those other error messages were where they tried to add an item to the cart--if the item had custom options, it would loop to this error message. My situation is that I have a SIMPLE item--not bundled or configurable--without any custom options. I can add it to the cart without any trouble. But if I run through the entire checkout procedure, upon placing the order, the error message appears on a white screen. The URL in the browser shows me I’m on the checkout success page. AND, the order appears to go through perfectly, getting registered by both Magento AND Authorize.net. I’ve tried debugging the error as far as I can go, but this one’s got me stumped. For reference, I’m in Magento 1.3.2.4. When I first received the error I reinstalled all the core files and was still able to replicate the error. I’m going to continue to test, but if anyone has ANY bright ideas about why this is happening, I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’m so close to launch and this thing could put the kibosh on the whole thing.
