In javascript, using the "bang" operator (!) will return true if the given value is true, 1, not null, etc. It will return false if the value is undefined, null, 0, or an empty string. So the bang operator will always return a boolean value, but it will represent the opposite value of what you began with. If you take the result of that operation and "bang" it again, you can reverse it again, but still end up with a boolean (and not undefined, null, etc). Using the bang twice will take a value that could have been undefined, null, etc, and make it just plain false . It will take a value that could have been 1, "true", etc. and make it just plain true . The code could have been written: var context = document.createElement('canvas').getContext; var contextDoesNotExist = !context; var contextExists = !contextDoesNotExist; return contextExists;
