A test is a question that we have about the product. The idea of one test per (written) branch might be useful or silly. I have some questions about the example you give input (x, y) if (x something if (x==y) something if (x > y) something output (x) What happens if x is greater than zero? Are you supposed to fall through? What's supposed to happen if x is less than y? Something? Nothing? Here's the thing: code (and branch) (and condition) coverage are nice ideas. But what does it mean to "cover" a line or a branch or a condition? Is it to make sure that the program can work--that is, execute a given line/branch/condition without crashing? Or is to to make sure that that program will work? ---Michael B.
