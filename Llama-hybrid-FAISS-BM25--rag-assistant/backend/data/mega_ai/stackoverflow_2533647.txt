How can you debug Lego Mindstorms programs?

Is there any way to add any sort of debugging to a Lego Mindstorms program, when using the NXT drag-and-drop environment? It would be nice to be able to monitor the status of the various sensors, but even knowing what step in the program was running would be nice.
