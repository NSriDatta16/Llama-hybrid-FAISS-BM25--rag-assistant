Comparing regression coefficients of models with differnet dependent variables

I am interested in comparing response (dependent) variables (2+) in a regression format where the models share the same data and design matrix. As an example, lets say I am interested in whether numerical counts of aquatic organisms, or the biomass of those organisms is more "sensitive" to the same disturbance gradient (e.x., flood frequency). So I figured, comparing regression coefficients, specifically slopes would be appropriate. Could you please tell me if you have a better idea, or if this is not appropriate. Thank you.
