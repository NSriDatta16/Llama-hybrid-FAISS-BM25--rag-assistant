How to interpret correctly this chart about nitrogen oxide?

I found the below chart in a test for university access in Sweden, with the following question: How large was the total emission of nitrogen oxides caused by Swedish consumption under the period 2004-2008? I have the correct solution, but it does not match my answer. I reasoned like this: Both 2004 and 2008 should be included, so we have 5 years. The emissions abroad are about 112 thousand tons on average, so 112*5 = 560 The emissions in Sweden are about 225 thousand tons on average, so 225*5 = 1100. So the total should be about 160+1100 = 1660. However, apparently the correct answer is 1100. I am quite sure I am missing something obvious, but I cannot figure it out. Translation of the most important terms: Utsl채pp i Sverige: emission in Sweden Utsl채pp utomlands: emission abroad (caused by imports). The original question in Swedish: Hur stort var det sammanlagda utsl채ppet av kv채veoxider orsakat av svensk konsumtion under perioden 2004-2008?
