I suspect that this has to do in part with the inherent omitted-variable bias in logistic regression . Leaving out any predictor associated with outcome, even if it isn't correlated with the included predictors, tends to bias the coefficient estimates of included predictors toward 0. Although the coefficient for Language itself doesn't pass the arbitrary p The difference between Wald and likelihood-ratio tests , with the first used for the coefficient estimate and the second for the difference between the models, might also come into play here. If the likelihood profile doesn't have the ideal quadratic shape, the likelihood-ratio test is more reliable.
