Take a look at acts_as_archive . This does what I think you're asking for here. Edit: Don't use Rails 2.3.5. Upgrade to 2.3.11 or switch to Rails 3, which you might as well do since you said you were just learning anyway. For the gem version, just follow the acts_as_archive instructions and use whatever the latest version is. Regarding where to put it, you should read up on Bundler . Pay special attention to the section on that page called "Using Bundler with Frameworks". Reading a Rails tutorial wouldn't hurt either, I suspect.
