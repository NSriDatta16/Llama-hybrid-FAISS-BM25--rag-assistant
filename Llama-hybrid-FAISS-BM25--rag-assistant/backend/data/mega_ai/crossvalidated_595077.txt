finding the average frequency of square wave that varies slightly using python

fairly new to data science in python, looking for some help. If I have an array of ones and zeros, which is roughly say 1000 elements zero then 1000 elements one and so on, and an array of time data corresponding to the ones and zeros in ms. How would i calculate the average frequency of the pulses using python? but where the data isnt precise. for example maybe the data is one for 900 elements then zero for 1100, the pulses vary a little in length. The pulses also aren't strictly ones and zeros, for ones the majority of values are one but some are zero. and same with zero pulses, the majority are zero but some are one. Thanks for any help you can offer, its greatly appreciated
