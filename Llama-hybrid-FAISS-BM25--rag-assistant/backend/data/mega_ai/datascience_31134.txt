Python sklearn - average classification reports

Using Python's sklearn module, from sklearn.metrics import classification_report y1_predict = [0, 1, 1, 0] y1_dev = [0, 1, 1, 0] report_1 = classification_report(y1_dev, y1_predict) y2_predict = [1, 0, 1, 0] y2_dev = [1, 1, 0, 0] report_2 = classification_report(y2_dev, y2_predict) Is there a way to combine (maybe just an average) report_1 and report_2 I'm looking for an implementation like: report_average = average(report_1,report_2) Or does this have to be done manually? I was hoping that printing the report_average would have average values between the two reports.
