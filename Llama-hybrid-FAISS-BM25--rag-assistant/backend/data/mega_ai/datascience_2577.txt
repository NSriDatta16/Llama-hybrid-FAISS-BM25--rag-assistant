This is not a regression but a multi-class classification problem. The output is typically the probabilities of all classes for any given test instance (test row). So in your case, the output for any given test row from the trained model will be of the form: prob_1, prob_2, prob_3,..., prob_k where prob_i denotes the probability of the i-th class (in your case i-th party), assuming there are k classes in the response variable. Note that the sum of these k probabilities is going to be 1. The class prediction in this case is going to be the class that has the maximum probability. There are many classifiers in R that do multi-class classification. You could use logistic regression with multi-class support through the nnet package in R and invoking the multinom command. As an alternative, you could also use the gbm package in R and invoke the gbm command. To create a multi-class classifier, just use distribution="multinomial" while using the gbm` function.
