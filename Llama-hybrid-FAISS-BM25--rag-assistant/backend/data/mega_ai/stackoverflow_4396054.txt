I can't reproduce your error with one of the inbuilt data sets, even after quite a bit of fiddling. Does this work for you? require(plm) require(car) data(Grunfeld) form Note also, that you seem to have an error in the more complex code you showed. You are using linearHypothesis() on the object ur.model , yet call vcovHC() on object plmmodel1 . Not sure if that is the problem or not, but check that in case. Is it possible to provide the data? Finally, edit your Question to include output from sessionInfo() . Mine is (from quite a busy R instance): > sessionInfo() R version 2.11.1 Patched (2010-08-25 r52803) Platform: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (64-bit) locale: [1] LC_CTYPE=en_GB.utf8 LC_NUMERIC=C [3] LC_TIME=en_GB.utf8 LC_COLLATE=en_GB.utf8 [5] LC_MONETARY=C LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.utf8 [7] LC_PAPER=en_GB.utf8 LC_NAME=C [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_GB.utf8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C attached base packages: [1] splines grid stats graphics grDevices utils datasets [8] methods base other attached packages: [1] car_2.0-2 nnet_7.3-1 plm_1.2-6 Formula_1.0-0 [5] kinship_1.1.0-23 lattice_0.19-11 nlme_3.1-96 survival_2.35-8 [9] mgcv_1.6-2 chron_2.3-37 MASS_7.3-7 vegan_1.17-4 [13] lmtest_0.9-27 sandwich_2.2-6 zoo_1.6-4 moments_0.11 [17] ggplot2_0.8.8 proto_0.3-8 reshape_0.8.3 plyr_1.2.1 loaded via a namespace (and not attached): [1] Matrix_0.999375-44 tools_2.11.1
