In what context are these terms? Surely they must be defined somewhere if needed. If you thought about them, then their definition is up to you. "Inter-annual variability" doesn't tell much. It could be the variance between yearly averages, i.e. the average of the variance within year 1, variance within year 2 etc. but that would give you only one number. Or it could be the year-over-year variance, i.e. the variance of: variable at day 1 year 1, day 1 year 2 etc., like stock returns (though I don't see this making much sense here). It may make more sense to get the "intra-annual variance" here, i.e. the variance of the variable within a year. "Seasonal amplitude" is just as vague. Could mean the absolute distance of the most extreme value observed (negative or positive) from the mean of that year/season. Or it could mean fitting a Fourier series (a sine or cosine curve may do) for each year/season and calculating the magnitude of the amplitude of the wave.
