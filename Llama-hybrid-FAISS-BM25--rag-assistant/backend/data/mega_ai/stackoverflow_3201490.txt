Re-creating the database is a good choice, especially for unit testing. If the creation script is too slow you could take a backup of the database and use it to restore the DB to an initial state before each test. The alternative would be to write a script that would drop all foreign keys in the database then delete/truncate all tables. This would not reset any autogenerated IDs or sequences however. This doesn't seem like an elegant solution and it is definitely more time consuming. In any case, this is not something that should be done through an ORM, not just NHibernate. Why do you reject the re-creation option? What are your requirements? Is the schema too complex? Does someone else design the database? Do you want to avoid file fragmentation?
