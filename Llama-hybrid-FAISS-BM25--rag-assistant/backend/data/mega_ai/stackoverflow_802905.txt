It overwrites content on the page which is the most obvious reason but I wouldn't call it "bad". It just doesn't have much use unless you're creating an entire document using JavaScript in which case you may start with document.write. Even so, you aren't really leveraging the DOM when you use document.write--you are just dumping a blob of text into the document so I'd say it's bad form.
