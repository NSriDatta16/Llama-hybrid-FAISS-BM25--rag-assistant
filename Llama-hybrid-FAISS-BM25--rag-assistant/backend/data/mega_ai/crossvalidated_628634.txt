I don't know SPSS, but I would recommend checking their documentation or manuals rather than ChatGPT - the latter will literally just make stuff up. From what I can see in the SPSS documentation a random intercept is not included by default, so you'll have to tick the 'Include Intercept' box if you want one. All other parameters will have to come from effects that may or may not already be in the fixed part of the model, so if you add a continuous ('scale' in SPSS parlance?) effect as a random one you'll have produced a random slope. Adding a categorical effect will create additional random intercepts for observations in those categories. There's nothing that would suggest to me that you can't have the same model as you're trying to fit in R. The reason for your error is explained within the error message itself: you're trying to fit too many random effect parameters for the number of observations you have within the workerId clusters. You'll need at least as many observations per cluster as you're fitting random effects (6 assuming they require a single degree of freedom each).
