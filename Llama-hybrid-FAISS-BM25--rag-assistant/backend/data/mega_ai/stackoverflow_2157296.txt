I think that, without fully embracing agile methodologies, some of its ideas may help you. For ex. Do an early stand-up so everyone knows what people will do during that day and what was done the day before Have short cycles (e.g. 2 weeks) with clear & tangible goals Aim for a "staged delivery" process Incorporate customer's feedback early in the process Aim for test-driven development, don't write without writing tests Even if this doesn't work for you guys, you should adopt some process in order to improve from something. The real mistake is to not adopt any of them all. As you grow organically, you will find some things that work, some that don't, etc. Don't follow blindly any methodology.
