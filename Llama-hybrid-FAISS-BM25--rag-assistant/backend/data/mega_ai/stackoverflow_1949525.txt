you're right in that php is a fine templating system in itself, as long as you stick to a certain subset of it in the "template" files. but insistance on a single template per web page is impractical: more often than not you'll find that you have fragments duplicated over several templates. anyway, separate files are fine. putting templates into a directory (tree) separate from the source directory (tree) is in my experience bad idea: the conceptual distance grows, you loose sight of what's really used and what's not, and as a result, you have quite a few templates that are dead but not buried, since their state is not so obvious. my suggestion: keep the "templates" together with "program" files, protected with appropriate web server configuration DocumentRoot /www AddType application/x-httpd-php .php deny from all /www/ dir1/ file.php file.tpl another-file.tpl dir2/ other-file.php other-file.tpl yet-another-file.tpl ... common/ shared-file.tpl another.tpl
