I think the aspect of NLP you're looking for is Named Entity Recognition (NER). It's already built into Python libraries like NLTK and SpaCy. Some videos that might be of interest: How to train a new 'DRUGS' entity type: https://prodi.gy/docs/video-new-entity-type Practical example: https://towardsdatascience.com/named-entity-recognition-with-nltk-and-spacy-8c4a7d88e7da The great thing for you is that out-of-the-box models are probably going to be extremely accurate in detecting place names (either LOC or GPE entity tags). They may even be able to detect drugs as a 'PRODUCT' tag. If you need to be more specific, the first video shows you how you would go about training a model for a new tag. For instance, in spaCy: import spacy nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg") doc = nlp("""When I lived in Paris last year, France was experiencing arecession. The nightlife was too fun, I developed an addiction to Adderall and Ritalin.""") print([(e.text, e.label_) for e in doc.ents]) will print something like this: [('Paris', 'GPE'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('France', 'GPE'), ('Adderall', 'PRODUCT'), ('Ritalin', 'PRODUCT')]
