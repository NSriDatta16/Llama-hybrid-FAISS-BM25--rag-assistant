"Prefix 'x' does not map to a namespace"

I want to load a DataTemplate at runtime using XamlReader , but it's throwing the exception "Prefix 'x' does not map to a namespace." This is the XML string I'm passing to XamlReader : MessageID This is the code that's reading it: ResourceDictionary dictionary = XamlReader.Parse(myXamlString) as ResourceDictionary; Here's the funny part, if I add x:Key="ValidationResponseTemplate" to the DataTemplate it parses without any exceptions. I can't keep it that way, however, because I can't specify the DataTemplate by key in the program's own .xaml (it won't know about the template until it gets fetched at runtime). The x namespace is defined in both the program's own .xaml and in the fragment of XML I'm trying to parse. Overall objective: be able to provide new DataTemplates to both change the appearance of the display at runtime, and to display XML data that the client did not know about at compile-time.
