The book Applied Predictive Modeling by Kuhn and Johnson is a highly-regarded practical machine learning book with a large section on variable transformation including Box-Cox. The authors claim that many machine learning algorithms work better if the features have symmetric and unimodal distributions. Transforming the features like this is an important part of "feature engineering".
