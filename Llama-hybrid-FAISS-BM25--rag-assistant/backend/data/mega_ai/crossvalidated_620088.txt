Do I need to worry about trends in my time series model?

I am making a model of income for the pension system over 25 years. I have the income as dependent variable and number of workers and average salary as independent. Both income and salary are effected by time trend. As the trend is on both sides do I have to deal with it? And if so what would be the best approach? I have tried to include time(Income) into my model but I am not sure if that is correct. So currently my model is like this lm(Income ~ avg_salry + num_workers + time(Income), data = data) I am not sure if I need to remove the trend in this case and if so that my approach is correct.
