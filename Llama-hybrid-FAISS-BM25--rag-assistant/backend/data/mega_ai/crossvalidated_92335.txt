How can I determine the probability that a sample has a certain average given details about the total population?

Imagine that I have goal scoring data for a hockey team. They average 2.43 goals scored per game with a standard deviation of 1.63 for this data set. They have played 82 games. I have two subsets of this data set; each subset represents data for the team when a specific goalie is on the ice (Goalie A and Goalie B). Each goalie has played 41 games in no particular order. When Goalie A has been on the ice, the team averages 2.92 goals per game. When Goalie B has been on the ice, the team averages 2.00 goals per game. Assume that the goalies have no influence on their own team's goal scoring rates. What I am trying to understand is this: is there a way to compute the probability that a team could have data subsets that differ so greatly from one another? How likely is it that the team scores almost a full goal more with one goalie on the ice as compared to the other? If anyone could set me on the right path for how a calculation like this might unfold, that would be great.
