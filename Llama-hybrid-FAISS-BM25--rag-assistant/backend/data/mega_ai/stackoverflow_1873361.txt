Here is the - not so obvious answer to my memory problem. I'll give myself this one because I learned it on the Apple dev forum form Rincewind - a very helpful Apple engineer BTW. It turns out that by slicing a large view into N smaller pieces and rendering into each in turn I will incur a memory spike that is roughly 1/N the size of the large view. So, for each smaller view: alloc/init, feed a portion of my data, setNeedsDisplay. Rinse/repeat for all N small views. Simple, eh? Prior to learning this I had mistakenly thought that setNeedsDisplay:myRect did this for the large view. Apparently not. Thanks for all the suggestions gang. Cheers, Doug @dugla
