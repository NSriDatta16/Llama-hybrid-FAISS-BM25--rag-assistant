Should the average prediction = the average value in regression?

Very basic statistics question: should the average prediction from a regression model equal the average value of the dependent variable using the same data? For example, if I collect data on the height and weight of 1,000 adults, then run a regression of height on weight, then predict height given the same sample's weights, should the mean of those predictions be the same as the mean of the sample's actual weights?
