Option 1 - using formulas LOOKUP is designed to retrieve a single value, which is what it's doing. It loops through a data range, checking whether the value is bigger/smaller than the reference value, and retrieves the first transition point. In your case, it finds the first match and stops, not what you're after at all. If you want to do this using formulas, you'll probably find SUMIF() and the newly added in 2007 SUMIFS() to be a much cleaner route. Also, side-note, in Excel 2007 Tables are your new best friend, they tidy the formulas for this kind of thing right up and look after things like expanding ranges. Your example above, using tables, would be translated to: =SUMIF(Table2[Team],Table1[[#This Row],[Team]],Table2[Hours]) where Table1 is the equivalent of your Sheet1, and Table2 maps to Sheet2 Of course the reason that this won't provide what you're after is that this is summarising by team only, whereas you want to apply 2 filters, so you'd move to SUMIFS() and end up with: =SUMIFS(Table2[Hours],Table2[Proj_Number],Table1[[#This Row],[Proj_Number]],Table2[Team],Table1[[#This Row],[Team]]) The benefit is that your formula will always recalculate automatically, the downside is that you have to manually update your Table1. Option 2 - pivot tables Insert --> Pivot table will create your pivot table, set the range as appropriate. Then drag Project Number into Row labels, drag Team name below it also in Row labels, and drag Hours into the Values box. That'll give you a breakdown by project by team of how many hours. You can then mess around with the options to get it exactly how you want, by doing things like turning off the level 1 summaries. Those kind of options are best found by experimentation, they live in the PivotTable Design tab. The catch is the need to manually refresh the pivot table, the benefit is that when you add new projects they'll be taken care of easily.
