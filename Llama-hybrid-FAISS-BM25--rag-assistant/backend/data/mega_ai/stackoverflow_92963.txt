One thing is that I try to stick to instant messaging when I Communicate with people. In general people will find it natural to communicate back with me via the instant messenger. At least, that's how the culture of my organization works. The IM is preferable because you can choose to answer it when you're ready - unlike the phone or face-to-face. Email is a much more extreme example of what IM buys you, but in my organization most people try to avoid using email because pretty much everyone gets flooded with internal spam, and nobody reads mail in a timely manner. Try to get people to use IM more so your thoughts aren't scattered as often. Also, listen to some ambient or instrumental music via headphones, preferably noise-cancelling. People are less likely to bother you if you have headphones on, especially if they know you're at your desk and they can instant message you. But like I Said, you answer your IM's when it's convenient for you. Try to get people used to being ignored for 5-15 minutes at a time. Yes, your problems aren't so critical that I have to address them this very instant. I consider email to be up to a day's turnaround time, so I try to not check it as often.
