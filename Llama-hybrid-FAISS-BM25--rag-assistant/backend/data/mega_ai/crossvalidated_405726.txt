It's almost pointless to talk about white noise in relation to such short time series. Think of this: you have to establish spectral uniformity of the series. The fidelity and bandwidth of spectral decomposition is so low that you can't reliably claim much on this series in terms of whiteness of the noise, in my opinion. On the second point, the mean being not zero, the answer could be YES to a reformulated question: can the noise in my series be white if the mean of the series is greater than zero? If you have series $x_t=c+\varepsilon_t$ , where $c >0$ is a constant, then $E[x_t]>0$ even when $\varepsilon_t$ is white noise. If you remove the bias in your series, and they become zero mean and colorless, thwn why not call them white noise with bias?
