How does jQuery-UI know how to bind event callbacks supplied as init options?

How does jQuery-UI know to bind callbacks passed as init options? I'm thinking the answer is somewhere in the $.widget.bridge method (ln 71) but I'm not entirely sure what's going on there. An example of what I'm talking about is something like the autocomplete search event . The code example shows that I can bind to 'search' with init options but I don't see anything specific to this behavior autocomplete's code. This technique seems cool. I'd like to leverage it.
