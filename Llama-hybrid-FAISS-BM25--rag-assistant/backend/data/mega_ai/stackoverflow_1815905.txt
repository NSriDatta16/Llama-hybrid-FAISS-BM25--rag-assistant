This question is somewhat relevant: String Literals As pointed out, the storage of string literals in ROM/RAM is platform/implementation dependent, you should not make any predictions for that. Also using a script to read and create array of appropriate sizes and store them is quite undesirable. You should better go for dynamic memory .
