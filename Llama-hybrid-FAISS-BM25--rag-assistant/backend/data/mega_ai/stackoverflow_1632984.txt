Agree with Mark, you should contact Kagi and see if they have something updated to offer. Something similar happened with Kagi's embedded library during the transition to i386: http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/85/kagi-universal For me, it turned out to be one example of many where it's ultimately not worth the risk of embedding compiled code that you can't compile/fix yourself. I no longer depend upon the Kagi stuff, for a variety of reasons.
