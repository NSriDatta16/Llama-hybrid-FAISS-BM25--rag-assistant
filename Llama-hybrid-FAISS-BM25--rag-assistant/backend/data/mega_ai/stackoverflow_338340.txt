Suggest a good PHP wiki engine

I am looking for a small wiki engine that is easy to embed into an existing PHP application. Or perhaps a set of libraries to handle all the typical wiki functions. Currently I am using ErfurtWiki , but it is starting to show its age. It hasn't been updated since 2005, and several of the pages on sourceforge appear to have been hacked . I will be including it with a GPLv2 application so a GPL compatible license is important. Edit: To update, mostly I am just looking for text formatting/parser functionality. I want to deal with the storage, security, rev history, etc on my own.
