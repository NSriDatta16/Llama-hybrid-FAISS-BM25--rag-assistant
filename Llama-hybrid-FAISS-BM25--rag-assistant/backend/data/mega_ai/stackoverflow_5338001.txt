ASIHTTPRequest post json to php server

I have been trying to post a json object to a PHP script for the last 5 hours. I have read all the docs and it seems the code should work BUT it does not. The request is made and received ok, but I can't access the posted json data or dont even know if its been sent correctly. I keep getting an empty php array, instead of the json data. NSString *jsonString = [self.tableDataSource JSONRepresentation]; NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://myserver.com/test.php"]; ASIHTTPRequest *request = [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURL:url]; [request addRequestHeader:@"User-Agent" value:@"ASIHTTPRequest"]; [request addRequestHeader:@"Content-Type" value:@"application/json"]; [request appendPostData:[jsonString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]]; [request startSynchronous]; here is the php script (test.php) $handle = fopen('php://input','r'); $jsonInput = fgets($handle); $decoded = json_decode($jsonInput,true); print_r($decoded); I am using the lastest ASIHttpRequest code from https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request.git What am I doing wrong????? Cheers, Trav.
