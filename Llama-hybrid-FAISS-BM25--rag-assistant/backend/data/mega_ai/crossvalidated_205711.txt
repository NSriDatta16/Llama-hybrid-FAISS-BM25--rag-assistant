As you said, say you have an estimated regression coefficient $\beta = 12$ and the maximum value is 0.016. This means that the hazard ratio between an individual with the value 0.016 and an individual with the value 0 is $\exp(0.016 \times 12) = e^{0.192} \approx 1.21 $. What you see probably in the R output as hazard ratio for that coefficient is $e^{12} \approx 16254$ which would be the hazard ratio between a hypothetical individual with the value 1 and an individual with 0. Thus, the value of the coefficient itself is important as an effect size, but that is relative to the size of the covariate that it relates to (this is the same in linear regression). You can not interpret a hazard ratio (or a regression coefficient) as large or small by itself. If you want to get smaller numbers (for numerical stability mostly) then depending on your data you can standardize the covariates somehow. For example, you might divide by the maximum value of the covariate in your case, since there are only (small) positive values. In this case, in the example I had in the first paragraph, you would get a regression coefficent of about 0.192 and a hazard ratio of 1.21, which has the interpretation that I mentioned above.
