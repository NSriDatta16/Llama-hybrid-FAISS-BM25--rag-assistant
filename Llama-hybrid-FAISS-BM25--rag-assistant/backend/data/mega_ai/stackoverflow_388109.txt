Round Robin Assignment implementation (database)

I'm currently in the process of implementing a number of different assignment algorithms for a SalesLead SalesPerson situation. The general idea is quite simple: A SalesLead signs up on a public website The code automatically assigns the SalesLead to a SalesPerson using round-robin scheduling (Leads are assigned to SalesPersons in the same order) I'm having some serious coders-block in how to actually perform this outside of making sure I pull the agents from the database in the same order each time, and using another table to store the last agent that was assigned a SalesLead (which may actually be useful for building a report, or at least having a trace-back method later on). Am I way off base? Clarification: The code doesn't currently match a sales person to a lead. This is a completely new function. Currently they can sign up for a specific SalesPerson, but we'd like them to be able to be assigned automatically.
