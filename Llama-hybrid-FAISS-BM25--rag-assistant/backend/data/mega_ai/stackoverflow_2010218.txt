Unable to merge coverage data using genhtml

I'm using genhtml (in Windows under cygwin) to generate a unit test coverage report from 2 coverage data files. They are all coverage data from the same unit test source file. However, when I entered the following command: perl genhtml /home/administrator/coverage1.dat /home/administrator/coverage2.dat I got the following output and problem: Reading data file /home/administrator/coverage1.dat Reading data file /home/administrator/coverage2.dat genhtml: Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at genhtml line 1506. And it failed to generate anything. I played around with the files, and discovered that one reason might be because of the repeating headers and files in the coverage data. Is this a known issue, or does anyone know a way to get around it, or am I on the wrong track? Thanks.
