How can I enable Full-Text indexing using SQL Server Management Studio in SQL Server 2008 Express?

I did it using the commands as described here and it works but I want to do it using the SQL Management Studio . SQL Server 2008 Books Online says this: To create a full-text catalog: In Object Explorer, expand the server, expand Databases , and expand the database in which you want to create the full-text catalog. Expand Storage , and then right-click Full Text Catalogs. Select New Full-Text Catalog . In the New Full-Text Catalog dialog box, specify the information for the catalog that you are re-creating. For more information, see New Full-Text Catalog (General Page). Click OK . There's no such option as Storage in my SQL Server Management Studio. Am I missing something?
