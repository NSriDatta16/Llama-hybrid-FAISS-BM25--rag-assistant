UITextView insert text in the textview text

I want to have to occasionally insert text into the UITextView text object. For example, if the user presses the "New Paragraph" button I would like to insert a double newline instead of just the standard single newline. How can I go about such? Do i have to read the string from UITextView, mutate it, and write it back? Then how would I know where the pointer was? Thanks
