Ok I found a more specific answer. There is a problem with the solution that Bozho proposed. the fact that the ViewResolvers no longer have access to the HttpServletRequest . There is a way to access the request but its kind of dirty IMHO. So that said, this is a very elegant and easy to implement solution . Basicly it involves a custom ViewResolver (as Bozho proposed) but it adds an handlerInterceptor that adds the User-Agent to the model so you no longer have to add it manually.
