NetBeans 6.5 "leaks" temporary files. It creates temporary files in %TEMP% (typically c:\\Documents and Settings\\*username*\\Local Settings\\Temp ) and does not delete them. When enough files accumulate, access to the temporary directory slows to a crawl. That in turn drags NB down to a crawl. To clean it up: Shut down NetBeans Open a command prompt and type: cd %TEMP% del *.java del *.form del output* del *vcs* Important: Do not try to do this with windows explorer. It won't work. The deletes can take several minutes each. Be patient. This is much better in 6.7 and I have not seen it at all in 6.8.
