I've never seen anything where testing is non-optional, built-in or inferred, but the most 'testy' language I've seen is Ruby - it comes with unit testing tools out of the box, it's easy to test and mock because the types are dynamic, and the community is generally well up on testing practices (with many TDD & BDD tools available). Although a strange lack of code coverage tools I notice.
