I am stripping out all the path information except for the filename and I am setting the document hyperlink properties to be relative... This works fine for firefox. When I open a document with a hyperlink and hover it shows the proper path file:\\c:\path to file . However in IE 8 the same file shows the path as http://.../path to file . I am trying to convert a whole directory of word documents to html so that we can then put them on a disk and use fireant to serve them for a remote presentation..... what am i doing wrong? EDIT: as requested here is the source of one of the converted documents to HTML.

In 2005, nursing representatives were part of the Values Committee that reviewed the organization’s mission, vision and values and it was decided then that the nursing department’s mission, vision, and values would be no different than that of the organization. Our Mission To provide quality care, personalized service and education to improve individual and community health. Our Vision To be the leader in promoting access to healthcare services for the residents and visitors of Worcester County and the surrounding region. Our Values We believe in putting “PATIENTS” at the center of our values: P ~ Personalized attention A ~ Accountability for financial resources T ~ Try respect and kindness I ~ Integrity, honesty &amp; trust E ~ Education – continued learning &amp; improvement N ~ Needs of our community – community commitment T ~ Teamwork &amp; partnership S ~ Safety first – dedication to patient safety &nbsp; These values are honored in all we do for our patients, visitors, medical staff, associates, partners and volunteers. &nbsp; Organizational Long-Term Strategic and Quality Plans AGH/HS boasts of a well-defined and well-integrated strategic planning process. For a narrative of this process, please refer back to the Organizational Overview Document (OO3). OO3 Working Document.htm Five-year organizational strategic and quality plans were initiated in 2005, shortly after our current chief executive officer (CEO) took office. At the outset, many leaders were skeptical of this detailed and time-consuming course of action, but as the reader will see, the AGH/HS strategic planning process soon evolved into a dynamic and successful practice adopted by the entire organization. Following a community needs assessment and an organization-wide analysis on AGH/HS strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), long-term strategic and quality plans were constructed. These plans were based on four quadrants centered on individual and community health: safe and effective care; access and equity for all; timely and efficient care; and innovation and improvement. From there, visions for total health were built upon foundations within the existing AGH/HS inpatient care delivery, emergency department care delivery, outpatient care delivery, and physician practice network systems. Plans for new services included women’s health, orthopedics, cancer care, cardiac/vascular services, pulmonary medicine, diabetes care, and wound care. Patient Care Services Strategic and Quality Plans Nursing’s strategic and quality plans mirrored that of the organizational strategic plans. The existing structure of the inpatient care delivery systems was assessed using a series of Registered Nurse (RN) surveys and SWOT analyses. The result was a strategic plan designed specifically for in-patient care to be developed as an anchor service line, which incorporated disease specific service lines within its definition. Nursing recognized the need to establish themselves as unique through outstanding customer service, excellence in nursing, and exceptional in the utilization of information and in the provision of quality clinical services. The Magnet Recognition Program was viewed as a roadmap toward obtaining this level of desired excellence and Magnet Designation was incorporated into the strategic plan. Expansion of inpatient services was based on the integration of the following service lines: Joint Surgery Center (orthopedics), Stroke Center, Cancer and Palliative care, Women’s Health Services, Cardiovascular and Pulmonary services, and Progressive Care. Adjunct services were to include Telemetry, Dialysis, Wound Care and Pain Management.

Emergency room overcrowding and long waits plague hospitals nationwide. Yet AGH’s emergency department (ED) pulled off the shortest average wait times of any hospital on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and achieved notable success with its nurse-led “30 Minute ER Promise.” This nursing strategic initiative is reflective of the AGH/HS vision to be the leader in promoting access to healthcare for the community. The hospital’s pledge is that patients will be placed in an exam bed or begin to receive treatment within 30 minutes of arrival at the hospital. That’s no easy feat for an emergency department (ED) that sees more than 30,000 patients each year and contends with an influx of vacationers each summer. The strategic initiative went live in February 2007 and the department continues to meet the 30 minute goal greater than 94 percent of the time. Improving on Good “This was something we could really capitalize on because we already had very good throughput processes,” explains Andi West-McCabe, MS, BSN, RN, NE-BC, director of emergency services. “A promise like this does a lot to reach out to our community and inspire a sense of loyalty to the hospital. If patients come here and have a good experience in the ER, then when it comes time to get their preventive screens or their child care, they’ll come back to AGH/HS. Even the vacationers end up returning.” And to someone who doesn’t have an extended vacation, the 30 minute promise seems pretty attractive. Many out-of-towners are quite surprised at the treatment because they’re accustomed to long waits at their local hospital. “Vacationers talk about how great it is to get in and out of our ER in a few hours. Just because they cut their foot on a shell in the ocean doesn’t mean their vacation has to be ruined,” said E. Belle Goslee, BSN, RN, FNE-A/P, clinical leader of the ED. Patients know a good thing when they see it. But the 30 minute rule isn’t all about marketing; it’s about streamlining processes and capitalizing on teamwork to produce quality care. Making Ready Before this project could evolve, Atlantic General nurses had to identify what they could improve upon and what barriers existed to achieving the 30 minute goal. “We looked at everything,” West-McCabe said. “We outlined protocols so nurses could work quickly based on the patient’s presentation. Now if a patient comes in with chest pain, nurses automatically put them on the heart monitor, start oxygen or an IV, get an electrocardiogram — all without missing a beat.” The protocols also help everyone work together with little communication and confusion. “Our nurses are excellent clinicians with superb clinical assessment skills — they’re able to discern from the minute they triage the patient what the needs are,” Goslee said. “The team concept is what makes our flow work so well. Everyone knows what has to be done.” The hospital also started using an electronic patient tracking system. As soon as a patient enters the ED, a staff member with a handheld pocket computer assesses that individual’s reason for coming in. This information, entered into the handheld, can be pulled up on any computer within the department, allowing the medical staff to keep track and plan treatment before the patient enters the room. The ED also had to reorganize some nursing roles, such as moving a veteran ED nurse into a manager role to work on throughput and having a charge nurse available 24 hours a day (previously they had them only 12 hours each day). They also added a unit secretary position to take orders, answer the phone, make copies and chart if the patient is being transferred. Catching On Initially, the nurse-driven initiative faced a challenge — garnering buy-in from the entire staff, techs, physicians, even other departments. “One initial difficulty was getting associates to understand why this was necessary. We already had a lot of compliments from the community and within the hospital about what a good job we did in the ED and how we saw the patients quicker than other local facilities,” explained Jan Schaffner, BSN, RN, CEN, one of the ED charge nurses. “That was our mindset at first: We do a good job, so why do we need to change? Fortunately we had associates that were willing to go the extra mile. We realized we were taking something we’re already good at and making it excellent.” “Now the techs will get started on vital signs right away; they don’t have to wait to hear ‘go get this patient and bring him back.’ If they see on the system the patient is present, they can start,” Schaffner said. “We looked at our processes and cut out any unnecessary steps. And since people are able to spring into action, we were able to prevent two major bottlenecks: patient’s waiting to be triaged and patients waiting to see the physician.” Not Sacrificing Quality Every person who comes into the Atlantic General ED receives a rack card explaining the 30 minute promise. “The 30 minute timeframe begins the moment an individual comes through the hospital’s doors until the time he or she is placed in an exam bed or begins to receive treatment,” said West-McCabe. “It’s not from entry to discharge.” The average total time spent in the Atlantic General ED for non-admission cases is 2 hours, 32 minutes. The average time spent for fast track visits is 1 hour, 14 minutes. That’s not to say patients’ care is rushed at the cost of their wellbeing. “We’re able to cut out unnecessary steps, eliminating unnecessary delays in treatment initiation,” Goslee said. “We just put the urgency back in emergency.” As for that 6 percent of patients who do happen to wait more than 30 minutes, they receive a free gift as a thank you for their patience. Later a chart review occurs to see how staff could have possibly prevented any delay. “We’ve now had several years of success with this,” West-McCabe said. “We’ve been very blessed to have an excellent team — every time we put something in front of them, they step up to the challenge and want to do better.” From submitting an opportunity statement to developing a business plan to completing action plans, AGH nurses stepped up to the plate and demonstrated enculturation of the AGH mission, vision, and values through the implementation of these strategic and quality initiatives. 2006 Business Plan for Emergency Services Expansion Strategic Plan 2006 Final - Emergency Services Expansion-Andi (2).htm Action Plan for ER 30 Minute Promise as Strategic Initiative Action Plan for Strategic Plan 30 Minute Promise (2).htm 1.1.1.A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Story – Additional Illustration of Nursing Strategic Plans Reflecting Those of the Organization: Opening of our Wound Care Center During the strategic planning process in March 2006, the recommendation was made by patient care services to evaluate the feasibility of developing a dedicated Wound Care Center (WCC) to expand service lines, improve disease management, and enhance patient satisfaction. The organization recognized the development of a WCC as one of its anticipated strategic priorities and the strategic plan was developed by staff, gaining administrative and approval by the Board of Directors (BOD) in early 2007.
