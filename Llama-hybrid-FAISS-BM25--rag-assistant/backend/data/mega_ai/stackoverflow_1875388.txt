Help on linking in gcc

In Microsoft visual c++ compiler, you can specify linker options using #pragma comment(lib, "MSVCRT") //links with the MVCRT library see this page I find this feature very useful because linker errors are common and i want to just place all the linker options in my source code instead of specifying them to the compiler. question: Is there a way to do this in gcc (or dev-cpp or codeblocks ide)? Thanks in advance.
