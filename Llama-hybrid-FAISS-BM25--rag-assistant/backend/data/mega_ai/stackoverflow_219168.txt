Literate programming

Literate programming is a way of developing software where documentation comes first, then the coding. One writes the documentation of a code snippet, and then writes the implementation of the snippet. The visual appearance of the software source code would be a plain document like word, with code paragraphs in it. I am trying to convert the dev shop I work to use only literate programming, as it brings great advantages to code readability and maintenance. However, due to the lack of tools the LP usage is limited in the company. For example, the ideal way to program literate is to write a paragraph using word markup, and then insert a subparagraph with the implementation. But i cannot seem to find any good tools for VS200x to perform LP with. Ideally, such a tool would look just like Word 2007, but integrated into the IDE. When the coder sets the cursor on a code paragraph, it would have all the functionality provided just like we have now in our IDE. What are good tools for LP, with .NET and VS200x in particular?
