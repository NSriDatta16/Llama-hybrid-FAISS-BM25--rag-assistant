Storing a large list in isolatedStorage on WP7

I'm storing a List with around 3,000 objects in Isolatedstorage using Xml serialize. It takes too long to deserialize this and I was wondering if you have any recommendations to speed it up. The time is tolerable to deserialize up to 500 objects, but takes forever to deserialize 3000. Does it take longer just on the emulator and will be faster on the phone? I did a whole bunch of searching and some article said to use a binary stream reader, but I can't find it. Whether I store in binary or xml doesn't matter, I just want to persist the List. I don't want to look at asynchronous loading just yet...
