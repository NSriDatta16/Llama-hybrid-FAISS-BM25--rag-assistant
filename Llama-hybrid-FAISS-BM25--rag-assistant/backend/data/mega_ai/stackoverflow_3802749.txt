What is MySQL's connection compression overhead on small datasets?

Is there any significant overhead to turning on mysql's connection compression for high load databases or is it always a winner? We have databases delivering very small datasets back to the requesting program (PHP) but these databases receive very large bursts of traffic from time to time. If I turn on connection compression am I likely to see a significant degredation in performance under load? We're using modern hardware but not it's a fairly average server setup i.e. one or two dual core CPU's, 8 GB of ram, etc.
