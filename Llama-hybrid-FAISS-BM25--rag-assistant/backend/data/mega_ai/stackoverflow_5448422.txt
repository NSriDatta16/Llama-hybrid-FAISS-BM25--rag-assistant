I think by definition a bit is a binary digit which must be zero or one, so the answer is always two (either the bit is 0 or 1). EDIT: in response to your new question, I believe that there is no standard way to do this. The C ISO spec (N1124, ยง3.5/1) defines a bit as A unit of data storage in the execution environment large enough to hold an object that may hold one of two values. Since the C spec tries to maximize the portability of the language, it doesn't specify what a bit is beyond this point. This means that from within C, you cannot tell any more than this about the size of a bit.
