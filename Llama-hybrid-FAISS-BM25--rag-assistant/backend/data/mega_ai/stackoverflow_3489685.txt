Have you considered using the JavaScript APIs for upload progress? They're much more accurate and allow you to report progress without a server callback. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/using_xmlhttprequest#Monitoring_progress It should be noted that the uploads occur via AJAX in this instance, which may or may not be helpful. AJAX-based uploads can be cancelled, restarted, or otherwise interacted with using JS alone. The downside is that it's a tad complicated to bundle the data. Some user agents still have issues with binary strings, so it may be necessary to convert the data to base 64 before uploading it. Also, it should be assumed that not all user agents support this feature. Hope this helps in some way.
