pushing a view when clicking on an annotation

I am trying to push a view when a user clicks on an annotation, I have the following code in place: - (void) mapView: (MKMapView *) mapView annotationView:(MKAnnotationView *) view calloutAccessoryControlTapped:(UIControl *) control { childController = [[NeighborProfileViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"NeighborProfileViewController" bundle:nil]; childController.title = view.annotation.title; childController.uid = [((NeighborMapAnnotation *)(view.annotation)) uid]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:childController animated:YES]; } I know that the code executes inside this fragment as I tried to print out something and it did print. However, why isn't it changing views to the view that I already push? Is this because this view is actually a subView of the main view, which actually has the navigation controller? If this is the case, then how do I get around this. Here's the code that loads the subView: -(IBAction) toggleAction:(id) sender { [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:NULL]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1.0]; [UIView setAnimationTransition:UIViewAnimationTransitionCurlUp forView:self.view cache:YES]; if(self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem.title == @"List"){ self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem.title = @"Map"; [mapViewController.view removeFromSuperview]; }else { [self.view addSubview:mapViewController.view]; [self.view sendSubviewToBack:self.view]; self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem.title = @"List"; } [UIView commitAnimations]; } in other words the calloutAccessoryControlTapped is inside the mapViewController
