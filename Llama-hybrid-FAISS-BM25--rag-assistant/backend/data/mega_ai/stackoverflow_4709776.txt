If this is just a specific query you will use in a page in the front end, the simple SQL should work best. No point creating a view for EVERY SINGLE possible result set that you want from MySQL. If I can make a suggestion however, please consider the SQL92 ANSI syntax SELECT agent.id AS id ,agent.name AS name, shop.id AS shop_id, shop.name AS shop_name FROM agent INNER JOIN shop ON agent.shop_id=shop.id WHERE agent.id=$id; Under no circumstance should you multi-trip to MySQL from PHP using the loop for such a lookup column for the result set.
