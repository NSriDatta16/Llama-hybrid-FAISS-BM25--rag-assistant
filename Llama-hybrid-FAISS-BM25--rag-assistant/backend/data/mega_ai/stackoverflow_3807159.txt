None that I know of do, and they wouldn't want to. Given the difference in degrees of testing, it would likely hurt robustness (a really bad thing for a source code repository). It would probably also end up hurting performance, because of the inability to do delta storage. Note that Subversion has two very different storage mechanisms, one backed by the embedded Berkeley DB, and the other backed by simple files. One or the other of these might be better suited to your usage. Also, since you posed your question pretty broadly, I'll comment on Git and TFS. Git uses very efficiently packed files in the filesystem to store the repository. Frequently, the entire history is smaller than a checkout. For one very old project that my lab has, the entire history is 57MiB, and a working tree (not counting history) is 56MiB. TFS stores a lot (possibly all) of its data in a SQL database.
