You can't apply any information used from learning/training to feature values during class prediction. This is called "information leakage" for which some learned information from training is applied to the features to help classification results. In your case, importance scores from RF are based on classification results of RF. Importance scores are used to judge which features are predictive of class, and are not intended to be used as weights for multiplying with feature values. If you want to improve classification results, try transforming your feature values with mean-zero standardization, normalization, or fuzzifying, or denoising/decorrelating with PCA (dimensional reduction). If those don't help, there is e.g. "boosted decision trees," in which a weak classifier is boosted to improve prediction. There are many boosted versions of a lot of classifiers.
