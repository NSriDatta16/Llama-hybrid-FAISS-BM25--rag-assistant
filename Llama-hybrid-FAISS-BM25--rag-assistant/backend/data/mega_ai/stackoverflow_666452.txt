In my case status line is ok, but title of the gvim looks like you said. You can consider changing both statusline and titlestring to the same value as they use the same pattern options. For selecting buffers in a convenient way you can use minibufexpl.vim : Elegant buffer explorer - takes very little screen space http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=159 or 0scan : Tags based search for any things you might want to find(ctags, buffers,...). http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2507
