Is the matrix dimension important for performing a valid PCA?

If $X$ is a $m Ã— n$ matrix, where $m$ is the number of measurement types (variables) and $n$ is the number of samples, would it be correct to perform a PCA on a matrix that has $m \geq n$ ? If not, please provide some arguments why would this be a problem. I remember having heard that doing such an analysis would be invalid, but the Wikipedia page for PCA doesn't mention a low $n/m$ ratio as being a potential limitation for using the method. Please note that I am a biologist and aim at a more practical answer (if possible).
