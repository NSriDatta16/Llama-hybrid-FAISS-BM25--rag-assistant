executing copy command in a batch file

I'm using a windows copy command to perform auto file backup of Microsoft outlook files for a domain users. the problem exists after 6 month of using this batch file is that the .pst file size for each user is growing and the copy operation is getting too long to complete. i want to know are there any way to copy only the changed bits in the .pst file couse what i'm doing is copying the whole file each time a user login. copy C:\"Documents and Settings"\%USERNAME%\"Local Settings"\"Application Data"\Microsoft\Outlook\ \\storage\folder1\folder2\%USERNAME%\%DESTDIR% /y /v thanks
