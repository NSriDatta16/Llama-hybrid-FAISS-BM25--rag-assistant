Making Cookies Stay Active

I'm using a PHP / MySQL login system, and I'm having issues keeping the user logged in when I navigate around the site. Would it help if I put session_start(); at the top of each page? (I'm looking for a quick-and-dirty / ham-fisted solution that works rather than an elegant one). Thanks in advance, John
