Generally, the dummy variable should be $1$ if $R_m\geq R_f$, and otherwise it should be $0$, according to the original paper published by Roy D. Henriksson and Robert C. Merton themself. But I can understand the logic that someone could use $1$ and $-1$ as the alternative value of dummy variable. Imagine, if the regression results shows the $\beta_2$ is significant while the dummy variable is $1$ or $-1$, that is to say, the mutual manager has the ability to minimize the total beta $(\beta_1+\beta_2 D)$ when $R_m This is amazing, right? But I'm sure you can find the difficulty. Getting $\beta_1+\beta_2$ when $R_m\geq R_f$ and $\beta_1-\beta_2$ when $R_m
