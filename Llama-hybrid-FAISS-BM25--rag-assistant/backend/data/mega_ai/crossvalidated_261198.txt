There's really no distinction between those definitions. (Perspective, perhaps?) As the pictured text reads, emphasis mine: The algorithm returns the vector of errors $\epsilon$ for each example in $\mathbb{D}$, whose mean is the estimated generalization error . To square this with the definition you give above, note that the mean of all errors is equal to the weighted (by $\frac{|\mathbb{D_i}|}{N}$) average of means over each of k folds. (K-fold cross validation error is a weighted average of errors of particular folds.)
