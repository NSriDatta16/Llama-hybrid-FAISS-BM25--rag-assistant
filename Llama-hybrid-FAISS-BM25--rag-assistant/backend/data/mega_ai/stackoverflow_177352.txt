I don't know specifics about navigation system units, but in the standard GIS world, map data is stored basically as a collection of polygons, lines and points, each described by its coordinates (and the projection used and some other parameters). For instance, one of the most common formats, shapefiles, is described here, and the database based format standard is here . I've successfully used this storage model for roads display and route calculation, using PostgreSQL , PostGIS and PGRouting . Calculations are done using the usual graph algorithms and the data stored in the common format is stored also as a graph to allow for their application. I can't extrapolate that experience to an embedded device as they likely do it very differently given their limited computing capacity. They very probably precalculate lots of stuff. For a somewhat different approach to storage, check OpenStreetMap
