Scheduling Algorithm for a multi-server queue problem

I have 4 servers, n customers and m reports. At any time, a customer may request one of m reports. There are only 4 servers which are capable of generating reports. Each server can only process one report at a time. Over time I can record the average generation time for each customer which is independent of the server. I assume that the arrival is Poisson Process. I would like to come up with the optimal schedule minimizing the average queue size. In other words, if I currently have say 10 customers in the system requesting 10 different report, how do I pick the order of serving these customers (other than first come, first serve) I'm familiar with some Stochastic Processes and Probability Methods. However, I'm struggling with: How do I determine the distribution if it depends on each report? If I don't assume Poisson arrival, how do I determine the distribution? What kind of algorithms would be the best to minimize the average time?
