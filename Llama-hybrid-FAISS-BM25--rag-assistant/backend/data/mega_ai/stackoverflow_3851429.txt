You'll probably want it on the removable storage (SD card). First you'll want to check if the storage is available, then read/write. The docs have some notes on this: http://developer.android.com/intl/de/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal (Note the API level 8 stuff there, such as getExternalFilesDir , I haven't used that yet, but looks handy, if you can guarantee >=8.) You can check if storage is there with something like: public boolean isExternalStorageAvail() { return Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED); } If it's not there show a Toast (at a minimum) or otherwise let the user know. Then read it like: File f = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/mycsvlocation/myfile.csv"); Then you can use the regular File methods to check if it's there, it's readable, etc., and then use it. Also note that the docs recommend you use a location on the SD card like "Android/data//files", and that's a reasonable recommendation, but many apps just use "/appname/" or such. And -- one more thing, you can put the file there just by mounting the SD card and creating that structure and copying a file over, of course. Alternatively, you could do that programatically (from your app) as well, but it sounds like you already have the file, and just want to read it.
