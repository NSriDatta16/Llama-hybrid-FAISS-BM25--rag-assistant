static can be preferable if you are using some tools. It also behaves a bit better with auto indent functionality in most text editors. It's a bit sad, when you have to avoid using something useful because it doesn't work with tools that should really support it, but I promise you'll get over it. An example question that gives some hint of potential pain in the debugging department: Viewing namespaced global variables in Visual Studio debugger? You probably won't have to look very hard to find more problems, but the debugger issues were enough to make me entirely give up on namespaces, to the maximum extent possible, so I've never looked any further. My personal recommendation is that for code that will be around for less than forever, one might as well go with static . Does effectively the same thing as an unnamed namespace, but, averaged out over all tools, it is better supported. In theory, one day it will disappear completely, but I'm happy to publicly admit that I'm certain that day will never actually come to pass. And in the mean time, you are saving yourself some pain.
