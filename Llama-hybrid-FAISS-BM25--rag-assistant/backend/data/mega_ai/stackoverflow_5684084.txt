You don't really find something like that - rather, you make it. The Solution Explorer is a TreeView, and the Toolbox is a custom control with drag and drop implemented, but it is basically just a control somewhat similar to this one , but even simpler (that was the closest example I could find right away, though). Just draw some lines, skip categories that haven't been expanded, draw images, done! Then the two are put in a custom TabControl, which is also easy to make or find pre-made .
