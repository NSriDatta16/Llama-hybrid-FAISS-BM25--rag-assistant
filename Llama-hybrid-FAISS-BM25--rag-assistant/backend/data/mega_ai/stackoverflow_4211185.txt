The outsource company can just build and sign the app with their own certificate. You can then resign the app with your company's certificate before submission (use codesign). There's not too much a consultant can do with the private key to just an App store Distribution certificate but without the team agent's iTunes Connect login credentials, as Apple's review team are the only ones who can run an app signed with your Distribution certificate, and you can't submit an app to iTunes Connect without the login matching the certificate (AFAIK).
