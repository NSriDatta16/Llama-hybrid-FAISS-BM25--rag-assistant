How can I pass a UIEvent to a UIScrollView

I am subclassing UIWindow and creating an implementation of sendEvent: as follows: - (void)sendEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super sendEvent:event]; // Send event to UIScrollView here } How can I send the event to a UIScrollView. I tried calling the touchesBegan:, etc. messages, but that did not do anything.
