Let $X_t$ be a causal and invertible $ARMA(p,q)$ process given by the equation: $$\phi(B)X_t=\theta(B)Z_t$$ where ${Z_t}$ ~ $WN(0,\sigma^2)$ . Differencing $X_t$ to obtain $Y_t=\nabla X_T$ will yield a non-invertible $ARMA(p,q+1)$ with a moving-average polynomial that has a unit root. Therefore testing the moving-average polynomial of a series for a unit root is equivalent to testing whether the respective series has been over-differenced. For more details see Brockwell & Davis - 1996, Chapter 6.3.
