My understanding is: A User can belong to 0-to-many Organizations. AND An Organization consists of 0-to-many Users. Are both of those correct? If so, that does sound like a many-to-many to me. In a many-to-many, you pretty much need a relationship-like object of some sort to bridge that gap. The problem is, there is no user_organization in the domain. This makes me think you shouldn't have user_organization as a part of your domain, per se. It feels like an implementation detail. On the other hand, maybe it makes sense in your domain to have a Roster which holds the Users in an Organization and stores their role and other information specific to that relationship.
