What are some good machine learning programming exercises?

Ideally, they would have the following characteristics: They can be completed in just an evening of coding. It will not require a week or more to get interesting results. That way, I can feel like I've learned and accomplished something in just one (possibly several hour long) sitting. The problems are from the real world, or they are at least toy versions of a real world problems. If the problem requires data to test the solution, there are real-world datasets readily available, or it is trivial to generate interesting test data myself. It is easy to evaluate how good of a job I've done. When I test my solution, it will be clear from the results that I've accomplished something nontrivial, either by simple inspection, or by a quantifiable measure of the quality of the results.
