It would probably be slightly easier in WPF because of the Thumb control which provides easy to use built-in support for dragging. (If I remember correctly, in WinForms you would need to handle the mouse events yourself, whereas the WPF Thumb does this for you and translates them into drag start, delta and end events.) However if you are much more familiar with one framework than the other than that would probably dwarf the difference that the Thumb control would make. You should also have a look around for toolkits/frameworks that could handle this for you -- I think they exist for both WinForms and WPF (not sure though).
