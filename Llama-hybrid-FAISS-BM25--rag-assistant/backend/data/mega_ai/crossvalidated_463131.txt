If the variance of the errors is proportional to the expected value then a logarithmic transform transform is appropriate. Other possible relationships between the first and the second moment would suggest another form of transformation. See When (and why) should you take the log of a distribution (of numbers)? and a spirited discussion here on SE Why do sample ACF/PACF suggest different TS models after box-cox transformation? , Note that the variance of a series may change at particular points in time (if you have time series data or spatial data) and that conclusion would suggest Weighted Least Squares as detailed by Tsay here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . In case one encounters possible anomalies one should treat them /isolate their effect/ mitigate their effect so they don't distort the empirical identification of any needed variance-stabilizing transform . Failure to do so this lead to a misleading log transforms of the classic Airline Series as pointed out by Chatfield and Prothero and elsewhere by Prof. Spyros Makridakis. Transformations are like drugs ... "Some are good for you and some aren't !"
