Block devices: ... 253 mdp 254 device-mapper $ cat /proc/misc ... 57 device-mapper ... For example, on this system, it just so happens that /dev/mapper/control will be c:10:57 while the rest of /dev/mapper/* will be b:254:* , and this could differ from one boot cycle to another -- or even as modules are loaded/unloaded and devices are added/removed. You can explore these device registrations further in /sys . $ readlink /sys/dev/block/2:0 ../../devices/platform/floppy.0/block/fd0 $ cat /sys/devices/platform/floppy.0/block/fd0/dev 2:0 $ readlink /sys/dev/char/1:3 ../../devices/virtual/mem/null $ cat /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null/dev 1:3
