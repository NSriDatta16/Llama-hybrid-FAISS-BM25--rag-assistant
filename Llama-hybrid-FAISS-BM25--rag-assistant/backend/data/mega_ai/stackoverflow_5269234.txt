Hard to tell without seeing the code for Operation.parse , Term.parse , and the Operation constructor, but my guess is that you are sharing a buffer or variable somewhere. On a separate note, you're doing the parse work twice. It might be good to reorganize your code like this: Object before = Operation.parse(subBefore); // a more specific type, not Object Object after = Term.parse(subAfter); if (before != null && after != null) { return new Operation(before, after); }
