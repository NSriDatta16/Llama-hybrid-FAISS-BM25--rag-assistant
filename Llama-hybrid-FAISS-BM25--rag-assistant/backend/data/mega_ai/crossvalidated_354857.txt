Is it possible to calculate an average correlation of r from several correlations of r?

Any help would be appreciated. I have a table presenting multiple r correlations between various formats of the same test and the construct/dimensions it purports to measure. Is there an acceptable way in which to calculate an average correlation of all the constructs/dimensions related to one format of the test please?
