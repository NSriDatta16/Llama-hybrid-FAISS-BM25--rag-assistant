Does a RNN also need a 3-dimensional input vector for a "Point-To-Point" forecast?

I know that for many applications a RNN (e.g. LSTM) needs a 3-dimensional input structure with [Batchsize, Sequence_Length, Features]. My question is if you also need a 3-dimensional input vector when making a "Point-To-Point" forecast, as classified here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42334335/how-to-structure-an-lstm-neural-network-for-classification under "one to one"? In that case, the sequence length would just be 1 which would theoretically remove this dimension as far as I understand.
