In business analysis, the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard published by the Object Management Group. It is a standard approach for describing and modeling repeatable decisions within organizations to ensure that decision models are interchangeable across organizations. The DMN standard provides the industry with a modeling notation for decisions that will support decision management and business rules. The notation is designed to be readable by business and IT users alike. This enables various groups to effectively collaborate in defining a decision model: the business people who manage and monitor the decisions, the business analysts or functional analysts who document the initial decision requirements and specify the detailed decision models and decision logic, the technical developers responsible for the automation of systems that make the decisions. The DMN standard can be effectively used standalone but it is also complementary to the BPMN and CMMN standards. BPMN defines a special kind of activity, the Business Rule Task, which "provides a mechanism for the process to provide input to a business rule engine and to get the output of calculations that the business rule engine might provide" that can be used to show where in a BPMN process a decision defined using DMN should be used. DMN has been made a standard for Business Analysis according to BABOK v3. Elements of the standard The standard includes three main elements Decision Requirements Diagrams that show how the elements of decision-making are linked into a dependency network. Decision tables to represent how each decision in such a network can be made. Business context for decisions such as the roles of organizations or the impact on performance metrics. A Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) that can be used to evaluate expressions in a decision table and other logic formats. Use cases The standard identifies three main use cases for DMN Defining manual decision making Specifying the requirements for automated decision-making Representing a complete, executable model of decision-making Benefits Using the DMN standard will improve business analysis and business process management, since other popular requirement management techniques such as BPMN and UML do not handle decision making growth of projects using business rule management systems or BRMS, which allow faster changes it facilitates better communications between business, IT and analytic roles in a company it provides an effective requirements modeling approach for predictive analytics projects and fulfills the need for "business understanding" in methodologies for advanced analytics such as CRISP-DM it provides a standard notation for decision tables, the most common style of business rules in a business rule management system (BRMS) Relationship to BPMN DMN has been designed to work with BPMN. Business process models can be simplified by moving process logic into decision services. DMN is a separate domain within the OMG that provides an explicit way to connect to processes in BPMN. Decisions in DMN can be explicitly linked to processes and tasks that use the decisions. This integration of DMN and BPMN has been studied extensively. DMN expects that the logic of a decision will be deployed as a stateless, side-effect free Decision Service. Such a service can be invoked from a business process and the data in the process can be mapped to the inputs and outputs of the decision service. DMN BPMN example As mentioned, BPMN is a related OMG Standard for process modeling. DMN complements BPMN, providing a separation of concerns between the decision and the process. The example here describes a BPMN process and DMN DRD (Decision Requirements Diagram) for onboarding a bank customer. Several decisions are modeled and these decisions will direct the processes response. New bank account process In the BPMN process model shown in the figure, a customer makes a request to open a new bank account. T
