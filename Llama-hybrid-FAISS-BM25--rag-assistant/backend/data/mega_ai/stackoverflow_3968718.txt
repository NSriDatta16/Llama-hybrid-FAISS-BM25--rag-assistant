Examining the request shows that this is a GET from user-agent "Java/1.6.0_20". That happens when you deploy the webapp on ROOT of Tomcat. The Tomcat server Eclipse plugin will do a self-test on / during startup (which indirectly loads the welcome-file as definied in web.xml ). What can you do? Either live with it or deploy on a context other than ROOT.
