Human readable password fields , egad. Self explanatory. Using LIKE against indexed columns, and I'm almost tempted to just say LIKE in general. Recycling SQL-generated PK values. Surprise nobody mentioned the god-table yet. Nothing says "organic" like 100 columns of bit flags, large strings and integers. Then there's the "I miss .ini files" pattern: storing CSVs, pipe delimited strings or other parse required data in large text fields. And for MS SQL server the use of cursors at all . There's a better way to do any given cursor task. Edited because there's so many!
