I always find the O'Reilly articles to be pretty helpful for many things. You could give this a try. If the problem is that you're not too familiar with regular expressions, I'd read this site for a primer on Regexes. Pay close attention to the Perl section, as many systems, including Boost, commonly support Perl-compatible Regexes. Once you understand the basics, go for either the Boost docs or the aforementioned O'Reilly guide.
