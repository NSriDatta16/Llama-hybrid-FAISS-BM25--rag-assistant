One of the terms that I find most confusing is the "confusion matrix". Of course, The term used itself is confusing, not the concept. I tried to track the history of the term and it is quite interesting too. The confusion matrix was invented at 1904 by ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson ). He used the term http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table . It appeared at Karl Pearson, F.R.S. (1904). Mathematical contributions to the theory of evolution (PDF). Dulau and Co. http://ia600408.us.archive.org/18/items/cu31924003064833/cu31924003064833.pdf During War World 2, h ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_theory was developed as investigation of the relations between stimulus and responds. The confusion matrix was used there. Due to detection theory, the term was used a psychology. From there the term reached machine learning. It seems that though the concept was invented in statistics, a field very related to machine learning, it reached machine learning after a detour in during a period of 100 years. For some references of the usage of the term see: What is the origin of the term confusion matrix?
