Reassembling TCP Segments

While observing network traffic in wireshark, i see that wireshark reassembles packets like: [Reassembled TCP Segments (4233 bytes): #1279(2133), #1278(2100)] Packet #1278: blahblah, Seq: 1538, Ack:3074, Len: 2133 Packet #1279: blahblah, Seq: 2998, Ack:3074, Len: 2100 (lengths are fictional values) Im looking to reassemble tcp packets that i receive through sharppcap Does wireshark use Ack to know what segments belong to each other? What is the Seq value refer to? If not, how does it reassemble them?
