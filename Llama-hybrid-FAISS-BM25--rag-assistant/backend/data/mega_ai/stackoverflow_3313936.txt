I have a BI project going in SSRS2008 with roughly 80 reports - and this is my experience with deploying reports into folders. This is my first foray into developing in Reporting Services, so any gurus please smack me if I'm out to lunch. Initially, I used folders in source control to separate smaller reports by department to help keep me organized. That worked fine while I was initially developing my reports, however the first time I deployed the project to the report server the structure was completely flattened - so I gave up on using a folder structure to organize. As far as I'm aware the only way you can create a folder structure in SSRS is to use the Report Manager UI and create folders on the Report Server. I'm assuming from there you would modify the path in the report properties in Visual Studio. Either that or you have to define the path when you first set up the report. I haven't tested this so YMMV. So in conclusion: It is not possible to create the folders in BIDS and deploy your reports into folders utilizing the IDE. I hope this is addressed in 2008R2 because it's kind of a pain having all those reports thrown together in the Solution Explorer.
