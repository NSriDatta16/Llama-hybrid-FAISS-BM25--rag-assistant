I would use IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings to keep my filename and Metadata associated with that filename as a class instance. I have used this in my WP7 apps and it works great. A good scenario for this is to check the file expiry for some caching implementation and if it is expired I can directly delete the file.
