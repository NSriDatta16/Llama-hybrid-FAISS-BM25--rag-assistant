Time Series/Browsing Behavior

I am trying to do some exploratory analysis of a very large dataset. This is all about the browsing behavior of several customers. All the customers visit a particular store (belonging to a retail chain) and we know what websites they visit when they are physically present in the store (and also when they were not present in the store). It is not very clear what kind of actionable insights might be had from this dataset and what kind of analysis might be done. Any constructive suggestion is welcome. Thanks and regards,
