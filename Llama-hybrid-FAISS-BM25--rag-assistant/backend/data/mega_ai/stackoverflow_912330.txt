yeah select job_desc_title from postings where id=194582 and select email_address,first_name,last_name,home_phone_area,home_phone_num from accounts will not union as the need the same number of columns See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/union.html UNION is used to combine the result from multiple SELECT statements into a single result set. The column names from the first SELECT statement are used as the column names for the results returned. Selected columns listed in corresponding positions of each SELECT statement should have the same data type. (For example, the first column selected by the first statement should have the same type as the first column selected by the other statements.) as Robert Harvey states you can add blanks to mis-matching lines select job_desc_title, '' AS email_address, '' AS first_name, '' AS last_name, '' AS home_phone_area, '' AS home_phone_num from postings where id=194582 union select '' AS job_desc_title, email_address, first_name, last_name, home_phone_area, home_phone_num from accounts But this will return you 2 rows for each match. The more likely scenario is that you want to JOIN both datasets to form one row assuming a 1 to 1 relationship.
