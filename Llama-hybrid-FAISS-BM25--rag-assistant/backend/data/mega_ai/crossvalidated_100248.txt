Yours is a good question and valuable to think about. Up front I don't see that both questions really need to be asked, but in helping to convey the results there can be value in both. I think one reason you will see both is because of how hard it is for some (many/all) people to understand certain concepts. For example, in your example you show a correlation of 0.22 which is statistically significant, what does that mean to the average person? and how much would that be influenced by a single outlier? The table comparing means I think is much more meaningful. The difference in reading comprehension is about 9 points when individuals vary from the means by about 6 points on average (a very lay interpretation of standard deviation), so that is a meaningful difference. On the other hand there is only about a 1.3 point difference in content knowledge when individuals vary by more than 4 points due to random chance, that tells me that even if that difference were statistically significant, it is not a difference of practical importance. I think that is much easier for many (including me) to interpret than the correlation coefficient. Whether the significance should be reported is another matter since we already reported significance of the correlations. I would prefer to see a confidence interval on the differences along with some measure or graph showing the variation of the raw data. In the other direction you could also find examples of very strong correlations that represent a magnitude of change in the variable of interest so small that most people would not find interesting. You are also correct that if you can choose the cut point then you can influence the size of the difference, but if an a priori cut-off (even a mean or median) can keep this reasonably objective for conveying information.
