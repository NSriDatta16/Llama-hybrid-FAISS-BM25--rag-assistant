Sometimes there's a simple and natural "classical" solution to a problem, in which case a fancy Bayesian method (especially with MCMC) would be overkill. Further, in variable selection type problems, it can be more straightforward and clear to consider something like a penalized likelihood; there may exist a prior on models that gives an equivalent Bayesian approach, but how the prior corresponds to the ultimate performance can be less clear than the relationship between the penalty and performance. Finally, MCMC methods often require an expert both for assessing convergence/mixing and for making sense of the results.
