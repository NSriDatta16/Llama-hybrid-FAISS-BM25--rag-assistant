Is timeseries forecasting for the next timeslot with a RNN a "Many-To-One" type application?

you often find applications that divide RNN according to their input and output data into the categories: One-To-One One-To-Many Many-To-One Many-To-Many as you can see e.g. (here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42334335/how-to-structure-an-lstm-neural-network-for-classification ). Let's say I have a timeseries of past electricity data of the last day (with a resolution of 1 hour), and I want to forecast the next timestep based on the input using a RNN. Is this a a "Many-To-One" type application? So does the "Many" mean, that we have multiple timeslots or does the "Many" mean, that we have a multivariate timeseries with multiple values for one timeslots (e.g. additionally having temperature values)?
