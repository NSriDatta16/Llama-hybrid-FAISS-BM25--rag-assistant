Update hasone relation behaves strangely (cakephp)

I've got an existing Showcase that hasOne Gallery. The Gallery already exists with the foreignKey showcase_id set to the proper value. The Gallery has a text field that I try to update via the Showcase-controller. The result I get is an extra Gallery entry, along the original one, instead of an update of the original entry. What am I doing wrong? My Showcase-view looks as follows: echo $form->create('Showcase', array('action'=>'update')); echo $form->input('Showcase.id', array('type'=>'hidden', 'value'=>$showcase['Showcase']['id'])); echo $form->input('Gallery.fulltext', array('type'=>'textarea', 'between'=>' ', 'value'=>$showcase['Gallery']['fulltext'])); echo $form->submit('Submit text'); echo $form->end(); My Showcase-controller function: $uses = array('Showcase','Gallery') function update(){ if(!empty($this->data)){ $this->Showcase->saveAll($this->data, array('validate'=>'first')); } } The Showcase model $hasOne = 'Gallery' and the Gallery model $belongsTo = 'Showcase' . Is $this->Showcase->saveAll() the proper function to use here? Or do I maybe need to update the Gallery entry within the Gallery controller? That will probably work but is seems so un-elegant.
