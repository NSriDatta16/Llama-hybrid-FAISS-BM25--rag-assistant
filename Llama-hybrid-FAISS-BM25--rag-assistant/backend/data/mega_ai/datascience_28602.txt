Training neural network classifier with one class after another

Is it possible to train a neural network classifier with only one class, and after that with only another class? For example, first train it only on recognizing dogs, and after finishing that training, only train it on recognizing cats, so in the end the net can classify between dogs and cats. Or do the classes always need to be mixed for training? Please tell me any scientific papers explaining why classes have to be mixed or explaining why they do not need to be mixed.
