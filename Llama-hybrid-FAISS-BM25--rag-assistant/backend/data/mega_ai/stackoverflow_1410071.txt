You should be a little bit more verbose. If you have to stick with XSLT 1.0 I would recommed EXSLT http://www.exslt.org or the code samples from Sal Mangano's 'XSLT Cookbook' 1st edition, published by O'Reilly see www.oreilly.de/catalog/9780596003722/ If I understand it right, the first column contains the delivery date and the lastOrderDate 'll be stored into a new right column. The content of all other columns 'll be copied verbatim to output. The idea is to first poll the content of the first column and store it into the variable deliveryDate. Afterwards the child TableData elements 'll be processed. When reaching the last TableData element a new table cell 'll be added to each table row containing the result of the calculated lastOrderDate. See the code sample in my second answer.
