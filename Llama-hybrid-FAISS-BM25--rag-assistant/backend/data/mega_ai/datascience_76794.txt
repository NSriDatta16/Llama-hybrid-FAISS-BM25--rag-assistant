The natural approach is to use a labelled dataset and a supervised learning technique. You can start with something simple, like using tf-idf for feature generation and train a simple logistic regression model. I think this is the first thing you should try, I see it more likely to succeed than the unsupervised techniques, and it is simple enough.
