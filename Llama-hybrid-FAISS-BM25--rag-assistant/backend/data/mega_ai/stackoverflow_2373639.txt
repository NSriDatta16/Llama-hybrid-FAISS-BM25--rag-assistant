Accept @KennyTM's answer. He is wrong to state that the computation is not parallelisable, as he goes on to show. In showing that you can rewrite your recurrence relation in closed form he illustrates a very general principle of optimising programs -- choose the best algorithm you can find and implement that. None of the micro-optimisations that the other answers suggest will come close to computing the closed form and spreading the computation across many processors in parallel. And, lest anyone offer the suggestion that this is just an example for learning parallelisation, I contend that @KennyTM's answer still holds good -- don't learn to optimise fragments of code, learn to optimise computations. Choose the best algorithm for your purposes, implement it well and only then worry about performance.
