Jquery sortable return single item to original list

I have shopping cart set up where the user can drag an item from the store shelf and place it in the shopping cart. This all works great. The next step of programming that I cannot resolve is how to remove the item from the cart with a click. There is this in the documentation but there is no example to call it. $('.drag_box').bind('click', function() { this.sortable( "destroy" ); }); Does nothing. Help please.
