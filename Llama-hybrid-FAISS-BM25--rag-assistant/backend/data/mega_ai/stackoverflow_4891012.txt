Visual Studio: Creating a simple GUI

I have written a C++ application, which I built using g++. For the purposes of demonstrating this code I want to create a simple GUI, under Windows, I thought it would be a relatively simple task to create this using Visual Studio's GUI builder. With some stress I have got to the point where I can build and run the C++ app through a Visual Studio 2010 workspace. So I add a new class, I choose "Windows Form", it gives me a form that I can drag stuff onto, great. How the hell do I integrate this? Can I not just create an instance of this class in my main function? How do I even get the form to show when I run the program? I really have no idea where to start, my experience is in using C and Java, I don't have much experience with C++ and I have absolutely no idea about Visual Studio. All I want is a GUI class to handle user input and right now it seems impossibly difficult. Any guidance would be very much appreciated, I'll come back to this when my blood pressure returns to a safe level.
