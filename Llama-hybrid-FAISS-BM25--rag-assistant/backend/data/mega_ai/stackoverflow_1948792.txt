Yes, you can. WCF RIA Services is using the default ASP.NET Membership provider. So search on the web on how to modify them (via web.config) to connect to another source and it will be transparent for the SL/WCF RIA Services application. For instance, I've connected them to the Azure Storage (table) instead of the default ASPNETDB database on this application : http://cloudypizza.cloudapp.net . You can test it by creating your own account on clicking on "login". I've briefly explained how I've done it here on my blog (in French only sorry) Regards, David
