The basejoin function in the urllib package might be what you're looking for. basejoin = urljoin(base, url, allow_fragments=True) Join a base URL and a possibly relative URL to form an absolute interpretation of the latter. Edit: I didn't notice before, but urllib.basejoin seems to map directly to urlparse.urljoin, making the latter preferred.
