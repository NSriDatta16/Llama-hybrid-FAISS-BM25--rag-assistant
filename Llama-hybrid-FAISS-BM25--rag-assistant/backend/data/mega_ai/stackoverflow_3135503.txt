i think it is more related to syntatic sugar and a way to organize your code, a good use would be to handle several methods related to a common context which ones belong to a object or a static class. it is not that you are forced to use them, you can programme sth with and without them, but maybe using them or not might affect how organized, readable and why not cool the code would be, maybe bum some lines in your code. Every example given here is a good one where you could implement them, as someone said it, is just another feature in the language you can play with. greetings
