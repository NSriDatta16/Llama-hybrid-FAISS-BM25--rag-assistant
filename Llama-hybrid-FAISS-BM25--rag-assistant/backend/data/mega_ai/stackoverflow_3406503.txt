I like to group fields at the top of a class only for code organizational purposes. I find it easier to find what I'm looking for more quickly than if fields were spread out amongst the class. I also typically group other members up by type and also have an internal sort by access modifier. public class MyClass { // Fields // Constructors // Properties // Methods }
