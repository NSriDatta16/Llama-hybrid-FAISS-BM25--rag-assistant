You could use distribution-level metrics (such as the one you are mentioning), and calculate all dissimilarities between all samples. This will result in a dissimilarity matrix, which you can use as input for your classifier. In fact, this dissimilarity matrix can be used as a Kernel matrix, to which you could for example apply a Linear SVM.
