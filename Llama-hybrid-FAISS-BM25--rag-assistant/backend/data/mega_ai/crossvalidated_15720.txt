As a good starter to IRT, I always recommend reading A visual guide to item response theory . A survey of available software can be found on www.rasch.org . From my experience, I found the Raschtest (and associated) Stata command(s) very handy in most cases where one is interested in fitting one-parameter model. For more complex design, one can resort on GLLAMM ; there's a nice working example based on De Boeck and Wilson's book, Explanatory Item and Response Models (Springer, 2004). About R specifically, there are plenty of packages that have become available in the past five years, see for instance the related CRAN Task View . Most of them are discussed in a special issue of the Journal of Statistical Software (vol. 20, 2007). As discussed in another response, the ltm and eRm allow to fit a wide range of IRT models. As they rely on different method of estimation--- ltm used the marginal approach while eRm use the conditional approach---choosing one or the other is mainly a matter of the model you want to fit ( eRm won't fit 2- or 3-parameter models) and the measurement objective you follow: conditional estimation of person parameters has some nice psychometric properties while a marginal approach let you easily switch to mixed-effects model, as discussed in the following two papers: Doran, H., Bates, D., Bliese, P. and Dowling, M. (2007). Estimating the Multilevel Rasch Model: With the lme4 Package . Journal of Statistical Software , 20(2). See also Doug Bates's slides on R-forge De Boeck, P., Bakker, M., Zwitser, R., Nivard, M., Hofman, A., Tuerlinckx, F., and Partchev, I. (2011). The Estimation of Item Response Models with the lmer Function from the lme4 Package in R . Journal of Statistical Software , 39(12). See also the aforementioned De Boeck's handbook and this handout There are also some possibilities to fit Rasch models using MCMC methods, see e.g. the MCMCpack package (or WinBUGS / JAGS , but see BUGS Code for Item Response Theory , JSS (2010) 36). I have no experience with SAS for IRT modeling, so I'll let that to someone who is more versed into SAS programming. Other dedicated software (mostly used in educational assessment) include: RUMM, Conquest, Winsteps, BILOG/MULTILOG, Mplus (not citing the list already available on wikipedia ). None are free to use, but time-limited demonstration version are proposed for some of them. I found jMetrik very limited when I tried it (one year ago), and all functionalities are already available in R. Likewise, ConstructMap can be safely replaced by lme4 , as illustrated in the handout linked above. I should also mention mdltm (Multidimensional Discrete Latent Trait Models) for mixture Rasch models, by von Davier and coll., which is supposed to accompagny the book Multivariate and Mixture Distribution Rasch Models (Springer, 2007).
