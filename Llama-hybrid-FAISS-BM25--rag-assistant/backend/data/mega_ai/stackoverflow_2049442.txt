In C#, writing variable = expression; assigns a new value to the variable. It does not affect the value that was previously referenced by that variable. In your example, you have a value called product , which is a ProductInfo provided by the caller, and a value you get from your list, which you stored in toUpdate , that you wish to update . This would involve calling member functions (or assigning to properties) of toUpdate based on values in product . However, I suspect you actually want to update the product information of a product found in a database or other kind of storage that is accessed by ProductSearchResults . The storage engine you use (or your data access layer) probably provides you with a function to save a ProductInfo associated with a certain identifier, so all you need to do is call that function.
