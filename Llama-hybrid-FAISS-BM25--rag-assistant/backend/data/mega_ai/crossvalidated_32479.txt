Just like linear regression, logistic regression and more generally generalized linear models are required to be linear in the parameters but not necessarily in the covariates. So polynomial terms like a quadratic that Macro suggests can be used. This is a common misunderstanding of the linear term in generalized linear models. Nonlinear models are models that are nonlinear in the parameters. If the model is linear in the parameters and contains additive noise terms that are IID the model is linear even if there are covariates like X$^2$ log X or exp(X). As I now read the question it seems to be edited. My specific answer would be yes to 1 and not necessary to 2.
