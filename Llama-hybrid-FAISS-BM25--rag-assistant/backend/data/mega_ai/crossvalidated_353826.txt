If that's a linear regression problem, I think using partial least squares (PLS) or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) will give you satisfied answer. Those techniques takes into account the correlations between the responses. If that's a non-linear regression problem, the nonlinear version or those techniques would work. But if you want to apply neural networks, I think using a regular multi-layer perceptron with what you decribed as method (1) would suffice, if you are only interested in predicting y1.
