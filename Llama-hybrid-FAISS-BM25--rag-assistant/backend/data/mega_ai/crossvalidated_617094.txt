Do similar PCA feature importance in first few top PCs mean these variables are nearly same in the original space?

I am using PCA to do the data inspection. First 3 PCs explain nearly 82% of the total variance. Suppose the number of features is $n$ . And I found 4 of the features have similar PCA feature importances for first 3 PCs. Say in the attached figure: evap_c_5 , evap_c_7 , w_s_5 , w_s_7 have similar feature importance for pc_1 , pc_2 and pc_3 . So can I safely conclude that those 4 variables are similar in the original space? if so, could you provide a theoretical derivation, or a literature for reference? Thanks!
