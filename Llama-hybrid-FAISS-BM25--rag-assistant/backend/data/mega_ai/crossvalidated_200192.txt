One way of looking at it is to use mixture priors with the main components reflecting the best available prior information and one extra component being a very weakly informative component. If there is no-prior data conflict, then the informative mixture components will dominate the inference and if there is a prior-data conflict the non-informative component will dominate the inference. The interesting bit is that you can also look at the posterior weights of each mixture component. This approach is e.g. described by Schmidli, H., Gsteiger, S., Roychoudhury, S., O'Hagan, A., Spiegelhalter, D., & Neuenschwander, B. (2014). Robust meta‐analytic‐predictive priors in clinical trials with historical control information. Biometrics, 70(4), 1023-1032. . There are a few other approaches that do achieve similar things. As you can see in the references the key point for getting a robust analysis is to have long-tails in the prior, which typical conjugate distributions do not have (there is even some papers that say that they give the prior the maximum possible weight in inference - for a mixture of conjugate priors this is no longer the case in the same way, but you can still do simple conjugate updating).
