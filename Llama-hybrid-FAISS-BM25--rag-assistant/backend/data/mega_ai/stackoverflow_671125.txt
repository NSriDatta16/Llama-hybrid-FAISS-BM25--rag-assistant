Look at Outlook perhaps, it uses dropdowns that defaults to sane half hours (to me anyway ;) and the selections can then be edited by hand afterwards if higher precision is wanted. The duration also follows when the start time is changed, and defaults to an hour or something. I used text boxes in an old web application before just like you, with the added option of double-clicking them to bring up a quick selection widget like the above Outlook Sample. Perhaps a button or some other Silverlight magic can enhance that. A vertical time-line like a calendar day in Outlook where you can drag the top and bottom of a meeting "box" is to me the most instuitive or atleast quickest way to place and adjust a booking. Perhaps if it's prefilled with one that spans an hour or so, easily draggable to change the start time - with the top and bottom resizeable to change the duration.
