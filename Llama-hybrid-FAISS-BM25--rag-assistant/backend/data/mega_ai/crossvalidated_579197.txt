How to use probability as weight in binary logistic regression?

I have conducted a latent class analysis which has given me the probability for each individual to be in one of two classes. The probabilities look like this ''' [Class 1] [Class2] [ID1] 0.9971185210 0.0028814790 [ID2] 0.0344765337 0.9655234663''' I want to run a binary logistic regression, to see if being in class 1 or 2 is more or less associated with outcome 1 or outcome 2. How can I create a model that is weighted by the probability of being in a class?
