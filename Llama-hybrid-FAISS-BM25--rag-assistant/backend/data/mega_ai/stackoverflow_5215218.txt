Are you sure that OnArticleSelected() is getting called after OnCreate()? findViewById(id) will return null if its called before the call setContentView(layout). Also try changing this line: fragment_two.populateDirectory(directory, this); to this: fragment_two.populateDirectory(directory, dual_fragments.this); If for some reason something other than an activity is getting passed in it will break things. I know you need to be distinct like this when making the call from inside an OnClickListener for a button, but Im not familiar with the listener you are using so I am not sure if it would be necessary. And Matthew brings a good point make sure you are pointing to the correct .xml file.
