jQuery Draggable Problem

Im trying to get a div to be movable within the constrains of the browser window, by dragging the titlebar inside the div . My code is as follows: My Title $(document).ready(function(){ $("#titlebar").draggable({ containment: 'window', scroll: false, helper: $('#container') }); }); Something is wrong with this (it wont do anything at all) but I cant see the problem!
