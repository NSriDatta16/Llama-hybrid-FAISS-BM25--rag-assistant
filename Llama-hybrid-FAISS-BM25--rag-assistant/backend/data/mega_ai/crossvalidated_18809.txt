How to correctly describe measurement variation (over multiple repetitions)

Firstly, please forgive my lack of statistics knowledge, but I am hoping someone can clear up my misunderstandings. I am taking a sample of a physical quantity, (for example: temperature). To take this sample I average the measurements over a time duration (for example: 1 sec). This gives me a sample mean and a sample deviation. I then repeat this measurement procedure under the same conditions. I then would have a sample mean and sample standard deviation for each repetition. So my question is, while each sample has variation how do I "combine" these to describe the variation over all of the repetitions? This seems rather fundamental, so please link any relevent references if you know of any.
