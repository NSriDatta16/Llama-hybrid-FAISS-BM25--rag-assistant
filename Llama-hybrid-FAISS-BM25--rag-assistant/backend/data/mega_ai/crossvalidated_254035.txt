Variational Auto-encoders vs Restricted Boltzmann Machines

What are the differences of modeling ability between Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)? What I am interested in is to know about the unsupervised learning power differences. Where exactly VAEs work better than RBMs and vise versa? Also what RBMs can capture that VAEs can not? I am already aware of this post and I know the concept of VAEs and RBMs. Also this one is very brief and is not what I am looking for. Does anybody know about any (theoretical) limitations on the modeling power for one that makes another superior?
