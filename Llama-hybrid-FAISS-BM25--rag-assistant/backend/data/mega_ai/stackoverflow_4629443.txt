The POST has already happened, so there's not going to be a magic bullet (i.e. a simple ActionResult ) that will work for you. Since you're handling the POST response on your server, you'll need to recreate the POST request to the target server yourself. To do that you'll need to leverage an HttpWebRequest vis a vis this answer . After getting the response back from the HttpWebRequest , you'll need to pass that response back, probably via a ContentResult . All in all, it will be non-trivial, but it is possible. Update : Based on your snippet, I'd try adding the following: WebResponse res = myRequest.GetResponse(); StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(res.GetResponseStream()); string returnvalue = sr.ReadToEnd(); return Content(returnValue);
