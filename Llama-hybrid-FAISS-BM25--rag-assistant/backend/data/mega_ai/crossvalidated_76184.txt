Given that your response variable y is categorical, it would violate the assumptions of standard linear (OLS) regression, if you were to use that instead of logistic regression. Specifically, the residuals would not be normally distributed and the residual variance would not be constant (since the variance of a proportion is a function of the proportion itself). Regarding logistic regression, the comment by @Glen_b is exactly correct. You should use logistic regression.
