First, the 0 cells mean that you will have quasicomplete separation, which makes the results of logistic regression look the way yours did - that is, huge standard errors around the parameter estimates. Second, I'm not sure what you are doing a t-test on, but a t-test compares two means. You don't have two means. Third, if this is really all the data you have (and all the variables you have) then you could try an exact chi-square test. R code: sales yields p = 0.048, but I'd be leery of relying on this for much.
