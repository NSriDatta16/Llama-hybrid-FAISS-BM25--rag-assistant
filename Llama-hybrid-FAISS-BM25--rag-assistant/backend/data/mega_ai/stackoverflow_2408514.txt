django python - generic views and cookies

I made in my web a menu using generic_view - simple 'django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list' in urls.py file. I would like to set a cookies each time when user chooses one of element of this list [HttpResponse.set_cookie(...)]. What is the best solution? Should I write function in views.py or have you got more simple solution? Edit 1 This is the fragment of my urls.py: manufacturer_dict = { 'queryset': Manufacturer.objects.all() } urlpatterns = patterns('', url(r'^$', 'django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list', manufacturer_dict), ) And template: manufacturer_list.html {% for object in object_list %} {{object.name}} {% endfor %} I am only using generic_views. This is list of mobile phone models. I want to remember the users mobile model in the cookie.
