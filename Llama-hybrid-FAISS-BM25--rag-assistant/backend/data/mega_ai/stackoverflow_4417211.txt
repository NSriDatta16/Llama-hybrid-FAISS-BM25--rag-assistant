Ok, answering my own question here. The issue that I was seeing has to do with where I put the image asset. I had it in the res/drawable-mdpi folder only and the device I was testing on was high density. Therefore, Android was scaling the image up for me automagically. To rectify the situation and deal with the pixels directly, I placed the image in the res/drawable-nodpi folder. This behavior is described on this page: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html under "How Android supports multiple screens".
