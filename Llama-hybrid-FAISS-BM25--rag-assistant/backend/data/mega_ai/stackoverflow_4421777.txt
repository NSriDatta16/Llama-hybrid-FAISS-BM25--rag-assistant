Not strictly speaking (from the man page ): the depth buffer is not updated if the depth test is disabled. But... you can have the depth test enabled, while not having any fragment fail the test: glDepthFunc(GL_ALWAYS); glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST); Of course, you get the last Z written by doing that, not the closest to the view.
