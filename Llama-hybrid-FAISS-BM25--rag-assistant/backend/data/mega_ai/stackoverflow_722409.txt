How to capture worksheet being added through Copy/Paste in Excel VBA

I am trying to capture worksheets being copied in to a workbook from another workbook. Workbook_NewSheet event does not trigger when the sheets are copied from another workbook. It is triggered only if the user manually inserts them through (Insert->Worksheet menu option), or when you add a new sheet through VBA as ThisWorkbook.Worksheets.Add . What I am trying to capture is basically a Paste operation which is resulting in a new sheet. This might be from any of the below user actions: User copies an existing sheet by dragging it holding Control Key (which adds a new sheet) User copies sheet/s from another workbook user moved sheets from another workbook or any of the below VBA code: SourceWorkbook.Sheets(“SourceSheet”).Copy Before:=TargetWorkbook.worksheets(“SheetNameIn Target”) 'copy across workbook' SourceWorkbook.Sheets(“SourceSheet”).Move Before:=TargetWorkbook.worksheets(“SheetNameIn Target”) 'move across workbook' ThisWorkbook. Sheets(“SheetName”).Copy 'copy within workbook' If you know any way of capturing this action/macro results within VBA that would be greatly helpful. Please note that I do not want to avoid such an user action (so i do not want to secure the workbook) but I want to handle the pasted sheet programatically to verify the data, and if the similar sheet already exists then update the existing sheet rather than having same data in two sheets.
