Web services provide a standard way for applications to exchange information over the Internet and access services that implement business logic. Your applications can access Oracle Database using native Oracle XML DB Web services. One available service lets you issue SQL and XQuery queries and receive results as XML data. Another service provides access to all PL/SQL stored functions and procedures. You can customize the input and output document formats when you use the latter service; the WSDL is automatically generated by the native database Web services engine. SOAP 1.1 is the version supported by Oracle XML DB. Applications use the HTTP POST method to submit SOAP requests to native Oracle XML DB Web services. You can configure the locations of all native Oracle XML DB Web services and WSDL documents using the Oracle XML DB configuration file, xdbconfig.xml. You can also configure security settings for the Web services using the same configuration file.
