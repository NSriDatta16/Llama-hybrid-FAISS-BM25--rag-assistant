What Confuses you about Magento Widgets API?

This is a little vague, but I hope I'm allowed. I'd like to get a feel for what the Magento developer community thinks of the Widgets API. Are they clear or confusing, useful or useless. The more detail the better. Do you use the feature? If not, why not? What don't you understand about the feature? etc. etc. When I say Widgets, I'm referring the programatic APIs specific to the feature.
