I find biplots very useful. A biplot represents both the variables and the observations in a space defined by two (or three) components. The length and direction of the vector representing each variable tell you how much it loads on these two components, directly addressing the question at the end of the first paragraph. You can find more information on Wikipedia and many examples/code through google.
