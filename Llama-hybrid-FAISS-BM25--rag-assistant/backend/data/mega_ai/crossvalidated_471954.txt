It is fine to do parameter inference when $R^2$ is low. When you do a two-sample t-test (equal variance), you are doing regression parameter inference, and a quick simulation would show you that you have low $R^2$ in many situations where you would be completely comfortable t-testing. Whether or not you should add additional predictors will depend on your goals. You might be able to explain some variability in the response by adding more predictors. You also run the risk of muddying the interpretation, particularly if you include predictors that are not independent of the two predictors of interest. Further, adding many predictors runs the risk of overfitting and just memorizing the data instead of modeling the phenomenon. Finally, be a little cautious about just looking at the parameter estimates. Also consider their scales. Interpretations are quite different if your variable is in kilometers than if it is in nanometers. Look at standard errors of the parameters. If neither parameter estimate is significantly different from zero, or if their confidence intervals contain one another, you have scant evidence that the values are different. Perhaps the best way to assess which is more impactful would be to do a linear contrast that would give you a confidence interval for the difference between parameters. EDIT I like what stefgehrig says about assessing model fit with a metric other than $R^2$ . The trouble with other metrics like the AIC mentioned is that it is hard to judge what a good values is. Adjusted $R^2$ or out-of-sample $R^2$ could be easier to interpret. However, do not fret about using a model with an $R^2$ of $0,30$ or even lower. You might be thinking that explain $30\%$ of the variability in the response is a terrible mode since you grew up thinking that a $90\%$ or so was an $A$ and you want to write $A+$ models, but especially for inference, it is fine not to explain a great deal of variability. As I mentioned in my first paragraph, this is routine in vanilla t-testing.
