I have never had to debug problems with the log-reader but often had to debug issues with the subscriber. What I would do is run the distribute agent (I remember it being called distrib.exe ... that is because I typed it in so often!) with a heck of a log of debugging flags set (I just looked up the docs on BOL and see an argument OutputVerboseLevel. I don't remember that argument name directly but it looks plausible). You can figure out what kind of arguments to provide to the agent by looking up the job definition that was set up by the replication wizard .. one of the steps should be a 'run an external command' and that will have a bunch of the argument names and values. Once I had figured out the appropriate invocation, I saved it in a batch file and would then run it from the DOS prompt whenever there was a problem that was not debuggable from the GUI. pjjH
