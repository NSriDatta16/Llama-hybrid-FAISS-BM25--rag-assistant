o classical logic, or if not conversely not support expected inference rules. An alternative that makes the consequences of different choices more predictable is to instead continue with implication → {\displaystyle \to } as the second connective: this is overall the most common connective in axiomatisations of logic, and it has closer ties to the deductive aspects of logic than most other connectives. A confidence counterpart ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } of the traditional implication connective may in fact be defined directly as the residuum of the t-norm. The logical link between conjunction and implication is provided by something as fundamental as the inference rule modus ponens A , A → B ⊢ B {\displaystyle A,A\to B\vdash B} : from A {\displaystyle A} and A → B {\displaystyle A\to B} follows B {\displaystyle B} . In the fuzzy logic case that is more rigorously written as A ⊗ ( A → B ) ⊢ B {\displaystyle A\otimes (A\to B)\vdash B} , because this makes explicit that our confidence for the premise(s) here is that in A ⊗ ( A → B ) {\displaystyle A\otimes (A\to B)} , not those in A {\displaystyle A} and A → B {\displaystyle A\to B} separately. So if a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} are our confidences in A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} respectively, then a ⇒ b {\displaystyle a\Rightarrow b} is the sought confidence in A → B {\displaystyle A\to B} , and a ∗ ( a ⇒ b ) {\displaystyle a*(a\Rightarrow b)} is the combined confidence in A ⊗ ( A → B ) {\displaystyle A\otimes (A\to B)} . We require that a ∗ ( a ⇒ b ) ⩽ b {\displaystyle a*(a{\mathbin {\Rightarrow }}b)\leqslant b} since our confidence b {\displaystyle b} for B {\displaystyle B} should not be less than our confidence a ∗ ( a ⇒ b ) {\displaystyle a*(a\Rightarrow b)} in the statement A ⊗ ( A → B ) {\displaystyle A\otimes (A\to B)} from which B {\displaystyle B} logically follows. This bounds the sought confidence a ⇒ b {\displaystyle a\Rightarrow b} , and one approach for turning ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } into a binary operation like ∗ {\displaystyle *} would be to make it as large as possible while respecting this bound: a ⇒ b ≡ sup { x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] | a ∗ x ⩽ b } {\displaystyle a{\mathbin {\Rightarrow }}b\equiv \sup \left\{x\in [0,1]\;{\big |}\;a*x\leqslant b\right\}} . Taking x = 0 {\displaystyle x=0} gives a ∗ x = a ∗ 0 ⩽ 1 ∗ 0 = 0 ⩽ b {\displaystyle a*x=a*0\leqslant 1*0=0\leqslant b} , so the supremum is always of a nonempty bounded set and thus well-defined. For a general t-norm there remains the possibility that f a ( x ) = a ∗ x {\displaystyle f_{a}(x)=a*x} has a jump discontinuity at x = a ⇒ b {\displaystyle x=a{\mathbin {\Rightarrow }}b} , in which case a ∗ ( a ⇒ b ) {\displaystyle a*(a{\mathbin {\Rightarrow }}b)} could come out strictly larger than b {\displaystyle b} even though a ⇒ b {\displaystyle a{\mathbin {\Rightarrow }}b} is defined as the least upper bound of x {\displaystyle x} s satisfying a ∗ x ⩽ b {\displaystyle a*x\leqslant b} ; to prevent that and have the construction work as expected, we require that the t-norm ∗ {\displaystyle *} is left-continuous. The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm thus can be characterized as the weakest function that makes the fuzzy modus ponens valid, which makes it a suitable truth function for implication in fuzzy logic. More algebraically, we say that an operation ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } is a residuum of a t-norm ∗ {\displaystyle *} if for all a {\displaystyle a} , b {\displaystyle b} , and c {\displaystyle c} it satisfies a ∗ b ≤ c {\displaystyle a*b\leq c} if and only if a ≤ ( b ⇒ c ) {\displaystyle a\leq (b{\mathbin {\Rightarrow }}c)} . This equivalence of numerical comparisons mirrors the equivalence of entailments A ⊗ B ⊢ C {\displaystyle A\otimes B\vdash C} if and only if A ⊢ B → C {\displaystyle A\vdash B\to C} that exists because any proof of C {\displaystyle C} from the premise A ⊗ B {\displaystyle A\otimes B} can be converted into a proof of B → C {\displaystyle B\to C} f
