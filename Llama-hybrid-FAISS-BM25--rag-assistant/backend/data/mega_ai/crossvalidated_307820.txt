Reinforcement Learning (self navigation) : Stopping back and forth oscillation

I am using deep q learning (output layer activation function is tanh) for a reinforcement learning agent to navigate in a grid. What it learns is not to hit the walls and other obstacles. If it hits something it get -0.9 reward and 0 otherwise. After sometime the agent begins to go one or two steps forward and then backwards and again forward and so on. To break out from this oscillation I can use exploration (10% or 1% or something). But if i do that it remedy the oscillation problem but it affect the actual functionality since now the agent will take a random action once every ten times and thus will hit something even though the system has learned not to. Usually how do people address such an issue ? Thank you
