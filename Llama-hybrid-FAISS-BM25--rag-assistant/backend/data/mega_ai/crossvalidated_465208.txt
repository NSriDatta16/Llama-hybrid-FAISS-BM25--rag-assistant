Meaning of "Manifold of interest"

While reading a paper , I stumble upon the following sentence and couldn't figure out its meaning: Informally, for an input set of real images, we say that the set of layer activations (for any layer L i ) forms a “manifold of interest” . It has been long assumed that manifolds of interest in neural networks could be embedded in low-dimensional subspaces. As far as I know, "manifold" in machine learning is the geometric representation of your data.
