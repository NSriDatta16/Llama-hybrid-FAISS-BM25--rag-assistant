Nobody seems have mentioned yet another kind of constant expression: address constants. The address of an object with static storage duration is an address constant, hence you can do this kind of thing at file scope: char x; char *p = &x; String literals define arrays with static storage duration, so this rule is also why you can do this at file scope: char *s = "foobar";
