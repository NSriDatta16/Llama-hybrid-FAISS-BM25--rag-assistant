If your requirement is "[Ff]ree" I'd suggest Hudson. It's quite modern and has a ton of plugins that can take care of the requirements you've asked for. Hudson is very actively maintained and the plugins receive lots of attention too. Homepage here: http://hudson-ci.org/ List of plugins here: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins IRC Channel (great resource for help): irc://chat.freenode.net/#hudson Hudson literally takes minutes to setup and bootstrap as well, in simple cases.
