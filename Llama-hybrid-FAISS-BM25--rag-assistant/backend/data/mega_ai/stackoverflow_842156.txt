Another solution is something I've seen recently. If setting a modified flag on your 'file' object is difficult, you could always try saving to a memory stream and calculating a hash on it, and if the hash is different to the original version's hash, it has changed. It's not as elegant as setting a modified flag, but is much easier to retrofit.
