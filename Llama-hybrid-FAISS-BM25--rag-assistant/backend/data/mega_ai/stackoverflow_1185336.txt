I would encourage you to look at how existing frameworks accomplish data validation. I use QCubed , they do exactly what you described (intercepting user input and validating it before processing) very well. Here's the tutorial that describes how their form processing flows: http://examples.qcu.be/assets/_core/php/examples/basic_qform/process_flow.php . Form_Validate is exactly the stage you described. Side note: it's important to do data validation on the server side for security / data integrity reasons. If you want, you can ADD client-side (javascript) validation on top of that, to improve the user experience. But you HAVE to have the server-side validations, too.
