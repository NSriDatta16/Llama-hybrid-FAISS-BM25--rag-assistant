I have some doubts about your ultimate goal - You want to identify if the residents are at home or not and from there get an id of witch building they are into ? On the concerns you have raised, you didn't mention the one where the difference of the snapshots is zero, but the individuals inside are all different (3 went out 3 went in). This will give you the illusion of no change while there was a big change. Because the act of going in or going out should be related to the individuals itself, although at 1st sight I get the idea that you don't give different preferences / behaviors to each. However I would suggest that you can use AI and more specifically Multi-Agents systems. I don't know your level of coding, but if limited or if you still prefer and easy to integrate software I would recommend Netlogo. I would start by creating the 2 main breeds of agents that you have mentioned: Buildings Population From there you might wish to separate into groups of different behaviors. Individual that don't go out Individuals that go out And different type of buildings High scrun Medium scrum Low scrum Well, the way I do my models is by giving probabilities for the different actions and creating the possible interaction between agents of the same and different breeds. As I said at the beginning, I am not sure of your ultimate goal, but you won't lose anything about having a look. Regards,
