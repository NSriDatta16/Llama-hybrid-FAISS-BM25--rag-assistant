I don't quite understand all of your question. Where have you changed the config? I read your explanations as: You have changed the schema for all applications You have updated the applications' configurations elsewhere See VolkerK's answer for the correct syntax for multi-table updates. Which storage engine are you using? If it's InnoDb (or other engine that supports transactions), you should start a transaction before running the query. Then you can verify that the result is the desired one before you commit any changes: Example: mysql> START TRANSACTION; mysql> SELECT * FROM Configs LIMIT 5; -- See what it looks like before mysql> Run update query here mysql> SELECT * FROM Configs LIMIT 5; -- Verify that the result is the expected one mysql> COMMIT;
