How do I share a WiX fragment in two WiX projects?

We have a WiX fragment in a file SomeDialog.wxs that prompts the user for some information. It's referenced in another fragment in InstallerUI.wxs file that controls the dialog order. Of course, Product.wxs is our main file. Works great. Now I have a second Visual Studio 2008 Wix 3.0 Project for the .MSI of another application and it needs to ask the user for the same information. I can't seem to figure out the best way to share the file so that changing the information requested will result in both .MSIs getting the new behavior. I honestly can't tell if a merge module, an .wsi (include) or a .wixlib is the right solution. I would have hoped to find a simple example of someone doing this but I have failed thus far. Edit: Based on Rob Mensching's wixlib blog entry , a wixlib may be the answer, but I am still searching for an example of how to do this.
