Your FE model is $$E[Z_i \vert X_i,Y_i]= a_i + b_1 \cdot X_i + b_2 \cdot Y_i + b_3 \cdot X_i^2 + b_4 \cdot Y_i^2 + b_5 \cdot X_i \cdot Y_i$$ The intercept $b_0$ is not really an ordinary intercept that comes out of the model (since that is eliminated by the demeaning), so I replaced it with the fixed effect $a_i$ . You can think $b_0$ as the average value of the fixed effects (which is what software packages will frequently report). Let's say you care about the effect of $X$ on $Z$ . Take the derivative of the expected value with respect to $X:$ $$\frac{\partial E[Z_i \vert X,Y]}{\partial X}= b_1 + b_3 \cdot 2 \cdot X_i + b_5 \cdot Y_i$$ The marginal effect tells you how the expected value of $Z$ changes with an additional unit of $X$ . Note that it is a function that depends on how much $X_i$ is already there, but also on what $Y_i$ is. If all three coefficients are positive, for example, adding that extra unit of $X$ will be more impactful when there are lots more $X$ and $Y$ to begin with. But why stop here? Now we can take this a step further and ask how this marginal effect itself depends on $Y$ by taking a derivative of the derivative: $$\frac{\partial E[Z_i \vert X,Y]}{\partial Y \partial X}= b_5.$$ This means the marginal effect of $X$ on $Z$ increase by $b_5$ Zs for each additional unit of $Y$ . The significance of the interaction tells you something about whether you can distinguish that effect-on-the-effect from zero. When your model leaves out interactions, you can think of that as effectively setting their coefficients to zero. This means $b_1$ will be comparable and have the same meaning across models with and without those interactions. It's the direct effect of additional $X$ on $Z$ .
