Linear model coefficients over time

I have one scale dependent variable $Y$ and 15 ordinal independent $X_1, X_2, ..., X_{15}$, measured three times in three consecutive years. My purpose is to measure the extend that $Y$ correlates with the ordinal variables taking into account time variation. A repeated measures ANOVA reveals that Y does not have a significant change over time, while Friedman's test verifies that all 15 ordinal variables increases in time. Further, in each consecutive year Y a linear model verifies that Y is not significantly related to the $X_i$'s (assuming that the $X_i$'s are hiding a scale variable). So the question is: Are the above results sufficient to declare that Y is independent to $X_i$'s taking into account time factor or there is another more appropriate way (probably from time series theory that will ensure that coefficients of the linear model are stable over time) Thank you in advance for any help.
