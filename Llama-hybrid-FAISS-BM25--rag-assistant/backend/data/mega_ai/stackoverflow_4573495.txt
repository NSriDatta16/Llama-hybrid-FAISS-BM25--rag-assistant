MVVM is a design pattern that separates the UI from the implementation details. The Entity Framework is (I believe) an ORM, designed to abstract application specific implementation details from the underlying storage. Datasets offer little to no abstraction over the underlying storage. I'd recommend using any ORM/DAL framework over directly interacting with datasets. Both MVVM and the Entity Framework can be used in the same application because they offer abstractions at completely different layers. When combined, the "model" in MVVM is the DAL/ORM layer.
