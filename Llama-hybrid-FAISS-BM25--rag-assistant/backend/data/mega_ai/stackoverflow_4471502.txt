Your regex: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_](?=[^\s]+$).{5,20} is matching 5 characters, but only after it matches 1 character within [a-zA-Z0-9_] , and then on to the 5 characters. So at minimum you need a 6 character string to match. Based on your last paragraph, something like the following is more to what you're looking for: /^[0-9a-zA-Z_]{5,20}$/ EDIT: Corrected thanks to @Allan, not quite in to the cognitive thinking pattern yet, coffee deprivation. ;-)
