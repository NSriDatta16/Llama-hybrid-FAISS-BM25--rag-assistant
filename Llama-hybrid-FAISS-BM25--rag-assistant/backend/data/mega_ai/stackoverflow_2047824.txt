After some playing around I found a solution... although I don't know if it's really a good one. I'd prefer a more elegant solution. Anyway I pass the request to the template and am able to access all the GET variables via request.GET. Then I loop through the GET dictionary and as long as the variable isn't page I print it. {% if contacts.has_previous %} previous {% endif %} Page {{ contacts.number }} of {{ contacts.paginator.num_pages }}. {# I have all of this in one line in my code (like in the previous section), but I'm putting spaces here for readability. #} {% if contacts.has_next %} next {% endif %}
