No, in general the prior odds can be any ratio. It's an interesting choice of words this authors uses, "...and is an unavoidable simplification of a problem for which there is not as yet a satisfactory solution". There is a large literature on Bayesian model choice, Bayesian hypothesis testing, and selection and implication of using informative priors. Some Bayesians might argue that a satisfactory solution to this problem does in fact exist within the Bayesian paradigm and might include utilities and decision analysis. However, not withstanding these aspects of the Bayesian paradigm, there are practical issues regarding the subjectivity in the choice of the prior and this may be what this author is referring to. Nonetheless, methods such as sensitivity analysis are recommended to assess how much specific conclusions depend on assumptions about the prior, that is, more than one prior should be considered.
