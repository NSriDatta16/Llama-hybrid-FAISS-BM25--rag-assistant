Answered in comments by AdamO: I would call such a data object a multivariate time series despite the timestamp for temperature and torque not being aligned. That's just an artifact of how these data are stored. You can view it as a missing data problem. As with any timeseries analysis, the first step will be to infer some type of continuous time trend before performing any inference or prediction. After that point, the alignment of timestamps for torque and temperature is no longer of concern.
