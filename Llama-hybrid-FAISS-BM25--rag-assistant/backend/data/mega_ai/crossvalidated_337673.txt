Proper Way to Plot Neural Network Loss

What is the best / typical way to plot the training and validation loss during the training of a neural network? Specifically, I am thinking of this as a task in order to help diagnose under / over fitting - perhaps for early stopping or some other method of parameter tuning (e.g. paper ) Here I am assuming there is a training set and an independent development / validation set. Question #1: First, does one plot performance / loss at the end of each epoch or each iteration (i.e. mini batch)? Question #2: Assuming we are plotting at the end of each mini-batch what is the process? Read mini-batch, run through network, compute loss and update parameters Now what? Training: Do we use The entire training set (or at least the cumulative read from disk at that point - if we are reading from disk in batch or using a generator) to calculate the performance / loss? Just the mini-batch we just used to update the parameters? Some type of rolling average of the mini batches read so far? Something else? Development / Validation: Do we use: The entire development / validation set (or at least the cumulative read from disk at that point - if we are reading from disk in batch or using a generator) to calculate the performance / loss? Some type of rolling average of previous iteration calculations? Something else?
