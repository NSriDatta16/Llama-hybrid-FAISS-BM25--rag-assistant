I think you're looking at this the wrong way. Consider the following, silly fragment of code let x = [undefined] let y = map toInteger x If we evaluate y == [] we get False , whereas if we evaluate head y we get an undefined exception. There's no reason that applying map or comparing y with [] should diverge just because the only element of x is undefined. That's the essence of non-strictness.
