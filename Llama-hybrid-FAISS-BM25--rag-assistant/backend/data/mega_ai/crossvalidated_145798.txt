How to build separate time series forecasts model for each of 3k customers?

I have 3000 customers in my base and I want to forecast next 6 months revenue at a monthly level for each of these 3000 customers. Does that mean i have to build 3000 Arima models 1 for each customer? I can build a automated process to try with different values of p,d,q for seasonal & non seasonal arima for a customer and pick the one with least MAPE etc but doing it may not give the most accurate result. Is there any better way of approaching this problem? Or are there any better methods to tackle the scale of this problem were i don't have to build 3000 arima models instead build fewer models? Note: Getting a customer level forecast is must I cannot group customers and forecast.
