Why Excel? It is much easier to compute this in R. See ?predict , in particular you will need to set the newdata argument of the function to the test dataset. It is not difficult to compute predictions manually either. Since it is a logistic regression, if $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_a,\dots,\beta_f$ the coefficients of the corresponding predictor variables $a,\dots,f$ and $u_n$ the random intercept of the group $n$, the model predictions can be computed as $$p(x_i|n)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_aa_i+\dots+\beta_ff_i+u_n)}}$$ If you are making predictions on different groups that those you used to fit the random intercepts, you can just remove the random effect term.
