How do I normalize data in online learning?

In offline machine learning, the data normalization of features with different units seem to be simple, we can apply this formula. But, when using incremental learning (weighted kNN in my case) new instances will be added to the initial training set, so do we use the same formula? if yes which max and min should I use (those of the original training set or the new one)?
