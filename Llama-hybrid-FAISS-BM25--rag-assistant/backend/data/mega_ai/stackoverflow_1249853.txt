The advantage of any framework like SEAM or Grails is that it's a higher level of abstraction. It takes care of underlying details for you and, if it's designed and written well, makes things easier. The disadvantage of any framework like SEAM or Grails is that it hides a lot of details from you. If you don't ever learn what's going on underneath you can find yourself in a world of trouble if you get stuck and don't know anything about the code that's generated for you. Another disadvantage is that the assumptions they build into the model might not always be what you want. But changing them means breaking the path that they've laid down for you, which isn't easy. My advice would be to use the framework and appreciate the advantages it brings, but don't use them as an excuse to stop learning what's happening underneath. Be the person who could write the whole thing by hand, without the framework, but chooses to use it for the leverage it provides.
