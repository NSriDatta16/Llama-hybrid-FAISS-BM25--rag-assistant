What's the best way to calculate Naive Bayesian Classifier by hand?

For example, lets suppose that if i use the data below to learn Naive Bayesian Classifier. Using this classifier, I would have to calculate p(NonContact, p(HardContact), and p(SoftContact) for the 15th record. The first 10 records are training data, and the other records are testing data.
