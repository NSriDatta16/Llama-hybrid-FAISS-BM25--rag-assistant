Why does this allow promotion from (char *) to (const char *)?

Given that scanf has (const char *) in the documentation from Microsoft and the answer to this question what the heck is going when I do the same for (char **) promotion to (const char **)? Basically why does this compile? #include int main(int argc, char **argv) { char szArray[50]; int i = 0; strcpy(szArray,"10"); /* the following code is upcasting the (char *) to (const char *) */ sscanf(szArray,"%d",&i); return 0; } And why won't this compile? #include void processargs(const char **p) { } int main(int argc, char **argv) { processargs(argv); return 0; } Both seem to be doing the same thing to a pointer!
