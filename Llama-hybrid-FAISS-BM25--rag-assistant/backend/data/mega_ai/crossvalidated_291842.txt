Note that the IBM Watson solution to this problem was utterly wrong, and that the dataset is too small by a factor of 20 for split-sample validation to work properly. The original source dataset is at https://hbiostat.org/data . Please don't refer to a copy of the original dataset. sibsp and parch cannot be interpreted correctly without interacting them with age, although there may be some merit in computing a "passenger is alone" variable. A fully worked out case study using logistic regression for this dataset is in my book Regression Modeling Strategies and its course notes which may be found at the RMS entry under https://hbiostat.org/rms . In my detailed analysis you'll see that I dealt with the age transformation very thoroughly and flexibly, and properly penalized the analysis for using the data to derive the function forms for age.
