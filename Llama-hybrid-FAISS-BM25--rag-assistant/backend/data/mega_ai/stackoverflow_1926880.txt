Telerik Scheduler - drag and drop

I use Telerik demo scheduler as my base, as it seen in http://www.telerik.com/community/forums/wpf/scheduler/uniqueid-property-how-to-access-it.aspx So i have implemented data loading from SQL to this scheduler. Now I want to implement drag and drop. So, how can I get my appointment values in old place and values in new place on scheduler and what the best technique to do that? I would use these values, to implement update of appointment dates in SQL.
