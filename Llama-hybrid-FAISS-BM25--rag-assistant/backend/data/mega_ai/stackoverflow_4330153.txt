Here are some reasons why Entity Framework (v4) is better: 1 - L2SQL is essentially obsolete 2 - L2SQL does not support POCO mapping, EF does. 3 - EF has more flexibility (code first, model first, database first). L2SQL has only 1. 4 - EF has support for SPROC -> POCO mapping 5 - EF has Entity-SQL, allowing you to go back to classic ADO.NET when required 6 - EF supports inheritance (TPT, TPH) 7 - EF goes hand-in-hand with Repository pattern, and deferred execution via IQueryable 8 - EF components (ObjectSet, ObjectContext) are easily mockable and allow for DI I cannot think of any reason why new projects should use L2SQL. Some might say "Well L2SQL is good for small projects, i can drag and drop and be done with it". Well you can do that with EF4 as well, and you'll have more flexibility/support in the long run if you decide to modify/grow your project. So that is not an excuse. HTH
