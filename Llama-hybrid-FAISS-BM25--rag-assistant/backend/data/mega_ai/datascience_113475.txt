Normalizing softmax by dividing by its maximum?

Reading this paper , I'm struggling to understand the step with the question mark (page 3). The formula for $\textbf r$ uses $\textbf q_i$ (no tilde), but the numeric values in the following paragraph are in fact $\tilde{\textbf q}_a, \tilde{\textbf q}_b$ - the standard softmax formula, without division by $max_i \tilde{\textbf q_i} + \epsilon$ . I'm new to this... is this step some sort of numerical stability thing which has not played a role in this example? What am I not seeing here? Thank you!
