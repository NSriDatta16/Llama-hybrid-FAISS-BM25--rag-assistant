You can use a credible interval (or HPD region) for Bayesian hypothesis testing. I don't think it is common; though, to be fair I do not see much nor do I use formal Bayesian Hypothesis testing in practice. Bayes factors are occasionally used (and in Robert's "Bayesian Core" somewhat lauded) in hypothesis testing set up.
