I have a similar situation with one of my projects. All the delete views for most controllers are styled the same way, display the same confirmation boxes, and simply renders a predictable display of whatever object is being deleted. The solution was quite simple and elegant in my opinion. Simply put, what we (the developers) did was create a new directory in app/views called shared and put shared views in there. These could be full template files or just partials. I would suggest using a shared template (in neither categories nor photos view directories, but rather in the shared directory) and rendering it manually from the view. e.g. have a method as such in both controllers and a file app/views/shared/photo.html.erb : def show @photo = Photo.first # ... or whatever here render :template => 'shared/photo' end This should successfully render the shared template. It is the DRYest route and doesn't have the feeling of pollution you get when using a more-or-less empty view in each controller's view directory just to include a shared partial, as I understand your question is suggesting.
