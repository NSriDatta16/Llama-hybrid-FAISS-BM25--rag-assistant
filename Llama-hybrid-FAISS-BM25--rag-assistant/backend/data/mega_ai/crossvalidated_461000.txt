RL: A single agent is trained to solve a Markov decision problem (MDPS). GT: Two agents are trained to solve Games. A multi-agent Reinforcement learning (MARL) can be used to solve for stochastic games. If you are interested in the single-agent application of RL in deep learning, then you do not need to go for any GT course. For two or more agents you may need to know the game-theoretic techniques.
