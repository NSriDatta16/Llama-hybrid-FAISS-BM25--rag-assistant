I have not seen a probit sample size calculation like this, but I have seen this done for a logit. I suspect the choice of model will not matter substantially unless you are way out in the tails (very rare or very frequent events). This could be verified with a simulation. You will need to know or guesstimate the probability of success at the mean of $x$ and at one standard deviation above the mean of $x$ : $$\begin{align} p_1 &= \Pr(y=1 \vert x= \bar x) \\ p_2 &= \Pr(y=1 \vert x= \bar x + \sigma_x)\end{align}$$ You can usually get these from a pilot study or from previous work. For example, > ss Here is an R function that produced the output above: # Logistic Regression Sample Size Analysis # # This function computes the sample size required for a logistic regression with a single continuous covariate of interest x # and one or more optional control variables z1-zk, Pr(y=1 | x, z1,...zk), # # It is based on Phil Ender's powerlog.ado (version 1.0) for Stata, which is itself based on POWERLOG.SAS (version 1.1) # for SAS by Michael Friendly. # # Inputs: # p1 is the probability that the outcome equals 1 when the predictor x is at its mean. # p2 is the probability that the outcome equals 1 when the predictor x is one standard deviation above its mean. # Both p1 and p2 must be strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than 1. The best way to obtain these numbers is through a # pilot study that closely mimics your research design or from previous literature. # r2 is the squared multiple correlation between the predictor variable x and all other variables in the model z1-zk (default = 0). # Use r2=0 for a one-predictor model with only x. # alpha is the significance level for the test. It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true (default = 5%) # power is the probability of detecting a “true” effect when it exists, defined as 1 minus the probability of incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis (default = 80%) # If help is not set to FALSE, the code returns an explanation (default = TRUE) # # Output: # Prints the parameters of the hypothesis test and required sample size n # If help is set to TRUE, prints out an explanation # Returns a list containing p1, p2, r2, alpha, power, and n # # Example: # ss For completeness, there is also an R package called WebPower that can handle logistic SS calculations. It also has a web interface . It uses a different approach and assumptions than I do, and it can do both two-sided and one-sided tests. It gets 169 rather than 164: > WebPower::wp.logistic(n = NULL, p0 = 0.5, p1 = 0.6, alpha = 0.05, + power = 0.8, family = "normal", parameter = c(0,1), alternative = "greater") Power for logistic regression p0 p1 beta0 beta1 n alpha power 0.5 0.6 0 0.4054651 168.776 0.05 0.8 Response to Question in Comments Here's a simplified example of how you might do a calculation like this. Say you are a ride-hailing company like Uber, and you want to estimate the probability of ordering a ride ( $y=1$ ) as a function of price $x$ using an experiment where you vary the price that riders see in the app. But say these are the early days, and you don't have a model for $\Pr(\mathtt{ride} \vert x)$ . After all, the point of the experiment is to estimate this model reliably with the experiment you are designing. What is to be done? You might know something about the $\Pr(\mathtt{ride} \vert x_1)$ , where $x_1$ is the current price. Taking the average over all the potential current customers that open your app and see a price would give you a $\hat p_1$ . If you don't have a current price, you can use a focus group to estimate $p_1$ for a price in the middle of the range you are considering. You should also have some idea of the range of $x$ that you want to test. Let's assume that range is from $0$ (free) to $2 \cdot x_1$ (2X current price), where each price is equally likely. So $x$ has a uniform distribution over $[0,2 \cdot x_1]$ . The standard deviation of a uniform RV like that is $\sigma_x = \sqrt(\frac{4}{12}) \cdot x_1$ . You do a pilot with price set to $x_2 = x_1 + \sqrt(\frac{4}{12}) \cdot x_1$ and get the average probability of sale $\hat p_2$ . If you can't do a pilot, you can make an assumption like this. In previous research, the short-run price elasticity of taxis was found to be $0.6$ , so for a $1\%$ increase in price, quantity demanded falls by $0.6\%$ . An increase from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is about $60\%$ , so you would expect that $\hat p_2 = 0.35 \cdot \hat p_1$ . This gives you $p_1$ and $p_2$ to plug into the sample size calculator above.
