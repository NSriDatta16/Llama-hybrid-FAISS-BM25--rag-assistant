I have a running version of Bayesian Deming regression. I used a fixed variance ratio approach starting from Linnet's work on Weighted Deming, 1988. Thus, sampling a single error term. I also added a linear heteroscedastic model for the error term. More will be added in the future. Any feedback will be appreciated. The package is under GitHub piodag/rstanbdp. On CRAN since 23/02/2024 https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstanbdp
