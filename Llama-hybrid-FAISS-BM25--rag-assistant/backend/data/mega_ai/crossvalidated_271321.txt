MCMC: invalid covariance matrix due to numerical error

During Gibbs sampling, I need to sample a multivariate Gaussian distribution. But rmvnorm return errors sometimes because the covariance matrix is not definite and I found the determinant of it is, say, $-10^{-20}$. I suspect this is caused by the numerical errors. What should I do to handle this?
