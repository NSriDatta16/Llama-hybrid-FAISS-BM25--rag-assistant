I don't think there is much circularity in your genes, so I would not use a circular display. Instead, I would simply try to visualize your table in a table-like way. For instance, we could mark mutations in normal samples in green and mutations in cancer samples in red, and group the different body parts affected together: I didn't use any particular package for that, just base R graphics. The key point is using the rect() function that draws and fills rectangles. In this way, you have a lot of control over things like placing titles, or leaving a little space between the rectangles. gene_data EDIT: you express some concern about how this would look like for your real data. I randomly simulated 40 genes and 20 tissues as you write above. The result still looks helpful to me. You could perhaps call out some genes you want to draw attention to, e.g., by shading or by using boxes. gene_data
