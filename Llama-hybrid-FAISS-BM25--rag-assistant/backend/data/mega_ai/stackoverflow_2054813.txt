It sounds like you want to create a 'UserControl'. It's just like any other control but you can add controls to the surface. Then you would expose properties in the UserControl source that would propagate the changes thru to the appropriate control: public string Label1Text { get { return this.Label1.Text; } set { this.Label1.Text = value; } } ...etc... You can even expose Click events in this manner, and allow users to subscribe to them. Then you can drag/drop this new control onto your other window surfaces.
