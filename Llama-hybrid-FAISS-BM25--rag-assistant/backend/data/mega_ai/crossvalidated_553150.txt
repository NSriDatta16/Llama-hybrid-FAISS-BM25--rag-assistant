I know this one but I really need use principal because my professor ask me for use it. Although principal's lib name it as "principal component analysis" it evaluates the loadings of factors using PCA analysis. – Davi Américo Aug 31 at 9:04 I wonder if your professor really understand the subtle but important difference between the principal component scores (from PCA) and the corresponding factor scores (from factor analysis). By looking at the help manual information for either psych::principal or stats::princomp, both would give you the principal component scores. However, no one can provide you with "factor" scores from a PCA because PCA can only give you the principal component scores. You may need to check this with your professor to clarify exactly what he/she was asking you to do. Good luck, John
