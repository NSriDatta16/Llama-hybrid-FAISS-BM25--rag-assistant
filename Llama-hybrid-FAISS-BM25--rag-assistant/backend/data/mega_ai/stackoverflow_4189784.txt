My first thought was to do the following. I don't think its the fastest or most elegant way, but I think it should do the trick: If you check a URL on Google, they all look the same: http://www.google.com/search?q='here your searchword' So i would just iterate over your array and for each string create a url like e.g. http://www.google.com/search?q=test do a HTTP-Post for that and parse the result. Here is a short example of the HTTPPost. You can also see how to get the response. I don't know how googles response is looking, but if you just print out the whole response, I think you will see how you have to parse it.
