Why should underlying membership provider decide whether…?

A) Why, when using templates with CreateUserWizard control, does including Textbox with ID=Email depend on whether CreateUserWizard.RequireEmail property is set to true, but TextBox with ID=Question is required only if underlying membership provider requires password question? In other words, why wouldn’t it also be up to underlying membership provider to decide whether Textbox ( with ID=email ) is required? B) On the other hand, why would be up to membership provider to decide whether password question is required? Shouldn’t this be up to Membership class to decide? Afterall, the job of membership provider should just be to provide access to underlying data store, and not to decide what data users must provide?! thanx EDIT: A) It comes down to the fact that the membership provider has an obvious mapping: RequiresQuestionAndAnswer, which you can set and have this enforced, but you can't specify that the user must supply an email address. So RequiresUniqueEmail in essence tells that user doesn’t have to specify an email address, but if she does, it must be unique? B) If I understand membership providers correctly, they are the entities that send SQL queries to data storage?! Thus I assume they have full knowledge of tables and relationships etc this data storage has? But still, what if data storage doesn’t have a column for storing email addresses, but CreateUser() specifies email address as one of its parameters? How does membership provider handle that?
