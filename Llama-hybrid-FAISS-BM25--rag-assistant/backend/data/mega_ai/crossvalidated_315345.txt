1.5.2.1 is an attempt to obtain an equally weighted (except for the two endpoints) central average over 2 seasons (not 3 or 4 or any other ) thus obtaining a centralized replacement value that is supposedly unaffected by seasonal activity premising no anomalies. This anachronistic approach was first suggested in the 1940's by the innovative Julius Shiskin to purge the data of seasonality in order to more clearly see the trend GIVEN that the data could be characterized in simple T+S+I or T*S+I terms and that there were no level shifts. It was programmed because it was simple and thus became gospel because it had been programmed and was simple to understand thus it became the answer to all analyses/characterizations of time series data. It is the basis for X-11 . G.E.P. Box and G. Jenkins essentially generalized this approach (i.e. extracting the signal hiding somewhere in the data ) and I once heard him say that he would have preferred ARIMA modelling (i.e. the Box-Jenkins approach ) to be called X-12 as it was an evolution/enhancement of X-11.
