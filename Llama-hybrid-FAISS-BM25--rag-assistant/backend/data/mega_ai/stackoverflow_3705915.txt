You would need to add a table view controller at the top level. Then drag connections from the table to the controller of datasource and delegate Then drag connections from the controller to the view for "view" Then change the class of the controller you added (it's the last tab in the inspector) to your custom UITableViewController class (if you don't subclass it it does nothing) Then make sure that you somehow retain the controller when the nib is loaded. Easiest way is with an IBOutlet in the file's owner. Sorry if this is a bit general, but the specifics would consume pages. I don't recommend this approach unless you have some experience with this and know what most of the above means, in which case it's possible and sometimes desirable to do this, and good job if you do. The easiest method, if you just want a simple table view, no special circumstances, is to use the File>New File>UITableViewController with xib for user interface, then go from there with the file it makes, but that isn't your question, so I have answered as best I can.
