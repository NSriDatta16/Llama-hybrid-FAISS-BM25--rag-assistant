How do I generate a thumbnail client-side in a modern browser?

I'm looking for an elegant way to generate a thumbnail for use with the FileAPI . Currently I get a DataURL representing an image. Problem is, if the image is very large, than moving it around and rerendering it becomes CPU intensive. I can see 2 options to get around this. Generate a thumbnail on the client Generate a thumbnail on the server, send the thumbnail back to the client (AJAX). With HTML5 we have a canvas element? Does anyone know how to use it to generate thumbnails from pictures? They don't have to be perfect -- sampling quality is acceptable. Is there a jQuery plugin that will do this for me? Are there any other way to speed up the clientside use of large images? I'm using HTML5 , and Firefox 3.6+ : there is no need to support anything other than Firefox 3.6+ , please don't provide suggestions for IE 6.0
