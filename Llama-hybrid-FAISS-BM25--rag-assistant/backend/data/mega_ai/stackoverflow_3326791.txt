If the two versions of the API are in the same namespace, that's horrible! You'll have the object factory from one round of generation overwriting the object factory produced by the other (or inhibiting; I forget which xjc actually does). It's also horrible for clients of the API since they won't know what version of the API they're dealing with (unless you're doing other nasty tricks, which ought to be discouraged; if they're in the same namespace they should be the same API). The fix is to put the two APIs in different namespaces so that they get generated into different packages with different object factories. (Also beware of any use of the -p option to xjc ; that can cause things to go into the same namespace and give you these overwriting headaches.)
