What is "Interpolated Absolute Discounting" smoothing method

I'm asked to implement "Interpolated Absolute Discounting" for a bigram language model for a text. First, I don't know what is it exactly. I guess it is an interpolation between different ngrams (unigram, bigram, ), whose parameters needs to be learned Second, what is the implemented probability distribution for this technique in nltk package? Moreover, I must learn the parameters from a corpus. How can I do that?
