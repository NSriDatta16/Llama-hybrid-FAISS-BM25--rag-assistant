Suggestion for features taking: Techniques like backward elimination, forward selection, and recursive feature elimination can help you select the most important features. highly correlated features can be combined by adding or multiplications with other features. Then you can use PCA(Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality because your features will be increased then it will be the curse of dimensionality.
