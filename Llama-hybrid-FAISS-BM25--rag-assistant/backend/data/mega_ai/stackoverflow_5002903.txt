You could use Regular Expressions For numbers: [\d]+ will match one or more numeric digits. For the text: [a-z]+ will match one or more letters in the range a-z. You could use the /i operator to make this bit case-insensitive. Doing a .match call on each string twice (first for the number test and then for the text test) will get you what you're after. There is a more elegant way of doing this with matchgroups , but this will get you started. Try this interactive Regular expression tester - its very useful: http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2007/09/a-better-dotnet-regular-expression-tester.ashx
