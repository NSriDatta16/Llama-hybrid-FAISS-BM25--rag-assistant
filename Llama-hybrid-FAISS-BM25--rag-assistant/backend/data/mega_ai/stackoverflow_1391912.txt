Interesting question. I'm glad to hear you're writing the tests first. If you let the design manifest itself through the tests, you're more likely to build only the parts you'll need. But is this the best design? Maybe not, but don't let that discourage you -- your add method works! It may be too early to tell if you'll need the GetModule method later. For now, build up the functionality you need and go green, then slowly refactor it (going from red to green again) to get the design you want.
