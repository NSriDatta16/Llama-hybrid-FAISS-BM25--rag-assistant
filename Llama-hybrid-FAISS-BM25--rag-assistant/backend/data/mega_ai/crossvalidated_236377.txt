Autoregressive coefficients and heteroscedasticity

The estimated parameter in an AR (1) with just one dependent variable is 0.92. I have checked the residuals for heteroscedasticity and both the Breusch-Pagan test and the White test confirm the presence of heteroscedasticity. Does this affect the reliability of the estimated parameter? Can I still confirm that the time series is AR (1) with an Autoregressive coefficient of 0.92?
