As monty python would say "and now for something completely different" - you could try a language/environment that doesn't use threads, but processes and messaging (no shared state). One of the most mature ones is erlang (and this excellent and fun book: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang ). May not be exactly relevant to your circumstances, but you can still learn a lot of ideas that you may be able to apply in other tools. For other environments: .Net has F# (to learn functional programming). JVM has Scala (which has actors, very much like Erlang, and is functional hybrid language). Also there is the "fork join" framework from Doug Lea for Java which does a lot of the hard work for you.
