Problem installing mysql gem on Snow Leopard: uninitialized constant MysqlCompat::MysqlRes

I've got a problem trying to install the Ruby mysql gem driver. I recently upgraded to Snow Leopard and did the Hivelogic manual install of MySQL. This all seems to work fine as I can access mysql from the command line and make changes to the database. My problem is that if I now use rake db:migrate I get: rake aborted! uninitialized constant MysqlCompat::MysqlRes (See full trace by running task with --trace) Now it appears that my mysql gem isn't working correctly as I can access MySQL fine from Python using the Python driver (which I compiled to). I therefore tried to rebuild the gem using the following command from this site: http://techliberty.blogspot.com/ , (incidentally I am using a recent Intel MacBook Pro): sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install mysql -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config This compiles although I get No definition for the documentation: Building native extensions. This could take a while... Successfully installed mysql-2.8.1 1 gem installed Installing ri documentation for mysql-2.8.1... No definition for next_result No definition for field_name ... I'm a little stumped as my mysql_config is located in the correct place: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config And I have removed all other instances of the mysql gem, from my system. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks. PS I saw this previous post uninitialized constant MysqlCompat::MysqlRes (using mms2r gem) but it doesn't seem applicable for my version.
