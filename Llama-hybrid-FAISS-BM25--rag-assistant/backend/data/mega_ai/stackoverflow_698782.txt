As already stated, the easiest way is to use a Stream and its WriteComponent and ReadComponent methods. But be aware that : - it works for descendants of TComponent , not plain TObject; - only for the published properties (those saved in a dfm), not the public ones nor (a fortiori) the privwte ones; - you have to pay a special attention for the Name property when restoring the component. You may find some code you could use in these SO answers: Replace visual component at runtime in Delphi , Duplicating components at Run-Time
