 P in all cases. Adding Dynamics Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) is a logical framework for modeling epistemic situations involving several agents, and changes that occur to these situations as a result of incoming information or more generally incoming action. The methodology of DEL is such that it splits the task of representing the agents’ beliefs and knowledge into three parts: One represents their beliefs about an initial situation thanks to an epistemic model; One represents their beliefs about an event taking place in this situation thanks to an event model; One represents the way the agents update their beliefs about the situation after (or during) the occurrence of the event thanks to a product update. Typically, an informative event can be a public announcement to all the agents of a formula ψ {\displaystyle \psi } : this public announcement and correlative update constitute the dynamic part. However, epistemic events can be much more complex than simple public announcement, including hiding information for some of the agents, cheating, lying, bluffing, etc. This complexity is dealt with when we introduce the notion of event model. We will first focus on public announcements to get an intuition of the main underlying ideas of DEL. Public Events In this section, we assume that all events are public. We start by giving a concrete example where DEL can be used, to better understand what is going on. This example is called the muddy children puzzle. Then, we will present a formalization of this puzzle in a logic called Public Announcement Logic (PAL). The muddy children puzzle is one of the most well known puzzles that played a role in the development of DEL. Other significant puzzles include the sum and product puzzle, the Monty Hall dilemma, the Russian cards problem, the two envelopes problem, Moore's paradox, the hangman paradox, etc. Muddy Children Example: We have two children, A and B, both dirty. A can see B but not himself, and B can see A but not herself. Let p {\displaystyle p} be the proposition stating that A is dirty, and q {\displaystyle q} be the proposition stating that B is dirty. We represent the initial situation by the pointed epistemic model ( N , s ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {N}},s)} represented below, where relations between worlds are equivalence relations. States s , t , u , v {\displaystyle s,t,u,v} intuitively represent possible worlds, a proposition (for example p {\displaystyle p} ) satisfiable at one of these worlds intuitively means that in the corresponding possible world, the intuitive interpretation of p {\displaystyle p} (A is dirty) is true. The links between worlds labelled by agents (A or B) intuitively express a notion of indistinguishability for the agent at stake between two possible worlds. For example, the link between s {\displaystyle s} and t {\displaystyle t} labelled by A intuitively means that A can not distinguish the possible world s {\displaystyle s} from t {\displaystyle t} and vice versa. Indeed, A cannot see himself, so he cannot distinguish between a world where he is dirty and one where he is not dirty. However, he can distinguish between worlds where B is dirty or not because he can see B. With this intuitive interpretation we are brought to assume that our relations between worlds are equivalence relations. Now, suppose that their father comes and announces that at least one is dirty (formally, p ∨ q {\displaystyle p\vee q} ). Then we update the model and this yields the pointed epistemic model represented below. What we actually do is suppressing the worlds where the content of the announcement is not fulfilled. In our case this is the world where ¬ p {\displaystyle \neg p} and ¬ q {\displaystyle \neg q} are true. This suppression is what we call the update. We then get the model depicted below. As a result of the announcement, both A and B do know that at least one of them is dirty. We can read this from the epistemic model. Now suppose there is a second (and fi
