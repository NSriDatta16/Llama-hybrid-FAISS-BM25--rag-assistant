If I understand you correctly, you want to make the score a function of remaining time and total moves? So the problem is to find the algorithm f(time, moves) . Scoring is not usually an exact science. You could work this out mathematically, but the best solution is a fair one; give players a score for completing the level, then give a bonus proportional to how good they are compared to other players. To gather this data lots of play-testers of different skill levels must play the game lots of times each. Record information like average time per move , total number of moves and time remaining , then graph this data. Once you understand the shape of this data, you will have the information required to make a fair f(time, moves) A naive solution would be just something like this: level_score = level * 100; max_bonus = 100000; bonus_score = max_bonus / (time_taken + moves_taken + level*10); score = level_score + bonus_score;
