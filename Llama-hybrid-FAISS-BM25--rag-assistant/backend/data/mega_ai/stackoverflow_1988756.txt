Breaking a build is preventing any user that relies on the same standard tools and set of code than your CI environnment to get a compiling and running system. If your coworkers cannot compile the system when they're up to date, because some config is missing, the build is broken, isn't it ? If you coworkers cannot be confident that unit tests pass, because one of them is flaky, the build is broken, isn'it ? If you have automated performance tests, and you're project have to be optimized, I would go as far as too say that if you code doesn't run fast enough, you've broken the build (but that is arguable) I would not be so strongly minded about code coverage, or other metrics for example. Breaking the build can happen. CI is just there to make sure it doesn't happen too much on the day you're supposed to ship ;)
