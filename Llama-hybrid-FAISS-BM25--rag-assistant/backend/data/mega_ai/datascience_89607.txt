which Model to apply on panel data where unique id has 6-8 records and total records are 2,000,000?

I am new to such panel data where I have multiple observation for same ID in different Quarter and I am not sure what kind of machine learning algorithm I can apply. I have data from Q1-18 till Q4-2020 I have 2,000,000 rows and 200,000 unique id and 20 columns For each id I have only 6-8 past quarter values , max quarter for each id are 8 quarters and for some id I have only 6 quarters where few quarter value are not available for that id Below is the basic idea of what my data set look like Quarter - respective business quarter for that year Target - is the sales volume in ratio I am trying to Predict - Target column for 2021 Q1 quarter I have 8-10 different numeric columns and state , quarter and ID as category columns I would appreciate if someone could suggest me what kind of modelling could be performed
