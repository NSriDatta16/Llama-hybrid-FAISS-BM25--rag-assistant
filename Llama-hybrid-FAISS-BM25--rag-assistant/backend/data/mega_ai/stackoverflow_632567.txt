Are XML chunks valid?

I want to store some fragments of an XML file in separate files. It seems, there is no way to do it in a straight way: Reading the chunks fails. I always get the Exception "javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The markup in the document following the root element must be well-formed." It only works when there is only ONE 'root' element (which is not the root element in the normal sense). I understand that XML with multiple 'roots' is not well-formed, but it should be treated as a chunk. Please, before suggesting some work-around-solutions, tell me: Are XML chunks valid at all? And IF so, can they be read out using standard JDK6 API? Test code: String testChunk1 = " text "; String testChunk2 = " text text "; // the following doesn't work with 'testChunk2' StringReader sr = new StringReader(testChunk1); StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(); TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer().transform( new StreamSource(sr), new StreamResult(sw)); System.out.println(sw.toString());
