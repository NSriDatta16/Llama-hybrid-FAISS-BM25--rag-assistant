Constructing a different type of object based on some input sound like you could use the Factory design pattern. EDIT: If you want callers to not check for the object type then the Factory pattern is becoming a viable option as it leverages polimorphism. You return the actual object into a variable of base class type and when you call a method the right code will be runned depeding on the actual object type. If your types are unrelated then it is worth while to see if you can make them share a base class because uing polimorphism is more elgant way to solve the problem than a big switch.
