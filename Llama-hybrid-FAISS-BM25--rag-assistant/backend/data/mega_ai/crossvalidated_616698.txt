What is the null hypothesis and p value in the lagged autocorrelation of innovations in Kaman filter

I am using statsmodels.tsa.stattools.acf to calculate the lagged autocorrelation of innovations in Kalman filter with alpha=0.05 . Innovation is defined as observation - observed equivalent of model forecast . And I want to calculate the lagged autocorrelation of the time series of innovations, to see whether autocorrelation lags at 1,...,10 time steps are zero. So that I would know whether my Kalman Filter is optimal. I used statsmodels.tsa.stattools.acf to calculate the autocorrelation. But I don't know what does it mean by the p value it returns? and what is the corresponding null hypothesis? what if the p-value returned is very small? say if I set nlags=10 , i.e. to calculate the autocorrelation of 10 time steps lag, the result is acf[10] = 0.219018 , and its p-value is 1.544171e-218 . I knew p value is the probability that we accept the null hypothesis. But I don't know what is the hypothesis over here.
