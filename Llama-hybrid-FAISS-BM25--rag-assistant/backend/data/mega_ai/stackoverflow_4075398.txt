QT-Graphics - How to constrain the item's movement

I am doing a picture mingling project using QGraphics Scene. So I am placing the pictures inside the QGraphicsscene as QgraphicspixmapItem. But the problem is when I am moving the itm(by mouse drag), the QGraphics view is automatically expanding. I want to constrain this action. Can anybody help me in this?
