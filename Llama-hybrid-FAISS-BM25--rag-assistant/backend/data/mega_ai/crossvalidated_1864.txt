I would have very little confidence in the generalisability of results of an exploratory analysis with 15 predictors and a sample size of 20. The confidence intervals of parameter estimates would be large. E.g., the 95% confidence interval on r = .30 with n = 20 is -0.17 to 0.66 . Issues tend to be compounded when you have multiple predictors used in an exploratory and data driven way. In such circumstances, my advice would generally be to limit analyses to bivariate relationships. If you take a bayesian perspective, then I'd say that your prior expectations are equally if not more important than the data.
