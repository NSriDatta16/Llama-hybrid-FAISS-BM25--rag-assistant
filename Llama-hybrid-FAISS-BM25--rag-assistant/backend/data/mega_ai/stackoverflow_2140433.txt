Can I rearrange dll images in my .NET app's address space to make more contiguous free space available?

alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/67f98ad782.png This image shows fragmentation in my app's address space. Is there any way to force the (third-party) dll images (purple) together to eliminate (or mitigate) the fragmentation? This app will run on 32-bit XP; obviously when we eventually move to 64-bit Windows 7, this problem will go away. Thanks!
