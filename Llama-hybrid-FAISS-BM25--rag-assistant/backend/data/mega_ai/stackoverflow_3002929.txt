This answer is more for figuring out how many unit tests to use for a given method you know you want to unit test due to its criticality/importance. Using Basis Path Testing technique by McCabe, you could do the following to quantitatively have better code coverage confidence than simple "statement coverage" or "branch coverage": Determine Cyclomatic Complexity value of your method that you want to unit test (Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate for example can calculate this for you with static analysis tools; otherwise, you can calculate it by hand via flowgraph method - http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/206/Lectures/BasisPathTutorial/index.html ) List the basis set of independent paths that flow thru your method - see link above for flowgraph example Prepare unit tests for each independent basis path determined in step 2
