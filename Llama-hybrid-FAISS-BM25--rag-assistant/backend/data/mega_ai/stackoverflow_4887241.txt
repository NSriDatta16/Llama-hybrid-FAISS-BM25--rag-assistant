Naming convention for images in a large website

This is a question about organising lots of images in a web project. Say you had the following two icons in a web project that represeneted, for example, a product selected or a product not selected: What would you name them? Seems a simple question, but I suspect naming images is something of an art. For example: star_active.png and star_inactive.png : Seems fair enough but what if you want to replace the star at a later date with a circle say. Then your name is misleading so you would have to rename it and then update all your css etc. product_selected.png and product_unselected.png : Great for the when used for the specific action of selecting a product but what if I wanted to use the same image for a different purpose. Then the name is confusing and too specific. Should the image size be part of the image name? eg. someImage_16.png What is the best naming convention you have found for naming images?
