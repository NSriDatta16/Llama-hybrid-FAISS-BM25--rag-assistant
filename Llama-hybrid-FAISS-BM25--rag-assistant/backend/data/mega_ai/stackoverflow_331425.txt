my $numReads means: Create a new local variable within the context of the foreach loop. Its initial value is undef , which in numerical context is treated as 0 . So the code reads: if ((...) and (0 >= ($coverage)) ) { } which means "do something" is never executed unless $coverage is set to 0 or less. If this was debug code, I'd assume that $coverage is used to enable/disable this statement. My guess is: You've found a bug.
