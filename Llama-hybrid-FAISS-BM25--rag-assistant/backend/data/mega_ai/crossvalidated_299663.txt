Regression Using Continuous Variable with Nulls

I'm in a bit of a quandry with a logistic model I'm working on. As one of the explanatory variables, I want to include "Days since last visit" (or some transformation of it), however about 20% of the population I'm predicting for has never made a visit so their value for this would be Null. Options I'm aware of: Setting Nulls to -/+ âˆž. I'd prefer to avoid doing this since it's essentially writing off the prediction for 20% of my population as 0 or 1 Adding a Categorical variable for "Is Null" and regressing with that as well. This seems like the most intuitive to me, but I'm still not sure on how I'd transform the model to capture the continuous element (i.e. difference between 1 days since visit vs 4 days since visit). My gut says there's a way to do this elegantly with an interaction variable but I'm not sure what that is. Transforming Continuous Values into Categorical Groups (i.e. No Visit, 0-10 days, 11-20 days, etc.). Probably what I'm going with now, I'd like the ability of demarcating granular propensities with a continuous variable but this seems the most straightforward to me and I think the data would be too thin to transform days since last visit directly to categorical. Thanks in advance for your thoughts! EDIT 8/28: I wanted to update on the second point here what I had in mind, say I have a table of the following values. (for some reason my markdown tables aren't displaying) Last Visit | Flag | Interaction NULL | 0 | 0 5 | 1 | 5 NULL | 0 | 0 7 | 1 | 7 I would include the Flag and Interaction variable in my regression, with the hope that since Flag = 0 and Interaction = 0 have perfect collinearity, the values for the interaction terms coefficient estimate would be based solely on the non-null data.
