How do I compile a GNUstep application that uses NSApplication on Windows?

I am exploring with compiling an application with GNUstep on Windows. This is my main.m file: #import int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) { NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]; [NSApplication sharedApplication]; [pool release]; } I realize this is an incomplete fragment to say the least and it obviously won't do anything. I have tried several different import statements including Cocoa/Cocoa.h, GNUstepGUI/GMAppKit.h, etc. But I always run into errors with compiling that I can't seem to find help with online. This is my compile command, which I am running from the mingw shell: gcc -o test main.m -I /GNUstep/System/Library/Headers/ \ -L /GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries/ -lobjc -lgnustep-base \ -fconstant-string-class=NSConstantString -enable-auto-import These are the errors I get: c:/WINDOWS/TEMP/ccHxKZG2.o:main.m(.data+0x390): undefined reference to '___objc_class_name_NSApplication' collect2:ld returned 1 exit status Any ideas on what I need to #import, or what needs fixing in my compile command? Thanks!
