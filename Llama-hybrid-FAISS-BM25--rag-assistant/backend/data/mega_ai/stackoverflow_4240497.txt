In my past I usually kept a version info using a PRAGMA command in the database. Whenever my app starts up, I check which version the database is currently in, and call any needed update routines to alter the structure. For most cases having a whole framework to do that is overkill; especially if you have less than 10 or 20 tables in the database. Some pseudocode: currentVersion = getCurrentDbVersion() if currentVersion Here is some more information about that PRAGMA command: http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_user_version Hope that helps. :)
