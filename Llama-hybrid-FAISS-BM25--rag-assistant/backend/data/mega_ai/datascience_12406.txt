Welcome to DataScience.SE. Let's see if I've interpreted your question correctly: i want to understand impact of previous reviews on current review Keep track of which reviews a reviewer has read (randomly withhold some if you have to), and use this information together the rating of the new review to create a regressor to estimate the score of a new review given the age and score of selected previous reviews. You can do similar regressions with the topic and sentiment , if you use embeddings .
