Cross-correlation for univariate GARCH models

I have a strange and maybe stupid question about cross-correlation. Let's imagine having 2 times series, for example, asset A and asset B . Both time series have enough history. Suppose, I've calibrated an ARFIMA-GARCH (or maybe just a GARCH) models for both and want to calculate cross-correlation between series based on these models I've calibrated. Is it possible to do and how? So, more widely, if we have N calibrated univariate ARFIMA-GARCH / GARCH models, can we calculate the covariance matrix based on these models? Sorry if this question is so stupid. Thank you.
