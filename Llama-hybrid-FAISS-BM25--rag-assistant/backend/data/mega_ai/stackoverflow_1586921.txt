Flex:: How do I prevent in drag and drop, dragging onto self

I have a Flex question. I was wondering, if I have two list boxes, and I want to drag and drop between both of them, how do I prevent the user from dragging onto the same list (thus duplicating the item? I cannot have a situation where that is the case. Thanks guys
