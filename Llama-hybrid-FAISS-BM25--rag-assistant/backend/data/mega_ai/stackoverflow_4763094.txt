I am not aware of a way where you can keep data in the main page and use a hidden iframe / frame to persist data. This is because once the main page is reloaded (when you go to another page), everything in the iframe is lost. You would basically use the main page as your data-storage location. On top of the main page, you would superimpose an iframe . The user would interact with your site through the iframe . From the user's perspective, there is no difference. You can persist information by writing to the parent frame (the main page). Since the main page is never getting reloaded, you can persist data inside it. I am not aware of any Javascript libraries that do this; I will take a look though. Keep in mind that this might affect SEO and possibly navigation (not back/forward buttons). Another point, as Guffa noted, is that users cannot share links to your page since the URL in the address bar never changes (all interaction is via the iframe ). So when your user sends someone a link, they will end up at the very first page.
