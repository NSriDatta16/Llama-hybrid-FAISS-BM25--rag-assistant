With a Bayesian analysis you have more things to specify (that is actually a good thing, since it gives much more flexibility and ability to model what you believe the truth to be). Are you assuming normals for the likelihoods? Will the 2 groups have the same variance? One straight forward approach is to model the 2 means (and 1 or 2 variances/dispersions) then look at the posterior on the difference of the 2 means and/or the Credible Interval on the difference of the 2 means.
