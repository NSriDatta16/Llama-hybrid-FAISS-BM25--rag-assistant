I have done this before and it CAN be done without any library with some effort. I've built the following methods: Method that tracks your mouse movements. Method to read and pass the content when you drop. Used onmousemove and onclick events for the drag and drop methods. OnMouseOver for the div area where you'd like to drop the text - to detect whether the pointer is over the container (div) or not. Finally after dropping the text I deleted the original content (if needed) using innerHTML so it looks like it has been moved. You can pretty much achieve a Windows like drag and drop functionality with this. I used it for drag and drop images, icons, etc. If you need help with the coding I can give you some guidance, but most of it you will find if you Google around a little, then all you need to do is make them work together.
