methods to estimate 2 sinusoids in noise

Are there some strategies to estimate a function which has the form $y=A\sin(f_1x+O_1)+B\sin(f_2x+O_2)+\epsilon$ (where $\epsilon$ is small-variance Gaussian noise) I have initial estimates of of the frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ and we know that $f_1$ is much slower than $f_2$ (5-10 times smaller). Furthermore $B$ is small compared to $A$. Essentially $B\sin(f_2x+O_2)$+small Gaussian noise is trying to model a small oscillating noise term. This noise term is sitting on top of a sine wave. I haven't found estimation like this on the internet, so I am open to using a more general framework such as a neural network, logistic regression etc, but what would be the recommended approach for this type of situation?
