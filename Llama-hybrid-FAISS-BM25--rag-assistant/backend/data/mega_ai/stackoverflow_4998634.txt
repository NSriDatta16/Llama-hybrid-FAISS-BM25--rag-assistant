Crystal Reports: Count on Conditional on a Sum of Group

Co-worker needs a count of items which have an average below a threshhold. I'm wracking my brain to no avail. In the back of my mind, I'm hearing that you can't do conditionals on aggregates, and therefore, we can't aggregate the conditionals. Description is: Given multiple outage times for different objects in (specific months), Calculate availability. With Availability, get a count of those objects not meeting threshhold. OK, sounds simple to me, but my conditions don't, and therefore my count won't. Currently, she has: Group by Month Group by Object Records of outage events, in seconds Sum (outage, object) in seconds availability = (sec. in month - sum(sec. of outage) ) / (sec. in month) From here, she would like a count of those objects w/ availability below a threshhold. The conditions don't render against a summary field -- which, in a way makes sense. CR has to pull back all records to get summaries in a second pass, and it would require a third pass to do logic (and counts) against the summaries. I'm getting nowhere. Any ideas? We might be torqued on this one.
