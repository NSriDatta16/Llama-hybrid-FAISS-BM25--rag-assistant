ASP.NET MVC 2 - Using EF4 with List scaffolding

I want to show a list of game reviews for editing. This is simple to do with VS' built-in scaffolding, but I'm running into issues with handling an entity's associated EntityCollections. My controller method is currently: public ActionResult ShowReviews() { var reviews = _siteDB.Games.Include("Genre").Include("Platforms").Include("Content").ToList(); return View(reviews); } As you can see, Platforms is plural. Each game can be on a multitude of platforms (PS3, XBox 360, etc.). I'd like to have the platforms' names as a CSV string in my list. I'm just not sure how to do it elegantly as I first need to drill into the platforms, extract their names, and append them to an empty string. I just feel like I'm going about this the wrong way, and the introduction of result shaping logic in my view strikes me as wrong. Here's my view as it stands now. Please let me know if there's a better way to do this. >" %> ShowReviews ShowReviews Game Review Title Genre Platforms Score Last Modified |
