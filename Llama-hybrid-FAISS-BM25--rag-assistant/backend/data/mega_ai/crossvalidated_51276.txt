" A Deep Neural Network is a feed-forward, artificial neural network that has more than one layer of hidden units between its inputs and its outputs. Each hidden unit, $j$, typically uses the logistic function to map its total input from the layer below,$x_j$, to the scalar state, $y_j$ that it sends to the layer above. (Ref. (1))". That said, as mentioned by David: " deep belief networks have a undirected connections between the top two layers, like in an RBM ", which is in contrast to standard feed-forward neural networks. In general, the main issue in a DNN regards the training of it that is definitely more involved that a single layer NN. (I am not working on NNs it just happened I read the paper recently.)
