If your organization uses single sign on then you could just use that process. If not then you could pass an encrypted key as part of the URL parameter that has the validation info in it and validate that in your web application. In order to safeguard the key you may need to add random data to it each time so that the users cant just copy the key and go to the web page directly always. Other option I can think of is passing the userid as part of the URL and then doing query in the users table to re-validate the user in the web app. But that's sort of extra processing I guess you are trying to avoid here..
