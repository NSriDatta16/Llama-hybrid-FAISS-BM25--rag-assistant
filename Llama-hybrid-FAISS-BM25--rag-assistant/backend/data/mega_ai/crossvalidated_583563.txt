Re-sampling at defined percentage of the population

Background: I have data that contains the severity scores of the pathology findings of tissues from different subjects with 100% sampling of the organ (let's call this dataset population, which contains thousands of scored slides for each subject). Certainly, this type of scoring will generate great data however, to reduce the resources needed, pathologists typically sample a fraction of the organ. Objective: My goal is to find out the least acceptable fraction sampling that gives us enough information to assess the disease. Method: I am going to use resampling (with replacement) of my data (population) at different fractions (5%, 10%, etc.) and calculate the coefficient of variation (CV), CE to summarize the results and provide it as a guideline for researcher to pick their accuracy of interest (based on CE, CV, SD, etc) and perform their sampling. Additional information: Two different pathologists scored the fields in each slide. They used a semi-quantitative (0 to 4; with 1 increment) scoring system. We will use the average scores of two readings per field of view in every slide (so our data will be at the field of view level). There are up to 52 slides per organ, and slides have up to 42 fields of view. Questions: (i) What is the best way to show sampling at a certain fraction is enough? In other words, is this correct to use a test (e.g., t-test) to compare the mean of different fraction sampling with the true mean (mean of the population) and provide a p-value and call it enough fraction sampling if the test does not find a sig. difference? (ii) Bootstrapping uses the same number of the dataset; however, here we are doing resampling at different fractions of the population. What type of sampling is this?
