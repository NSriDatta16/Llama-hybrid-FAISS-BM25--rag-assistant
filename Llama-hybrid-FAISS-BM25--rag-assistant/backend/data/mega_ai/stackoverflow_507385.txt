I haven't seen IE8 or Firefox "push the parent down" when padding is applied to a child element; it's just that the parent element's height expands to accommodate the child. This is the correct automatic behaviour in CSS. I made a brief demo: http://robertgrant.org/testbed/paddingbottom.xhtml Feel free to try it in IE6/IE7 and see what happens (needs Javascript enabled to make the link work, but you can see what's going on even without that). If you want to constrain the parent's height, then set it (e.g. height: 100px) and set its overflow property to hidden.
