An algorithm for sorting & grouping a list of weighted objects

I have a number of chunks of data. For arguments sake we'll say they are File 1 - 150Kb File 2 - 50Kb File 3 - 70Kb File 4 - 60Kb File 5 - 70Kb File 6 - 100Kb File 7 - 90Kb For transmission, I can package these up into a max payload of 300Kb. If you just iterate through them in order you'd get TRANS1: 150Kb + 50Kb + 70Kb = 270Kb - the next file puts you over the limit of 300Kb TRANS2: 60Kb + 70Kb + 100Kb = 230Kb - the next file puts you over the limit of 300Kb TRANS3: 90Kb So three seperate transmissions. But if you re-organise them, you can send Files 1,2,6 together = 300Kb Files 3,4,5,7 together = 290Kb So you cut the number of separate transmissions needs. Since there's a monetary cost associated with each transmission (these transmissions are actually API calls to a 3rd party system, where we're billed per API Call) we'd like to keep the number of separate payload sends to a minimum. Is there any sorting algorithm out there around this kind of optimization, that will take a list of weighted objects, and sort/group them so you end up with fewest number of groups For reference, I'd be coding this up in .NET but if you can provide and example in another language or psuedo-code implementation/description, that'd be great also. Thanks, Eoin C
