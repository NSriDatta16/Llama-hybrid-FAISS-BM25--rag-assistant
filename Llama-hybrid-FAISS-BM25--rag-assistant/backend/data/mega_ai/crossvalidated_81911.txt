Interpreting PCA results

I am running a PCA for quality in a water resource. I have 15 original variables. Running the PCA using Minitab, it turned out that the first PC is responsible for 99.7% of the variation. Looking at the eigenvectors, all the original values have almost the same correlation value with PC1 (about 0.25). What does that mean? Note: I tried to use the log of the data, and the results were very much the same.
