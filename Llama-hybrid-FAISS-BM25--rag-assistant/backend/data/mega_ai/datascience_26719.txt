PCA is used to eliminate redundant features. It finds directions which data is highly distributed in. It does not care about the labels of the data, because it is a projections which represents data in least-square sense. Multiple Discriminant Analysis, MDA try to find projections which best separates the data. The latter considers the label and finds directions that data can be separated the best, although it has some details about the kind of decision that finds. To wrap up, PCA is not a learning algorithm. It just tries to find directions which data are highly distributed in order to eliminate correlated features. Similar approaches like MDA try to find directions in order to classify the data. Although MDA is so much like PCA , but the former is used for classification, it considers the labels, but the latter is not directly used for classification.
