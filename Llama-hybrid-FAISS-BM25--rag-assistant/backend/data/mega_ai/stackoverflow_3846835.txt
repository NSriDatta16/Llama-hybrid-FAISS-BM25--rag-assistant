what the best solution for user driven content on my website

i have created a website for a non profit organization. People on the site want to post stuff . i want to figure out the best way to allow them to do this. Can i host a wordpress site and somehow embed it into my website Do i need to install some whole CMS solution? Other solutions for supporting user driven posts. to clarify, the functionality of wordpress is all i need (people posting content and pictures).
