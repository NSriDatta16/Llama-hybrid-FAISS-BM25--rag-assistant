In order to implement this properly you need to know ( read ) about database normalization. Every entity needs its own table. You will have tables for: objects (real estate objects) categories transactionTypes ... etc. If you have hierarchical categories, strictly organised in a tree structure, you may want to implement this as a tree structure, all stored in one table. If there are possibilities of overlaps, then it means you need to have different tables for each, like: propertyTypes propertyRatings propertyAvailability ... etc.
