Look into using Collaborative Filtering (CF) via Matrix Factorization in machine learning to get personalization. You can use CF w/ the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) cost function if you want to keep the Bayesian connection. See this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2618 and this intro into recommender system using machine learning: http://www.eggie5.com/99-recommender-systems
