This paper Outlier Detection for Text Data discussed similar problem. I believe for a robust classifier you need to understand latent topics in the corpus, either with LSI approach as discussed in this paper or via a clustering approach in latent space. I think using de-noising autoencoder for learning features from sentence embedding is the most straight forward approach to obtain robust classifier.
