Suppressing output of module calling outside library

I have an annoying problem when using machine learning library PyML . PyML uses libsvm to train the SVM classifier. The problem is that libsvm outputs some text to standard output. But because that is outside of Python I cannot intercept it. I tried using methods described in problem Silence the stdout of a function in Python without trashing sys.stdout and restoring each function call but none of those help. Is there any way how to do this. Modifying PyML is not an option.
