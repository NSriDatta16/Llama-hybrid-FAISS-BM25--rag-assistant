No, you should not difference your series before running an ADF test. You would difference a series that contains a unit root. To find that out, you can run an ADF or some other unit-root test. The test result will give you an indication of whether you need to difference your time series. So you do the ADF first rather than last. Your particular series appears to have a deterministic linear trend. A sound way to deal with that is either (1) to fit a linear trend and work with the residuals or (2) to include a linear trend in a model for the series. Differencing is not warranted, because a linear trend does not imply a unit root. (You may look up the term overdifferencing to see what can go wrong when differencing a time series that does not have a unit root.)
