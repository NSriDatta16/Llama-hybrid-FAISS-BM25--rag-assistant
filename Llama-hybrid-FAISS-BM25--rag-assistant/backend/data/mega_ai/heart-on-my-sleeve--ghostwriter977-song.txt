"Heart on My Sleeve" (stylized in lowercase) is a song written and produced by TikTok user Ghostwriter977, with vocals made to sound like Canadian musicians Drake and the Weeknd through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The song was self-released on April 4, 2023, on various streaming platforms like Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube. Notable for its AI usage, "Heart on My Sleeve" was taken down by Universal Music Group (UMG). The song had accrued attention on TikTok and had garnered millions of views across a variety of platforms. Background and release In April 2023, Drake responded to an Instagram video of an AI-generated version of him covering "Munch (Feelin' U)" (2022), a song by American rapper Ice Spice, calling it "the final straw". Drake's response came days after his label, Universal Music Group (UMG), requested that Spotify and Apple Music block AI companies from accessing its songs. Voices of other artists have also been used to cover other songs, such as Barbadian singer Rihanna covering Beyoncé's "Cuff It" (2022), American rapper Kanye West covering "Hey There Delilah" (2006) by Plain White T's, British singer Freddie Mercury covering Michael Jackson's "Thriller" (1983), or American singer Ariana Grande covering Drake's "Passionfruit" (2017). On April 4, TikTok user Ghostwriter977 uploaded "Heart on My Sleeve" to Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Amazon Music, Deezer, YouTube, and Tidal. A one-minute snippet of the song was then put onto TikTok on April 15. Ghostwriter977 released several videos following the song's wider release onto TikTok, including one showing an apparent screenshot of a text message between Ghostwriter977 and "Rob (Attorney)" with the caption, "Offer in from Republic", referencing Republic Records, Drake and the Weeknd's label. The song was remixed by a YouTube user. On April 17, UMG filed a takedown notice of the song across multiple platforms. Ghostwriter977 then linked to his page on Laylo—a service allowing creators to notify fans of new releases—asking fans of the song to add their phone number. While some theorized that Laylo may have orchestrated the song's release to draw up attention for their service, the company later clarified that they were not involved with the song. An investigation by The Verge found that UMG may have been able to claim the video through Metro Boomin's producer tag—"If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you"—featured at the beginning of the song; YouTube requires copyright holders to claim that a certain part of a video infringed upon copyright. Since the song's release, UMG has been manually taking down videos using YouTube's report system. Reportedly, the company cannot use YouTube's Content ID system as it does not own the song. Although the identity of Ghostwriter977 is unknown, the user later stated that he was a ghostwriter who "got paid close to nothing just for major labels to profit". Ghostwriter977's identity has been a topic of speculation. The Verge suggested that Ghostwriter977 may either be UMG and Drake, a legitimate ghostwriter, or Laylo. However, Laylo issued a statement saying it was not behind the account. Music and lyrics "Heart on My Sleeve" features AI-generated vocals of Canadian musicians Drake and the Weeknd.
