Information Criteria and Sample size

In the estimation of the univariate time series model, we need to determine the correct order. For the general ARMA (p,q) model, we can determine the true order by information criteria $$AIC(p,q) = ln(\frac{\sum u_t^2}{T-p-q}) +\frac{2p+2q}{T-p-q}$$ $$SIC(p,q) = ln(\frac{\sum u_t^2}{T-p-q}) +\frac{ln(T-p-q)(p+q)}{T-p-q}$$ we know that SIC is used in the large samples while AIC is used in small samples. However, a bad statistician use AIC for his large sample size in order to ensure the series is stationary. Is it possible that he get the stationary result? How? and what is the negative sides of using AIC in large samples? I guess, in large samples, AIC will overestimate p. So, he gets large p. And then, I guess I should the formula of A. Dickey Fuller (ADF) test or other unit test formula... But I 'm stack at that point. Also, MA(q) is always stationary. But. AR(p) is $y_t =\alpha + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + ... + \phi_p y_{t-p} + e_t$ When we re-write it, $Q(L)y_t = \alpha +e_t$ where $Q(L) = (1- \phi_1L- ...-\phi_pL^p) = (1-h_1L)(1-h_2L)...(1-h_pL)$ . So the AR(p) process is stationary when $|h_i| for all i=1,...,p.
