Tesseract Example for Iphone

I have compiled tesseract for using it in xcode following: http://iphone.olipion.com/cross-compilation/tesseract-ocr I obtain the .a file, import it as framework in the iphone project, and update the header search path for tesseract header files. So now I need a simple example in order to get start. I can't find anything in http :// code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ or by googling. Anyone can help me give me a starting point (a code snippet)..?! Many ThankS! -- Later i found this code: #include "baseapi.h" TessBaseAPI::InitWithLanguage(NULL, NULL, language, NULL, false, 0, NULL); char* text = TessBaseAPI::TesseractRect(imagedata, bytes_per_pixel, bytes_per_line, 0, 0, width, height); TessBaseAPI::End(); but when I try to compile for device (only inserting include statement without the code above) i get the following: error:syntax error before 'PAGE_RES' warning:type defaults to 'int' in declaration of 'PAGE_RES' warning:data definition has no type or storage class and so on with BLOCK_LIST, IMAGE etc. if compile for simulator i get error: expected '=',',',','asm' or ' attribute ' before 'PAGE_RES' and so on with BLOCK_LIST, IMAGE and TessBaseAPI --- Other Update: I found solution for include problem: Where the include occurs must be rename the file.m in .mm extension because we have to tell xcode that we have to use objective-c and c++ together.
