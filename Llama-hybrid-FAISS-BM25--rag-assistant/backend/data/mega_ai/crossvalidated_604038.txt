Can I apply quasi-Poisson regression on discontinuous data?

I'm trying to relate the concentrations of certain air pollutants to the incidence of a disease, but I don't have continuous data on that pollution. I have daily data on cases and deaths from the disease, and meteorological parameters, but pollution measurements were taken every 4 days, and there were days when it was not possible to measure due to a problem with the equipment. I intend to apply Poisson regression to evaluate the effect of exposure to pollution on a given day with a gap of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 days after exposure. If I did the calculation of moving averages in excel, could I apply this data in quasi-Poisson Regression?
