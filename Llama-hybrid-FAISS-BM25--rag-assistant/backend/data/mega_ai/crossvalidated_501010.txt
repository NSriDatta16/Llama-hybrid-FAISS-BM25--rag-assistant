There's nothing special about ordinal regression models in this regard. You would assess linearity in the same manner as you would for a linear or binary logistic regression, comparing results for variables as they are vs. appropriate transformations of them and/or combinations of predictors. There's no automated way to formally test this in any of the SPSS regression procedures (or in those in other packages either, as far as I know).
