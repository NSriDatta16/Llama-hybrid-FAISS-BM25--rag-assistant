XGBoost with objective as binary:logistic returning only binary value

I am training an xgboost model for binary classification using objective as 'binary:logistic'. The model should predict probability but it is outputting either 0 or 1. I want the model to output the probability. These are the parameters I am using Thanks a lot in advance!
