What should I consider when connecting a PHP app to MSSQL over VPN?

So my understanding so far is: Install CLI VPN client on my Centos server Open VPN connection to remote IIS server Connect to MSSQL in PHP as normal I'm concerned about Latency: How much should I expect? Will it vary wildly? Will it "break my application"? Closed connection: Should I expect my connection to just stay open? Is reopening it in PHP trivial/fast enough? VPN client configuration: Is this going to extremely difficult? Are there more server settings that need changing besides opening a port? Connecting to DB in PHP: Are there special steps I must take because it's over a VPN? Other info: this connection is only used by ONE feature on the site (find a local agent) and I don't expect an average user to use that feature more than 1-2 times per visit. Perhaps this is better as a wiki; I have not found a good article on this subject and the feedback I've gotten about running a webapp DB connection over VPN has been decidedly mixed. Could someone with experience in this task give me some advice?
