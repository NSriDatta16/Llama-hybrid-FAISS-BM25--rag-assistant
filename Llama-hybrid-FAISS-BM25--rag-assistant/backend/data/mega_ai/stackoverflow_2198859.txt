You can use a cross join to join up your users to the 1-row stats query. Then you can use a nested iif to calculate the grade. Something like this... SELECT users.*,grade.* ,iif(users.score>grade.high,"A",iif(users.score>grade.average,"B",iif(users.score>grade.low,"C","D"))) as label FROM (SELECT round(avg(users.score)-stdev(users.score),1) as low ,round(avg(users.score),1) as average ,round(avg(users.score)+stdev(users.score),1) as high FROM users) AS grade, users;
