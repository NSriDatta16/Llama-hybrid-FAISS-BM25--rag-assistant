XSLT 1.0 Unique Elements

I am attempting to use preceding-sibling to select unique elements from a group. Using the folliwng xml as an example.. TEST1 20101026 TEST2 20101026 TEST1 20101026 TEST1 20101026 TEST1 20101026 I want to be able to select unique option-date elements (distinct is by date and data-ab). I only want to select the option-data/date that is uniqueu for each item i.e not by option.I have used combinations of preceding-sibling but as it returns to the parent I can only guarentee the dates will be unique for each option where I need it by item. Racking my brains over this for hours and cannot come up with an elegant solution. Regards, Andy
