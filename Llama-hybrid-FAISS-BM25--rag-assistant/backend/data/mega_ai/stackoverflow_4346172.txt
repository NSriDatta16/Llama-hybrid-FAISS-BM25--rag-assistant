SliderExtender with BehaviorID is not rendered after pageLoad(), but work after postback

I'm using a asp.net slider inside an UpdatePanel within a page control . I assign a behaviorID and call it using $find(behaviorID) in both $(document).ready and Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_endRequest functions inside a JavaScript located in the bottom of the page. The JavaScript function on the slider doesn't work after page_initial. It fails to find the slider in JavaScript, i.e. $find(behaviorID) = null . while other JavaScript functions set in the $(document).ready does work. However, I can view slider's rail and drag it. But when I do any postback on the page with other controls , the slider works smoothly! It generate additional tags with and the JS which is used to generate Slider and its Event in source code looks like: Sys.Application.add_init(function() { $create(AjaxControlToolkit.SliderBehavior, {"Length":410,"Maximum":100,"Minimum":-100,"TooltipText":"Adjust Target","id":"targetSlider_JS"}, null, null, $get("ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder3_Target1_txtSlider")); }); The page is in 'content' of a MasterPage. I guess it doesn't render the slider correctly when page-init, need some server side setting for slider? Regards,
