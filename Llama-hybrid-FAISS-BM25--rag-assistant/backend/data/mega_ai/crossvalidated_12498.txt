Outlier detection for generic time series

In this case, "generic" being the entire gauntlet of macroeconomic time-series that private and government statistical offices put out. Some background - I recently started working at a data provider - we collect data releases and repackage them in a presumably more convenient and accessible fashion for our clients, and we have tens of thousands of data series (wouldn't be surprised if we topped a million, actually). As part of our QA process, we run the following outlier detection: $X_t-X_{t-1} = E_t$ $\sigma^2$ is estimated from the resulting sample of $E_t$, and a z-score is calculated based off $E_t\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ I think we can do better - the math clearly falls apart for everything that isn't a random walk. I initially thought of fitting an ARMA(m,n) based on the peak of the autocorrelation/autocovarience functions of the series and checking the residuals. I'm wary of the robustness of this, and a previous question seems to indicate that autocorrelation is not particularly robust.
