Multi-output regression python

I am new to machine learning and cannot figure a way to solve this problem: I have X which is always one row/record while the y can be a row or more. Here is a simple sample from my data-set, 'i mean that i have more columns in both x and y that the presented here' x = [[1,3,'John'],[3,5,'Sandra'],[5,2,'Leila']] y =[ [['D',3,,'K'],['JK',8,'GH']], [['FG',6,'DF'],['WE',4,'EF'],['CV',5,'EE']], [['TG',9,'CB']], ] y contains both numerical and categorical values, all the rows in y need to predicted. I am using python to do Multi-output regression
