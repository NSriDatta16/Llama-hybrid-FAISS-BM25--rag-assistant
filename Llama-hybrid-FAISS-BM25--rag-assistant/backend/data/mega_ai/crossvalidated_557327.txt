Data-informed grouping of covariates in Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling?

Is there a way to place a prior on the first stage's betas that allows the second stage groups to be determined from the data? I am working with co-exposures where I am not super confident in how they should be grouped. I have been recommended the below paper but it is way above my head.
