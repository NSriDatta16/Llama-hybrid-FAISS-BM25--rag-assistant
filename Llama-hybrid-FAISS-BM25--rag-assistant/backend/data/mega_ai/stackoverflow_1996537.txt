There is an interesting post about deploying the runtime libraries on the Visual C++ blog . The post is about VC8 so I'm not sure all the recommendations apply to VC9. Here are your options according to Microsoft: Use an .msi installer including the .MSM files for the VC libraries you're using. These MSM files install the libraries globally. They also keep a reference count so that the libraries are removed when the last application using them gets uninstalled. Use "app-local" deployment i.e. copy the libraries and manifest files in your application directory. This is a simpler solution if you don't use an .msi installer. Your app should still use the system version of the libraries if they are more up-to-date than your own. Link everything statically (and avoid crt usage across dll boundaries) Another option Microsoft discourage you from using is running the Visual C++ redist installer from your own installer. I'm not sure what their reasons are. It will take a few extra megabytes and will not be reference counted but it still works very well AFAICT. You can pass the /q option to vc_redist_x86.exe to perform an unattended install (no user interaction).
