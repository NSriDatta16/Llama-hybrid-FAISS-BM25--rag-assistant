uiimageview location against another image

I have several uiimageviews on my view which the user can drag around. I have them "snapping" to coordinates based on the view... but... I'm wondering if it's possible to snap these to coordinates based on an image. So I have say one image in the background, a box. When I then drag images around, if they fall inside the box they snap to it. Like I said, I can do this by working out the location in relation to the SCREEN, but not the box. I'm thinking that I can get the coordinates of the box, then compare to those? Just wondering if there was a better way?? Thanks
