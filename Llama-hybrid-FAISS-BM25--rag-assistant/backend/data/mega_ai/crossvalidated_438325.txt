Account for the number of Bernoulli trials in the response and selected predictors of GLM?

I have sampled animals at a number of sites and time points. Each site is sampled up to 4 times a year and is sampled over multiple years. At each site*time combination a maximum of 20 animals were sampled, with the number varying at each site*time combination. Each animal was tested for 3 different viruses. I have also collected some site*time level co-variates, such as animal abundance at a at each site*time combination. I am modelling the prevalence of virus_1 at the site*time level, i.e I have a single prevalence value for each combination of site*time . To account for differences in the number of animals sampled at each site*time combination I have built what I understand to be a weighted logistic regression model - where the response variable is the prevalence of virus_1, weighted by the number of animals sampled at each site*time combination. I have included a nested random effect to account for repeated measures through time within sites. Model Question: How do I account for differences in the number of animals sampled at each site*time combination in my predictor variables? i.e I have include the prevalence of virus_2 and virus_3 as predictors in my model; these predictors are also influenced by the number of animals sampled at site*time combination. An offset() for the number of animals sampled at each site*time combination maybe? If I included an offset() for the number of animals sampled at each site*time combination would this mean that for my response variable I am accounting for the number of animals sampled at each site*time combination twice, once using cbind(success, failure) as the response variable and once using the offset() ?
