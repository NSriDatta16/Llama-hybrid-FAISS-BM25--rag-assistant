It says explicitly in the section you quote: " it is suggested to choose $κ$ close to $2π$ times [... the] reciprocal of the mean time between observations ". So it's proportional to frequency of observations (1/ average time interval ) not the time interval. [They also give a reference which no doubt has an explicit definition as well.]
