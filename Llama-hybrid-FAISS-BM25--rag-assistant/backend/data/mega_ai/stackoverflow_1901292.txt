Have a look at http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/ - you'll see that there are a variety of ways of going about this. Assuming you're wanting to code the whole thing yourself, you'll need to look into Bayesian Frameworks, Neural Networks, possibly maths ones like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the cool-named Elastic Bunch Graph Matching. However it's worth noting that there are sooo many people who have coded this around the world, that there are now ready to use, open source, off the shelf apps, apis and libraries that you can simply call. Or neural networks you can plug in - for example - TiNA . Do a good bit of reading - it's a fascinating topic, and then decide whether you want to go through reinventing the wheel (hey, it's fun to code, but it may not be what you want to focus on) or whether you'll inherit and extend some library or API. Enjoy!
