@future doesn't work (does not update records at all)? Weird. Did you try using your function in automated test? It should work and and the annotation should be ignored (during the test it will be executed instantly, test methods have higher limits). I suggest you investigate this a bit more, it seems like best solution to what you want to accomplish. Also - maybe try to call it from your class, not the trigger? Daisy-chaining triggers together will not work, I've tried it in the past. Your last option might be batch Apex (from Winter'10 release so all organisations should have it by now). It's meant for mass data update/validation jobs, things you typically run overnight in normal databases (it can be scheduled). See http://www.salesforce.com/community/winter10/custom-cloud/program-cloud-logic/batch-code.jsp and release notes PDF.
