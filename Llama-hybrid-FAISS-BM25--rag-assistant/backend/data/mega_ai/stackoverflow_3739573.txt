Magento custom attributes failing to install

I followed the tutorial at http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/5_-_modules_and_development/0_-_module_development_in_magento/installing_custom_attributes_with_your_module step by step to make my module install a couple of custom attributes, using Magento CE 1.4. I get to see the custom attributes on the product edit page, but whenever I try to save them I get an SQL error complaining that column "myattrid" does not exist. I know that: this column is part of the flat product tables and indeed, it is not there a lot of people give the advice to create by hand, but this bypasses the point of automatic installation Is the tutorial I followed outdated? If so, what extra steps do I need to take?
