Time series analysis in a case study to measure gender inequality

I am working with 1 dependent variable that is gender inequality (GI) and 2 independent variables: neoliberal globalization and patriarchy. I am doing time series at sub national level. One thing confusing me either I am use multi linear regression or Transfer Function model approach to predict level of gender inequality.
