How can I use patterns from data analysis to make a predictive machine learning model?

I'm trying to make a predictive model that can predict how well a product will sell in the future based on certain parameters. I've made some visualizations showing the relationship between the data. The visualization shows that there's a clear relationship between how warm it is outside and the amount of sales for a certain product. I have 10 years worth of data for how much a product sold each week along with the temperature for each week. If I split the data, so I only have 8 years worth of data for how much it sold and keep the 10 years data of temperature, what ML algorithm would be best to use to predict the last 2 years of amount of sales?
