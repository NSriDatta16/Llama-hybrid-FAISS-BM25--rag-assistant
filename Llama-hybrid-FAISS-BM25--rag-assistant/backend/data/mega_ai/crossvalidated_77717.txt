Pattern classificaton using neural network learning

Paper1 (freely available) and Paper2 (Springer) talk about application of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) for pattern classification. I am having a tough time to understand how the equation of FCM is constructed from a set of features. My application is in cognitive vision and I have features which are (hue values, SURF features) of an object that is being identified. How do I apply FCM equation for pattern classification ? In these papers they have genetic algorithm as the learning technique. I need to apply neural network for learning and then use mean square error between the actual FCM and the simulated FCM. I simply cannot understand how to transform the features into nodes and construct the edges. An illustration with an example will be really helpful. Thank you
