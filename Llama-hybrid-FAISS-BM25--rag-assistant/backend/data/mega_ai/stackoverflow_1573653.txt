I'd discourage you from putting Perl on your resume - there's already too many people in the perl market and we don't want any more! ... just kidding. The past is supposedly no guide to the future, but, despite having plenty of C (etc.) and Java in my 'skills toolbag' I've seen more gainful employ from my Perl than anything else over the last decade. I suspect that offshore-perl-new-build may not be the biggest market in the future, but there's certainly active development in the city and media industries in the UK. Otherwise, I'd just agree with the points above. Technicians with diverse skills are more able to pick the right tools, and less inclined to 'get religious' about language choice. If you're looking at a post where the non-technical management have a strong point of view about what technology should and shouldn't be used - I'd place that one in the 'avoid' pile.
