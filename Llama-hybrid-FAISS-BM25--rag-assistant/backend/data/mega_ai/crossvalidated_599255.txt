Data augmentation before the test/train split on a small dataset

First of all im working with a project that is not mine and cointains 0 explanatios about why things were done and I fear some of them are just mistakes. I found that for the trainig of a convolutional neural network with a from a pretrained model on the detectron2 platform, the split of train and test sets was done after the data augmentaion, so some images are duplicated in both of the sets with different augmentations. He only had 10 images for the training, so I guess he wanted to expand the dataset but im not sure about the method.
