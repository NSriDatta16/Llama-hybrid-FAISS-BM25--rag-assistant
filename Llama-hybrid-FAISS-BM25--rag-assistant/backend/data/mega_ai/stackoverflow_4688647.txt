Raghuram gave me a push in the right direction. The way to get maven to take care of copying the jars automatically is to add this code inside the tag in the pom.xml file: org.apache.maven.plugins maven-dependency-plugin copy-dependencies package copy-dependencies ${project.build.directory} false true More details on this can be found here: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/usage.html Getting maven to package the jars together would be nice, but this is good enough to answer this question.
