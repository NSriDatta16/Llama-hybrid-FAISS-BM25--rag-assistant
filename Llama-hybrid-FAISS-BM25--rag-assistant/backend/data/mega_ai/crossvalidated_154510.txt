Say $X_1, \ldots X_n \overset{iid}{\sim} \text{something}$. You don't know the distribution but you don't need to. By the central limit theorem $\bar{X} \to \mathcal{N}$. Don't worry about the parameters. Then $\exp(\bar{X}) \to \text{lognormal}$. Last part: $Y_1 = \exp(\frac{\sum_i X_i}{n}) = \left[\exp(\sum_i X_i)\right] ^{1/n} = \left[\prod_i \exp X_i\right]^{1/n}$. $Y_1$ is your first response time. I don't know anything about this stuff, but their justification for using this probably has something to do with this. Probably your response rate comes from an average of a gajillion unknown things coming from some unknown distribution.
