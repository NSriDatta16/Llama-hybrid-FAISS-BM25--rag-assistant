A simple method here is to use Bayesian analysis. For notational simplicity, let's "parameterise" your family of (two) distributions by defining the probability density $h$ by: $$h(x|\theta) = \begin{cases} f(x) & & & \text{if } \theta = 0, \\[6pt] g(x) & & & \text{if } \theta = 1. \\[6pt] \end{cases}$$ The binary parameter $\theta$ now tells you which is the true distribution --- $f$ or $g$ . Now, to determine which is the correct distribution given your data, we set a prior probability $\pi = \mathbb{P}(\theta = 0)$ that the data come from the distribution $f$ , and we compute the corresponding posterior probability: $$\mathbb{P}(\theta=0 | \mathbf{x}) = \frac{ \pi \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i)}{ \pi \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i) + (1-\pi) \prod_{i=1}^n g(x_i)}.$$ This tells you the posterior probability that the data come from the distribution $f$ (and the corresponding probability that they come from $g$ is one minus this probability).
