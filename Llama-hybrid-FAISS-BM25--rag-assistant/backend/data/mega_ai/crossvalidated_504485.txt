The way I understood it is there is scaling going on to try to fill the plot, so that explains the different values that appear under the NMDS1/NMDS2 columns. Taken from the envfit documentation from the vegan package: "The lengths of arrows for fitted vectors are automatically adjusted for the physical size of the plot, and the arrow lengths cannot be compared across plots. For similar scaling of arrows, you must explicitly set the arrow.mul argument in the plot command; see ordiArrowMul and ordiArrowTextXY. The results can be accessed with scores.envfit function which returns either the fitted vectors scaled by correlation coefficient or the centroids of the fitted environmental variables."
