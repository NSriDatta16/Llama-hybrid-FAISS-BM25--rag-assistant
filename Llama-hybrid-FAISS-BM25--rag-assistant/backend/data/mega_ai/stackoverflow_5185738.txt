A Word .doc document is not a text file. It contains lots of binary data, the stuff that keeps track of styles, fonts, paragraph formatting, etcetera, etcetera. Which is the junk you see. You cannot realistically read such a file yourself, or for that matter display the document accurately, you have to use Word. You can automate it with the classes in the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word namespace. An intermediary solution is to store Word documents in the RTF file format. As long as the formatting doesn't get too fancy, a RichTextBox can display it accurately. Storing it in a dbase column isn't hard either, it is text.
