MC dropout deep learning

I would like to compute the uncertainty of my deep learning model using MC dropout. My original model contains already one dropout and I am satisfied with its performance. To compute the uncertainty, should I place other dropouts in my model? If it is yes, where should I place these dropouts? Will these additional dropouts decrease the performance of my model (in training and testing parts)?
