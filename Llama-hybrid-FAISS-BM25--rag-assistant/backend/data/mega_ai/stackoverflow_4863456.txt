FileUploader plugin (PhoneGap) for iPhone

I am trying to use the PhoneGap FileUploader plugin to upload an image from iPhone to my server How do I use the uploadByUri function exactly? I don't understand all the parameters... FileUploader.prototype.uploadByUri("http://www.mysite.com/images/", imageURI, params, fileKey, "myimage", "image/jpg", uploadSuccess, uploadFail, uploadProgress) What do I use for for " params " and " filekey "? The read-me file says: fileKey Parameter name of the file params Object with key: value params to send to the server Right now I am putting null and get no errors, but there is no image in my destination folder. Also, do you know if I can upload directly an image in base64-encoded string from the camera rather than an image from the album? Thank you for your help. Roberto
