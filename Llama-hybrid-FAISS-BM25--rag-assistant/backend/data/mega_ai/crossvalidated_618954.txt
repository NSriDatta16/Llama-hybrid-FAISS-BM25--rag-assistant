How to analyse reaction times in SPSS?

I've learnt basic stats but I'm a bit confused on how I should so this, I'm gonna try and explain it as best as I could. So I had participants doing a driving simulation which includes two different alerts inserted at different times throughout, and I have 3 different programs to counterbalance the order of the alerts. So my reaction time looks like this in the end: ] 1 Each row is a different participant doing a different order of alerts, and the transparent vs highlighted indicates two different alert. So how do I find out whether the highlighted RT is significantly shorter than the transparent one? How should I organise my data in SPSS since the alerts are in different order ...?
