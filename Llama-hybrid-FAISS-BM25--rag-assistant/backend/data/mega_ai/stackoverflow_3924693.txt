I am assuming that receivedData is an NSMutableData object. Did you implement the delegate method -connection:didReceiveData: and -connection:didReceiveResponse: ? If not, you may want to do that and in the -connection:didReceiveData: simply append the incoming data to the NSMutableData object. If you did implement those methods already, then you might want to check to see if that delegate method is getting called and there actually is data in the temporary data storage when you finish the request. If there is nothing there, it is possible that nothing is being returned to the delegate methods.
