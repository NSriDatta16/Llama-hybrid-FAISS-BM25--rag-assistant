Constructing a neural network which intersects the function $f(x) = x^2$ more than $n$ times in the interval $[0, b]$

Given constants $b, n ∈ N$ , provide a neural network which implements a function $g_{b,n} : R → R$ such that $|{x ∈ R : g_{b,n}(x) = x^2, 0 ≤ x ≤ b}| > n$ , i.e., $g_{b,n}$ intersects the function $f(x) = x^2$ more than $n$ times in the interval $[0, b]$ . My idea is to create a zig zag sort of function split into $b/n$ parts where the start and the end points of each part are at $y=0$ and the midpoint of each part is at $y = b^2$ . This ensures that there are 2 intersections in each part. I know how to create a neural network which makes a linear function, but I'm unsure how to make a zigzag function like this? Is it possible?
