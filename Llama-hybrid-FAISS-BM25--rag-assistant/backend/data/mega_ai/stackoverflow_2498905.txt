Yes I believe that is correct. If you store the sessions on database, then there is a Job on Sql Server Agent thats call this procedure every minute or so: DECLARE @now datetime SET @now = GETUTCDATE() DELETE ASPStateTempSessions WHERE Expires There is no trigger for session expired. Lets say that was a trigger, where that can be ? There is no place to put that trigger alone to understand that the session expired and auto-delete his self. From the other hand what you can do, is not to create a timer, but when a user ask for a page, every 1-2 minute, trigger a function to delete the expired ones. So you make a trigger from a user call, but you must make it run only onces every 1-2 minutes using some kind of lock, and check for the last run. Hope thats helps.
