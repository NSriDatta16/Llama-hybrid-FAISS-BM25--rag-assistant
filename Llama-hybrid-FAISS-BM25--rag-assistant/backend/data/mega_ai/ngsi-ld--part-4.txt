alue model and an XML-based representation. The NGSI Context Interfaces were adapted by the FI-WARE project, which developed the platform for the European Future Internet Public-Private-Partnership (PPP). The OMA NGSI Context Interfaces got an HTTP binding with a JSON representation, referred to as NGSIv1, which included both NGSI-9 and NGSI-10. In the course of FI-PPP the interfaces further evolved into NGSIv2, which became the key interface of the FIWARE platform. After the end of the FI-PPP in 2016, the FIWARE platform became the core of the FIWARE Open Source Community managed by the FIWARE Foundation. In 2017, the ETSI Industry Specification Group on cross-cutting Context Information Management (ETSI ISG CIM) was created to evolve the Context Information Interface, which resulted in the creation of NGSI-LD. The limitations of the original information model led to the specification of a broader model which derives from property graphs, explicitly including relationships between entities, on a par with entities themselves. ETSI ISG CIM continues to evolve the NGSI-LD Information Model and API. It publishes new versions of the specification once or twice a year.
