The likelihood is not a probability. It's pretty easy to understand from a simple example; sample 3 heights, they are 1.3m, 1.6m and 1.9m. The "mean" height is 1.6m and, if those heights are normal, that maximizes the likelihood. However, average height is not a random quantity, the sample outcomes are. if I did the study again, the probability of sampling exactly 1.3m, 1.6m, and 1.9m is exactly 0, as is the probability of sampling 2.3m, 2.6m, and 2.9m: height is continuously valued. S is not a response or a sample in most notations, it is a sufficient statistic. Another notation for sufficient statistic is $T$ when $S$ is reserved to mean a sum... although for many practical distributions (normal, bernoulli, poisson, etc.) the sum is a sufficient statistic. A sufficient statistic can be thought of as "summarizing" the whole sample (when it comes to parametric estimation). Any statistic independent of the sufficient statistic is called an ancillary statistic. A sufficient statistic effectively summarizes the likelihood for the whole sample, so that the MLE: $\text{arg max}_\theta L(\theta, S_n) = \text{arg max}_\theta L(\theta, X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$ .
