Making code efficient is always a secondary step for me. First I write the code so that it works. Next, I profile it if i am unhappy with the performance. The truth is most applications run fast enough after the first time writing them. Sometimes though, better performance is needed. Performance can be gained many different ways. It all depends on your application. I write LOB apps mainly, so I deal with alot of IO to databases, services and storage. These calls are all very expensive and need to be limited so they are my first area to optimize. I optimize by lazy-loading, eager-loading, batching calls, making less frequent calls and so on. I recently had a winforms app that created hundreds of controls dynamically and it took a long time. That's another bottleneck that I have to address. I use a profiler to measure the performance of the applications. Use the free Equatec profiler . It will show you how long calls take and how many times a call is made. The profiler gives a nice report and visual display that can drill down the call stacks.
