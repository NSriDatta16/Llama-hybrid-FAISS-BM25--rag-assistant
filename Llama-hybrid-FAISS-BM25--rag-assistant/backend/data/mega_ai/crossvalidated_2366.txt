Actually, people get paid big money for statistical guidance through experiments... If you're not too sure about it, I'd also advise to consult a statistician. An internet forum is not the best aid for complex analyses. Much of what is possible depends on the structure within the dataset: How are the variables distributed, how is the correlation structure,... But I'll take a shot at it. So you have $m$ measurements at 4 different times, being: virgin state after preparation after first round (shot in "virgin state") after second round (shot in "non-virgin state") Your response variable is $MV$. Let's assume the error of the chronograph is random and normally distributed, this makes life a lot more easy. Let's also assume that for all other measurements the assumptions of parametric models apply, i.e. that every measurement consists of $n$ indipendent and identically distributed random variables, being your $n$ tested cases. A rather basic approach would involve using a Kolgomorov-Smirnov test to compare distributions (think about correction for multitesting) a model selection procedure to determine the best predictors for $MV$ using either set So in theory, you could use a GEE with "round" as a factor, indicating whether the measurement was made in the first round or in the second round, thus allowing for different intercepts and coefficients for first and second round that can be compared and tested. You have to specify "case" as a random factor in the GEE to get correct estimates of your SE. Basically, if the main effect "round" is significant, there is a difference before and after in average $MV$. If the interaction "round":measurement is significant, the impact of the measurement is different between the two rounds. Now it boils down to use any sensible criterium to select the best model. Without seeing the data, it's impossible to say whether this approach is actually valid. You will have to do some descriptive and exploratory analysis to really understand the underlying distributions and correlations. Otherwise you can never know whether you violated assumptions of any method. On a sidenote: Give this dataset to 10 statisticians, and chance is big you get as many different models. You should keep in mind whether or not the model also makes sense in real life. my 2 cents
