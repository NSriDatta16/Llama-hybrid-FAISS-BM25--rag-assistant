I struggled with the problem of mp3 to m4b audiobooks on OSX for a while and came up with my workflow.. now summed up in a ruby script that does it all automatically. Here's the workflow: 1.(ruby) sort files and identify chapter names (regexp magic!) 2.(lame) convert all the mp3 to 64kbits mono cbr (this is done to leverage the input files, remove tags that could cause problems in merging, and most of all because coreaudio aac conversion from stereo to mono sucks..) 3.(mp3info ruby gem) compute files length and generate chapter xml file (length computed on the mono cbr version to avoid problems) 4.(cat) merge them 5.(afconvert) convert to aac 6.(ChapterTool) applay chapter markers and rename to m4b
