Average squared distance between two samples of a normal distribution

I have a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. I draw twice from it, and get the values $X_1$ and $X_2$. What's $E\left[(X_1 - X_2)^2\right]$? More generally, for what $f$ is there a closed form solution to $E\left[f(X_1 - X_2)\right]$?
