Likelihood - not a pdf and not normalized?

I am reading the book "Patter recognition" by Cristopher Bishop. At Chater 2.3.6 "Bayesian inference for the Gaussian", there is written The likelihood function, that is, the probability of the observed data given $\mu$ , viewed as a function of $\mu$ , is given by $$p(\mathbf{X}|\mu) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} p(x_n|\mu)$$ Again, we emphasize that the likelihood function $p(\mathbf{X}|\mu)$ is not a probability distribution over $\mu$ and is not normalized I can understand that the likehood is not a probability distribution over $\mu$ , that is, it's not the probability of obtaining $\mu$ , but rather the probability of obtaining the observation given $\mu$ . But why it is normalized? Is it not true that $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} p(\mathbf{X}|\mu) =1$ ?
