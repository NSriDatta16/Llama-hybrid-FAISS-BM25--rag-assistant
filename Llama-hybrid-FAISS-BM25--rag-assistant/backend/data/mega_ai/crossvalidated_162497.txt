Random Forest, dependent measurements

I have a following quiz: A random forest is used for classifying the disease state of patients based on measuring multiple genes. The dataset consists of 100 genes and 50 patients. However, for each patient, 10 measurements exist at different time points. When analyzing the data, the out-of-bag error is very close to the error on the training data, but very different from the error on the test dataset. I am not quite sure if I understand it correctly. The out-of-bag error is calculated on the points (patients) that were not included during bootstrapping in the training dataset. Right? If so, I do not understand the reason for error difference. The answer is that 25 patients have dependent measurements. But I do not get why it affected the test dataset and not out-of-bag error.
