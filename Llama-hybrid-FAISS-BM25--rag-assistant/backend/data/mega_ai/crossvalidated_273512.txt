I have used the randomForest package in R several times and there were some functions to measure the variable importance such as importance() and varImpPlot(). As far as I know varImpPlot visualizes the the importance of each predictor with respect to variables' contribution in the decrease of error measures (e.g mean squared error for regression, Gini index for classification etc.) What I usually do to measure variable importance in a really simple way is, I estimate linear and lasso regressions and then see how much the coefficients were shrunk. library(MASS) library(randomForest) library(glmnet) data(Boston) # Random forest (based on the lab example from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning") rf.boston # Linear model lm.boston par(mfrow = c(2,1)) rf.boston And a quick comparison for both: As far as I understand, Lasso approach could be a bit problematic when predictors are correlated. You can see that rm variable has a larger lasso coefficient than the linear one.
