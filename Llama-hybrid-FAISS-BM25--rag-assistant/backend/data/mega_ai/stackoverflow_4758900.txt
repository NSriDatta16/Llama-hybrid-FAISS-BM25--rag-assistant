Personally, I think your 'longhand' way is elegant in that it is easy to read and maintain than I would find the answer @samjudson (but I do see the appeal of their approach). You could use OR to test more than one value per case. I find LIKE easier to read but that could just be me ;) e.g. CASE WHEN card_type LIKE '37%' THEN 'AMEX' WHEN ( card_type LIKE '30%' OR card_type LIKE '39%' ) THEN 'Diners' WHEN ( card_type LIKE '40%' OR card_type LIKE '49%' ) THEN 'VISA' WHEN ( card_type LIKE '50%' OR card_type LIKE '59%' ) THEN 'MasterCard' ELSE 'unknown' END
