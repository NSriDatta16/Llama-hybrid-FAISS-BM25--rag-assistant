What does the acf of the log of data tell us?

I'm working with time series data . And there is a use of acf ( auto correlation function ) being applied to the log of a series. Basically the log of the data with acf was the correct way while the acf without log was not. Why I would use a log function in a auto correlation function. ?? Example: Acf(log(data)) # correct Acf(data) # wrong Please any help would be great.
