BUILTIN\Administrators removed - how to undo it

SQL Server 2000 Standard, Windows 2003 My coworker removed 'BUILTIN\Administrators' group from SQL Server which results in 'SQL Server Agent' not working. All my TSQLs to synchronize databases stopped working. I have Administrator rights on the server and my database user is in sysadmin role. Does any one have idea how to bring 'BUILTIN\Administrators' back without restoring master database from backup? Edit: When I try to add Administrators or MACHINENAME\Administrators using Enterprise Manager I have this group on the list to choose, but when I accept my choice I have error: Error 15041: Windows NT user or group 'MACHINENAME\Administrators' not found. Check the name again of course instead of MACHINENAME I see my server name Edit2: Found it Login as sysadmin Run following TSQL queries EXEC sp_grantlogin 'BUILTIN\Administrators' and EXEC sp_addsrvrolemember 'BUILTIN\Administrators','sysadmin'
