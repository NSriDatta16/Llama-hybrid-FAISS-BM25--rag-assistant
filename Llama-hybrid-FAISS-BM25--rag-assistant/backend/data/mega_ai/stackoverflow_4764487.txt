Single page website navigation selected states

New to SO! Please suggest a better way to phrase this question :) I have a single page, vertical scrolling website with a fixed navigation bar located in the footer. I am using local.scroll and anchors to link the navigation to divs on the page. I would like the user to be able to click on one link and have it change to a selected state. I'm just not sure how to style/code the links for a single page (instead of using class="select" for each active link as in multiple page sites.) This site has an example of what I'd like to accomplish: http://www.kristaganelon.com/#portfolio-section
