MySQL average of 2 columns using WHERE and GROUP BY year(), month()

Using MySQL. How can I find the average of the min_amount and max_amount columns while grouping by year(my_date) and month(my_date)? Currently I'm planning on putting the sum of the columns in an array then average them using PHP. Is there a way to get the average of the 2 grouped columns with an SQL query instead? $sql = "SELECT SUM(min_amount) AS sum_min_amount, SUM(max_amount) AS sum_max_amount, my_date FROM table_1 WHERE name = '$name' AND year(my_date) BETWEEN '$start_year' AND '$end_year' AND month(my_date) BETWEEN '$start_month' AND '$end_month' GROUP BY year(my_date), month(my_date)";
