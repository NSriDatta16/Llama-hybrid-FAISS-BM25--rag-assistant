How to organize Scala code in Lift project?

After 1.5+ years of Ruby and Rails programming, I have finally started working on one of the new projects in Scala and Lift. Basically I'm trying to write an API for accessing information from a huge database (millions of rows). Lift should help me code the frontend of this project (the API part). But now, this also involves a module that would read from a compressed ZIP XML file to initially populate the database with rows. This module would need to run once in 3 months. Where should I place this module code? or rather, How should I organise my Lift and Scala code? Where does the background processes go? Any pointers in this regard are welcome.
