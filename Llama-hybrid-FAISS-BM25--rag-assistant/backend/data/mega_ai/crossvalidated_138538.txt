Issues in auto.arima algorithm when using external regressors and outlier correction

auto.arima is an automatic arima modeling function in forecast package in R that uses information criterion(example: AIC/BIC) to select best ARIMA model. I was attempting to answer a question in this site. I used the data series from the above referenced question and also can be downloaded here http://ge.tt/1uihVfA2/v/0?c . The plot is shown below. Eyeballing the series I find that there is an outlier at 2012:03 or observation 101. So I used tsoutlier package to create an additive outlier, a binary coded variable for the series (135 obs). Below is the code for reproduciblity. datats When I apply auto.arima to the outlier adjusted series using xreg, I get following results. Series: datats ARIMA(0,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: intercept AO101 17253973.7 34441489 s.e. 842995.3 10137415 sigma^2 estimated as 9.503e+13: log likelihood=-2364.06 AIC=4734.12 AICc=4734.3 BIC=4742.84 I was really surprised by the above results, clearly the data is seasonal and has structure in it, however the auto.arima chose "no model". This seems to be a poor model selection. Below are my questions: Am I doing something incorrect ? I'm assuming I did something egregiously incorrect here. May be someone can correct my flaw in the modeling process. If not, then I have 2 more questions. Is auto.arima algorithm unable to handle binary coded variable for outlier correction Is this is a flaw/limitation in using AIC (Information criteria in general) for ARIMA model selection for time series with external regressors.
