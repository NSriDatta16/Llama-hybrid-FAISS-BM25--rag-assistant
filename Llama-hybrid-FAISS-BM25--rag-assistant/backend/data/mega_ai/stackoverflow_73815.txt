For my projects, I use a combination of 1, 2, & 4. If it's really important data, you need to have multiple copies in multiple places. My important data is replicated to 3-4 locations every night. If you want a simpler solution, I recommend you get an online storage account from a well known provider which has an insured reliability guarantee. If you are worried about security, only upload data inside TrueCrypt encrypted archives. As far as cost, it will probably be pricey... But if it's really that important the cost is nothing.
