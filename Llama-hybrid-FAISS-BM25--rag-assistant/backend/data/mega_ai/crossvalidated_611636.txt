No, even when we assume a single data generating process and even when it's a very simple data generating process, it's quite possible for predictive models to be very different from models estimating the effect of a specific variable. Suppose we have a very simple data generating process x~Bernoulli(0.5) z where all the arrows represent truly causal relationships. Under this data generating process, y is independent of x given z , so the best predictive model is y~z . If we put x in this model it would have a coefficient of 0. x is not predictive . However, if we want to estimate the effect of x on y , this effect is not zero. Individuals with x==1 have higher y than those with x==0 , by 1 unit on average, and this is causal. We need to fit the model y~x and not the model y~z or y~x+z to estimate the effect of x on y . If you constructed a model describing the full data-generating process, you could derive both the best predictive model y~z and the best model for the effect of x , y~x from it. These models are different , and they would be different whether or not you knew the exact data-generating process.
