Time series analysis with recurring event (python)

I Have a vector of n values and I have event that occurs occasionally throughout this vector. So I have V1 = [300, 120, 450, 700, 880, 400, 100, 60, 44, 91] and the indexes of the start and end of the event. So indexes = [(2,4)] means that the event start at position #2 (when the value was 450) and ended at 4 (when the value was 880). I want to check if there is a significance difference in v1 when event happens, meaning wether [450, 700, 880] has different distribution and higher mean then the rest of v1. What is the best way to do this?
