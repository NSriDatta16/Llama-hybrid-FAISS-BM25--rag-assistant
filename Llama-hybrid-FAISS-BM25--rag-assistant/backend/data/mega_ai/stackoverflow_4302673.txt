It appears that jQuery does not manage to resolve the child selector (“parent > child”), thus both "$track" and "$drag" are set to undefined values: $track = $('>.jScrollPaneTrack', $container); $drag = $('>.jScrollPaneTrack .jScrollPaneDrag', $container); As a result, the scrollbar does not initialize, and simply does nothing Replacing the previous lines with a "dumbed down" version fixes the issue: $track = $container.children(".jScrollPaneTrack"); $drag = $track.children(".jScrollPaneDrag");
