Determining the consistency of two measurements

Suppose there are two independent measurements, $x_1 \pm \sigma_1$ and $x_2 \pm \sigma_2$, both of which purport to measure the same underlying quantity $X$ (which is apriori unknown). For simplicity, we can take these to be Gaussian distributed measurements (but I'd like to be a bit more general if possible). In the frequentist framework, how does one assess the consistency (or otherwise) of these measurements? That is, how does one make quantitative statements about whether the data are indeed consistent with measuring the same quantity $X$? Of course, intuitively, for $x_1$ and $x_2$ which are far apart (relative to something like $\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2}$), we would like to say they become less and less consistent. I understand how to approach this problem from a Bayesian perspective: evaluate the Bayesian evidence for two models, one in which the measurements are derived from the same underlying quantity $X$, and one in which they are generated by different underlying quantities ($X_1$ and $X_2$, say). Of course this requires specification of priors on $X$, $X_1$ and $X_2$ (and also priors on the two models). Attempted solution Define a null hypothesis in which they do indeed come from the same underlying quantity $X$. Calculate the probability $p(X) = p_1(X)p_2(X)$ of observing 'more extreme' measurements under this model. This can be done analytically for Gaussian distributed measurements, yielding a product of two complementary error functions. The answer is a function of the true (unknown apriori) $X$. Should one then pick the maximum likelihood $\hat{X}$, plug this into $p(\hat{X})$ and compare that p-value to some threshold $\alpha = 0.05$ (say)? This $\hat{X}$ is in general different from the $X$ which maximises $p(X)$. Thanks!
