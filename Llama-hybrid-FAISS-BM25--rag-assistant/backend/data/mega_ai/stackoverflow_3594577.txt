Organize my domain objects in DDD while using ado entity framework

I have these 2 types of Users: Parents and Kids, both are Users, and have the same properties, but different methods. I Created Base User class and 2 class: Parent And Kid, both inherit form User base class, and each class have some different methods. User class is partial class, because the entity framework model has the same class because the database has just Users table, no parents or kids. Now, when i create an object from Parent class, and try to insert in the database using ado entity framework " AddObject("Users", (User)_parent) " it give me an error that i am inserting parent and that there is nothing with this identity to insert. So, is my domain driven design has something wrong or i should edit something in the entity framework?
