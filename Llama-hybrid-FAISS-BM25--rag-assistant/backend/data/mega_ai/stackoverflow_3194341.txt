The simpliest way to solve your problem is to go back to Extension Maganer, select your extension, choose "Edit in Kickstarter" from the dropdown menu, and then select the corresponding Frontend plugin to edit it's properties. Check the first checkbox which means that you want your plugins to be rendered as USER_INT cObjects. After that click the View result button, uncheck all custom PHP files (your own code, like modules and plugins) on the right side and click the WRITE button. Please be careful. If you don't uncheck the checkboxes of your own files, they will be overwritten with dummy files.
