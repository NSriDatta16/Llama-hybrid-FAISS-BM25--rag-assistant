You want a Morton code . It interleaves the bits of each dimension to help keep similar values together. It's often done for 2 and 3D, but it works for any dimension. Express each of the D values as binary word of B bits, then interleave the bits to form a new D*B bit long number. That's your lookup table number. If you want a smaller number, discard lower bits to get fewer bins. An even better (but much more annoying to compute) function is a multidimensional Hilbert curve mapping. This is very difficult to work with in practice, but it does have pretty much the best indexing locality you can get.
