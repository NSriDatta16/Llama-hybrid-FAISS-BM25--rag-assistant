I would highly recommend two printed references on these subjects: Advanced Compiler Design & Implementation by Steven S. Muchnick Building an Optimizing Compiler by Robert Morgan The Muchnick book is on the formal side but is very readable and has good descriptions of all of the important optimization techniques. The Morgan book has a much more hands-on feel and would be a great basis for a compiler project focused on optimization techniques. Neither book has much to say about lexical analysis or parsing, knowledge of these subjects is assumed.
