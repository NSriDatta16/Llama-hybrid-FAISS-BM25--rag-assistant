nant directory::exists returns false even though directory exists

I'm trying to check for if a directory exists as part of a NAnt script and getting a false negative. Here is the script fragment: ${directory::exists('${backup.dir}')}"/> Here is the output: [echo] D:\D\RTC\backup\20110223 --> False Except the directory exists. As a side note if I run.. ${directory::get-creation-time('${backup.dir}')}"/> I get the following error: Expression: ${backup.dir} --> ${directory::get-creation-time('${backup.dir}')} ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Could not find a part of the path "D:\D\RTC\${backup.dir}". AND if I run.. ${path::get-directory-name('${backup.dir}')}"/> I get [echo] Directory Name --> All in all I'm very confused right now.. Any thoughts?
