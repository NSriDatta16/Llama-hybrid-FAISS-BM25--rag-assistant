No, the resource editor is not a good tool for this. In a WPF application the best way is to put all of your images in an "Images" directory and mark each one as a "Resource". Then you can reference them directly in Image controls and elsewhere. Here are the precise steps: Crop and otherwise adjust your images using your favorite bitmap editing program (Paint.NET, Photoshop, etc) Save them as .png files (or .jpg or .gif if you prefer) Create an "Images" folder inside your Visual Studio solution (or multiple folders, however you want to organize it) Drag the images from your hard disk into your "Images" folder (or right-click the project, select New -> Existing Item and select the images) Now you can reference your images easily in XAML: Or in code: var source = (BitmapSource)Application.LoadComponent( new Uri("Images/MyImage.png", UriKind.Relative)); You can also reference images in external assemblies: Which in code would be: var source = (BitmapSource)Application.LoadComponent( new Uri("ReferencedAssembly;v1.0.0.1;component/Images/MyImage.png", UriKind.Relative));
