This depends on how are you reading the file and how do you plan to show errors. Using IAE is better if you also plan to construct the class programatically. Using JSR-303 is better when you also use it with JavaEE 6. Also, you must think if your user needs to know the error line number. And remember: the first (pure-POJO) way ensures that no object will ever be inconsistent (marshalling or unmarshalling), while JSR-303 requires someone to call the validation functions (as well as requiring the framework classes in classpath).
