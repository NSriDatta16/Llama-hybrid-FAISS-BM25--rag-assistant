How to get the record with the same values except primary key

Suppose the records in database are as below: Id FirstName LastName OrderPrice 1 Tom Hanks 123 2 Tom Hanks 173 3 Tom Hanks 123 4 Tom Bob 123 5 Robert Hanks 123 Given Input : Id = 1 Expected OUtput : Id = 3 I know that I can write some thing like below Declare @Id as INT = 1 Declare @FirstName as varchar(100) Declare @LastName as varchar(100) Declare @OrderPrice as INT Select @FirstName = FirstName, @LastName = LastName , @OrderPrice = OrderPrice From Customers Where Id= @ID Select ID From Customers Where FirstName = @FirstName and LastName = @LastName and OrderPrice = @OrderPrice But, I do not want to write some thing like where I should mention all the columns names in where condition. Because actually the record I was working on contains almost 100 columns in it. So, I was asked not to use a query some thing like this. Can any one help me how to do this?
