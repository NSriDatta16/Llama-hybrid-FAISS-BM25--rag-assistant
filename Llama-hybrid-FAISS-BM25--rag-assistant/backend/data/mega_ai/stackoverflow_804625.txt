Include files should be thought of as header files, you really only want to use them to declare common variables, etc that you need to share between multiple .wxs files. My project uses ~10 .wxs files and a single .wxi that I define the product code, upgrade code, etc in. For a better idea of what I'm talking about check out the SO questions Wix Tricks & Best Practices and WiX Includes vs. Fragments as well, as always, the documentation in Wix.chm
