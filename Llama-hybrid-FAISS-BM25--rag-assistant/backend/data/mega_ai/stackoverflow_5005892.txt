If you want to access data by some key, an RDBMS would be the logical option. It is often the case that data grows with age and changes to the point of requiring different types of search. Often times data is dumped into text files, but the location of said files or the format of said data gets forgotten. A database helps with this by centralizing the (location of the) data and via a schema definition that helps define the format and content of the data. As an added bonus, you get built in query functionality to help with searching and the fact that if the DB is managed properly it becomes stable storage that can survive anything from hard drive failures to entire site failures.
