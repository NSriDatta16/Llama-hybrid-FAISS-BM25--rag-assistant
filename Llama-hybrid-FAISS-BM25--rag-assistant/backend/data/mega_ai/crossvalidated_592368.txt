How to update Neural Net Parameters on fresh new data

[ I asked this earlier on DS SE: here but the question didn't receive sufficient attention there. I ask it here because I'm looking for a practical answer with some theoretical justification. ] I have a large dataset $D_1$ . I have a Feed-forward deep Neural Network $N$ , with hidden layers, that I trained on $D_1$ , using MSE Loss and standard back-propagation and obtained the parameters. Now, I know the network architecture and the learned parameters. Next, I obtained a new batch of data, $D_2$ - it is a large dataset similar to $D_1$ . I want to again learn the parameters of $N$ , as though I had trained it from scratch on $D_1 \cup D_2$ , but only by training on $D_2$ and using the earlier known parameters on $D_1$ . Is this some standard problem? How can I do this? I can obtain basic info about $D_1$ such as size of the dataset; but training is expensive.
