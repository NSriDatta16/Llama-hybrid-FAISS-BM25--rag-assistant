If you plot(res.hc) you can see the tree is highly unbalanced and thus when you specify a cut of two, one is making the cut at the first branching point. In this case the tree has a single branch on one side of the tree at the first break, thus providing your second result. Compare that plot with plot(pam.res, labels=3) where the PAM method is taking more of average approach so neither cluster is a particular good fit. As one increases the number of clusters with the PAM it will become more and more similar to the hclust method with more cuts (cutting at lower heights). The extreme points from the hclust are still the extreme points from the PAM cluster. PAM is merging them into 2 cluster while the hclust would have separated them into about 6 or 7 clusters.
