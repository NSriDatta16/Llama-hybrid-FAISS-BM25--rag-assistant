SQL Agent Jobs, how to document

I want to end up with a sort of Calendar that shows the different scheduled jobs and their steps (the exact command executed). But I"m having a hard time finding all the data. So my question is two-fold: 1) Does anyone know of a software (preferably open source or free) that can get this data from sql server 2000 in a spreadsheet or other easy to manipulate format? 2) Can anyone help me with the queries I'd need to get this data. How are SQL Agent Jobs organized in the database? Any guidance on this issue would be welcome.
