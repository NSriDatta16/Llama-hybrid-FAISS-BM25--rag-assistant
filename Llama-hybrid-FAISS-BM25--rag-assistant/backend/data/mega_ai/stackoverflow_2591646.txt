How to set a filter for an estimated maximum price

I cannot figure out how to set an estimated maximum price for a collection of records. What I want to avoid is to simply use SQL MAX, because maybe there are records with exorbitant prices. For example, in the "computers-hardware" category of OLX ( http://www.olx.com/computers-hardware-cat-240 ) the filter for maximum price is estimately set to $1400, but sorting by price, the first items are above $10000 Maybe they calculated the average and then estimated some maximum price... what do you think?
