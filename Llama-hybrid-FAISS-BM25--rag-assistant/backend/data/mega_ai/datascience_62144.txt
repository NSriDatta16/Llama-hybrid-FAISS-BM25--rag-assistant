Data anonymization in Python

I am working on an industrial project which consists of real data. Now, the data contains sensitive information about company operations which could not be disclosed publically. As a result, I need to anonymize the original data first before implementing the machine learning algorithms. `The data anonymization includes: changing the names of persons, places, geographical locations, etc. I would like to know what are the best practices for anonymizing datasets? Ideally, I should be able to get the original data back after performing analysis on the anonymized dataset. I went through the literature and looked over some answered questions. They all are based on cybersecurity aspects like encryption and decryption algorithms . I am not familiar with cybersecurity algorithms. Is there any way to slightly change the data without digging into cybersecurity algorithms?
