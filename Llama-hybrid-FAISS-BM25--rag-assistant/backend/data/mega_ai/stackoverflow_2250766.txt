How Symfony did its command alias?

Apologies my french english ... I would like to create an alias in Windows XP cmd, like Symfony. This code works perfectly, but resets every system boot : doskey kCLI= php C:\wamp\www\KinkamaCLI\KinkamaCLI.php I tryed to put a .bat in "start" folder, but I think it's not beautifull, and I feel it doesn't work, because I can't see the generate batch file : echo doskey kCLI= php C:\wamp\www\KinkamaCLI\KinkamaCLI.php >> C:\Documents and Settings\sartois\Menu Démarrer\Programmes\Démarrage\kCLI.bat I would to create a permanent alias. Enter : kCLI my-command-here And not : php C:\wamp\www\KinkamaCLI\KinkamaCLI.php my-command-here
