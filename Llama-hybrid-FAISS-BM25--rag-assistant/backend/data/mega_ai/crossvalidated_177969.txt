If you want to know if there is some particular number of meetings that has a huge effect then I suggest using a regression with a restricted cubic spline of the number of meetings as the independent variable. If the dependent variable is retained/not retained then this should be a logistic regression which is not in PROC GLM in SAS. I don't use SPSS though and, in any case, questions about how to do something in particular software packages is off topic here. But look for logistic regression with splines of the IV.
