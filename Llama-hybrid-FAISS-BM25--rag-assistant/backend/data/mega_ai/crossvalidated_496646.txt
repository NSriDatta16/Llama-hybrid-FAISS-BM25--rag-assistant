Markov transition matrix row sums to 1

I am trying to learn a little bit of Markov Chains through Dobrow's "Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R", but i am struggling with the following: The entries of every Markov transition matrix P are nonnegative, and each row sums to 1 . I am trying to understand why the rows sum to 1. The author argues as follows: $$ \sum_{j} P_{i j}=\sum_{j} P\left(X_{1}=j \mid X_{0}=i\right)=\sum_{j} \frac{P\left(X_{1}=j, X_{0}=i\right)}{P\left(X_{0}=i\right)} $$ Finally, since ( I can't figure out the first equality below ) $$ \sum_{j} \frac{P\left(X_{1}=j, X_{0}=i\right)}{P\left(X_{0}=i\right)}=\frac{P\left(X_{0}=i\right)}{P\left(X_{0}=i\right)}=1 $$ the results follows. What have i tried so far? Since $$ P\left(X_{1}=j \mid X_{0}=i\right)P\left(X_{0}=i\right) = P\left(X_{1}=j, X_{0}=i\right) $$ we have that: $$\sum_{j} \frac{P\left(X_{1}=j, X_{0}=i\right)}{P\left(X_{0}=i\right)} = \sum_{j} P\left(X_{1}=j \mid X_{0}=i\right)$$ and the last sum should equal 1, but i cannot argue as to why that is true. I am afraid i am missing something simple. Observations: $P_{ij} = P\left(X_{1}=j \mid X_{0}=i\right)$ and the Markov Chain is discrete and time-homogeneous. Can someone help? Thanks in advance, Lucas
