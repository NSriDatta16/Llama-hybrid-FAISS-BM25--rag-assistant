Instead of having the default values 'hard wired' into the javascript section of your page, why not embed php fragments into the javascript, so that the values are generated dynamically from values stored on the server side. When you pass the updated javascript values to the php, save them somewhere so that they can be used the next time the page is generated. I'm not a php developer, so I don't know the syntax off the top of my head, but here goes... . . . var clientVariable = . . . I hope you get the general idea.
