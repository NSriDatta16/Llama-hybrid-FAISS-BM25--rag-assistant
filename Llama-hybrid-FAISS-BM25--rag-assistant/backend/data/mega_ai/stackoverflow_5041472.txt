In v2, modules are the preferred way organize the cmdlets, providers, functions, aliases, and other commands that you create. You don't install a module. You simply import a module into the PowerShell session using Import-Module cmdlet. AFAIK, a PowerShell snapin is more of a v1 approach. There are still a few teams at MS creating snapins instead of modules. For example, SharePoint 2010 cmdlets. PowerShell snapins are binaries (.dll) that implement cmdlets and providers. You need to install a snapin and then add the cmdlets in the snapin to a PowerShell session using Add-PSSnapin cmdlet.
