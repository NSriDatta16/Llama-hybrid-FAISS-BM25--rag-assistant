Sequential models, changepoint detection and analysis is an entire class of methods, kind of unto themselves. Developed by Abraham Wald who published a wonderful, intuitive book titled Sequential Analysis in 1947, it's kind of languished in Op Res departments ever since. It has only been in recent years with Google's adoption of SPRT tests (sequential probability ratio tests) that it has emerged or come into its own. Recent publications include last year's Sequential Analysis by Alexander Tartakovsky -- a comprehensive look at the field. http://www.amazon.com/Sequential-Analysis-Hypothesis-Changepoint-Probability/dp/1439838208/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1445907717&sr=8-3&keywords=wald+sequential+analysis In addition, last June Columbia co-sponsored a 3-day workshop about it... https://sites.google.com/site/iwsm2015/committees-and-sponsers The OP's query is concerned with obtaining "suggestions" for what is clearly a question about changepoint detection in a time series. It deserves a more specific answer than "look within these references as there is sure to be a solution for your concern," but that will have to do for now. I'm interested in what others have to say.
