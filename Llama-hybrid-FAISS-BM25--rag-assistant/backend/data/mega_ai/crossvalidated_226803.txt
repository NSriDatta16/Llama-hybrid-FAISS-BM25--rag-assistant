What is the proper way to use rfImpute? (Imputation by Random Forest in R)

Is it right to use rfImpute to impute missing feature values on the whole data set and then use other regression/classification techniques on the new data set created? Or, is an rfImpute model intended to be fitted on a subset of the data and then that fitted model is somehow used to fill in missing values in the rest of the data? To be clear, I only bring up these questions because rfImpute seems to require arguments for both X (features) and y (target variable). In addition, y cannot have any missing values. Does this mean that y gets used for the imputation of the features? Wouldn't this be harmful later when trying to fit models to the new imputed data set? Obviously the y values we are trying to predict in the future won't be known, so how could rfImpute fit into a machine learning pipeline?
