If you use R you can easily produce prediction intervals for the predictions of a random forests regression: Just use the package quantregForest (available at CRAN ) and read the paper by N. Meinshausen on how conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests and how they can be used to build prediction intervals. Very informative even if you don't work with R!
