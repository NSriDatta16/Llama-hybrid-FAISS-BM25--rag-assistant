Detect a bot in a audit log

I need to develop a report that will show automated queries in an audit log of queries on a system of the company. The logs have this fashion: query_id id query_time 1 1 2018-02-01 00:09:02 2 1 2018-02-01 00:24:55 3 1 2018-02-01 00:58:55 4 1 2018-02-01 01:01:49 5 1 2018-02-01 01:05:42 6 1 2018-02-01 01:18:56 Where query_id is an index of the query, the id is who has queried and query_time is the time of the query. I tried to make the difference between the time of the queries and count how much was less than 60 seconds, but don't make the job. One other way is see the periodicity of the queries. I was thinking if there was a better way to do this. Maybe something using time series. There is some technique that could identify a query bot?
