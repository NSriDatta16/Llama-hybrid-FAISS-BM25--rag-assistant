Silverlight 4 DataBinding: Binding to ObservableCollection not working anymore

Upgrading from SL3 -> SL4. First problem: this throws a parser exception: (same with x:Name) Collection is ObservableCollection . Worked fine in SL3. So it seems that SL4 doen't allow binding to the Name property. Huh? So: changed to ... since I just need to ID the control in code behind. So here's the bug ('cuz this has got to be a bug!): In this frag, AllAvailableItems is an ObservableCollection : In the code behind, I use a recursive function to find the Dependency object with either the Name or Tag property provided: public static T FindVisualChildByName (DependencyObject parent, string name, DependencyProperty propToUse) where T : DependencyObject { for (int i = 0; i (child, name, propToUse); if (result != null) return result; } } return null; } OK, get this: in the code behind, I can get the control that is ORDERED FIRST in the XAML! In other words, if I put the CheckBox first, I can retrieve the CheckBox, but no StackPanel. And vice-versa. This all worked fine in SL3. Any help, ideas ... ? Thanks - Kurt
