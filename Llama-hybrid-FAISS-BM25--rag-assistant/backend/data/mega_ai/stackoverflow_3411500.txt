Hex dump parsing in perl

I have a hex dump of a message in a file which i want to get it in an array so i can perform the decoding logic on it. I was wondering if that was a easier way to parse a message which looks like this. 37 39 30 35 32 34 35 34 3B 32 31 36 39 33 34 35 3B 32 31 36 39 33 34 36 00 00 01 08 40 00 00 15 6C 71 34 34 73 69 6D 31 5F 33 30 33 31 00 00 00 00 00 01 28 40 00 00 15 74 65 6C 63 6F 72 64 69 74 65 6C 63 6F 72 64 69 Note that the data can be max 16 bytes on any row. But any row can contain fewer bytes too (minimum :1 ) Is there a nice and elegant way rather than to read 2 chars at a time in perl ?
