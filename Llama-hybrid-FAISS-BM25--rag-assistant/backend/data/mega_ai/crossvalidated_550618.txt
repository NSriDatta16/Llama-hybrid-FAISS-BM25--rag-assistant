Expanding range of data (for PCA)

I am interested in computing 5 indices of structural connectivity between 116 different brain regions, and their associations with behavioural performance. I plan on using prinicipal component analysis (PCA) on these structural connectivity measures to find components (i.e., connectivity profiles) capturing maximal variance. My concern is that 4 out of 5 of my structural connectivity measures have extremely limited range (this is the nature of the indices that I am working with; nothing to do with the data acquisition quality). For example, the range for 4 of these measures is .0005 to .0015. Even when I z-score this data relative to the group mean, the majority of values cluster between .2-.6 z-score. I'm concerned that the nature of the data is such that there is just not enough variance and dynamic range that can be picked up by the PCA, or that any correlations will be severely underestimated. Are there any methods (e.g., logarithmic expansions) that I can use to expand/increase the dynamic range of this data or any suggestions on alternate approaches to handling such data with extremely limited range?
