We addressed this problem in our 2011 vanilla Rao-Blackwellisation paper . The limiting distribution of the unique simulations in the Metropolis-Hastings sequence is associated with the density $$\tilde\pi(x)\propto\pi(x)\bar{\alpha}(x)\quad\text{where}\quad\bar{\alpha}(x)=\int_{\mathcal X}\alpha(x,y)q(y|x)\,\text{d}y$$ if $\pi(\cdot)$ is the original target of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm $\alpha(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability $q(\cdot|\cdot)$ is the Metropolis-Hastings proposal or kernel (In the above excerpt from the paper, $\mathfrak z_i$ denotes the $i$ th accepted value in the MCMC chain and $\mathfrak n_i$ the number of times it is repeated in the MCMC chain.)
