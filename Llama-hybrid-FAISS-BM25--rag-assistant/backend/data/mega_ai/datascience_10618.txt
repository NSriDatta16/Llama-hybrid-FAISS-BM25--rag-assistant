How can I use idh and random when I use hupossion in mcmcglmm?

Here is my problem: I need to use hupossion in MCMCglmm package. Here is my prior: > prior = list(R = list(V = diag(2), nu = 0.002), + G = list(G1 = list(V = diag(10), nu = 0.002), + G2 = list(V = 1, nu = 0.002))) and here is my training: > myTrain There are 5 levels in the attribute pipematerialroup1. I know sth must be wrong with the prior. I got the following information: Error in MCMCglmm(pipenumyearnosameday ~ trait - 1 + at.level(trait, 1):lastyearnumnosameday + : prior$G has the wrong number of structures there is one more thing I need to say: myPredict This is my prediction part when I just take pipematerialgroup1 as random effect. If combine pipematerialgroup1 and installyeargroup1, what this prediction would be? Can someone help me get the prior right? Thanks a lot.
