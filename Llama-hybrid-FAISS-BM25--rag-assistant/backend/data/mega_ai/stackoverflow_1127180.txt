Dojo Drag and drop: how to format a dropped item?

I'm using Dojo trying to build an application with dojo's dnd. I've looked around for an answer to this problem but I'm just not sure how to accomplish this. I have a Source object in which there are a bunch of products formatted with html/css in a certain way. When I drag these objects to my Target object, the dropped item still looks the same as before. I want to format it differently after being dropped. Any ideas how to do this?
