You have the answer in your question: Lambert-W. In R you can use # Load library library(LambertW) # Define function to obtain p from mu p to obtain In Mathematica you can use data = Table[{1 - Exp[(1/mu) + ProductLog[-1, -1/(mu Exp[1/mu])]], mu}, {mu, 1.01, 5, 0.01}]; cp = -1/Log[1 - p]; ListPlot[{data, Table[{p, cp p/(1 - p)}, {p, 0.1, 0.93, 0.01}]}, PlotStyle -> {{PointSize[0.03]}, {PointSize[0.01]}}] (Mathematica was used to determine the general form of the relationship for determining $p$ from $\mu$.)
