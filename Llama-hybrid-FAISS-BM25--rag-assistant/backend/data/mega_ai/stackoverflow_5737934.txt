Get a link to a Google Doc with Zend

Hey there - I'm using Zend Framework with Gdata to handle the Google Docs API. I've got it modified to use V3 so we can upload and manage pdf's from a web interface. We have a custom class gDataClient that sets up the Gdata_Docs service, Gdata_ClientLogin, and creates a new Gdata_Docs object. On the page I'm working with, here's the relevant code: $gDoc = & new gDataClient($agentGid, $agentGpw); $something = $gDoc->GetDoc('mydocID','pdf'); print_r($something->content->src); This generates a direct link to the document, but when I click it I get a 401 (Authentication Required) even though I've already created and authenticated the client. Any ideas?
