Easy way to generate web service clients in Java WITHOUT using Axis

I've always used the web service generation in Eclipse WTP to build my web service clients due to it's relative easy of use. However, in the last couple years, as I've learned more about it I've seen the error of my ways. I've read that one should use one of the plethora of other java web service client platforms such as CXF, Metro, etc. At this point, I don't particularly care which platform I use - so long as it is not Axis. My question is - the WTP tooling makes it easy to generate web service clients in java. Are there any similar tools, scripts, programs or tutorials that are of similar ease of use? I don't really have time to learn all the intricacies of SOAP, RPC, etc. so please keep in mind that I'm not really trying to be lazy so much as I am pragmatic. Thanks in advance.
