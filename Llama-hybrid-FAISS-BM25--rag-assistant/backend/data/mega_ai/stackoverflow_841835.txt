The Old New Thing takes on this one I think the basic idea of randomly partition the set recursively on the way down and concatenate the results on the way up will work (It will average O(n*log n) binary decisions and that is darn close to log2(fact(n)) but q-sort will not be sure to do that with a random predicate. BTW I think the same argument and issues can be said for any O(n*log n) sort strategy.
