The time features of KML are well documented and include time span. I would recommend that you try using both vector and image based methods depending on how close in the user is zoomed: When the user is zoomed out (small scale) lots of cells will need to be drawn, making it more efficient to use an image. The PNGs could be packaged up in a kmz file, which is just a zipped directory. When the user is zoomed in close (large scale) fewer cells will need to be drawn making vector the most efficient method. Google Earth can plot a large number of vectors, without much trouble but there are limits. Google Earth is fantastic as a General Purpose viewer which is very very user friendly. However, the time series tools are more complicated so it will depend on the sophistication of your users. How applicable it is to your project depends on the type of data you have and the sort of output you want. You may get better results using flash.
