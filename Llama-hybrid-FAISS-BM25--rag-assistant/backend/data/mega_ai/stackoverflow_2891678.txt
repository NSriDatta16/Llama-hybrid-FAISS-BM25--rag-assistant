Have you tried using morphological techniques? Closure-by-reconstruction (as presented in Gonzalez, Woods and Eddins ) can be used to create a grayscale representation of background illumination levels. You can more-or-less standardize the effective illumination by: 1) Calculating the mean intensity of all the pixels in the image 2) Using closure-by-reconstruction to estimate background illumination levels 3) Subtract the output of (2) from the original image 4) Adding the mean intensity from (1) to every pixel in the output of (3). Basically what closure-by-reconstruction does is remove all image features that are smaller than a certain size, erasing the "foreground" (the text you want to capture) and leaving only the "background" (illumination levels) behind. Subtracting the result from the original image leaves behind only small-scale deviations (the text). Adding the original average intensity to those deviations is simply to make the text readable, so that the resulting picture looks like a light-normalized version of the original image.
