What is the best software for neural network analysis?

I need to fit a neural network to my data. I used SPSS 21, but I think it's model summary isn't sufficient. I also used R (nnet & neuralnet), it has a poor report and I can't find a good model summary for it. The last one is NeuroSolutions, I used it. very bad! I can't run a model. What are those graphical icons in it's window after bulding model? You say! What's your advice for Neural Network Analysis?
