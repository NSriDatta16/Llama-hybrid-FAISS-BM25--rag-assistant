This will depend on your compiler and platform. As far as I know, there is no way to enforce this in a completely cross-compiler and cross-platform manner, without defining lots of macros of your own. However, both VC++ and GCC (the big two) support the #pragma pack directive, which will allow you to define the alignment and packing for your struct. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2e70t5y1.aspx or http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Structure_002dPacking-Pragmas.html . With that in mind, you can use #pragma pack to define how your structure is aligned, then fread() or similar to simply blit the bytes from the file to memory. You may want to prefix the list with the list length so that you can allocate the memory for the whole list at once, then load the entire file using a single I/O call.
