Java profiling: java.lang.Object.hashCode takes half of the CPU time but never explictly called

I have been benchmarked my multihreaded program using -agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples and was surprised to find the following line in the results: rank self accum count trace method 1 52.88% 52.88% 8486 300050 java.lang.Object.hashCode I never explicitly call hashCode() in my program. What can be the reason for this? How can I understand the source for this time "waste" and whether it is normal or not? Thanks, David
