It's NOT safe, this is why you have the " Verify Fields " and " Not Verifying the Signature " paragraphs in the Advanced Registration document: When you request facebook data, we verify the form fields before packaging them up in the signed_request . This lets you assume that all the data is genuine and saves you from having to verify things. The one problem that could arise, is a smart attacker could change the form fields and submit them to you, thereby giving you unverified data. Read that document for more information, I've also wrote a tutorial (an introduction about the plugin) and showed how to handle the fields attribute coming from client-side.
