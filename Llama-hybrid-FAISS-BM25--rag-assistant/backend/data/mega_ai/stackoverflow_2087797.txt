Touch events with Magic Mouse and iPhone Simulator

I observe that with the iMac magic mouse, while using the iPhone simulator, if: a) the active view has an object in the center of the iPhone screen which is capable of generating touch events, and b) the iMac operator accidentally or otherwise drags their finger(s) across the magic mouse surface in a way which would normally be used for scrolling, that the object in the center generates (bogus) mouse down and drag events. If there is no such object in the center of the screen, there is no issue. Is there a way to programmatically or otherwise disable this feature?
