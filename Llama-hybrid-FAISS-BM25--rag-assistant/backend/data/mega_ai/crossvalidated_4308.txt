Is it possible to apply Bayes Theorem with only samples from the prior?

I was just wondering-- is it possible/practical to apply bayes' theorem without an analytical expression for the prior, only samples? For example, say you have sufficient draws from a posterior distribution from a previous experiment via MCMC methods, and you'd like to use that posterior as the prior for a new one. You have an analytical expression for the likelihood as before, but now only samples from the (new) prior. How would you proceed?
