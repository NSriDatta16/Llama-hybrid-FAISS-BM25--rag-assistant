Windows Mobile Memory Leak Issue

All, I currently have a phone from a customer who experienced various issue while running our windows mobile application. This issue is that the phone eventually resets completely while running the application. I have this in house to do some testing and I haven't experienced the reset, but I do notice that program memory is dropping significantly while running through the forms. We do have a slight memory leak in out application that we have been trying to narrow down, but nothing to this magnitude. Eventually the application just drops out of program memory, but it seems as though not all the memory is released. Program memory doesn't go back up to what it was originally. They have installed some third party applications, such as VicSoft ClearTemp, but this applications seems to just remove temporary files to keep the storage memory low. The phones in question are Sprint 6800 Windows Mobile 6.0 profressional. The application is written in the .NET 2.0 Compact Framework. We do have an issue where the application is dropping out of memory which is still an ongoing issue, and this seems to be happening randomly. THis issue seems to be directly memory related, but maybe the two are working hand in hand causing the crash. Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated. Steve
