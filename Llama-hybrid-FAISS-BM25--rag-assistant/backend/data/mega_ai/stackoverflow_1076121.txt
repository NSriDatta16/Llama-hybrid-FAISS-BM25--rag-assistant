There should be a library for PHP to generate these IDs. If not, it's not difficult to implement it. The advantage is that later you won't have name conflicts, when you try to reorganize or merge different server resources. With numeric ids you would have to change some of them to resolve conflicts and that will result in Url change leading to SEO hit.
