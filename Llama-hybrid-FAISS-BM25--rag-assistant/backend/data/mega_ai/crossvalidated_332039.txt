non-linear logistic regression

I have the non-linear logistic regression model $$ \text{logit}\Pr(Y=1|X_1,X_2,)=X_1X_2\frac{1}{m(2+\theta)TD_{50}}+X_1\frac{\theta }{m(2+\theta) TD_{50}}-\frac{1}{m} $$ which I will like to estimate $m$, $\theta$ and $TD_{50}$ in R say. Note that in a prediction setting this is just a glm. But because I will want estimates for each of the parameters, the problem becomes non-linear. Is there a simple way to fit this without writting my own estimating equations?
