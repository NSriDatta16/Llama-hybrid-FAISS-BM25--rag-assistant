Just to add to the excellent answers by Adrian and Noah, there is the residual question of: how to establish which of the three sets of variables given above should be conditioned on. Fist let's recap how the backdoor criterion is applied to this particular DAG, which I'm reposting here: Usually we are interested in the "average causal effect" (ACE) which is the expected increase of $Y$ for a unit change in $X$ . This means that we must allow all causal paths between $X \rightarrow Y$ to remain open but we must block any backdoor paths from $Y \rightarrow X$ What makes this DAG quite intriguing is that $U_3$ appears to be a confounder for $X \rightarrow Y$ but is also a collider (having 2 direct causes, $U_1$ and $U_2$ ). So a simplistic approach would be to say that we need to condition on it to block the backdoor path $Y \leftarrow U_3 \rightarrow X$ ) but then we don't want to condition on it, because that will open up the backdoor path $Y \leftarrow U_2 \rightarrow U_3 \leftarrow U_1 \rightarrow X$ . This is easily resolved by blocking that path by additionally conditioining on either $U_2$ or $U_1$ , or indeed both. Thus we have arrived at the 3 candidate adjustment sets $\lbrace U_1, U_3\rbrace$ , $\lbrace U_2, U_3\rbrace$ and $\lbrace U_1, U_2, U_3\rbrace$ . All 3 sets will give us an unbiased estimate of the causal effect, so how do we choose between them ? We could reject the larger set $\lbrace U_1, U_2, U_3\rbrace$ on two grounds. First model parsimony. Second $U_2$ and $U_3$ are correlated and this correlation could be very high leading to instabilty in the estimation procedure that is used to fit the model. If they are not highly corrrelated then we might still consider this set, but with the additional considerations as below: we choose the set which gives us the most precise estimate of the causal effect - in a multivariable regression model this would be the estimate with the smallest standard error. $\lbrace U_2, U_3\rbrace$ will yield the most precise estimate because conditional on them, $U_1$ is an instrument and therefore should not be adjusted for. Adjusting for $U_2$ would reduce the residual variance of $Y$ more than adjusting for $U_1$ would. Thanks to Noah for pointing this out in the comments. Here is a monte carlo simulation in R of this DAG that demonstrates this: set.seed(15) nsim % summary() %>% coef() se_1[i] % summary() %>% coef() se_2[i] As we can see, conditioning on $U_2$ gives consistently lower standard errors than conditioning on $U_1$
