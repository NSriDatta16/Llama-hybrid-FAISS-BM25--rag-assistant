Unit testing with generated DAL code

I use a code generator (CodeSmith with .NetTiers template) to generate all the DAL code. I write unit tests for my code (business layer), and these tests are becoming pretty slow to run. The problem is that for each test, I reset the database to have a clean state. Also, as I do a lot of tests, it seems that the latency of the database operations sum up to a pretty bit delay. All DB operations are performed through a DataRepository class that is generated by .NetTiers. Do you know if there is a way to generate (or code myself) a mock-DataRepository that would use in-memory storage instead of using the database ? This way, I would be able to use this mock repository in my unit tests, speeding them a lot, without actually changing anything to my current code !
