In iTextSharp, can we set the vertical position of the pdfwriter?

I've recently started using iTextSharp to generate PDF reports from data. It works quite nicely. In one particular report, I need a section to always appear at the bottom of the page. I'm using the PdfContentByte to create a dashed line 200f from the bottom: cb.MoveTo(0f, 200f); cb.SetLineDash(8, 4, 0); cb.LineTo(doc.PageSize.Width, 200f); cb.Stroke(); Now I'd like to insert content below that line. However, (as expected) the PdfContentByte methods don't change the vertical position of the PdfWriter. New paragraphs, for example, appear earlier in the page. // appears wherever my last content was, NOT below the dashed line doc.Add(new Paragraph("test", _myFont)); Is there some way to instruct the pdfwriter that I'd like to advance the vertical position to below the dashed line now, and continue inserting content there? There is a GetVerticalPosition() method -- it'd be nice if there was a corresponding Setter :-). // Gives me the vertical position, but I can't change it var pos = writer.GetVerticalPosition(false); So, is there any way to set the writer's position by hand? Thanks!
