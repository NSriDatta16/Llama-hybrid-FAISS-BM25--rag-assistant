If there is high similarity in your dataset and pretained model dataset and If you have large amount of training samples, fine tune all layers of neural network model If you have small number of training samples,fine tune last few layers of model If similarity between your dataset and pretrained model dataset is low and If you have large number of training samples, fine tune all layers or train the model from scratch. If you have small number of training samples, it is difficult to get good model performance. you can select a less complex network and train it with heavily augmented data or acquire more data.
