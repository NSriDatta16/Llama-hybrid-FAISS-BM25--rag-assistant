Embedding Verdana in a dynamic text field, need to make it bold - do I have to buy Verdana Bold?

First off, I don't have a copy of Verdana bold. It's no where on my hd and I don't know the first thing about making fonts so that is out of the question. I've been searching for a couple of hours now and it seems the tried and true solution is to embed multiple versions of the font off the stage. Ridiculous. Right? In either case, I am pleading to all you Flash Jedi out there to please tell me there is another way? I refuse to turn to the dark side.
