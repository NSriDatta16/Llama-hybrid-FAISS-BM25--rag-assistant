Data analysis for two groups?

I have a data set for two groups i.e. control group and treatment group. They are two different group from the same socio-economic background. But the treatment group has participated in co-management program with the local forest department. Both of these groups have networked with different local organizations, those who are working for forest management and livelihood improvement. I have around 15 independent variable and 4 dependent variables. They are measured on different types of scale (Likert, rating, binary). But the dependent variable (capacity development) is measured with the 4-point rating scale and we have the total score. Now, we would like to find out the change in the capacity level of both groups and also what are the important factors that actually contribute to this capacity development process. My first idea was to conduct ANCOVA or MANCOVA to find out the significant mean differences between group, and then run one of the suitable regression models to find out the factors. Does it sound good? Can anyone help me to find out the best one?
