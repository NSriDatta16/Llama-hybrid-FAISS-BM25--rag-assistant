Considering the simplicity of your test case, it looks like the only methods you have available to put an element inside another will always force the contents to reload. [ Edit ] After seeing what you're trying to do, there are a couple things you can try: All ads could be served in IFRAMEs (on your own site) which will not hold up loading of the page and can be placed in the right place right away. As mentioned above IFRAMEs won't hold up loading of the page so you could put the ads in place right away if they are IFRAMEs and load them at the bottom if they are something else. Of course, this won't work if the slow part is before you know if you are going to get an IFRAME or not. You could keep the content in it's placeholder DIV but when it's done loading just reposition (with CSS absolute positioning) over the right place in the page. Not the most elegant solution, but should work fine.
