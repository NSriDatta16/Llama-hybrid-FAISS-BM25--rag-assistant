Printing a Calendar or Diary from ASP.NET Application

We have an ASP.NET application that uses the Infragistics WebSchedule control to display appointments etc in the same manner as Outlook. The problem we have is that the customer wants to be able to print the page as it appears on the screen - which the control itself does not appear to support directly. We have developed a Crystal Report that does a fair job but it is pretty complicated and just a little bit flaky (it does not stretch to accommodate all of the appointments for a particular day so if there are too many then they spill over). Bascially we have bullied Crystal to doing something it is not really meant to do - render a graphical representation of a diary rather than list the data in a tabular manner. Does anyone have a better alternative to this? Thanks in advance
