Is there a difference between using principal component analysis and factor analysis before segmentation?

I am trying to segment a group of stores. I have a very rich data set, including different store and store / category level annual sales, well-being survey results in city level, neighbourhood level demographics, variables representing number of landmark points such as number of stores, banks, schools around the outlets. Number of features in my data set is 307. However it's very difficult to assess results of a segmentation study in this dimension. So I do a PCA to lower the number of dimensions. With 9 PCs I am able to cover 80% of variation. But since PCs calculated through PCA are not rotated, it is a bit difficult to label them with inspecting commonalities. Can I use factors estimated and rotated with VARIMAX from factor analysis? I think these factors would also be representative.
