Error Measures, why is the sum halved? why not use the absolute value?

In a neural network class I'm taking the error measure is defined as: If the purpose of squaring the difference of the predicted and target values is to always have a positive value, then why not just use the absolute value of the difference instead? Secondly, why is the summation halved?
