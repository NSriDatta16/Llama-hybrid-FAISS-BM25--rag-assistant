These are definitely messages. A "packet" is a layer-3 (in ISO terminology) protocol unit, such as an IP packet; and a "datagram" is a layer-1 or layer-2 unit, such as the several Ethernet datagrams that might make up the fragments of an IP packet. So a message might be split across several packets, particularly if you're using a streaming protocol such as TCP, and a packet might be split across several datagrams.
