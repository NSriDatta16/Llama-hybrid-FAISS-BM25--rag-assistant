Other reasons to use Bayesian approaches include getting more accurate inference when the log-likelihood is very non-Gaussian. For example, in binary logistic regression standard p-values and confidence intervals may be inaccurate whereas Bayesian quantities are exact. getting accurate uncertainty intervals for complex derived parameters. In the frequentist world we frequently have to resort to the delta method to get approximate confidence intervals. Not only is this labor intensive, but the result is often very unsatisfactory because such intervals are forced to be symmetric when they should have been asymmetric in order to have accurate coverage with respect to both tails. One example is state occupancy probabilities in a state transition model, which involve recursive matrix multiplications are a mess to deal with in the frequentist domain. With MCMC (let's say you have 4000 posterior draws from the multivariate distribution of all parameters together) you just compute the complex derived parameter 4000 times and estimate the highest posterior density interval from those 4000 numbers.
