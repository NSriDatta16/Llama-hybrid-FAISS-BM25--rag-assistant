digitsequal = ( ((number 111110) && (number % 111111 == 0)) || ... ((number 110) && (number % 111 == 0)) || ((number 10) && (number % 11 == 0)) ); Thanks to boolean operations that shortcut, this should be a good enough solution regarding the average number of comparisons, it requires at most only one modulo operation per number, it has no loop, it can be nicely formatted to look symmetric, and it is obvious what it tests. But of course, premature optimization, you know, but since a lot of other solutions are already given... ;)
