Time series data is usually dependent on time. Pearson correlation, however, is appropriate for independent data. This problem is similar to the so called spurious regression. The coefficient is likely to be highly significant but this comes only from the time trend of the data that affects both series. I recommend to model the data and then try to see whether the modelling produces similar results for both series. Using Pearson correlation coefficient, however, will most likely give misleading results for the interpretation of the dependence structure.
