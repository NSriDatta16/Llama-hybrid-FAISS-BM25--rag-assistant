Should I run a learning curve before or after grid search?

I would like to find out how much data I should use for training my model. I also want to test what parameters I need using grid search. My question is should I first run a learning curve on a baseline i.e. no parameters / default ones in the model first (xgboost) or should I run learning curve straight after best model is output from grid search? But I need to find out first the training size but am thinking maybe the learning curve will change with different parameters.
