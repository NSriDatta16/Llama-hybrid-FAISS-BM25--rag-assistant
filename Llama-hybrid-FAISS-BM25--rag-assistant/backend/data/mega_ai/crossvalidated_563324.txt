Need the equivalent of a "paired T-test" for percentages (test-retest comparison between groups)

I have an observational study with a control group and a treatment group (n=25). All the subjects are given the same test (which consists of 9 questions, each of which has 4 multiple choice answers). Then the treatment group is given training and the control group isn't. The same test is given to all the subjects again (post treatment). I want to compare the differences in the scores (post - pre) between the 2 groups to see if, on average, the treatment group improved more, if the improvement was statistically significant (hypothesis test), and estimate the magnitude of the improvement (lconfidence interval). I need the equivalent of a paired test but for percentages. I don't think I can directly run a paired T-test because of my small sample size, not to mention the fact that the distribution for the number of correct responses (which seems to be small for some questions) is probably going to violate the normality condition. EDIT: It has been pointed out that there is an approach called "difference in difference" that does seem to be what I am trying to do, but I am finding little work on how to do inference with it (i.e. hypothesis testing and confidence intervals). But I don't work in the fields that use this methodology, so maybe someone can point me to a reference that gives these results.
