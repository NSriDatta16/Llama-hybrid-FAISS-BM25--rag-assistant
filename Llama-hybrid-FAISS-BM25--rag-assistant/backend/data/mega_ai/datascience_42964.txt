To complement the good points already stated: From Do We Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems? random forests are more likely to achieve a better performance than SVMs. Besides, the way algorithms are implemented (and for theoretical reasons) random forests are usually much faster than (non linear) SVMs. Indeed as @Ianenok, SVMs tend to be unusable beyond 10 000 data points. However, SVMs are known to perform better on some specific datasets (images, microarray data...). So, once again, cross validation is indeed the best way to know which method performs best.
