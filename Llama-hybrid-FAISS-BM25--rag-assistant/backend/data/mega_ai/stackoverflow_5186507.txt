The closest thing is the configuration lint system I built a while back. While far from a full fledged validator, it checks for common configuration errors and allows you to write you own test. The first unofficial steps of manual validation involve checking the "Disable Module Output" section of the magento admin to see if your module is loading. If it doesn't show up in there, that means there's a problem with your etc/module/*.xml file. (maybe code pool?)
