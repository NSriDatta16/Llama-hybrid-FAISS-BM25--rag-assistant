Sounds like you're trying to do hot-tracking with DragOver on individual list items. If you're using WPF, you could probably make a custom template for ListBoxItems that has a trigger for that. If not: You could implement DragOver on the list items themselves instead of just the ListBox control, and you would need to maintain a reference to the currently hot-tracked item so you could un-highlight it. This means your ListBox has to be populated with some custom objects, though.
