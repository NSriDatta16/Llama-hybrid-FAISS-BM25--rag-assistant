Likert-scale data as DV... curious as to which regression model to use

I have a 1-10 Likert scale as my DV and five variables as my IV. My IVs include both continuous and categorical variables. I am wondering which independent variables have a major effect on my dependent variable, which a regression model would help with. I was wondering if you had any suggestions as to which regression model I should use. What do you think of an ordinal logistic regression model? Thanks! :)
