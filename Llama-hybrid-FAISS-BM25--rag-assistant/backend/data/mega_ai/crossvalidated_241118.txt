Query on redudancy of variables in logistic regression

I am analyzing data from a study by regressing the variable for "health service utilization", which is coded as 1/0 for use/non-use. The data is for 1440 cases drawn equally from four different sites, and hence I have created four dummy variables, one for each site with 1/0 coding. When I enter these dummy variables as independent variables I am getting the message "Logistic "Regression Due to redundancies, degrees of freedom have been reduced for one or more variables" and one of the sites is excluded from the equation. Reading from this site I checked for collinearity in IVs by using both Pearson's and Spearman's correlation, but did not find any, except for a.6 correlation between sub-groups of age-group, which is coded as a categorical variable. How can I address this issue? What am I missing? If I am using this approach of four dummies for four sites, I cannot have a equation showing only 3 sites.
