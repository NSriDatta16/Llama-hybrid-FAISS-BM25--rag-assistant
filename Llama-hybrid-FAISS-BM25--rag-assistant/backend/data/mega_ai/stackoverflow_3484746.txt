get the filename of a given URL using PHP and remove the file extension

I have a little snippet that grab's the filename, including the extension. $currURL = substr($_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"],strrpos($_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"],"/")+1); given a url... http://www.somewebsite.com/pretty/url/here/this-is-a-page.php it returns this-is-a-page.php . I would like to be able to return simply, this-is-a-page . I'm pretty obsessive about doing stuff like this in as little code as possible... how would you do this in a simple and elegant manner?
