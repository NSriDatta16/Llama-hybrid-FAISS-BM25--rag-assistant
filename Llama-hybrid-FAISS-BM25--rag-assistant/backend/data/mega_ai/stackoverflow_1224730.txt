Some comments: Jet/ACE files are organized in data pages, which means there is a certain amount of slack space when your record boundaries are not aligned with your data pages. Row-level locking will greatly reduce the number of possible records, since it forces one record per data page. In Jet 4, the data page size was increased to 4KBs (from 2KBs in Jet 3.x). As Jet 4 was the first Jet version to support Unicode, this meant that you could store 1GB of double-byte data (i.e., 1,000,000,000 double-byte characters), and with Unicode compression turned on, 2GBs of data. So, the number of records is going to be affected by whether or not you have Unicode compression on. Since we don't know how much room in a Jet/ACE file is taken up by headers and other metadata, nor precisely how much room index storage takes, the theoretical calculation is always going to be under what is practical. To get the most efficient possible storage, you'd want to use code to create your database rather than the Access UI, because Access creates certain properties that pure Jet does not need. This is not to say there are a lot of these, as properties set to the Access defaults are usually not set at all (the property is created only when you change it from the default value -- this can be seen by cycling through a field's properties collection, i.e., many of the properties listed for a field in the Access table designer are not there in the properties collection because they haven't been set), but you might want to limit yourself to Jet-specific data types (hyperlink fields are Access-only, for instance). I just wasted an hour mucking around with this using Rnd() to populate 4 fields defined as type byte, with composite PK on the four fields, and it took forever to append enough records to get up to any significant portion of 2GBs. At over 2 million records, the file was under 80MBs. I finally quit after reaching just 700K 7 MILLION records and the file compacted to 184MBs. The amount of time it would take to get up near 2GBs is just more than I'm willing to invest!
