(A remark, only tangentially relevant for the question and the site.) Probability is about objective status of individual things . Things cannot have intention and they receive their statuses from the universe. With a thing, an event (giving it its status) always shall have happened: the event is already there accomplished, even if it haven't actually happened yet - the past future of a thing, also called "fate" or contingency. Again, with probability, the fact of event - having yet occured or not, doesn't matter - is already there [as opposed to the meaning which never is there]; and as such it's already got unnecessary and superfluous. The fact should be discarded, and that invalidation of it is what we call "the event is probable". Any fact about a thing bears in itself its primeval unconvincing side, or probability of the fact (even the actually occured fact - we recognize it by pinprick of disbelief). We are inevitably "tired of things" pre-psychically to an extent. It remains therefore only to quantify that partial negation of facticity, if need a number. One way to quantify is to count . Another is to weigh . A frequentist carries out or imagines of a series of trials lying before him which he turns face over to see if the event actually happens; he counts. A Bayesian consideres a series of psychological motives dragging behing him which he screens; he weighs them as things. Both men are busy with charge/excuse game of mind. Fundamentally, there is no much difference between them. Possibility is about potentialities of me in world. Possibility is always mine (a rain's chance is my problem to opt for taking an umbrella or getting wet) and concerns not an object (the one I'm considering as being possible or having the possibility) but the whole world for me. Possibility is always 50/50 and it is always convincing, because it implies - either calls for before or entails after - my decision how to behave. Things themselves have no intentions and thus possibilities. We should not confuse our possibilities of these things for us with their own probabilities of "stochastic determinism". Probability can never be "subjective" in the human sense. An observant reader may feel in the response a masked dig at the bright answer in this thread, where @amoeba says he thinks "there are almost no frequentists of the [probability definition] kind (P-frequentists)" . It could be turned opposite: bayesian probability definers do not exist as different class. Because, as I've admitted, bayesians consider chanks of reality the same manner as frequentists do - as series of facts; only these facts are not experiments, sooner recollections of "truths" and "arguments". But such forms of knowledge is factual and can only be counted or weighed. Probability it erects is not synthesized as subjective, that is , anticipatory ("bayesian" to be) unless human expectation (possibility) enters the scene to meddle. And @amoeba anxiously lets it in when imagines as "the coin will wear off and the Sun will go supernova".
