iPhone CoreData fetch from delegate?

I've got a program which is working and uses Core Data for storage. However, I'm not entirely sure if I should be keeping my fetch/update methods exclusively to the app delegate? One example is for a question within the app. The question has a "left" and a "right" statement. The delegate currently creates the new QuestionVC and passes in the questionNumber for the question. Then the QuestionVC then does a fetch to get the question object and uses the left and right properties of the object to set the text on the screen. Should I do this the other way round... The delegate does a fetch on the question number and then creates the QuestionVC and passes in the question object. The QuestionVC then just has to get the left and right text without having to do a fetch at all. Any tips, advice welcome. Thanks Oliver
