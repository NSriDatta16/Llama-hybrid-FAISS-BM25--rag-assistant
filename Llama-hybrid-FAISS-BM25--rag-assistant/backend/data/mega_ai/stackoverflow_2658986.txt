vb.net pdf reader load problem

From the tools menu I have done right click>choose item>COM (tab)> and ticked adobe pdf reader. From here I simply dragged the pdf tool onto my form. That's all I've done. Now on form load it throws a bug. "InvalidOperationException was unhandled" hovering over the message it says the following, An error occurred creating the form. See Exception.InnerException for details. The error is: Class not registered (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)) Any ideas anyone? Gonna take a mastermind to work this one out seriously
