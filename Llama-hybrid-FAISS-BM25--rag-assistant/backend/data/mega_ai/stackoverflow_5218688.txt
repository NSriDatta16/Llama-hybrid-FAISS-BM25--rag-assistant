Cannot find the pop up list relating to the #pragma mark compiler directive

I am going through some sample code and notice the compiler directive : "#pragma mark xxx". Read that the pragma is related to some popup menu in the IDE. But I don't seem to be able to activate the popup menu. Can anyone show me how to display the menu relating to "#pragma mark" ? (Xcode 3.2.5)
