This is a pretty difficult problem to solve. You can see some examples here on how a cartoon style, e.g. from the Simpson's has been applied to an image. A cartoon image generally doesn't have the structure that gives this artsy effect. The easiest way to try to apply this in some way would be to have a face-tracker, and then try to align two faces, e.g. a cartoon face and a human face, and then apply this. That might get you somewhere, but it might also look weird. You might then annotate landmarks in the images to help further and do a non-rigid registration before this. This is still somewhat a shitmix solution, but the closest I can think of that could work for faces. Edit: The comment by @TannerSwett adds something to this, it is potential to go onto some artists webpages and try to find their illustrations and try to learn "their" style. I still do not think that will satisfactory or yield enough data, but that would be an interesting thing to test. There is no generally available solution right now, but I think that are definitely some people working on this, and we will see better results soon. I think that maybe the way to go is not the artistic neural network approach. Maybe it is better to have a network that can classify objects in an image and then learn the correspondences between the objects and their cartoon counterparts, then blend the results in some meaningful way.
