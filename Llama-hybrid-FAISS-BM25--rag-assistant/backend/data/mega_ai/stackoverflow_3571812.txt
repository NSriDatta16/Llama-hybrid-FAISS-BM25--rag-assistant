In C, elements in initialisers for static objects must be "constant expressions" (all global objects are static). The address of a static object is an "address constant", which is a kind of "constant expression" - that's why lang works. The value of a variable - even a const variable (though note that langPtr itself is not const ) - is not a "constant expression", which is why langPtr does not work. Note that this is different in C++, where const qualified variables are genuine constants.
