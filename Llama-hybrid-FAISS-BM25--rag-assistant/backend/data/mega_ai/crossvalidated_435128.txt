Okay, so here is what I recommend: What not do to: Collapsing by ignoring certain level (for example month) could either be fine but more probably not, as it will have some effect and confounds your inference since you did not control for it. Assuming things and not really testing that assumptions hold. I'm not saying you should actually perform statistical test for the assumptions (even though you often can), but simply evaluating the effect of changing the assumptions on the result of your inference. Enough of things not do to, let's talk about more interesting stuff, what you can do: Assume you have no idea how to tackle this and start learning how people often attack this sort of problems which is through using mixed/random/hierarchical models. Read Wikipedia pages for terms like hierarchical models, partial pooling and random effects. Download the magnificent book of Statistical Rethinking (version 2, freely available) from Richard McElreath. The pdf is available here . It is password protected (hint: info about where to find the password is provided in the latest course's webpage). Read the book and also go through the lectures (latest version) for example here Now you will have a very good understanding of how to tackle this. You could either go through the lme4 docs and try to get things done in a frequentist way, or you might want to use a fully Bayesian way, it all depends on you. There are literally tons of documents, article, books on how to do these things, but the most important thing is to learn what these models are and what they can do for you and this is exactly what McElreath has done, in an outstanding way, IMHO. Here are some other books I recommend reading (after that book) if you are into this: 1 - Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models 2 - Mixed Models: Theory and Applications with R Good luck!
