What is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine intelligence?

I have read the term "machine intelligence" in a few places, e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20170219022131/https://research.google.com/pubs/MachineIntelligence.html : Research at Google is at the forefront of innovation in Machine Intelligence, with active research exploring virtually all aspects of machine learning, including deep learning and more classical algorithms. What is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine intelligence? I'm not sure if machine intelligence is a rebranding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, or if it means something else.
