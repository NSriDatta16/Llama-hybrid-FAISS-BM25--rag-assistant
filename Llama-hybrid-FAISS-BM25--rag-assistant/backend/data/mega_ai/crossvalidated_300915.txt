dimensioality reduction: Sammon Mapping

Reversing linear dimensionality reduction algorithms by projecting new set of data in the learned manifold is very straight forward. I am interested in projecting new set of data on non-linear manifolds (eg.Sammon Mapping) and then reconstruct the high dimensional data using specific amount of components. Is there a way of reversing non-linear dimensionality reduction alorithms?
