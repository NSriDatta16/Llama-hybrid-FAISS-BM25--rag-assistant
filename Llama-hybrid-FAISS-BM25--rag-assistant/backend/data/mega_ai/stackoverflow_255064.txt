Use String.charAt() It's standard and works in all browsers . In non-IE browsers you can use bracket notation to access characters like this: "TEST"[1]; // = E You could convert a string into an array of characters doing this: var myString = "TEST"; var charArray = myString.split(''); // charArray[1] == E These would be discouraged. There isn't any reason not to use the charAt() method, and there is no benefit to doing anything else.
