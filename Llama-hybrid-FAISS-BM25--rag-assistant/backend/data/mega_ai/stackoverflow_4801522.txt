Does QueryDosDevice and IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUM treat LUNs as separate devices?

Can someone confirm whether QueryDosDevice() and IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER considers LUN s on the same physical USB storage device as a single device, or is each LUN considered as a separate device? For example, if I have a USB thumb drive that has multiple LUN s, and each LUN has been allocated a logical DOS "letter", such as C :, D: , etc, if I call QueryDosDevice() will it return the same DeviceName for all the LUN s? Or will each LUN have a different DeviceName ? Similarly, if I use IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER for each of the LUN s, will the returned DeviceNumber be the same for all the LUN s? Thanks for your help!
