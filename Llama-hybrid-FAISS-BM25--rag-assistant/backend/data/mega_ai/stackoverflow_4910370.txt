Aside from Bert's answer, which is good as far as the source control part of the question is concerned, I'd also suggest you write some unit-tests that cover your changes. And don't get me wrong, I don't mean to say that you should just write one or two unit-tests and then forget about it. For regression testing/unit-testing to really work, it needs to be implemented systematically and it needs to become a consistent part of the project's automated building process. And obviously, this is not easy either, once you're gone, you'll have no guarantee that your replacement/your coworkers continue using your testing strategy. So that too is something that you must document, refine, make it easier to do, and constantly educate your coworkers and management on.
