Data sanitization and DB storage

If I have the following data, what is the best option in terms of Database storage. Here is text&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Here is some more text I see that I have 3 options: Store in DB as it is then decode at runtime: &lt;p&gt;hello&lt;/p&gt; Decode and then store in DB: hello Strip tags completely: Hello Are there any big "No No's" with any of the above, just looking for some advice on best practice. Also worth noting that I will have absolutely no control over the data that I receive.
