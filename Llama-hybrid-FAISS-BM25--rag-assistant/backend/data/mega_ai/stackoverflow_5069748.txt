Reference pairs of controls

I have a set of custom user controls, of type "ChartControl". I want to "pair" these (in some way), such that if having 10 controls, it's 5 pairs of 2 charts. The purpose of this is when I raise some specific event in one chart, I want the Form class to perform an action on both that chart, and it's pair chart, but not the other 8. So what options do I have on how to "find" this 2nd chart of the pair? Or in other words: How to organize these charts in a type of list or class structure for this to be easy? The challenge I see is that when receiving an event from a chart control, I can't simply loop through some list of controls to see where it belongs, as I can't compare the objects: Operator '=' is not defined for types "UserControl" (VB.NET) Would appreciate some ideas on how to do this. It's probably simple, but my brain seems a bit stuck here..
