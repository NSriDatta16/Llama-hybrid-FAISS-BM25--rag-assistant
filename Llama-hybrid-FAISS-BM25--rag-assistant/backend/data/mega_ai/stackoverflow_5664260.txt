Don't use static variables to save anything like that inside a class. Use a member variable instead. IMO the easiest way to do something like that and make it extensible is using a enum: enum PlayerJob JOB_NONE = 0, JOB_GEOLOGIST, JOB_LANDMAN, ... NUM_JOBS // this element is optional but can be useful for range checking. }; ... PlayerJob job = JOB_NONE; ... switch(job) { case JOB_NONE: break; case JOB_GEOLOGIST: ... break; ... default: error("Unhandled palyer job: %d", job); break; } Also I'd think about somehow organizing such "job relevant" stuff into some kind of array or list or whatever to make it easier to call "job specific" things: std::map jobzones; jobzones.push_back(JOB_GEOLOGIST, "geozone.xml"); ... transitToZone(jobzones[job]);
