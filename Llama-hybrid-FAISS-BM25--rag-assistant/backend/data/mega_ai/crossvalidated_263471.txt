Ok...I'll bite. First, there are a multitude of resources out there containing free market data at various levels of detail and composition. For instance: Yahoo! Finance provides easily downloadable past 12 months price information for all US traded stocks and, if you know the underlying CUSIP, you can pull down information about bonds too Robert Shiller's website has a wealth of historic information going back as far as the mid-19th c. http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm Kenneth French's website has portfolio level information http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html CRSP - Center for Research in Security Prices has another boatload of data http://www.crsp.com/ although I don't know if it's free iVelocity.com has information about stock options Quandl.com has literally millions of financial time series indexes from an enormous range of sources It might be cool to mash up a bunch of stock, macroeconomic indexes, etc., to see what kind of relationships emerge. Next, if you want to impress your professor, don't use ANOVA for the analysis. It has linear, Gaussian assumptions wrt the residuals and it's well known that the tails of financial data are way more extreme than Gaussian. So, try something neat like Hyndman's boosting additive quantile regression as described in this paper, "Forecasting Uncertainty in Electricity Smart Meter." ( http://robjhyndman.com/papers/smart-meter-quantiles.pdf ). Forget the "electricity" part, it's just a novel methodology that can be applied to financial information. Once the quantiles have been fit, you can assume any underlying probabilistic, extreme value distribution that you like. Didier Sornette's book "Extreme Financial Risks" is an excellent overview of extreme value theory as applied to financial markets. In addition, his ETHZ website has many more amazingly creative papers well worth browsing ( http://www.er.ethz.ch/financial-crisis-observatory.html ). So, hopefully this helps. At a minimum, you have pointers to some useful resources for data. The extreme value theory suggestion may not be that helpful, depending on your comfort level with its highly technical demands. /** Additional Data Sources **/ The St Louis Fed has a large archive of macroeconomic indicators https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/ The US Financial Diaries has hhold level information about consumption patterns http://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/ The Billion Prices Initiative is described as an, "Academic initiative that uses prices collected from hundreds of online retailers around the world on a daily basis to conduct economic research. This page shows our most recent research leveraging high-frequency price data, as well as the US daily inflation index." http://bpp.mit.edu/
