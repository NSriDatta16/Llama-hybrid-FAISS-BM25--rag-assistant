Does high training accuracy for a NN mean that it has a potential to reach high validation accuracy? No. Neural networks tend to overfit easily. They can even fit a dataset with random labels perfectly [1]. In that case the training error is zero, but no model can perform better than random guessing on the test set. So, in general case, high training accuracy does not tell you anything about the test accuracy or potential to reach good test accuracy. See some threads related to this problem: How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? Expected best performance possible on a data set [1]: Zhang, C., Bengio, S., Hardt, M., Recht, B. and Vinyals, O., 2016.
