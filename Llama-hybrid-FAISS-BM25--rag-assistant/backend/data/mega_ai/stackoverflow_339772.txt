I received another answer on a different forum that might be the answer but I've got to verify it first. Basically what they suggested is that the user might have installed the app on a network share instead of directly on the harddrive which would mean the application wouldn't run with full trust. The recommended fix was to use isolated storage instead of ApplicationData if that was the case. I'll verify that this is the problem and update if using isolated storage resolves it.
