Difference between Naive Bayes vs Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)

I want to perform sentiment analysis on text, have gone through several articles, some of them are using "Naive Bayes" and other are "Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM)" , on the other hand i have seen a python library for sentiment analysis that is nltk. It uses "Naive Bayes" can anyone explain what is the difference between using the two? I have also gone through this post, but not clear about both of them.. Difference between Bayes network, neural network, decision tree and Petri nets
