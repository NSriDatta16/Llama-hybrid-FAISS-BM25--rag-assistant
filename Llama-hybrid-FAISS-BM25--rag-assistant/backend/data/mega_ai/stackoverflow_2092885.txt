There are a few options: You can move your directories in SVN as if (almost) you are organizing your local directories. All the history would be retained. (which would include your 'move's of course) If you want to bring the repository into a state where this mistake won't be in the history, then you can use the administration features to remove the unwanted change-sets and add them manually to the appropriate place. This might be tedious and you might have to look into your revision numbers if they are referenced elsewhere. In the mean time I suggest deciding on a strategy with the team so confusions avoided.
