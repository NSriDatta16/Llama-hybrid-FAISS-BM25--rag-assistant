I have a couple of questions to ask you : Does it work? Is it fast enough? Is it readable/maintainable? If the answer to all three is yes then, beyond that, further changes are really just wasted effort in my opinion. Don't refactor just for the sake of refactoring. Far too often people change things in anticipation of what might be (your "changing int" for example). I prefer to subscribe to the YAGNI school of thought. The right time to worry about that is when you do it. And the Law of Demeter is a design guideline , not a rule. In the real world, pragmatism usually beats dogmatism :-)
