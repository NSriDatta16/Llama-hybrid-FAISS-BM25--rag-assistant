I am not sure how the multiple typedef s compile in your case. Remember, headers don't compile by themselves, but in conjunction with an implementation class. Also, your headers lack header guards or a #pragma once directive. What options are you using? As for placement new -- it is explicitly forbidden by the standard (18.5.1.3) -- so that won't work. There is no pattern here -- except for redefinition of already declared symbols. BTW: None of your .c or .cpp examples compile with Comeau .
