How to Combine Univariate GARCH Models?

We fitted univariate GARCH models to several time series. We would like to make sure that the forecasts also consider the correlation structure between the time series. The literature presents some multivariate GARCH models which can be directly fitted to multivariate time series. However, we would prefer to combine the univariate GARCH models by somewhat imposing the correlations on top of the forecasts. Do you have some ideas? Thanks.
