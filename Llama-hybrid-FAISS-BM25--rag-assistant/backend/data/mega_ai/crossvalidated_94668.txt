How to obtain predicted values from a gamm() using averaged coefficients (MuMIn)?

I want to extract the predicted values from a gamm() whose coefficients have been averaged using the package MuMIn, but I'm getting an error. library(mgcv) library(MuMIn) set.seed(0) dat sel confset.95p From the error message it appears I am doing more than one thing wrong. Can anyone help understand this? Thanks
