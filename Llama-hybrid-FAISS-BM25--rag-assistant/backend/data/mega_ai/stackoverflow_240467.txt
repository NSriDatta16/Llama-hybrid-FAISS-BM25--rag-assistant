How do I change an element (e.g. h1 -> h2) using jQuery / plain old javascript?

Of course, there are a whole range of possible errors relating to document validity, but my immediate stumbling block occurs when changing a paragraph ( p ) into an address element. My current method is (more-or-less): var p = $('p#test'); p.replaceWith(' ' + p.html() + ' '); but that fails for this specific case; it works perfectly for p -> blockquote or h2 -> h3. Firebug suggests that a self-closing element ( ) has been added to the document, for some reason. Can anyone spot the bug or suggest an alternative method?
