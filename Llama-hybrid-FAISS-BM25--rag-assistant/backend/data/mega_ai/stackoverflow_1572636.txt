Have you actually proved that using an out-of-process SQL database like MySQL or SQL Server is too slow, or is this an assumption? You could use a SQL database approach in conjunction with an in-memory cache to ensure that retrievals do not hit the database at all. Despite the fact that the records are plaintext I would still advise using SQL over a flat file solution (e.g. using a text column in your table schema) as the RDBMS will perform optimisations that a file system cannot (e.g. caching recently accessed pages, etc). However, without more information about your access patterns, expected throughput, etc. I can't provide much more in the way of suggestions.
