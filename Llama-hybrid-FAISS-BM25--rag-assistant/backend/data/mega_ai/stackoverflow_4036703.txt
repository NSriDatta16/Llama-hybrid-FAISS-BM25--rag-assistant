Ubuntu mount -t command

I use following command to mount "/dev/sdb1" to "/storage" directory: mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /storage After run above command, I can use "df -h" can see it: /dev/sdb1 147G 188M 140G 1% /storage But after i restart the server, it disappear, and i have to run mount command again. Is there a command that can keep the mount even if i restart the server?
