BSTS employing purposedly spurious regressors for causal impact analysis

I'm employing Google Correlate time series to evaluate the causal impact of an intervention on a variable of interest y . I made sure that the Google series are highly correlated with y during the pre-treatment period, and that their relationship with y is merely spurious. Because of this, the probability of these series being affected by the intervention can be thought to be very low. The causal impact analysis reveals a significant impact in the expected direction. When employing a placebo treatment period (I divide the pre-treatment period into two: placebo pre-treatment and placebo treatment ), and obtaining Google Correlate variables that are good predictors for the placebo pre-treatment period (to avoid a downwards bias), I find that the model fails to find a significant impact where there was no intervention. So it seems like the spurious variables behave as good predictors would. Given this, is it a bad practice to employ such variables for causal impact analysis because of the spurious nature of their correlation?
