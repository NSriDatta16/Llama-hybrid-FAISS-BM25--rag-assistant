Different results using randomForest::randomForest with one tree vs rpart

I am wondering what randomForest package handles differently for each individual tree. If I build a random forest with a single tree, no resampling, and allow the usage of all features in a dataset, I should get the same results as those obtained building a rpart model. I use the default configuration, which builds a tree with at least 5 elements for each leaf. Instead, I am obtaining different results (better results with randomForest), as if the randomForest tree were able to better adapt to the data. Actually, we can see that rpart prediction is layered , something reasonable given the if-else nature of trees, but that the prediction for randomForest is not, as if it were ignoring nodesize . This is a MVE illustrating this (note that cp = 0 allows rpart trees to be built without restriction): data("swiss") par(mfrow=c(1,2)) rf Resulting image: :
