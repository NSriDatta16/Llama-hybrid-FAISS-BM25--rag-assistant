List of valid characters for the fragment identifier in an URL?

I'm using the fragment identifier to create a permalink for AJAX events in my web app similar to this guy . Something like: http://www.myapp.com/calendar#filter:year/2010/month/5 I've done quite a bit of searching but can't find a list of valid characters for the fragment idenitifer. The W3C spec doesn't offer anything. Do I need to encode the characters the same as the URL in has in general? There doesn't seem to be any good information on this anywhere.
