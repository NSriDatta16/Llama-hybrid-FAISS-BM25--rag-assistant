jQuery livesearch not working when loading asynchronously

I have a livesearch and it uses an unordered list, like this: 1 2 Now I have the liveSearch function put on these items: $('#search').liveUpdate('#list').focus(); At first I was testing with a static list, it worked like charm. Now I'm trying to load it asynchronous with the following statements: //$('#list').load('/search/organization'); //$('#list').load('/search/person'); //$('#list').load('/search/debitor'); $('#list').load('/search/accountname'); The data is loaded as normal but now the search isn't working anymore. I'm not that used to using ajax so maybe this is a common problem? Thanks in advance, EDIT: When I add this line of code, or alert it somewhere else it returns 1. There is always only one element in the ul. $('#list').load('/search/organization'); var test = jQuery('#list'); alert(test.length); Still no sollution found.
