It's about using cheap comodity hardware to build a network/grid/cloud and spread the data and load (for example using map/reduce). RDBMS databases seem to me like software being (originaly) designed to run on one supercomputer. You can use various hard drive arrays, DB clusters, but still.. The amount of data increased so there's one more reason to design new data storages with this in mind - scalability, high availability, terabytes of data. Another thing - if you build a grid/cloud from cheap servers, it's fault tolerant because you store all data at three (?) different locations and at the same time it's cheap. Back to your pictures - the first one is from one computer (typically), the second one from a network of computers.
