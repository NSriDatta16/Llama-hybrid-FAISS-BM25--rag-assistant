How can I verify the linear hypothesis in a multiple logistic regression using SAS?

I have a multiple logistic regression where 2 of my independent variables are continuous. The rest are dichotomous. I am supposed to verify the linear hypothesis for the continuous variables. Is there a way to do this using SAS?
