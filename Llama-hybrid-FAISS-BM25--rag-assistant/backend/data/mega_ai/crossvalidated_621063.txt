Significance test for trend in time series with multiple sets of observations

Tomorrow there will be a race in which six runners participate in the 100 m dash. I will be able to capture the speed of each runner at each meter, so for each runner there will be a time series with 100 measurements. My hypothesis is that the runners will be at their fastest at around meter 65 or so, and then they will start to tire out. Therefore the curves in general will look like a upside down U. The null hypothesis is that there's no relationship between distance into the 100m dash and speed. My question is, is there a statistical test to support the conclusion that there is a relationship between distance into the race and speed? If so, is there a post hoc test to show that one particular meter is actually the fastest? To confirm, I want to carry it out this test over all six runners, not for each runner individually. Would a one-way ANOVA with post hoc Turkey test for multiple comparisons be appropriate?
