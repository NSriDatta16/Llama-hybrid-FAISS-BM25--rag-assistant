Do you have any saying on the HW that will be used? Assuming this will have more reads than writes, this could be an ideal application for SSDs, coupled with what TomTom mentioned - storing the events as files in a dedicated directory. If you go that way, I suggest having a directory for each "Key", and organize them in subdirectories. I.e., supposing you have a key like this: HJ029084930A You should have: /streams /streams/HJ02 /streams/HJ02/9084 /streams/HJ02/9084/930A/HJ029084930A /streams/HJ02/9084/930A/HJ029084930A/20100315/230257.trc /streams/HJ02/9084/930A/HJ029084930A/20100316/000201.trc /streams/HJ02/9084/930A/HJ029084930A/20100316/000203.trc /streams/HJ02/9084/930A/HJ029084930A/20100316/010054.trc ... /streams/HJ02/9084/930A/HJ029084930A/20100317/010230.trc What I am hinting at is that you should do your best to avoid having "too many" files (or directories) inside a directory, or the OS could slow down retrieving your stuff. One possible problem is when a stream overlaps from the end of a day to the start of the next one. See if you can split it so that you can have it finish on 23:59:59 and create a new one starting from 00:00:00 on the next day. It depends on what the semantics of "tail()" are in your case.
