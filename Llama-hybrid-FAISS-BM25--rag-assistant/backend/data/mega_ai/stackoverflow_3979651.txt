How to get files to WP7?

Let's say I'm writing a eBook reader for Windows Phone 7. Now the first thing that the user will need to do is add some books to his device, and since I don't offer a online book store or similar service, the only option is file transfer from his PC to the phone. Is he able to do this, how? Then how do I access this file. Can this file be placed in Isolated Storage of my app? I was searching around and didn't find any solution, in fact I believe that similar scenario is currently impossible but I just wanted to hear your toughs on the problem and probably some workaround ideas.
