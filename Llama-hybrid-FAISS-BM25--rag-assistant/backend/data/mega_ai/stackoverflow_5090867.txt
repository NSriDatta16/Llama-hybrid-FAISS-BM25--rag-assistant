Are boost interprocess containers suitable for thread shared storage in the same process?

I need a vector container to be shared between two threads of the same process, providing mutex protected access for the following methods: empty size erase push_back I would also like the collection to provide an iterator which locks the container while the iterator is in use. Essentially I am looking for a collection with a std::vector interface but with concurrent access protection but I can't seem to find anything. Are the boost::interprocess containers suitable for this application? If not, is there an alternative which is more suitable or do I have to write my own?
