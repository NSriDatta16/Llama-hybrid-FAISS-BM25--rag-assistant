Hmm... I might just be stored procedure happy, but I think at this point you'd benefit greatly from a stored procedure (or even a view) that did something like this: CREATE PROCEDURE GetRecentDisclaimer @BodyFragmentBeingSearched varchar(200) AS SELECT MAX(version), disclaimer_num, body FROM Disclaimer WHERE body LIKE @BodyFragmentBeingSearched GROUP BY disclaimer_num, body From there, someone's written a blog about how you'd call a stored procedure in Rails and populate ActiveRecord objects, check it out here: http://nasir.wordpress.com/2007/12/04/stored-procedures-and-rails-part-2/
