Estimation of mixed-effects logistic regression requires numerically integrating the random effects to calculate the likelihood of the model. There are several approaches to do this and you can find more information in this post . In general, and even though setting nAGQ much greater than 1 takes more time, it is to be preferred. This will ensure that the error in the approximation of the likelihood function is minimized.
