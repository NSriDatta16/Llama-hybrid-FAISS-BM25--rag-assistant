Matrix Manipulation for MySQL

I'm currently working on a quote retrieval system for my employer's website using mysql/php/html. They currently use a pricing matrix in the form of a two way table with height and width along each axis in a spreadsheet that lets you look up price. My question is what's the best way of manipulating this matrix into a database table usable by mysql? Since the pricing grids they use are up to 19x17 I realise that I would need a 3 column table (width, height, price) with 323 (19x17) rows for every permutation of the available heights and widths and it's corresponding price, but is there a less longwinded way to achieve this without manually entering each possible width and height combination? Thanks EDIT: an example of the grid is on the left and the format I need it in is on the right http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/406/82853790.jpg
