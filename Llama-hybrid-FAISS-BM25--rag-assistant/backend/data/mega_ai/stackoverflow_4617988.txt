MVVM / ViewModel / User controls / DataContext / Command - Design Issue/Discussion

I have a User Control that displays/manages one or more Addresses for an entity (employee, business, etc). I have leveraged this User Control from various views - encapsulating the UI of an address within the control. I have several ViewModels that hold/expose an Address Collection from various different perspectives - each of which is usually managed by a different ViewModel (one ViewModel for each View) I have passed the appropriate DataContext to the user control, meaning that although I have various ViewModels that expose the Address Collection - I can pass the appropriate context via the DC Binding. My question then becomes where do I put the Command Logic for adding and removing addresses? I do not want to put commands that are identical in each view model, as that would be simply repeating code. Being new to MVVM, would I just create a class with an IAddressCommand interface - and then stub out the commands in each of the ViewModels? Do I just encapsulate a view model, within another Viewmodel? Thoughts? Regards Richard
