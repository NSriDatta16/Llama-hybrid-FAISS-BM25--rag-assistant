As TokenMacGuy mentioned, the usage of the ::operator[] can be ambiguous, and what you described was their way of handling the ambiguity. An important thing to look at as a software developer is that 3rd party libraries are almost never written exactly the way you would use them. Even worse, poorly designed 3rd party libraries can damage the quality of your code. Everything you just described can be easily accomplished by abstracting the std::map class away, and if the side effects of ::operator[] bother you that much, I would encourage that you abstract it away.
