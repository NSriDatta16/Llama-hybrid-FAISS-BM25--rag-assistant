Your description of overlapped recycling is accurate, yes (1); and there is a setting for disabling it, but it's intended to prevent HTTP errors which you would be re-introducing. App pool recycles are a normal occurrence for managed apps (stems from, among other things, a CLR limitation that prevents the unloading of assemblies in the same memory space) that you must design for. Your technique would be difficult to manage in a web-farm or web-garden scenario. I think a better design would be to rely on out-of-process storage for the data (using distributed cache products like ScaleOut, App Fabric, and the like) so that all app pools have the same view of the cached data.
