From http://vyaskn.tripod.com/object_naming.htm : There exist so many different naming conventions for database objects, none of them is wrong. It's more of a personal preference of the person who designed the naming convention. However, in an organization, one person (or a group) defines the database naming conventions, standardizes it and others will follow it whether they like it or not. Read the full article for details on how to implement/create it in your organisation.
