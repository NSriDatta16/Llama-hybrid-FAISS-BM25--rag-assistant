Fit between two curves

I am trying to determine the fit between two curves (example shown below). Both curves are plotted here as a bunch of XY data points (not functions). The curves represent the trajectories of two planes taxiing, and I'm trying to figure out how far apart they are on average. (axes are in x/y position in meters) I've done correlation and RMSE, but neither of those is really what I want-- the two planes are travelling at different speeds, and thus one curve has many more data points than the other. So RMSE is sensitive to time, whereas I want deviation independent of time. My next thought is to do some sort of integration, but I'm not sure how that would work as the curves crisscross frequently. As you can see, the curves are pretty similar so I'm looking to get a small number as a result... probably around 0-5 meters. What sort of analysis should I be doing here? A close up of the turn:
