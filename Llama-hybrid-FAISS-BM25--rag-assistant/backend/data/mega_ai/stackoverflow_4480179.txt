Well, now G-WAN is available under Linux, I am using it for more than 6 months. The C scripts are fully-ANSI C compatible so there is no difference for any seasonned C programmer. To update them on the server, you can edit them directly in the /csp folder (remotely via SSH) or locally on a test machine (and copy them later): G-WAN reloads scripts on-the-fly when they have been changed on disk (no server stop required). G-WAN C scripts can use any existing library (starting with all those under /usr/lib) without any configuration or interface: you just have to write a '#pragma link' followed by the name of the library at the top of your script. What I found really useful is the ability to edit C scripts and refresh the view in the Internet browser to see how my code works. If there is a compilation error, then G-WAN outputs the line in the source code (just like any C compiler). But where it enters the extraordinary area, is when you have a C script crash: here also it gives you THE LINE NUMBER IN THE SOURCE CODE (with the faulty call and the backtrace). Kind of black-magic when you are used to Apache modules.
