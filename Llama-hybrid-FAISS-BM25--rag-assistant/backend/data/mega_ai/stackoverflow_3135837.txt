Do android developers commonly use 3rd-party UI/networking libraries like Three20 on iPhone?

I've done plenty of iPhone work, never anything with Android. On iPhone, it was a few months in before I discovered the Three20 library (which is awesome) and began moving my code over. I don't want to make the same mistakes moving to Android, so my question: Do android developers commonly use 3rd-party UI/networking libraries like Three20 on iPhone, or do they take the ones out of the box? I realize that there is an effort to port Three20 to Android, but that's not my goal per se. I just want to know if the out-of-the-box UI/networking/navigation libs you get with android are considered sufficient for most android apps. Thanks!
