ction: E ( x , S , C , λ ) {\displaystyle E(x,S,C,\lambda )} where C is the color parameter and λ is the coherence parameter. E ( x , S , C , λ ) = E c o l o r + E c o h e r e n c e {\displaystyle E(x,S,C,\lambda )=E_{\rm {color}}+E_{\rm {coherence}}} Optimization: The segmentation can be estimated as a global minimum over S: arg ⁡ min S E ( x , S , C , λ ) {\displaystyle {\arg \min }_{S}E(x,S,C,\lambda )} Existing methods Standard Graph cuts: optimize energy function over the segmentation (unknown S value). Iterated Graph cuts: First step optimizes over the color parameters using K-means. Second step performs the usual graph cuts algorithm. These 2 steps are repeated recursively until convergence. Dynamic graph cuts:Allows to re-run the algorithm much faster after modifying the problem (e.g. after new seeds have been added by a user). Energy function Pr ( x ∣ S ) = K − E {\displaystyle \Pr(x\mid S)=K^{-E}} where the energy E {\displaystyle E} is composed of two different models ( E c o l o r {\displaystyle E_{\rm {color}}} and E c o h e r e n c e {\displaystyle E_{\rm {coherence}}} ): Likelihood / Color model / Regional term E c o l o r {\displaystyle E_{\rm {color}}} — unary term describing the likelihood of each color. This term can be modeled using different local (e.g. texons) or global (e.g. histograms, GMMs, Adaboost likelihood) approaches that are described below. Histogram We use intensities of pixels marked as seeds to get histograms for object (foreground) and background intensity distributions: P(I|O) and P(I|B). Then, we use these histograms to set the regional penalties as negative log-likelihoods. GMM (Gaussian mixture model) We usually use two distributions: one for background modelling and another for foreground pixels. Use a Gaussian mixture model (with 5–8 components) to model those 2 distributions. Goal: Try to pull apart those two distributions. Texon A texon (or texton) is a set of pixels that has certain characteristics and is repeated in an image. Steps: Determine a good natural scale for the texture elements. Compute non-parametric statistics of the model-interior texons, either on intensity or on Gabor filter responses. Examples: Deformable-model based Textured Object Segmentation Contour and Texture Analysis for Image Segmentation Prior / Coherence model / Boundary term E c o h e r e n c e {\displaystyle E_{\rm {coherence}}} — binary term describing the coherence between neighborhood pixels. In practice, pixels are defined as neighbors if they are adjacent either horizontally, vertically or diagonally (4 way connectivity or 8 way connectivity for 2D images). Costs can be based on local intensity gradient, Laplacian zero-crossing, gradient direction, color mixture model,... Different energy functions have been defined: Standard Markov random field: Associate a penalty to disagreeing pixels by evaluating the difference between their segmentation label (crude measure of the length of the boundaries). See Boykov and Kolmogorov ICCV 2003 Conditional random field: If the color is very different, it might be a good place to put a boundary. See Lafferty et al. 2001; Kumar and Hebert 2003 Criticism Graph cuts methods have become popular alternatives to the level set-based approaches for optimizing the location of a contour (see for an extensive comparison). However, graph cut approaches have been criticized in the literature for several issues: Metrication artifacts: When an image is represented by a 4-connected lattice, graph cuts methods can exhibit unwanted "blockiness" artifacts. Various methods have been proposed for addressing this issue, such as using additional edges or by formulating the max-flow problem in continuous space. Shrinking bias: Since graph cuts finds a minimum cut, the algorithm can be biased toward producing a small contour. For example, the algorithm is not well-suited for segmentation of thin objects like blood vessels (see for a proposed fix). Multiple labels: Graph cuts is only able
