Grid search on k-fold cross validation

I've a dataset of 120 samples in a 10-fold cross validation setting. Currently, I pick the training data of the first holdout and do a 5-fold cross-validation on it to pick the values of gamma and C by grid search. I'm using SVM with RBF kernel. Since I'm doing a ten 10 cross-validation to report precision,recall, do I perform this grid search in the training data of each holdout (there are 10 holdouts, each having 10% test and 90% training data) ? Wouldn't that be too time consuming ? If I use the gamma and C of the first holdout and use it for the rest of 9 holdouts of the k-fold cross-validation, is that a violation because I would have used the train data to get gamma and C and again use the portion of train data as test in second holdout ?
