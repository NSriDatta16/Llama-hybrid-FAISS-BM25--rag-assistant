The state-of-the-art for non-convex optimization in a complex, ill-conditioned and multi-modal landscape is Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategies, aka CMA-ES, which in various versions (such as BIPOP-CMA-ES) has scored first in several global optimization contests (see e.g. the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking, BBOB 2009 ). You can find a lot of information, code for several languages (C, C++, Java, Matlab, Octave, Python, Scilab), research papers and tutorials about CMA-ES on Nikolaus Hansen's website . The relevant paper is: Hansen, Nikolaus, Sibylle D. MÃ¼ller, and Petros Koumoutsakos. "Reducing the time complexity of the derandomized evolution strategy with covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES)." Evolutionary computation 11.1 (2003): 1-18; which you can find on the first author's website linked above. I also recommend his tutorial paper, which you can also find on his webpage. The disadvantage is that CMA-ES requires a lot of functions evaluations to be effective (e.g., usually not less than $10^3$-$10^4$, and even more); however, it is able to solve problems that are just impossible for other solvers. A possible alternative, if your target function is costly to evaluate, is to use Bayesian Optimization (BO) assuming noise in the target function; this would smooth away kinks in the target distribution. See also this question and my reply there to get some references about BO or other optimizers.
