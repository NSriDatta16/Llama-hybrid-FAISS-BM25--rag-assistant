variations in viewing direction approximated by local affine transformations, and relative motions between objects in the world and the observer, approximated by local Galilean transformations. This generalized scale-space theory leads to predictions about receptive field profiles in good qualitative agreement with receptive field profiles measured by cell recordings in biological vision. There are strong relations between scale-space theory and wavelet theory, although these two notions of multi-scale representation have been developed from somewhat different premises. There has also been work on other multi-scale approaches, such as pyramids and a variety of other kernels, that do not exploit or require the same requirements as true scale-space descriptions do. Relations to biological vision and hearing There are interesting relations between scale-space representation and biological vision and hearing. Neurophysiological studies of biological vision have shown that there are receptive field profiles in the mammalian retina and visual cortex, that can be well modelled by linear Gaussian derivative operators, in some cases also complemented by a non-isotropic affine scale-space model, a spatio-temporal scale-space model and/or non-linear combinations of such linear operators. Regarding biological hearing there are receptive field profiles in the inferior colliculus and the primary auditory cortex that can be well modelled by spectra-temporal receptive fields that can be well modelled by Gaussian derivates over logarithmic frequencies and windowed Fourier transforms over time with the window functions being temporal scale-space kernels. Deep learning and scale space In the area of classical computer vision, scale-space theory has established itself as a theoretical framework for early vision, with Gaussian derivatives constituting a canonical model for the first layer of receptive fields. With the introduction of deep learning, there has also been work on also using Gaussian derivatives or Gaussian kernels as a general basis for receptive fields in deep networks. Using the transformation properties of the Gaussian derivatives and Gaussian kernels under scaling transformations, it is in this way possible to obtain scale covariance/equivariance and scale invariance of the deep network to handle image structures at different scales in a theoretically well-founded manner. There have also been approaches developed to obtain scale covariance/equivariance and scale invariance by learned filters combined with multiple scale channels. Specifically, using the notions of scale covariance/equivariance and scale invariance, it is possible to make deep networks operate robustly at scales not spanned by the training data, thus enabling scale generalization. Time-causal temporal scale space For processing pre-recorded temporal signals or video, the Gaussian kernel can also be used for smoothing and suppressing fine-scale structures over the temporal domain, since the data are pre-recorded and available in all directions. When processing temporal signals or video in real-time situations, the Gaussian kernel cannot, however, be used for temporal smoothing, since it would access data from the future, which obviously cannot be available. For temporal smoothing in real-time situations, one can instead use the temporal kernel referred to as the time-causal limit kernel, which possesses similar properties in a time-causal situation (non-creation of new structures towards increasing scale and temporal scale covariance) as the Gaussian kernel obeys in the non-causal case. The time-causal limit kernel corresponds to convolution with an infinite number of truncated exponential kernels coupled in cascade, with specifically chosen time constants to obtain temporal scale covariance. For discrete data, this kernel can often be numerically well approximated by a small set of first-order recursive filters coupled in cascade, see for further details. For an ea
