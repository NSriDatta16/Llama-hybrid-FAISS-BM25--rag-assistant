Select first "li" in multiple unorganized lists with jQuery

Problem demo is here: http://www.studioimbrue.com Currently, when the page loads, all the thumbnails are triggered to dim. I'm trying to make it so that each first thumb remains at full opacity (using :first of course) until another thumb is clicked. I can get it to do it for the first one, but it won't iterate to each . I tried using the each() function, but I couldn't get it to work. My JavaScript skills aren't that great so if you find a solution, just post the code and then explain (if you can). Below is the current code I'm working with: $(document).ready(function(){ var activeOpacity = 1.0, inactiveOpacity = 0.6, fadeTime = 100, clickedClass = "selected", thumbs = ".thumbscontainer ul li"; $(thumbs).fadeTo(1, inactiveOpacity); $(thumbs).hover( function(){ $(this).fadeTo(fadeTime, activeOpacity); }, function(){ // Only fade out if the user hasn't clicked the thumb if(!$(this).hasClass(clickedClass)) { $(this).fadeTo(fadeTime, inactiveOpacity); } }); $(thumbs).click(function() { // Remove selected class from any elements other than this var clicked, previous; clicked = $(this); if (!clicked.hasClass(clickedClass)) { previous = $(thumbs+'.'+clickedClass); previous.removeClass(clickedClass).fadeTo(fadeTime, inactiveOpacity); clicked.addClass(clickedClass).fadeTo(fadeTime, activeOpacity); } }); });
