Spark/Databricks: GPU does not appear to be utilized for ML regression (cross-validation, prediction) notebook

I have created and attached a notebook to a GPU-enabled Databricks cluster (6.4 ML (includes Apache Spark 2.4.5, GPU, Scala 2.11), EC2 type: p2.xlarge). I have started running the notebook that includes cells with PySpark/MLlib code for performing cross-validation and prediction using a Pipeline consisting of a VectorAssembler, MinMaxScaler, and GBTRegressor. When I run this job it appears to be utilizing only CPU (Ganglia UI shows no GPU activity whatsoever, but plenty of CPU being used). Perhaps there is PyCpark code I need to add to my notebook and/or configuration settings for the cluster to allow for running this code with the help of my cluster's GPU? I am new with Spark/MLlib, it's very possible that I am missing something obvious. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
