Yep, this has just happened to me after a reinstall. I was using Vs2k8. Realised I didn't have resharper 4.5 installed. Closed VS, ran install, selected the same settings as I had been using for the last 8 months (VS settings) and then restarted VS. Now no Ctrl + F or Ctrl + Shift + F ! Very odd. UPDATE: Well I found out what it was. The Find box had been relocated behind the Windows taskbar. I had to move the taskbar to the side of the screen, so that I could drag the find box back into the usable window space. No idea if this was a Resharper caused change but there was a direct correlation to the install.
