How to calculate the Jacobian of the transformation ( for covariance matrix)

I'm reading this Paper about a separation strategy for modeling covariance matrices with focus on Bayesian analysis. Direct decomposition of covariance matrix is as follows: $\Sigma = \text{diag}(S)\,R\, \text{diag}(S)$ , where $S$ is $k\times 1$ vector of standard deviations, $\text{diag}(S)$ is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements $S$ , and $R$ is $k \times k$ correlation matrix. Elements of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ can be written as follows: $\Sigma_{ii} = s^{2}_{ii}$ $\Sigma_{ij} = s_i s_j r_{ij}$ . Now let's assume that $\Sigma$ has a stadard inverse-Wishart distribution $W^{-1}_k(I,\nu), \nu\geq k$ ,that is, when $\Sigma$ has density function $$f_k(\Sigma;I,\nu) \propto |\Sigma|^{-\frac{1}{2}(\nu + k+1)}\, \exp(-\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\Sigma^{-1}))$$ Now under the transformation $\Sigma \rightarrow (S,R)$ the Jacobian has value of $2^k\left(\displaystyle \prod _{i}^k s_i\right)^{k}$ . The density function under this transformation is transformed into the following form $$f_k(S,R;I,\nu) \propto |R|^{-\frac{1}{2}(\nu + k+1)} \displaystyle \prod_i^k s_i^{-(\nu+1)} \exp\left(-\frac{r^{ii}}{2 s_i^2}\right) $$ where $r^{ii}$ is the $i$ th diagonal element of $R^{-1}$ . Can someone point me in the right direction to compute this Jacobian?
