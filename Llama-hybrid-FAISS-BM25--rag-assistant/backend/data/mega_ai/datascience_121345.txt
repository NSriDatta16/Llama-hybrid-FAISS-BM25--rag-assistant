First of all, though both PCA and t-SNE are dimension reduction methods, they are designed to serve different purposes. PCA seeks a low-rank representation in a sense ( maximizes the variance in projection space ), while t-SNE produces a low-dimension representation specially suited for visualization purpose. Word embedding matrix is already a low-rank representation, so there is not much juice left to squeeze for PCA (trying to get a even-lower-rank matrix of a low-rank matrix). This is why you see a linear decay (instead of power decay typically) of component coefficients. On the other hand, a low-rank matrix may still have much to gain from t-SNE if we want to visually inspect it. Again, PCA and t-SNE are just tools - which one to pick is dependent on what the purpose is.
