It is still unknown how to estimate standard errors for PS analysis, and no methodological papers have described the use of PSs in this way to my knowledge. Leite, Sandbach, Jin, MacInnes, & Jackman (2012) described a method very similar using longitudinal growth models, so you might want to look into that. Ganz, Kwan, Stanton, Bower & Belin (2011) and Binder, White, Resnick, McClellan, Lei & Ouslander (2012) used an approach similar to what you describe.
