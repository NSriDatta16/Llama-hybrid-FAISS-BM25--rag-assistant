What are your experiences with NetAdvantage or DXperience?

I'm looking into both of them, and while I have been quite pleased with NetAdvantage at my previous employer, I find the price point (plus testimonials like at What is the best winform UI component set? ) to make me hesitate and consider DXExperience. That said, I'm wondering: What your experiences are in field with either (or ideally both)? Would you be willing to spend your own hard earned money on either one? This is for WinForms - and also a last question: Does DXperience have anything analogous to the UltraWinDataGrid? This grid is awesome -- and the absence of a reasonable competitor is a show stopper. Note : This is not intended to incite a flame war, I am interested in experiences, and pragmatic advice.
