Regression variable has no meaning for one category

For a (binary) logistic regression, I have two IV's in my model. The first IV has three categories (one person, two persons, three or more persons). The second variable is binary (communication exists vs. not exists) For the first category, the second IV has no meaning, but for the second and third category is does. Question is, how can I include all cases in one regression? The DV is always the same.
