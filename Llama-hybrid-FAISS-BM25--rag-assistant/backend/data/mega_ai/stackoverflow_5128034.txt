You could look at Prism guidance provided by Microsoft Patterns & Practice group. Prism is actually complete architectural approach to build enterprise level solutions. But it contains StockTrader Reference Implementation application that is built using DI, MVVM and includes interaction with data storage (they use XML files as data storage to provide easy distribution, but it really doesn't matter what data storage is used). Also, the guidance contains several small quickstart projects which emphasize particular part of the architecture. There is comprehensive documentation and active community around Prism, so you can find answers to any question. And it is completely free.
