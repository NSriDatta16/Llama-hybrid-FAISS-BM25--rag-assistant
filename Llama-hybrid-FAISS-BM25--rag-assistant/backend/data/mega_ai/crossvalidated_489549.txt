I think you're correct that it makes sense to think of CR categories as ordinal. In that case, the term of art you seek is "ordinal logistic regression," which is used for categories that can be ordered like "poor, fair, good." (By contrast, a category that isn't inherently ordered is a person's college major: History isn't "more of a BA" than Economics or any other discipline.) We can't do arithmetic on monster difficulties, but we can sort them. What I mean by "arithmetic" is that adding up CRs produces a different encounter difficulty than if we follow the guidelines and calculations in the Dungeon Master's Guide ; eight monsters with CR $\frac{1}{8}$ have a different difficulty than a single CR 1 monster. Because this part of the answer depends on knowledge of D&D 5e, as opposed to statistics, I won't elaborate on it further.
