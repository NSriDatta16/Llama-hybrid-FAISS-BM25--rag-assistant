Python: Inverse Replace Function

I have no idea about how I explain this, but here goes... >>> x = 'qwertyHelloWorldasdfg' >>> x = inversereplace(x, 'HelloWorld', 'a') >>> print x aaaaaaHelloWorldaaaaaa >>> y = 'qwertyHelloWorld' >>> y = inversereplace(y, 'qwerty', '') >>> print y qwerty In the function above, it replaces everything in x that is not Not the 2nd argument with the 3rd Argument. How would I go about doing this? If there is already a function that does this then please let me know. Thanks in advance, ~DragonXDoom
