Does convergence in mean imply convergence almost surely if the limit is zero and the sequence is nonnegative?

Say $X_k$ is a non-negative sequence and it is known that it convergences in mean to zero. It feels like it should also convergence almost surely due to the fact that the only value a non-negative random variable can take and still average to zero is the value zero. However, this explanation is kind of hand-wavy. Can this be proven more rigorously or disproven?
