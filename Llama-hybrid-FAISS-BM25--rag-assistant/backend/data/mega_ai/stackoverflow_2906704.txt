Actually I'm evaluating Bonita Open Solution (BOS) for internal use in small company and I think it's a great platform to build workflow applications on. I believe that a manager having basic BPM knowledge can quite easily prototype the whole process including user interaction forms, some of process variables and condition on flows, and simulate anytime with one click. Since you're modelling application, you can completely reorganize the flow when optimizing process. Anytime a programmer can come and implement interactions with external services using connector, again not a hard thing. Once you are ready, just export application and deploy on server. Bonita has simple but powerful Java API. Accessing it you can tweak most limitations. Nice thing about Bonita is it's active development. Also forum is quite supportive and even the developers of BOS answer the questions in a short time (hours or few days on weekends).
