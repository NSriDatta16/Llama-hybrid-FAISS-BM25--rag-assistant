A couple of things to consider: Make sure that all of your joins are indexed on both sides. For example, you join list_items.list_id=lists.object_id in several places. list_id and object_id should both have indexes on them. Have you done any research as to what the variation in the averages are? You might benefit from having a worker thread (or cronjob) calculate the averages periodically rather than putting the load on your RDBMS every time you run this query. You'd need to store the averages in a separate table of course... Also, are you using status as an enum or a varchar? The cardinality of an enum would be much lower; consider switching to this type if you have a limited range of values for status column. -aj
