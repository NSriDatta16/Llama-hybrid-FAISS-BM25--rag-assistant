If all Window Managers you're interested in running under support EWMH , the Extended Window Manager Hints standard, there are elegant ways to perform this (speaking to Xlib via ctypes, for example). The _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property of the root window (see here ) tells you which window is active (if any); the _NET_WM_STATE property of the active window is then a list of atoms describing its state which will include _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN if that window is fullscreen. (If you have multiple monitors of course a window could be fullscreen on one of them without being active; I believe other cases may exist in which a window may be fullscreen without being active -- I don't think there's any way to cover them all without essentially checking _NET_WM_STATE for every window, though).
