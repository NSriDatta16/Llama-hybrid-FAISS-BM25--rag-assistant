Detect Touch and Hold Inside UITableView

I'm trying to detect touch and hold gestures inside a UITableView, while keeping track of which cell was selected. I need to be able to differentiate between normal taps on a cell and touches that last longer than X seconds (probably 1s or so). The main challenge is that I'd like to do this without subclassing UITableViewCell, since doing so slowed down my scrolling significantly. I think there's probably a way to do this using an NSTimer, but I can't seem to get it working correctly. Using touchesBegan: and touchesEnded: with a timer is out, since I don't see any way to keep track of which cell was selected, unless there's some way to do that with those methods? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
