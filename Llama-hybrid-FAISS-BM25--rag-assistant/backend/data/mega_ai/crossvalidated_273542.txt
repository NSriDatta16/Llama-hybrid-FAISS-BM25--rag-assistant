Estimate confidence intervals iteratively for time series dataset for hundreds of products

I am working on a retailer data set where I have weekly data for hundreds of products. ID Week1 Week2 Week3 Week4 Week5 Week6 Week7 1000 41 618 720 645 573 503 447 1001 4 62 80 67 94 81 65 1002 2 32 10 23 26 26 31 1003 6 22 13 1 28 19 25 1004 1 9 7 9 6 8 4 1005 0 2 9 3 4 14 19 The objective is to detect outliers. So my I have 2 questions: I am trying to make a confidence interval and if the values exist in that interval then its fine otherwise. I would consider the values a outlier. Is this the correct way of detecting outliers for thousands of products ? Or if not then what could be possible and efficient ways of doing this ? If it is a possible way then my current approach is to approximate my sales data with Poisson distribution explained here . But still I can see that there are sales of products which according to human eye should not be outliers but they are coming as outliers even though I am using 99% confidence interval. The reason is that I am taking mean. Any suggestions how can I improve this ?
