If you are willing to assume that the ratio was constant up until you made the change then you can do this as a simple test of 2 proportions or a $\chi^2$ test on a $2 \times 2$ table. You can expand the later to compare more than 2 groups. If you want to consider the ratio changing smoothly over time (with possibilities of sudden jumps at know changes) then logistic regression is an option. If you need to take into account possible serial correlation then you are getting into generalized estimating equations and should probably consult with a local statistician.
