It's easy. Get images in Drupal (IamgeAPI, ImageCache, CCK, Image node etc. OR CCK field with external image URL). Anyway you will end up with nodes that contain images. Use Views to display those nodes in a block. Use Nodequeue to control order of images with drag-and-drop UI or make some cook taxonomy/flag system. Put this block anywhere you want.
