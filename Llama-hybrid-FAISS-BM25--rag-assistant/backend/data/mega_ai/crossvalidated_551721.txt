How to interpret this binomial distribution result?

From the Binomial distribution, the chance of getting at least 50 heads when flipping a fair coin 100 times is 54% (to 1 d.p.). It seems to imply that that there will be more heads than tails, but this contradicts the common sense conclusion that the number of heads and tails will be equal, on average. And of course, by symmetry, the same applies to tails. I'm Confused.
