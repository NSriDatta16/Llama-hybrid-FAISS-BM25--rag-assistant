The most efficient way to do this with a simple list will be a simple linear time search, as in SomeObject winner; float maxMass = 0.0f; // Assuming all masses are at least zero! foreach(SomeObject o in objects) { if(o.mass > maxMass) { maxMass = o.mass; winner = o; } } If this is something you intend to do regularly, it may be beneficial to store your objects in an order sorted by mass and/or to use a more appropriate storage container.
