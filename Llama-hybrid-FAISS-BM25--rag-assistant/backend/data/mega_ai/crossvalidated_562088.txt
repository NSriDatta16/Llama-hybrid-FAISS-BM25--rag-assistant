Weights for estimating ATE (rather than ATT) in SAS %CEM macro for coarsened exact matching?

I'm running Gary King's %CEM SAS macro (available here ) for coarsened exact matching (CEM) for a project at work. The macro works fine for estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) and returns sample weights (labelled Wsc1_stur) for that purpose. We're also interested in estimating the overall Average Treatment Effect (ATE) using CEM. Is there an option in the %CEM macro for calculating the ATE?
