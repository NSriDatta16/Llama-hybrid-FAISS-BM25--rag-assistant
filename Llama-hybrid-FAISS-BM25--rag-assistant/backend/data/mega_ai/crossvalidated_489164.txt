They're completely different notions and even could be combined. Multinomial logistic regression is for the situation where you want to predict the probability of falling into multiple categories (3+ categories would be multinomial logistic regression...if there are only two categories, it's regular logistic regression). Mixed effects models are for when your predictor variables include both fixed effects and random effects. Consequently, if we find ourselves in a position where we have both fixed and random effects as the predictors and want to use them to predict the probability that a photograph is of a dog, cat, or horse, we might use a mixed effects multinomial logistic regression!
