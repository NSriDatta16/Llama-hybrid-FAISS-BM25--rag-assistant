We used to use MyEclipse but we just stopped doing so over time, and didn't really miss it. We're now on Ganymede EE and find it has everything we need, having now implemented some of the things bundled with MyEclipse. Syntax highlighting across various sources such as .css, .js and .sql is nice to have out-of-the-box. And we've always used the remote debugger built right in - it's pretty neat imo, but I didn't realise there was anything special with MyEclipse in this regard. And of course you can install Eclipse and MyEclipse side-by-side while you try things out.
