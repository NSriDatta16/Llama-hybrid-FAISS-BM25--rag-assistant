I think you described it yourself: you're looking for it to use something used by the EXE when you're running from development mode. When you run from development mode, there is no EXE generated or used, so Windows won't be leveraging functionality linked to the EXE. (PB starts your application so quickly because it is only loading the application to the virtual machine and running its Open event.) If you need this, it sounds like you'll have to include Deploying of the EXE and running it as part of your testing cycle. Good luck, Terry.
