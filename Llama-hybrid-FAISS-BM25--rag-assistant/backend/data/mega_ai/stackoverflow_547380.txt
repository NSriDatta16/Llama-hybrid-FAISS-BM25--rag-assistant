Java library inspector?

I am currently working on a mantenance project that is written in Java. We are currently working to clean up the code some and try to provide a little more organization to the project overall. The list of libraries that are included in the build have grown long, and honestly no one remains that knows/remembers what each library is used for or why? So I am looking for a tool that would be able to essentially find where the library is used in the code. Essentially like a find usage function in an IDE has for functions. Does such a tool exist? I am curently using Netbeans and as mentioned our code is in java. I know I could remove each library and compile the project for each library to find the usages, but it just seems there should be a better way. Any ideas?
