Using the BIC to select a model

I have a data set (with $n$ points) and there are two models which I think will fit the data well. The first model is a simple power law and the second model is a power law plus a linear term and an intercept; \begin{eqnarray} y&=&ax^b\\ y&=&ax^b+cx+d. \end{eqnarray} I would like to use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to see if using the second model is really worth it. My question is, what exactly is the likelihood $L$ for both of these models? How exactly do I compute $L$ so that I can estimate the BIC?
