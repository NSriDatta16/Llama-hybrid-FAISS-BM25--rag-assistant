it depends what you mean by "embed". Do you mean: using the HTML 5 video tag? using the old school object tag, and serving the video file yourself? serving a flash player yourself? using an embedding "script" which loads all the magic at runtime from somewhere else? some other way... there a re many more ways, these are just some common ones Update Based on Comments right right. Ok, well, then, using that method ( #4 ) does not affect how the video is downloded at all. See, by "embedding", using some scripts, all you're doing is setting up the player container somewhere else.. youtube, vimeo, your other site etc. The only thing that will alter the "performance" of the video is a combination of the player itself (flash, html5, and the configs), and the server technology which is serving up the video file itself (IIS,Flash Server, Akami, etc etc). Simple answer to your question: No
