According to gcc's online documentation , -Wall turns on: -Waddress -Warray-bounds (only with -O2) -Wc++0x-compat -Wchar-subscripts -Wenum-compare (in C/Objc; this is on by default in C++) -Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only) -Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only) -Wcomment -Wformat -Wmain (only for C/ObjC and unless -ffreestanding) -Wmissing-braces -Wnonnull -Wparentheses -Wpointer-sign -Wreorder -Wreturn-type -Wsequence-point -Wsign-compare (only in C++) -Wstrict-aliasing -Wstrict-overflow=1 -Wswitch -Wtrigraphs -Wuninitialized -Wunknown-pragmas -Wunused-function -Wunused-label -Wunused-value -Wunused-variable -Wvolatile-register-var Out of those, -Wreturn-type seems like it would do the trick: Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to int. Also warn about any return statement with no return-value in a function whose return-type is not void (falling off the end of the function body is considered returning without a value) , and about a return statement with an expression in a function whose return-type is void. However, if turning on -Wall makes your code have way too many warnings, I'd recommend fixing up your code!
