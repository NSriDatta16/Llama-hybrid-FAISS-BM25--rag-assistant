What URL encoding irregularities do browsers generally tolerate?

Web browsers tend to do their best to recover malformed URLs. Let's start with a baseline google query. http://www.google.com/search?q=myquery Which results in my browser (recent-ish build of Chrome) requesting. GET http://www.google.com/search?q=myquery HTTP/1.1 Fully expected behavior obviously. Let's try putting an unescaped space into the mix. http://www.google.com/search?q=my query GET http://www.google.com/search?q=my%20query HTTP/1.1 What if we use the % character? Because it's not followed by a valid character code the browser should escape it to %25 http://www.google.com/search?q=i always give 100% GET http://www.google.com/search?q=i%20always%20give%20100% HTTP/1.1 Chrome didn't escape the %! Is space substitution the only URL transformation an average browser will/is expected to perform? Are there libraries for performing these kinds of URL "salvaging" transformations?
