I have looked it up and found http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-tabwidget.html on the Android developer site; however, that doesn't use XML for defining the layout of the tabs. Yes, it does. See step #4. UPDATE Google reorganized their documentation and got rid of this tutorial. You can see the use of XML for defining the tabs in TabWidget in this sample project .
