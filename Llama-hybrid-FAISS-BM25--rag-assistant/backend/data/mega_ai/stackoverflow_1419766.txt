Read books of Herb Sutter like Exceptional C++ or C++ Coding Standards , books from Scott Meyers, like Effective C++ . For different patterns read Design Patterns by the Gang of four (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides), the Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms by James O. Coplien is also good. If you want to go deeper - like metaprogramming, take the Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu.
