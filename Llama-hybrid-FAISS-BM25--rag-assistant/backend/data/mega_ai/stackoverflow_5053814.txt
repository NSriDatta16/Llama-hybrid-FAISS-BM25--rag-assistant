You could try to make the action to be asynchronous:- User submits a search. System displays "The system is currently searching the information based on your criteria and you will be notified shortly". System handles the user request at the mean time. Since the user isn't waiting for the result page, the user is free to browse around or do other thing in your website instead of locking up their screens. When the result is generated, system notifies the user that the search is done and provides the link for the user to view the result. This can be done by either sending an email notification to the user, or merely popping a dialog box or sliding down a notification message on the menu bar (basically something to catch the user attention). It is wise to have a separate machine to run these processing intensive scripts so that it will not slow down the entire application server especially when you have tons of users submitting the search.
