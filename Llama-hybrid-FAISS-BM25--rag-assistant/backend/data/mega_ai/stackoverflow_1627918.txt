You could also do this in your MakeFiles, like this: APP_NAME = Foo Foo_HEADERS = foo.h Foo_FILES = main.c foo.c If you're not so much familiar with MakeFiles i suggest you to take a look at Make Docs , but this is a simple example, APP_NAME sets the name of the compiled executable(in this case is Foo), Foo_HEADERS will set the headers used by your application, Foo_FILES you will set the source files of your applications, remember to put the APP_NAME (in this case Foo) at the beginning of _HEADERS and _FILES . I suggest you to use MakeFiles because they will organize you application build process and will be better for the end-user.
