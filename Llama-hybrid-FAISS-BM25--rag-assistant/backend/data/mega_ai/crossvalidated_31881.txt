One simple approach is to use an exponentially weighted moving average . This tends to emphasize recent data, while retaining some history. For example, each hour you could update the estimated popularity $y$ for a page by updating your estimate as follows: $y := (1-\alpha) y + \alpha x$, where $x$ denotes some measure of its popularity over the past hour (e.g., number of visits) and $\alpha$ is a constant that determines how rapidly the estimate discounts older values. You could then sort pages by their estimated popularity. Pages with a high estimate are "trending".
