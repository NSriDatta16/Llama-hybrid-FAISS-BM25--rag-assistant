I had the same problem and found two solutions. 1) First option is that you need to obtain the likelihood by hand and then optimize in R by using the optim command. When you use this command, you need to specify starting values for the parameters to be estimated. As far as I know, R uses 0 for all the coefficients. You need to try different initial values. Of course, you will highly unlikely get the positives coefficients if you determine these initial values by hand. My suggestion is to generate random numbers using rnorm (or some other distribution) for the initials values and then use repeat until break command. You need to break the repetition when all of the coefficients are positive. Then, you need to save these numbers so that you no longer need to run the repeat until break command. For more info, see http://www.r-bloggers.com/logistic-regression/ Another solution would be to use a Bayesian approach. If you specify uniform priors whose lower limits are 0 for your coefficients, you will get positive coefficients. You can conduct this analysis in WinBugs in minutes. Here is an example: model{ # modelâ€™s likelihood for (i in 1:n){ time[i] ~ dnorm( mu[i], tau ) # stochastic componenent # link and linear predictor mu[i]
