Do you mean: 'I don't want to write the same code in each action to load my user data and pass it to the view, which would render partial view instead'? If yes, than change your RenderPartial to RenderAction and put your logic for getting user stats from db there. But this code will execute each time the user requests the page. You might want to consider putting the values in HttpCache (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa478965.aspx) so you don't have to go to db for every request.
