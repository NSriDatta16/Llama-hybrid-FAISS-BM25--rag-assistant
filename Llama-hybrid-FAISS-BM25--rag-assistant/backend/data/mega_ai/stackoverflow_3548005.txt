For Swedish use ISO-8859-1 or UNICODE. I am not familiar with any new way to change the default charset in existing DBs in IB 2009. When you think about what's involved you'll see you'd be recreating the DB anyway; you'd be changing the storage format of all text in the DB! Easiest way to pump the data is probably a dedicated data pump like the one in DB Workbench . You need the "Pro" edition for this, but there's a free trial to see if it works. Again, consider that you may not be able to just directly copy data; you'll have to do it in a charset-aware way. This is why you should always buy your DB management tool from a European person. :)
