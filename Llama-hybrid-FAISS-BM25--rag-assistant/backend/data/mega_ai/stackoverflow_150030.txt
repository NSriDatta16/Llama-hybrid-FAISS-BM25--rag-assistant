You are seeing different values because of compiler packing rules. You can see rules specific to visual studio here . When you have a structure that must be packed (or adhere to some specific alignment requirements), you should use the #pragma pack() option. For your code, you can use #pragma pack(0) which will align all structure members on byte boundaries. You can then use #pragma pack() to reset structure packing to it's default state. You can see more information on the pack pragma here .
