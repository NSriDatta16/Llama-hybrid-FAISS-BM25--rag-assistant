How does the association of the two variables (x1 and x2) relevant to the decision on whether or not to merge them? If variables x1 and x2 represent two different methods to measure the same element, combining the two can provide a more accurate description of the element you wish to measure. E.g. if you need a variable that indicates body size, one can combine variables x1 = height and x2 = weight, either by summing x1 + x2 or by peforming a principal compenents analysis and choosing only the first component. If variables x1 and x2 are repeated measures of the same variable, creating a variable which is the average of the two may give a more accurate measure of the variable in question. Is there any other issue to consider on this topic that I didn't mention? If the variables are repeated measures, or the variables measure the same element but from two different subjects (mother and father from above) or two different parts (e.g. wrist width from both the left and the right hand of same person): It is ill-advised to create an average between them if either x1 or x2 includes outliers, or the differences between the two variables (x1 - x2) are very large.
