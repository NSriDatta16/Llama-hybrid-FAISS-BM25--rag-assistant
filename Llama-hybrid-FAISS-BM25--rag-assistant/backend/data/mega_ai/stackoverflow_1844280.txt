=COUNTIFS('Sheet1'!$E$2:$E$465,Column() + 1,'Sheet1'!$F$2:$F$465,2) Except that instead of Column() + 1, you should go Column() + WhateverNumberGivesYouTheRightAnswer So if you are in the sixth column, and want the value 7, you would say Column() + 1 (as in 6 + 1). If you are in the ninth column, and want the value 12, you would say Column() + 3 This will work if you drag it across and down.
