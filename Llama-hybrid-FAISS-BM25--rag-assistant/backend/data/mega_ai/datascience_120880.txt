Let's take a step back: why do we remove outliers? Answer: because they hinder our application . That being said, in some applications outliers are so useful that we do not want to throw away. For example, say I have a feature of how frequent (times per week) customers buy from my store, and there are a few outliers with very high purchase frequency. If my aim is to 'classify customers into high and low lifetime values', shall I throw these 'outliers' away? Probably not. They are valuable customers. Another example. Say I have a few temperature sensors out in the wild. Usually they read between 10-30 degree Celsius, but in one occasion one reads 200. Should I remove this 'outlier'? Probably yes, as it was a sensor malfunction, most likely. However, I would definitely not do this if those sensors are positioned inside a nuclear plant, for which I am writing an alert system. Back to your question: how you deal with outliers depends on your exact application; since you only generically state the application is 'classification machine learning models', I would suggest you to keep all data points, until you have a solid application. Chances are those 'outliers' turn out to be valuable for you work.
