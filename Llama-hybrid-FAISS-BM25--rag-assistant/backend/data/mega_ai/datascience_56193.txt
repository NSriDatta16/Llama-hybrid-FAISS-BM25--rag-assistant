Why does discriminiator accuracy falls to 0%, and is there a fix around this?

I am training a Vanilla-GAN(or original GAN 2016) on a pokemon dataset https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset , for few epochs the discriminator has 100% accuracy over the real examples, but as the epochs pass it falls to 0% around 4-5 epochs. One interesting effect however is that when I increase my batch size from 32 to 64, this effect is seemed to have a delayed effect. i.e It kicks in around 400-500 epochs. Please help.
