Multivariate time series forecasting and LSTM: When should I separate time series in different inputs

Let us suppose that I have a multivariate time series with two variables that vary together in time: var1 and var 2. And let us suppose that I want to forecast the n-ith value of var 2, by considering a window with the n-1 past values of var1 and var2. I would like to use a LSTM in the first layer. I'm not sure if it would be better to consider a single input with 2 dimensions (providing the n-1 values of both variables) or if it would be better to separate both variables in two different inputs (two separate LSTM whose values can be concatenated later). Is there any rule or heuristic for guiding this decision? Best regards.
