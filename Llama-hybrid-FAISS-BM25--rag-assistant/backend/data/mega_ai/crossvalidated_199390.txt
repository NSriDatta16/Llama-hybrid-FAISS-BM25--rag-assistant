How to combine two variances of Simpson's diversity index?

I know how to combine two common variances with mean and sample size. However, I don't know how to combine two variances if a variance has a special form. From Simpson's diversity index, he proposed a variance equation as shown below: $$ s^2=4[P_i^3-(P_i^2)^2]/N $$ where $P_i$ is the proportion of the number of organisms in the $i$ th species ( $n_i$ ) to the total number of organisms in the sample $N$ . Therefore, $P_i=n_i/N$ . The problem is that a new indicator developed by myself uses two elements which are from each Simpson's diversity index. Accordingly, to get the variance of this new indicator, I need to combine two variances from each Simpson's diversity index. How can I combine these two different variances from the above equation for each?
