I'd like to encourage you - WPF and C# are great choices! Don't be too afraid of "older" 3.5 materials though. Most of things are completely unchanged. As for LINQ - yes, it's another great tool. You might want to start with video tutorials here , so you get used to Visual Studio and so. Good luck!
