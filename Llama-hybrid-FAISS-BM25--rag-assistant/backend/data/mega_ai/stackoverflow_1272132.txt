If you want the folder to be part of the App bundle, you need to create a folder reference inside the Resources group, instead of a group (it will show up in Xcode as a blue folder as opposed to the yellow one). To do this, you drag the folder from Finder and select folder reference when prompted. Once you have that, you should be able to get the contents of the folder with something like: NSError *error = nil; NSString *yourFolderPath = [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"YourFolder"]; NSArray *yourFolderContents = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:yourFolderPath error:&error];
