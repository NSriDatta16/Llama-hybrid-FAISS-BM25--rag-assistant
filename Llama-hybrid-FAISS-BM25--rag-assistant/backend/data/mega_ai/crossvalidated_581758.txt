Parametric: no matter what training set you are using, your model occupies the same amount of memory in your pc (ie has the same amount of parameters)... Neural Net are parametric (otherwise good luck optimizing them) Non parametric: the size of your models may vary, usually depends on the size of the training set In other words: the "parametric" property of a model does not depend on the structure of the model (ie the NN architecture) but on how the model is defined on the very basis" SVM and Decision trees are usually used as examples for non parametric models, however they are not usually considered generative
