how about Doc2vec . Mikolov released the journal after the successful attempt of word2vec. A single feature vector for a whole paragraph or sentence or document (depending upon your use case) could be generated. Personally, I didn't get quite good results with it for sentence classification problems. Rather I went with averaged word vectors for sentences.
