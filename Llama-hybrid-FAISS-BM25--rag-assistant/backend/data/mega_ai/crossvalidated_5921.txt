(1a) You don't need the Welch test to cope with different sample sizes. That's automatically handled by the Student t-test. (1b) If you think there's a real chance the variances in the two populations are strongly different, then you are assuming a priori that the two populations differ. It might not be a difference of location--that's what a t-test evaluates--but it's still an important difference nonetheless. Don't paper it over by adopting a test that ignores this difference! (Differences in variance often arise where one sample is "contaminated" with a few extreme results, simultaneously shifting the location and increasing the variance. Because of the large variance it can be difficult to detect the shift in location ( no matter how great it is ) in a small to medium size sample, because the increase in variance is roughly proportional to the squared change in location. This form of "contamination" occurs, for instance, when only a fraction of an experimental group responds to the treatment.) Therefore you should consider a more appropriate test, such as a slippage test . Even better would be a less automated graphical approach using exploratory data analysis techniques. (2) Use a two-sided test when a change of average in either direction (greater or lesser) is possible. Otherwise, when you are testing only for an increase or decrease in average, use a one-sided test. (3) Rounding would be incorrect and you shouldn't have to do it: most algorithms for computing t distributions don't care whether the DoF is an integer. Rounding is not a big deal, but if you're using a t-test in the first place, you're concerned about small sample sizes (for otherwise the simpler z-test will work fine) and even small changes in DoF can matter a little.
