Did you try something like export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m (Or the highest value that match your machine)? If you still don't have enough memory to run maven, then I would suggest you try to disable other plugin and exclude some classes from the test coverage to check if it's really a memory issue. org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin com.example.boringcode.* com/example/dullcode/**/*.class com/example/**/*Test.class http://mojo.codehaus.org/cobertura-maven-plugin/usage.html EDIT Other ideas: Set the following properties (see the cobertura plugin properties ) -Dmaven.cobertura.report.maxmemory=xxx -Dmaven.cobertura.instrumentation.maxmemory=xxx Try to use fork or increase the memory with the following. I'm not sure whether it works for cobertura, but seem to work for junit. Snippet from this page : ... pertest or ... ... -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
