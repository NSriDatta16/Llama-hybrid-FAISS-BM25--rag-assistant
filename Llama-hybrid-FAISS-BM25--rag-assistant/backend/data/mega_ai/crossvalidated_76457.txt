(1) I don't think you've given an accurate example of bootstrap validation a) it does draw random sample with replacement, but I'm not sure it "ignores" anything b) it doesn't increase stability/accuracy of the model, but rather of the test error (2) This might be a useful starting point: Steyerberg: Internal validation of predictive models: efficiency of some procedures for logistic regression analysis (J Clin Epidemiol. 2001 Aug;54(8):774-81)
