Bayesian Analysis Example: Seeking Review and Feedback

I recently started trying to learn Bayesian analysis, but I'm not yet confident that I understand the concepts, so I did the following example and wrote out my understanding of the concepts. I would appreciate it if people could please take the time to review it and and provide feedback as to whether my understanding is correct. I have performed two experiments. In the first experiment, I had $173/323$ successes. In the second experiment, I had $125/198$ successes. I modelled the first experiment as the binomial random variable $X_1$ with parameters $n_1$ and $p_1$. I modelled the second experiment as the binomial random variable $X_2$ with parameters $n_2$ and $p_2$. I hold $n_1$ and $n_2$ fixed. I'm trying to get a Bayesian estimate for each of $p_1$ and $p_2$ and find the standard deviation of their posterior distributions. I know that the family of beta distributions is the conjugate prior for the binomial distribution, so I use that as the prior for the parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$. The hyper-parameters were chosen to be $\alpha = 0.5$ and $\beta = 0.5$ (Jeffrey's prior). If my understanding is correct, at this point, one is now ready to run simulations of these random variables. To illustrate, in Stan, my model is as follows: y1 ~ binomial(n1, p1); y2 ~ binomial(n2, p2); p1 ~ beta(alpha, beta); p2 ~ beta(alpha, beta); My understanding is that the "posterior distribution" is the distribution of $p_1, p_2$, right? The point of what we're doing here -- in Bayesian analysis and simulation -- is to find the (posterior) distribution of some unknown values (in this case, $p_1, p_2$), using the prior distribution (in this case, the beta distribution), which reflects our beliefs about the posterior distribution before running the simulation? Is my understanding of this correct? So, after running the simulation, the standard deviation of the posterior distributions of $p_1$ and $p_2$ would be the standard deviation of the distribution that was generated by the simulation? Is my understanding here correct? After I ran this simulation, I got that $p_1$ has an approximate mean of $0.54$, with standard deviation of approximately $0.03$, and $p_2$ has an approximate mean of $0.63$, with standard deviation of approximately $0.03$ (but different from the standard deviation of $p_1$). Does this sound correct? And, if so, would I be correct in saying that these mean and standard deviation values are the mean and standard deviation values of the posterior distributions for $p1$ and $p_2$?
