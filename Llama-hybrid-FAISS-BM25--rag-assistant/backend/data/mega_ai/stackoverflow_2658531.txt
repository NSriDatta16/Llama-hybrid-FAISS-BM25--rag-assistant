Projects should be cohesive . Logic should be related, and accomplishing a similar goal This answer will depend on the size of the product you are supporting. In general we organize our projects along domain and logic. And we will divide those even further, the more you divide the more organize you must be, or you are going to hit the dreaded recursive dependency issue. When I do choose to break up project it is when it grows to be too large or two areas are becoming too similar. When complexity is rising I do not split by tables, i generally split functionality. Re-usability is another excellent time to reduce lines of code, as well as introduce a new project. However be careful how many "utility" libraries you introduce because they do have impact on readability/understandability. I do not think there is a line in sand that says, if you hit 3k SLOC, you have too much. It all is contextual.
