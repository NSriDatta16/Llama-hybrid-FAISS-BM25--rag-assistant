I am working with Robert, the original poster on this, and have a problem getting to that URL with the image. If the URL is pasted in the browser: 403 Forbidden Your client does not have permission to get Images/Streams from this server. Which is new, I was getting the URL text repeated in the browser: http://bigwatersedge.axiscam.net/jpg/image.jpg?timestamp= WebClient throws and exception: "The underlying connection was closed: The connection was closed unexpectedly." I also added: WebHeaderCollection headerCollection = new WebHeaderCollection(); headerCollection.Add("http://bigwatersedge.axiscam.net/view/snapshot.shtml?picturepath=/jpg/image.jpg"); wc.Headers = headerCollection; Basically, I am having trouble retrieving the image in the URL. update: I added the HttpRequestHeader.Referer to the header collection. No exception throw, collects the image data. Have not converted the byte array to a workable image object yet.
