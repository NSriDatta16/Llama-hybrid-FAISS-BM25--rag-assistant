sIFR or Cufón have both been very useful. @font-face isn't widely accepted by browsers, so you probably won't be very successful with that. If you're using sIFR or Cufón I recommend only using it minimally for headers and subheaders. Both have scripts that will do automatic inline replacement of certain html tags with the flash element (hence, better SEO and usability) As for licensing, both methods require you to embed the font so if you've paid for a font you will have to make sure you've paid for embedding rights. Cufón requires that the embed clause allows non-flash applications to also embed it. It's not an easy to answer question as to what fonts support it - it's a per-font decision by whomever owns the font.
