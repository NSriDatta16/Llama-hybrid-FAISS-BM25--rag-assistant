Code Organization: How to best group functions, classes, etc

Scenario: You have a reasonably sized project with some forms, classes, etc. Question: How would you group your functions? Would you put the functions common to all the forms into one separate class or a number of classes depending on function? What about your database calls. Would you have one class that contained all your database functions? Or would your create a utility class that would handle the calls? Reason: I'm looking for some direction on how to best "group" functions. For instance I can see that having all the database functions in one class would make it easier to change/debug later, but is that necessary? I'm partial to the utility that handles all the connections for you and returns the formatted result but the SQL code does end up all over the place. End Note: I know there are a lot of questions but as I said I'm looking for direction, you don't have to take every answer and answer it to a T but some coding guidelines or some coding wisdom from past experiences would be greatly appreciated Many thanks,
