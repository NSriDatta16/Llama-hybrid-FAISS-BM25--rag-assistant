How to stop WPF drag and drop from locking dropped file

I have a drag and drop application (which allows users to organize their files) that takes files. The app keeps a list of strings that corresponds to the files, but it does not need access to the files themselves. The problem is that the program locks files like the application has them open. How can I release them? private void File_Dropped(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { if (!e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.FileDrop)) return; var files = e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop, true) as string[]; ImageFile iFile; foreach (var file in files) { if (_Extensions.Contains(IO.Path.GetExtension(file).ToUpper())) { iFile = new ExtendedImageFile(new StringBuilder(file).ToString()); LBXFiles.Items.Add(iFile); } } e.Handled = true; }
