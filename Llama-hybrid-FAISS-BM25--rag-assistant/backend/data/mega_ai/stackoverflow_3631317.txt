The first strange thing you notice might have to do about how host objects are implemented by the browser. localStorage is a host object , provided by the environment, JSON on the other hand, is a built-in object provided by ECMAScript. Try to resolve another built-in's and you will get more or less the same results than with JSON . Now, the difference about JSON vs window.JSON : window is just a property on the global object that points to itself, when you access the window identifier the name resolution process takes place to find it. Basically referencing: JSON; Involves only one identifier lookup (in the scope chain), and: window.JSON; Involves an identifier lookup ( window ) and a property lookup ( window.JSON ).
