When is a Neural networked considered to be overfitted?

When is a neural network considers to be overfitted to a specific task. I read somewhere that if the number of input parameter equate the number of hyper parameter, that would be an indication of overfitting.. I use CV for training. first i split the data into train/test => 90/10. and within the training set ,i do another 90/10 split, which are those data I use for the training. I then use the model for processing the complete dataset. CV would state how much i am overfitting (I am getting minor error, deviating with 2%).. But since i am using most of the data for training? am I then creating an overfitted neural network for this dataset. I am currently having 230043 training samples, 107145 total params, and validates on 25561 samples. am I overfitting?
