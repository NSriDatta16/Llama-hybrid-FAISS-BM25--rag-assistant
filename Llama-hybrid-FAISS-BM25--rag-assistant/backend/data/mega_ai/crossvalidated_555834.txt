If your time series $x_t$ can be adequately described by an AR(p) model (perhaps with a trend), consider estimating the model and producing a density forecast. E.g. if you assume normality of the model's errors, the mean of the predictive density would be the estimated conditional mean one step ahead, $\hat\mu_{t+1}$ (which is the usual point prediction) and the variance would be the estimated variance of the error term, $\hat\sigma^2$ . Then find $\hat{P}(x_{t+1}>0)$ as $1-\Phi(0; \hat\mu_{t+1},\hat\sigma^2)$ where $\Phi$ is the cumulative density function of a normal distribution with mean $\hat\mu_{t+1}$ and variance $\hat\sigma^2$ . (This assumes away any estimation imprecision of the model parameters and could become problematic in small samples.) Or if you do not assume a specific distribution, you could estimate the error distribution nonparametrically from the residuals (e.g. using kernel density estimation or just the empirical CDF), shift it by $\hat\mu_{t+1}$ and see what probability mass of that distribution is to the right of zero. That will yield an estimate of the probability you are after. You could scale the residuals by $\sqrt{\frac{n}{n-(p+1)}}$ or some other sensible factor to reflect the fact that in-sample fit tends to be better than out-of-sample prediction. Or you could replace in-sample residuals by forecast errors from a rolling window approach where you fit the model on a window of data and forecast unseen data ahead, then shift the window and repeat, and thus until you run out of data. Alternatively, try logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis or naive Bayes. A worked out example with R code and detailed explanations for each of these methods is available on p. 171-181 of James et al. "Introduction to Statistical Learning" (2nd edition, 2021). The example there tries to predict whether the market index will go up or down the next day, based on past prices and optionally past trading volumes. It should be straightforward to adapt that to your setting. (Since you mention trend, you could include an additional deterministic trend variable as a regressor.)
