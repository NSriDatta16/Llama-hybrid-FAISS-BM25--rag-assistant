Well, to do what you want to do I think you would need a custom control that derives from the IDataGridViewEditingControl interface, which you could then plug into your DataGridView. This article shows how to do this with a RichTextBox. Unfortunately I don't think a drop-in solution exists, unless you're willing to go commercial. Infragistics has a WinGrid control with which they claim you can plug in a WinFormattedTextEditor that supports hyperlinks.
