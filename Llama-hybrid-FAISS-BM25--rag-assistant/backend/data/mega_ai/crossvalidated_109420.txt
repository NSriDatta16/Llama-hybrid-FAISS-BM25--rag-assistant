Intervention Analysis - Pulse over several periods

I have a couple weekly time series and an intervention occurred over several weeks and then for some, after a period of no intervention, began again. So, the pattern is off for a period of weeks, then on for a period of weeks, then off for a period of weeks and perhaps on again. The image below tries to show the possible patterns: When there is a single pulse, then as discussed here it is pretty simple to code the intervention as a pulse (1 or that period and zero elsewhere) and code the transfer function as one of several shapes - e.g. only effecting a single period (the pulse), a permanent level shift (a step) or perhaps with a lasting (but decaying) effect (a pulse but with decay transfer function). In the situation described here though, is there the same flexibility or do we really only have the option to code the interventions as 10 separate interventions (for the top series) or 5 separate ones for the bottom series and only allow the intervention to effect the single period? I am not sure how to have any of the "pulses" have a decaying effect because where does one start and the other stop? In my reading thus far for this type of analysis I have seen the pulse and step but nothing like this, where there is an "on" for a period of time, then "off" and then on again (maybe).
