Generally your sample should be a random sample, therefore what you read is the intuitive description of credible randomness. The opposite would be systematic bias like are you only sampling from one town in a country? Or from one family in a village? Or is there a strong time trend and your cross-section is a quasi time series you're ignoring? Ask yourself these questions and if the answer is no then there should be no multicollinearity in the data. Another issue is this: most estimation procedures involve inverting a second moment matrix of the type $(X'X)^{-1}$. Now, if your data quality is so low that there is not a lot of variation in it, and this will be reflected in the second moment matrices as they measure the spread, then they may be near non-invertible. Your standard errors will be huge (b/c you're effectively dividing by zero) in this case meaning your t-stats will be low leading to less parameter significance but if you're stuck at the stage of inverting second moment matrices, then you can find a generalized inverse that will get you some coefficient but as I wrote, it is most likely insignificant.
