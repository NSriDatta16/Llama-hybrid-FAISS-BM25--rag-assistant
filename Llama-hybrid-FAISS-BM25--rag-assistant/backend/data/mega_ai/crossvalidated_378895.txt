No, you can't discard transactions, if you want to calculate any measures to evaluate how strong or good rules are. E.g. let your items be A, B, C and the transactions (baskets) A A,B A,B C You can calculate absolute frequency fr(A,B)=2 without caring about single A and single C. However, you can't evaluate the strength of rule A->B. If you include also single A you'll get fr(A)=3 correctly. Now you can calculate precision ('confidence') of A->B, P(B|A)=2/3. However, you will also need C to get the data size (n) correctly, here n=4. Now you can get the relative frequencies P(A,B)=2/4=0.5, P(A)=0.75, P(B)=0.5. Leverage of A->B is P(A,B)-P(A)P(B)=0.5-0.75*0.5=0.125. Note: The problem is computationally demanding, if you want to find optimal rules without excessive minimum frequency thresholds. I would recommend and efficient C or Java implementation.
