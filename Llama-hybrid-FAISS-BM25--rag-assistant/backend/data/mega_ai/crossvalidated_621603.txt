Clustering or factor analysis for dimensionality reduction in multivariate linear regression

I have dataset describing aggregated purchases from multiple brands. It contains variables: Brand (ordinal) Promotion (ordinal) Sales (numeric) I need to use linear regression to describe the effect of different brands and promotions on the amount of Sales. The cardinality of Promotion is low, 2 unique values, but the cardinality of feature Brand is high, around 100. As far as I understand I cannot perform One-Hot-Encoding on Brands because I will get really sparse data and the regression would be hard to interpret. So should I do factor analysis on Brands and try to maybe group them in a meaningful way? My idea involves, grouping Brands according to their amount of Sales, or according to their purchase frequency (how many people buy from these brands). The above dataset was created from the base dataset containing individual purchases. It contains variables: Brand (ordinal) Promotion (ordinal) Quantity Spent value Date It may be beneficial to my analysis, but I am not yet sure on it. Can you help me on that? Results of linear regression model without regularisation with one-hot-encoded variables Brand and Promo. Brand has over 118 unique values and dataset has around 192 datapoints. Thus the linear regression model seems to be overfitted. All the coefficients have p > 0.05 and do not seem to be significant.
