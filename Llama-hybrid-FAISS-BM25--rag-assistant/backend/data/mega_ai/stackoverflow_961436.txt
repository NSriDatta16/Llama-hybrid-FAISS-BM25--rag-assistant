I realized that its probably actually easier to do the exact reverse of what I was attempting. i.e. select count(*) as count, useragent from sessionvisit where useragent not like '%firefox%' and useragent not like '%chrome%' and useragent not like '%safari%' and useragent not like '%msie%' and useragent not like '%gecko%' and useragent not like '%opera%' group by useragent order by count desc What I'm actually trying to do is get an accurate conversion rate, and it seems to make more sense to include good browsers rather than exclude bots (good or bad). In addition if i ever find a 'session' where a 'robot' has made a purchase it probably means there is a new browser (think chrome). Currently none of my robots have made a purchase!
