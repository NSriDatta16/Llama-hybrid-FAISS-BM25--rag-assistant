May I draw your attention to another codeplex project? It's called Obtics and deals with the same issues ( http://obtics.codeplex.com ). It addresses both the first the second and the additional problem and takes reactivity to a very deep level (has a demonstration with a LINQ based raytracer). It claims full support for all LINQ statements an methods of the Enumerable class. It uses yet another mechanism to create live queries: var theResultSet = ExpressionObserver.Execute( () => from item in theSource where item.Age > 25 select item ).Cascade();
