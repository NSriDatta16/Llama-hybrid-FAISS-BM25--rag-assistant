Submitting a form using Sencha Touch

I want to build a simple form with Sencha Touch, and attach a submit handler to it. Either I'm a n00b, or this is surprisingly hard to do. Here's what I want: Attach an onSubmit handler to the form, not a onClick handler to the submit button Cancel form submission when the form is submitted. The problem is that regular Sencha Touch buttons are not buttons at all - they are just a bunch of divs and spans. Hence, tapping on the submit button doesn't fire the native form submit. As a result, a handler will need to be attached to the "button" to fire a submit on the form, and then capture the submit of the form to do what I want. This is doable, but doesn't sound elegant. Is there a better way of doing this? The second problem is that of event canceling. How do I get a handle of the submit event object so that I can call preventDefault on it? Is there any other way to do this in the Sencha Touch world?
