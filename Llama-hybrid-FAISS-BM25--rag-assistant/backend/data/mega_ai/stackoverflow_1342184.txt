Recommendations... JavaServer Faces (JSF), Struts, model2, other

We are looking at reworking a java business management web service that has been in use for over 4 years now. The software's internal architecture has been all custom built and with a bad separation of of the presentation layer and business logic. As well the overall model layer has proven it can't effectively keep up with changing business logic and needs refactored. As I am planning out this task I have been looking at available frameworks that I could leverage to make the application more friendly to new developers hired on and changing business logic. I have never used struts or JSF before but read up on them in a somewhat brief and overview method and at first glance am not overly impressed by either, however I find JSF more intriguing. First Both Frameworks seem to focus on the Controller and View portions of the MVC pattern. Leaving you to do whatever on the model/business layer. (am I correct?) With the rework we want to be able to employ outside contractors to help expedite the rework so finding a unified development methodology is important to insure quality of code and decrease inconsistencies and ramp-up times. So what recommendation would you have on frameworks, practices, etc that might help this effort. I really don't want to reinvent the wheel with a custom framework and find us in a similar situation later.
