Python Natural Language Toolkit is a library which is suitable for doing such a work. As with any NLP library, you will have to download the dataset for training separately and corpus(data) and scripts for training are available too. There are also certain example tutorials which will help you identify parts of the speech for words. By all means, I think nltk.org should be the place to go for what you are looking for. Specific questions could be posted here again.
