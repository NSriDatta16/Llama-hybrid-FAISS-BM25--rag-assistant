There are two ideas that clash slightly in your question - that of keeping the data separate to the content so it can be re purposed, and that of including formatting data. Is the formatting data part of the data, or just meta data? Haven't we seen this before; it basically seems to be a CSS / HTML conundrum. If these blocks of text fit into a known data scheme (as Mario's answer assumes) then yeah, I'd go with his answer, but re-reading your questions I'll answer (and assume) you have bits of formatting within, say, the paragraph tag that Mario used? Going with the idea the formatting is basically part of the data, not just an added extra, I'd suggest adopting something like the CSS / HTML solution. Store the text with standard XHTML tags, ready for your CSS. This could then be parsed when you want to use a standard UI (as in non web app?), and just strip the tags and replace as necessary. Of course, you could make up your own markup ([myBitOfText #] instead of ) but you may as well have one return from your database that requires no re-purposing or string manipulation.
