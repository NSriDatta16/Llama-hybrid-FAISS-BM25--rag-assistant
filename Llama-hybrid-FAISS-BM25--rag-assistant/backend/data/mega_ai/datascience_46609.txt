Python Time series: extracting features on a rolling window basis

I have a long univariate time series, and before performing some machine learning models with it, I want to extract as many features as I can from the time series on a rolling-window basis. As a quick example, for a window of size 10 , I would like to calculate statistics like mean and std deviation for the first t=0:9 points in my dataset, and have those two results occupy one row in a some new feature table, and the next row in the table will have mean and std deviation calculated on points t=1:10 , and so on and so forth, until the end of the data. Is there an efficient way to do this in Python?
