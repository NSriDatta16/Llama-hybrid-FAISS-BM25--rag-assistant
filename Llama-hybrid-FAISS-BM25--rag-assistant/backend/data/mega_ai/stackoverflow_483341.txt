Regex to match a substring within 2 brackets, e.g. [i want this text] BUT leave out the brackets?

I've managed to find the Regex to get almost the result I want here i.e. Regex r1 = new Regex(@"\[(.*?)\]"); string row = HEADERNAMES[COL1,COL2,COL3,COL4]; Match match = r1.Match(row); string result = match.ToString(); Outputs: "[COL1,COL2,COL3,COL4]"; I know I can then use: result.Replace("[", ""); result.Replace("]", ""); to get exactly what I want but I was wondering if there was a way to ommit the delimeters [ and ] from the Regex result without performing the String methods. I would have thought there was a more elegant solution using Regex itself?? Thanks in advance.
