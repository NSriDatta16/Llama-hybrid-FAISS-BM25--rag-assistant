You can do this in direct SQL but I think you'd be better off using built in wordpress functions so that if that DB structure changes at all (which it might since the MU and regular WP cores are set to be merged soon) you're still OK. It sounds like you want to be able to pull info about other blogs from the active blog. I'd do it in two steps: $blogs = get_blog_list(0,'all'); foreach($blogs as &$blog) { switch_to_blog($blog['id']); $blog['state'] = get_option('state'); restore_current_blog(); } restore_current_blog(); That'll give you a list of details for all active blogs on the MU install + the state field from the options table. Yeah, its less than elegant, but its functional with little mess. If you need to use this info multiple times in a page load then use WP's object cache to store the variable for later use. There's also a myriad of ways you could either call this via ajax or web-service from the parent blog or implement a memcache solution so that this data can be centrally stored and managed if this becomes an issue, but I think if you use the object cache here with something like WP Super Cache on the front end you should be fine.
