Interpreting logistic regression odds ratios: proportional odds

I am not understanding the interpretation of the odds ratio from logistic regression coefficients. I understand that if $\beta_1$ is sex, with male the reference group, then $e^{\beta_1}$ gives the ratio of odds of occurrence of the event for a female versus a male. What I'm not understanding is why odds are not considered to be proportional. Let's say the independent variable is time and the dependent variable is a binary variable representing occurrence of an event. When you specify the odds ratio for $\beta_1$ , you don't say anything about the independent variable time. Time could be 1,2,3,...40, but the odds ratio is still the same. The odds ratio of the event occurring for a female vs a male is still $e^{\beta_1}$ all the way through, is it not? To me this means the odds are proportional, otherwise you couldn't specify an odds ratio without also specifying the time you're talking about. I have heard that there exists a proportional odds model, but it seems to be distinct from normal logistic regression. I would appreciate clarity on this!
