Logistic regression - labeling outcome by confidence of classification

We have trained our logistic regression model to classify candidates attending interviews as 'pursue' or 'fail' (two possible outcome) Now as a post prediction step, we are planning to categorise the candidates as strong/mediocre/weak based on the model's probability score. What is the correct way to categorise the candidates ?
