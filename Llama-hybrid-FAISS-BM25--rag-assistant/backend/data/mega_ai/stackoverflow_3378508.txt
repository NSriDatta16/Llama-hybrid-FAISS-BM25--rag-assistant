Is there a tool to keep my C source files in order?

I have some C source files that are slowly expanding. I tend to keep the prototypes with documentation in the .h file in good order, grouped into relevant functions and types with #pragma mark . The code is written and documented in a way that requires reading the .h file alongside the .c file. I'd like the files to be ordered in a way that facilitates this. Is there a way to keep the function declarations in the .c file in the same order as their prototypes in the .h file? I'm looking for a tool to read the .h file (with #pragma mark s if possible) and re-order the .c file correspondingly. Possible?
