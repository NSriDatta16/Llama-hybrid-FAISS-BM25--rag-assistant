Language model in deep learning - hard time to understand the task

I'm having a hard time to understand the task of "language model". Translate, speech, Spelling, sentiment analysis, those I understand, but what does "language model" means?! is it just the action of embedding? I'm sorry for my ignorance, and will be happy to get your help. Thanks.
