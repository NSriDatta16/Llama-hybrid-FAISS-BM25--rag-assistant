Calculate claim amount?

Let X be the random variable representing the claim amount for flooding damage from house insurance policies of bungalow type houses. Past claims show evidence that X is a normally distributed random variable with an average claim amount of μ = 21000 euro and a standard deviation of σ = 4000 euro. e) An insurance company notes that for 2.5% of claims the claim amount is above K euro, calculate K. I am lost is 2.5% is the z-score? How can you solve this?
