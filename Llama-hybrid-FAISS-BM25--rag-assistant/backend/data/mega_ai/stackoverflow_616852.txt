How do I create an Active X control for use in Internet Explorer 7+?

I'm using Delphi 2007 and I am looking for some resources and best practices for writing an ActiveX control for embedding within Internet Explorer 7.0 (and higher). My goal with this ActiveX control is to be able to retrieve information about which websites the user is visiting, and the type of connection (e.g. HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, etc). I'm not looking to sniff traffic, just for reviewing the addresses they are visiting. Or, if it would be easier, I would ideally like to write a toolbar similar to AVG Anti-Virus' free toolbar that it installs in IE that "verifies" links on pages as safe links. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Regards.
