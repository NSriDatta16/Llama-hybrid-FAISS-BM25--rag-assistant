In my opinion, MBUnit is the way to go. It's vastly superior to NUnit (very similar, but with Row Tests and Transaction support) and other MS tools (Team Suite was not really successful, I would discourage its use). MbUnit provides advanced unit testing support with advanced fixtures to enable developers and testers to test all aspects of their software.
