Signature verification - machine learning

I have to do a project on signature verification. My goal is having a program with two images as inupt (one is a genuine signature of a selected subject and the other one is the one that I want to test). I have a dataset to train the algorithm with 3000 signatures: half of them are genuine and the other ones are forgery, and they are taken from 150 subjects. My doubt regards the confrontation between the two images I use as input (the genuine one and the one I want to test). How can I deal with it?
