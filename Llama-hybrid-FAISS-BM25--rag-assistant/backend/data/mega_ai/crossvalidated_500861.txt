Logistic Regression: Behavior of Independent Variable Plots

I'm doing a study where I am using a logitisc regression to estimate the probability that an account will prepay their monthly scheduled bill. Data description includes: total observations = 40000, total number of observations that prepay (1) = 5250, total number of observations don't prepay (0) = 34750. Right now, my explanatory variables include: Account Age and Incentive to Prepay. Both variables are continuous and measured quantitatively. When I plot Incentive and Account Age against the dependent variable, which is prepaid = 1 and no prepay = 0, I get these interesting graphs. I'm not necessarily sure how I should interpret these graphs. My initial thought, is that I need to change the functional form to quadratic/cubic for the graph with incentive. I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the behavior of these graphs. Thanks a lot!
