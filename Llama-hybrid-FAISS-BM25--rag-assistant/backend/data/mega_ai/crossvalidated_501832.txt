When Hotelling first used the words 'analysis', 'component(s)' and 'principal' together. It was in the plural form. But it wasn't exactly as PCA yet and it was 'method of principal components' or in the title 'Analysis of a complex of statistical variables into principal components.' In most other languages the plural form is used. For instance, in French it is 'Analyse en composantes principales' and in German it is 'Hauptkomponentenanalyse'. However, in the English language the singular form is more common. The reason for the singular form is because this is the common way in English language. See for the canonical question on the English forum: When are attributive nouns plural? . And there are many other related question asking for instance for ' number(s) analysis '.
