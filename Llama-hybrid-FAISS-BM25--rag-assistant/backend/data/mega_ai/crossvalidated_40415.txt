I assume you measured blood pressure (BP) multiple times before the physical exercise because you thought the BP measure is somewhat variable. If so, you could average all the pre-exercise BP measures and get one more reliable value for each person. As to the post-exercise measures of BP, you might do the same thing. If you think the post-exercise measures of BP will slowly return to baseline, you might average the first few post BP measures for each person to get one, more reliable post-exercise BP value for each person. At that point you will have one pre-exercise BP value (i.e., the before average) and one post-exercise BP value (i.e., the after average) for each person. Then you can analyze the data in various ways. One simple but effective approach is to calculate a before-after difference score for each person. Then you can do a Mann-Whitney test between men and women on these difference scores. (You could also consider using a t-test because it might have higher power, especially with your sample size.) Good luck.
