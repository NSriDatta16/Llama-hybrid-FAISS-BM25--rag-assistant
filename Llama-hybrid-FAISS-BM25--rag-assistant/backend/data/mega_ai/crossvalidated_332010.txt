Logistic Regression (encapsulating chronology within features)

I am looking for suggestions on how I might construct features that would encapsulate the timings/order of events (ultimately, to be used to predict a future event) Background I have timestamped interactions between customers and a business: Customer Date Code Interaction ------------------------------------------------ Donald 1 Jan A letter sent: change of T&Cs Donald 2 Jan B letter sent: notification of fine Donald 3 Jan C customer pays fine Donald 4 Jan *Y *customer files complaint (about fine) ------------------------------------------------ Theresa 1 Jan D customer applies for product Theresa 2 Jan E application rejected Theresa 3 Jan F customer files complaint (about rejection) ------------------------------------------------ Angela 1 Jan B letter sent: notification of fine Angela 2 Jan D customer applies for product Angela 3 Jan E application rejected Angela 4 Jan *Y *customer files complaint (about fine) I would like to use this data to predict how likely Y will occur within some timeframe, given what has occured up until now. If I use the shopping basket analogy, the logistic regression model can be used to predict if item Y will be in the basket given that item A is present, or if item B is present, etc. In my context, it can be used to predict if a complaint (about fine) will happen in a customer jounrey given that interaction A has occured, or if interaction B has occured, etc. However, with a customer journey, the combination of events (and even the order in which they happen) are likely more important than the individual events themselves. Question What new features can I generate that would encapsulate the chronological order of customer-business interactions? Current solution My convoluted solution is to one-hot encode each customer journey: Does A occur? A Does B occur? B Does A happen at any point after B? A>B Does B happen at any point after A? B>A etc. and then use logistic regression . Customer | A B C A>B B>A A>C C>A B>C C>B A>B>C | Y ---------+-------------------------------------------------+---- Donald | x x x x x x x | 1 Theresa | | 0 Angela | x | 1 Does my solution sound sensible? Are there any better suggestions? Bonus points if there's a suggestion that encapsulates the time elapsed between subsequent events.
