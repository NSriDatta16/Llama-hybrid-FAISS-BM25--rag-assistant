As @Tom Minka pointed out most ML techniques assume iid inputs. There are a few solutions though: One can use all the past time series samples within the system 'Memory' as one feature vector, ie: x=[x(t-1),x(t-2),...x(t-M)]. However, this has 2 issues: 1) depending on your binning, you may have a huge feature vector 2- some methods require features within the feature vector to be independent, which isn't the case here. There exist many ML techniques which are specifically designed for such time-series data, for example Hidden Markov Models, which have been used very successfully for seizure detection, speech processing, etc... Finally, an approach I have taken is to use 'feature extraction' techniques to convert a dynamic regression problem (which has the element of time) into a static one. For example, the Principal Dynamics Mode (PDM) approach maps the input past feature vector ([x(t-1),x(t-2),...x(t-M)]) onto a static one ([v(1),v(2),..v(L)]) by convolving the past with a system-specific linear filterbank (the PDMs), see Marmarelis, 2004 book or Marmarelis, Vasilis Z.
