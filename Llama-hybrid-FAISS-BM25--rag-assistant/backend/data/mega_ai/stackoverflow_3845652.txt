Shin, considering you have a fixed length string in datbase, you are already using the best method to format your time (substr). This gives you the least requirements for computing power. If, however, you are worried about your code elegance and, if by any chance the string is not a fixed length (like 9:31:02 instead of 09:31:02 ) you can use this code: $hours = strtok( $dbTime, ':'); $minutes = strtok( ':'); $formattedTime = $hours . ':' . $minutes i hope this helps Slavic
