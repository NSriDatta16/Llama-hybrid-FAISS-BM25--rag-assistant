What are you measuring efficiency by? Assuming there is no other data associated with each FavoriteFood (in which case obviously you want two tables), a one-table approach is probably more time efficient, as the unnecessary join would incur an extra processing cost. On the other hand, a two-table approach may be more space-efficient, since it takes less space to store an index than a string, but that depends on how the particular database that you're using optimizes storage of repeated strings.
