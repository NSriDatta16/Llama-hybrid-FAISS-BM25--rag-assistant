This is a logistic regression model. You speak of a unimodal distribution, but I don't know what you mean by that in this context. A linear model would have the probability of plant growth increase as rainfall increases or decreases, but not both. If you want the probability to reach a maximum at a certain rainfall level and decrease as you move away from that level, you would need some ability to specify a function with that type of behavior. One way to do that would be to include a squared term.
