car::Anova with random factor or lmer with random factor

I have 36 rats, some are highly impulsive (HI), some are low-impulsive (LI) and some are MIDs. I ran them on two separate days on an attention task with a variable ITI paradigm whereby a cue is presented pseudo-randomly after 3s, 5s, 7s and 9s. I'm looking at the probability of making a correct response (DV) as a function of the impulsivity phenotype (3 levels); Day (2 levels) and the ITI (4 levels), my random effect is rat_ID. I'm not sure whether I should use lmer or car::Anova with a random factor, below are codes for both: model = lme(prob_correct ~ Day*ITI*impulsivity, random=~1|rat_ID, data=mydat2, method="REML") Anova(model) OR lmecoeff
