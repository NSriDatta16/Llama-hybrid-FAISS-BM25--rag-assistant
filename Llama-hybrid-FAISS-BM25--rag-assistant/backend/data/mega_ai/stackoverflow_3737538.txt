Can you include two models in one query in CakePHP?

I am building a book review application. In the Review model, I have book_id and several fields like author_rating and/or scary_rating. In the Book model, I have a search() function that I'd like to use to search for books with certain characteristics, like an author_rating of above 5, for example. What is the best way to accomplish this? I know these are probably wrong, but I could add the attributes (author_rating, scary_rating, etc) into the book model and update them (average them in) each time a review is submitted; or, I could run a cron task that updates those fields every so often. But is there a better way where I could query both the Book and Review models to come up with Books and meet certain criteria defined by looking at the Reviews database? Does that make sense?
