Android: NLP library for date recognition in string

I am currently working on an android app which should make appointments automatically by reading the incoming messages from your mobile phone. I've managed to create a service which monitors the incoming messages, but now I need an Natural Language Processing algorithm in order to find the date for the appointment. I've tried DialogFlow , but I found out it cannot be used offline and that is not the purpose of the app. It should work offline too ! Does anyone have a suggestion for a library I can use?
