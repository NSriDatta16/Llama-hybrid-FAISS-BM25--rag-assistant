SVN hook to check a change was also made to the corresponding Test class

Has anyone come across an SVN pre-commit hook that works with the following logic? If "MyClass.java" has been modified and is being committed, then there must also be a modification to "MyClassTest.java", by naming convention. The goal here is to make sure that a developer made changes to the corresponding unit test, when s/he changed a piece of code. I know this can be cheated by simply changing a little bit of formatting. But the goal is not to stop cheating. It is to very strongly encourage test driven development in a team that is moving to it. A bonus would be, for when the change is just a refactor, for the hook to ignore the check if the submit comment has the word "REFACTOR". (after all pure refactors should always be committed by themselves)
