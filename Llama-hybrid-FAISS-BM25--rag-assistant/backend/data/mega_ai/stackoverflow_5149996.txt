Updating Self-Installed PHP files?

I am in the final stages of completing my project ( vizulium - open-source photography CMS). I have one final remaining stumbling block: updating the software. My idea that I wanting to implement is this: Check newest version at Vizulium website (page just displays current stable version). If newer version exists, and the user requests it: a. Zip the updated files on Vizulium server b. Download the files to the user's server c. Unzip contents I already have a tracking system in place that keeps track of the updates (datetime) that I push. I have not began step 2. All is in PHP and mySQL. Is this a typical implementation of the problem? Do I need to clarify anything? I am not using FTP since it is a self-install and I assume the user is programming-illiterate.
