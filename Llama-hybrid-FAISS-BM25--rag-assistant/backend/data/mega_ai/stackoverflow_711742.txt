eventOne is a public event backed by a private field of type EventHandler . eventTwo is a public field of type EventHandler . Basically an event only encapsulates the ideas of "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" in the same way that a property only encapsulates the ideas of "get" and "set" rather than the actual storage. (As far as the CLR is concerned an event can also expose a "raise" method, but C# never uses this. Ignore it.) See my article on events ( alternate link ) for more about the difference between delegates and events.
