How to perform cross validation in semi-supervised learning

Suppose in semi-supervised learning, we have labeled set $X_L$ and unlabeled set $X_U$ Is it ok to validate model performance on labeled data only? How to do cross-validation in transductive learning, in which the test set is $X_U$ , which can also be considered as a part of the training data? While performing label propagation or graph neural networks on graph-based data, should we split all nodes randomly, or preprocess(like finding connected components) first?
