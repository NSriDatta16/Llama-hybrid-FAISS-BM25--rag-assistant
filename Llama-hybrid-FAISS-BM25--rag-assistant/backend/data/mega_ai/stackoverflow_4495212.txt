Those glyphs are not in the font. The standard fallback font of serif should be making it obvious; hereâ€™s what I see (using a pangram from Wikipedia): If you download the font and look inside (using Font Book on Mac, or something like FontForge), you can see which glyphs are present or absent. To fix this, I would enter the characters you need into the previewer. A quick selection of sans-serif fonts which contain the glyphs you need: Museo Sans whose 500 weight may be used freely online. Aller , which may require a license. DejaVu Sans and Droid Sans, which many users will have installed. Helvetica, Geneva, and FreeSans. Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Calibri, Candara, and Arial, which almost all users will have installed. Calibri appears to be a decent match for Lato, so you might use font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; (without embedding anything at all).
