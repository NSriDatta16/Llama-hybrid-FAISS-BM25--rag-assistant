Discrepancy in inferential tests using metafor

I am running analyses using metafor, looking at different scores between two groups. All of these are using raw mean differences (so rma(yi = MEAN_DIFFERENCES, sei = STANDARD_ERRORS) . A co-author suggested we also provide standardized mean differences, so I computed means, SDs, and group Ns for each analysis and passed them in (so rma(m1i=MEANS_EXPERIMENTAL, m2i=MEANS_CONTROL, sd1i=SDS_EXPERIMENTAL, sd2i=SDS_CONTROL, n1i=NS_EXPERIMENTAL, n2i=NS_CONTROL, measure="SMD") ). Results passed an initial sanity check, but I noticed that the inferential stats ( zval and pval ) are inconsistent with what I obtained using the mean differences (in one instance this resulted in a p-value above alpha using the SMD analysis but below it using the MD analysis). Does this indicate some underlying issue, or am I misunderstanding how rma.uni computes model results? Is there a more elegant way of doing this (e.g., computing a SMD and confidence intervals from a model that used MDs)? EDIT: example output from one of the MD analyses... Random-Effects Model (k = 23; tau^2 estimator: REML) tau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0.0604 (SE = 0.0248) tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0.2457 I^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability): 81.86% H^2 (total variability / sampling variability): 5.51 Test for Heterogeneity: Q(df = 22) = 80.6150, p-val And the same original variables, but SMD...
