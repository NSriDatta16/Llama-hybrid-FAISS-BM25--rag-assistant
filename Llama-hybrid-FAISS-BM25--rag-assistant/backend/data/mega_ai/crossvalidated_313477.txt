After talking to someone about this, we decided that the average of the ratios (i.e. the mean) is a better statistic in this case. The problem domain is discovering mathematical theorems. Our reasoning is that some inputs have higher absolute numbers because they're "more amenable" to stating theorems. As an example, it's easy to state lots of theorems about the plus function; it's not so easy to state theorems about the Riemann zeta function. However, we would not be justified in saying that "more amenable" inputs are better than "less amenable" ones. Our intention is to quantify the performance of mathematical search algorithms, not to make philosophical claims about what things are "mathematically better" than others. Hence there is no justification to the weighting that a ratio of the averages would imply, so we should use the average of the ratios since it treats all inputs equally (a good "default" position to take, in lieu of such justifications).
