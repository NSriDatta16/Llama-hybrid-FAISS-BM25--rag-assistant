How to solve multicollinearity problem in a linear regression?

I tried to do a OLS linear regression and got the following error message the end of the output: " 2 The smallest eigenvalue is 1e-25. This might indicate that there are strong multicollinearity problems or that the design matrix is singular." I thought regression was supposed to solve/account for multicollinearity. Should I do PCA before regression and try this again? How do I solve this error message? Is it even significant? Input Data: EDIT: Took advice from commenter.
