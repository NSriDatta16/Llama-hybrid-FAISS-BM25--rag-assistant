Input representation in a neural network

I have been going through this book ( https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf ) on sequence labelling by Alex Graves. On page 29, under the section of input representation he states that the performance of neural networks are almost similar over a wide range of input representations. If some of you can put some light on this paragraph from the book and explain why is it that neural networks are relatively robust to input data representations? Thanks!
