How to get Average search volume AND Average CPC with same Google Adwords API service?

I am using the Google Adwords API to retrieve the Average search volume for a given keyword, using the TargetingIdeaService get function . Now I would like to also retrieve the Average CPC for the same keyword. All I could find so far is a way to do that with the TrafficEstimatorService , but that implies additional cost, I believe. So my question is: is there any way to retrieve both : the Average Search Volume, the CPC data using the same service (either TargetingIdeaService or TrafficEstimatorService, or other)?
