I am working on the same problem right now. I installed all necessary libs in my local Maven repo and from there I put it into our Company Maven Repo. It is not working quite right yet. Some of the tests fail that work nicely in my Maven test run, but since the outcome of the test is not important for the coverage data, I am quite satisfied. Here is my Maven snippet. I hope that helps. org.apache.maven.plugins maven-antrun-plugin 1.1 false site run org.crap4j crap4j 1.1.6 org.kohsuke args4j 2.0.1 com.agitar asmlib 1.0 commons-httpclient commons-httpclient 3.0 com.agitar coverage 1.0
