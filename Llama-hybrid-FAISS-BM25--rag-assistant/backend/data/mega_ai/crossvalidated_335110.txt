Markov Chain - "Expected Time"

The Megasoft company gives each of its employees the title of programmer (P) or project manager (M). In any given year 70 % of programmers remain in that position 20 % are promoted to project manager and 10 % are fired (state X). 95 % of project managers remain in that position while 5 % are fired. How long on the average does a programmer work before they are fired? Solved it through the transition matrix where the equations are, m(P) = 1+ 0.7 m(P) + 0.2 m(M) m(M)= 1 + 0.95 m(M) So m(M)= 20, and m(P)= 16.67 , I hope someone can confirm this. Thank you
