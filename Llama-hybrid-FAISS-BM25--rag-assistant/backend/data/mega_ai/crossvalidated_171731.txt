What you're trying to do sounds a lot like what the authors of this paper propose: http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5016 Essentially what they do is bootstrapping on small subsets of their very large dataset and then average over these bootstrap results. I haven't read the paper closely (and would probably have made this a comment rather than an answer if I were able to), but it looks as though they argue that they can get consistent estimates with their method.
