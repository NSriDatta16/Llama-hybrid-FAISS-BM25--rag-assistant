There's tons of syntax issues here. You don't have just 1 issue, you have a lot. Just fixing the one you asked about is going to lead to about 5 - 10 more. I'll comment them inline first. //This should probably be MemStorage. In Java classes start with a capital letter. //It should also probably be public. class memStorage { float storedNum1, storedNum2; //constructor //This isn't a constructor. This is a method. It would be a constructor if it matched the name //of the class AND didn't return a type of "void" void Memory(float num1, float num2){ storedNum1 = num1; storedNum2 = num2; } //Store numbers and call them when needed //Store the first number void mem1(float num1){ num1 = number; // The value of number is undeclared. This is the syntax error you ran into. // Also note that you didn't store in storedNum1. println("number 1 has been stored"); } //Store the second number void mem2(float num2){ num2 = number; // The value of number is undeclared. This is the syntax error you ran into. // Also note that you didn't store in storedNum2. println("number 2 has been stored"); } } // This method isn't within the body of any class. Methods always belong inside of a class. // The way you write this method, it looks like it should be the main method of another class // You are using to hand test the MemStorage class void processNumber(char number){ //Instantiate memory storage class and execute method memStorage storedNum1 = new memStorage(); storedNum1.mem1(); //print keypressed numbers println(storedNum1); //This method doesn't exist. You probably mean System.out.println() // Furthermore, you didn't override toString(), so it wouldn't print anything meaningful. } Here's how I would clean this up and retain what appears to be your intention. public class MemStorage { private float storedNum1; private float storedNum2; public MemStorage(float num1, float num2){ this.storedNum1 = num1; this.storedNum2 = num2; } public void setNum1(float num1){ this.storedNum1 = num1; System.out.println("Number 1 has been stored."); } public void setNum2(float num2){ this.storedNum2 = num2; System.out.println("Number 2 has been stored."); } public float getNum1(){ return this.storedNum1; } public float getNum2(){ return this.storedNum2; } // Hand Test public static void main(String[] args){ MemStorage memStorage = new MemStorage(0,0); memStorage.setNum1(1.23454f); System.out.println(memStorage.getNum1()); } } You really need to go back to basics and start with a beginners tutorial.
