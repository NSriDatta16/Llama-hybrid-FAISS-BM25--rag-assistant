Your graph shows that as you shift hr and data.mem the peak positive correlation between them is when there is no lag of hr. Note that the x-axis is just units of shifting the values, your times are never used. In fact, none of them are even times, if you check str(data) you'll see that your time is just a factor. But hr is a data.frame with one factor in it called hours. I'm not sure why you want to do a cc with that. Perhaps you really wanted: ccf(data$men, data$women) That's more reasonable. Note that the x-axis isn't time but can easily be translated because each value is evenly spaced. So, a shift of one is a shift of one hour. You'd have to worry about having a time series if you had uneven spacing. And what the graph shows is that men and women tend to be subscribing at around the same times.
