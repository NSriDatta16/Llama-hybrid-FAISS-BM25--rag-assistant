Likelihood Matrix from a Random Forest?

I'm going through the supporting material of a paper ( https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/81 ) , trying to reproduce their results (see below, note that HVG=highly variable gene). The data this methodology is being applied to is a matrix of single cell sequencing gene expression data. We're talking ~1100 genes and ~760 cells. The idea is to classify cells based on the gene expression. I'm struggling to properly understand their use of a random forest model in step 3. They refine the features under consideration in step 2, and presumably use the tentative identities in 1 as training data for randomForest(). I understand that they can then use this model to predict further data, but get confused when they start talking about forming a likelihood matrix. So let my question be the following: How can you begin with a random forest model and extract a 'likelihood matrix' to judge classification. What is this intended to mean? I feel I must be misunderstanding, so any insight would be much appreciated. (In addition, if you understand how they are applying hierarchical clustering that would also be great. I can't quite work out if they're clustering the cells or the genes, and where the identifiers come in)
