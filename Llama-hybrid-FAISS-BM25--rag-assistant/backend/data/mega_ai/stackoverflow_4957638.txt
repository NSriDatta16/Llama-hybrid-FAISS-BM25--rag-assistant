You'll need to make sure you've created a hosted azure storage service via the Windows Azure portal. When creating the storage service, you provide the account name and the system will assign two keys. Use these two values in your connection string settings. You can either manually edit the string in the service configuration, or my preferred approach is to set it via the role's property settings. Simply right click on the role in the cloud service project in visual studio, then select properties. You'll be able to access the role's settings via one of the tabs. Use the provided dialog box to modify the connection string by inputing the account name and connection string for your storage service.
