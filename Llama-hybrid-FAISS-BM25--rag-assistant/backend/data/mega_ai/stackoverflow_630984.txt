jQuery UI Dialog Issue With IE

I am using the new jQuery 1.3.2 and jQuery-ui-1.7 libraries along with the UI Dialog. I have a div tag with several form elements (textbox, checkbox, etc.) in it. Upon page load, jQuery shows the div as a dialog. This works absolutely fine in FF, but in IE, the height of the div is wrong. It is just showing the title bar a bit of the content. I explicitly set the height when creating the div. If I set the height option after opening the dialog, the height is corrected, but the content is blank (shows the top third of a textbox). If I allow the dialog to be resizable, if you resize it in IE it works fine, but I don't want to force IE users to resize just to see the contents. Any ideas? Here is the code I use to create the dialog: $('#dialogDiv').dialog({ bgiframe: true, height: 400, width: 620, modal: true, draggable: true, resizable: false, close: function(event, ui) { if($('#agree').val() != '1') location.href = 'somepage.html'; } });
