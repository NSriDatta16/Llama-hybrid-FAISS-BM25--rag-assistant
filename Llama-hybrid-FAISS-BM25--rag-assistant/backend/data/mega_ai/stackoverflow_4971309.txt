How about using SQLite ? You wouldn't need to install anything else than your software. Here is a wrapper for .NET . To answer your question regarding looking up the filename on the drive, that depends on what kind of drive it is. If it is an SSD it will probably not take long at all, if it is a mechanical drive and you are using indexing it will also be fast. However if you don't use indexing and have a slower mechanical drive, it will be slow. You could also consider a RAM Disk / RAM Drive if you really want performance and want to have it stored on a filesystem. However, you would need to store it on a persistant storage as well.
