Python urlopen connection aborted - urlopen error [Errno 10053]

I have some code that uses mechanize and beautifulsoup for web scraping some data. The code works fine on a test machine but the production machine is blocking the connection. The error i get is: urlopen error [Errno 10053] An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine I have read through similar posts and I cannot find this exact error. The site I am trying to scrape is HTTPS but I have also had the same error occur with an HTTP site. I am using python 2.6 and mechanize 0.2.4. Is this due to the proxy or, as the error says, something on my local machine?? I've written in for mechanize to use the system's proxy: br = mechanize.Browser() br.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1')] br.set_proxies({}) #will use system default proxy page = br.open(url) html = page.read() soup = BeautifulSoup.BeautifulSoup(html) Again, this all works on my test machine, but the production machine gives that Error 10053.
