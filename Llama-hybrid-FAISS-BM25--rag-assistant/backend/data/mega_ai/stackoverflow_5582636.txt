Your question seemed a little vauge, so Im answering my interpretation of your question. You didnt demonstrate what you got, but, Im going to guess you got a list of grades with an average by class, not classes with grades.. So, while I think theres a few questions in there. First. select avg(grade), classname from classes left join grade on classes.id = grades.class_id group by classname Should give you the average grade by class. What is cijfers? you didnt really include much about that yet you also asked it to average it somehow.
