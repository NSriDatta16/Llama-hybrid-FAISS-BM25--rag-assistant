How to choose the best number of installments to sell an item

I have a dataset about previous sales. It contains both sold and cancelled item information. Which includes prices and number of installements for the item. Here I want to increase the probability of selling an item deciding the best number of installments (and may be duration of installments). I am not sure what is the machine learning algorithm to use for this problem. It seems like I have to predict the number of installements for an item to sell it. It might be a recommendation problem but I am not sure how to put the problem into recommendation model or any other model. Appreciate your insights.
