Is there a bag of tricks for fully-connected networks training on tabular data?

There are lots of discussions and research about tips and tricks that are helpful for convolutional networks training. (Like in this paper ). The new architectures/optimizers/layers emerge very often, especially in the fields of computer vision and NLP. I wonder is there something similar for the fully connected networks applied to the tabular/structured data classification? The most widely used approach I see is to use embeddings layers, concatenate them with numerical input, and pass it through the stack of fully-connected layers (probably with dropouts and batch normalization). Are there any other recommendations or state-of-the-art methods applied for the tabular data, any custom architectures suitable for this task? Or the "simple" approach outlined above is the best available solution? I understand that people mostly use boosted trees or linear models in this case but I would like to investigate possible solutions available in the Deep Learning world.
