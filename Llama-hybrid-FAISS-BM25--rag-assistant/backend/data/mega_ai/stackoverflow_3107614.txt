If you are using an out-of-process storage for the session such as SQL Server or state process you need to decorate the objects that you intend to store in session with the [Serializable] attribute because they need to be transmitted over the wire and saved as a binary representation. Later when you try to read them from the session ASP.NET will fetch this binary representation over the wire and deserialize them back to the original object.
