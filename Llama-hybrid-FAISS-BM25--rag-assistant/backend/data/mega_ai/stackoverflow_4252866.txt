You have it backwards: Third-party apps are sandboxed so they cannot access "protected" data, including some system data and other apps' data. System apps tend to not be sandboxed and have extra privileges (they might all do). For example, App Store has to be able to upgrade other apps, and exploiting holes through Safari was one way to root a phone (suggesting Safari runs as root). Nowhere is app data protected from the user. Instead, Apple apps do not expose the filesystem (and third-party apps can only expose a small portion of it). Additionally, the "two areas of storage" are actually / (more or less the firmware image) and /var/mobile (more or less the user data partition). AIUI, upgrading the OS overwrites / but leaves /var/mobile intact; this is how a normal upgrade manages to preserve all your data without a long backup/restore process. IIRC, system apps are in /Applications and third-party apps are installed to /var/mobile/Applications. I'm not sure what category Apple apps distributed on the App Store fall under (iBooks, Remote, Pages/Numbers/etc).
