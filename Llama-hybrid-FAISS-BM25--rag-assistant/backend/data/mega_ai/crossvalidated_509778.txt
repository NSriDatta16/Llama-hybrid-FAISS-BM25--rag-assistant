Your question : Is every data point generated by the same realization of the parameter? My answer : No. I think the parameter changes each time a sample is drawn. My reasoning : I looked into page 83 of "Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan," by Richard McElreath (1st Edition), and found the following code: sample_mu This code basically generates 10,000 draws from a normal distribution, where the mean follows a normal prior, and sigma follows a uniform prior. The code indicates that the parameter mu and sigma changes each time a sample is drawn. Suppose otherwise and say the same parameter value is used for all the sampled observations. Then this sample will contain information about a single value from the distribution of the parameter, from which you cannot estimate the hyper-parameters.
