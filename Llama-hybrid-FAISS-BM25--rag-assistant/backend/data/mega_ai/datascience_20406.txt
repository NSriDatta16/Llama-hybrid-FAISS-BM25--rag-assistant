How to distort data in a clever way?

For example, I have some time series. How can I change my data, so it will not be obvious to understand what was original values? Ideally transformation would allow to revert and reconstruct original data with some noise(or to save the relationship between time series values with no option to revert to original values) I thought of: multiplying each value of series by some number, which will do shift and scale operation or I can compute some continuous function(like log), where argument is my time series data. Nevertheless, I believe there should be more advanced method. Thanks! Update: After careful considerations, and answer of @D.W. below and trying to transform data, I found that I spend more time on this than on main problem I have. Initial problem was twofold: 1) to send real data to home computer to play at home any time I want. 2) to send real data to home computer, transform it a bit, to share with people in the web, to get some advise on my main problem. After thinking, stressing, askying, googling I decided to drop the idea to do anything. Few good links to people who have the same problem and are intended to transfer, transform data: For problem 1) I believe stream cipher is a an option to read more about ( as it transforms your data to a random string). Result is bad, as if one will look at your working computer logs, you are busted. For problem 2) read about laplace noise . Also, believe to be bad. Regards.
