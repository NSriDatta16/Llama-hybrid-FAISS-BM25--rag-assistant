Combine Pandas DataFrame Rows Based on Matching Data and Boolean

I have a Pandas DataFrame with sales data and columns for year , ISO week , price , quantity , and organic [boolean] . Because each row represents a different location, dates are repeated. I would like to combine rows with matching year , ISO week , and organic . Ideally, the combined row would have the average price and sum of total quantity. Any help is much appreciated!
