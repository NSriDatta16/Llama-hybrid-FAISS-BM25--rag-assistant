rotate an image with touch

I making an app which sets the sleep timer with a clock .Basically it is clock which has a single hand which user can move to set his sleep time .I tried to rotate the image with uitouch but it rotates from middle but i want it to rotate from the tip.Secondly i want that the image only rotates when user is touching the tip of the image but in my project the image is also rotating when use touches any part of the screen.Also i want to rotate the image in both directions but in my project it moves only clockwise due to this method image.transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(image.transform, degreesToRadians(1)); Can anybody give me hints or solutions about how can it be done? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ // touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; touchLocation = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; NSLog(@"began"); } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // get touch event [image.layer setAnchorPoint:CGPointMake(0.0,0.0)]; if ([touch view] == image) { image.transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(image.transform, degreesToRadians(1)); //image.center = touchLocation; } } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ NSLog(@"end"); }
