I have an ipod touch 3rd generation ,i record audio using Headphone mic.Whatever i received input over mic , i want to display its frequency range(hz) in UILabel. I also downloaded the code aurio touch but all give some tips to find frequency.No one gave any sample code to determine frequency using fft in auriotouch.I am new to iphone app development.This is my first task,so i want done it good.So plz guide me a right way to do this.And i am also didnt know about digital signal processing.(I have one doube , is it only possible to determine frequency using drawed area of sine wave or we calculate over own). For long surfing i have got one more sample name SCListener , there is source in github.When i download and run the code it displayed averagePower,peakPower,and frequency values displayed in label.Is this correct example to use in my code ?And also i didnt know the output should be in hz or khz. How to check the recorded frequency displayed in label should be correct ? Plz plz help me ........ Thanks in advance..Sorry for my bad english.
