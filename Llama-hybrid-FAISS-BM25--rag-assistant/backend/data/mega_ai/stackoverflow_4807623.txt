XSLT Transform with Character 8221

I'm transforming an XML document using javax.xml.transform.Transformer and XSLT. The document contains the characters “ and ” (Java Integer Code 8220 and 8221). These are not the normal quotation marks. When I transform the document, these characters are transformed into &#147; and &#148; Now, my struggle is how to convert these back into something that people can read? I tried reading the document with DOMReader and SAXReader using encodings utf-8,utf-16, ascii, etc. No luck. Your help is very much appreciated. Max.
