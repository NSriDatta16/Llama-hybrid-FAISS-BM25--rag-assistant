What storage location, SQL Server or file system, would result in better performance in saving tiff images?

Our system needs to store tiff images of ~3k in size. We receive ~300 images at a given time and need to quickly process them. Once ~100,000 images are received, the images are transferred off our system to another archival system or purged. I am looking for best performance in regards to the initial save of the image files. The task of transferring the images for archival is less performance critical. What storage location, SQL Server or file system, would result in better performance in saving tiff images? Are there any other considerations or gotchas to be aware of?
