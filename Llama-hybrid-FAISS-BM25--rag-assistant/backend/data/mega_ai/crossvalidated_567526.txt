Possible pitfalls/accuracy issues using a weighted average of a median

I am trying to aggregate data for testing for multiple data sets. It is unrealistic to load the entire data set (which is composed of multiple subsets of varying length) into memory to calculate a median. As one solution to my problem, I thought I could find the median of each subset of data, along with the sample size, and aggregate it into a weighted average by doing something like (x_1(n_1) + x_2(n_2))/n were x is the median and n is the data set size. This is essentially taking a weighted average of medians. Is there a risk that taking the weighted average of medians will be far off from the actual median of the data set? I am not a mathematician by trade so I appreciate the help. ty!
