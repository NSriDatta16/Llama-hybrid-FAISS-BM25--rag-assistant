Youtube player hasn't yet been loaded at the time you're trying to use it. There is a special callback function that will be fired automatically as soon as it is loaded. Your HTML pages that display the chromeless player must implement a callback function named onYouTubePlayerReady. The API will call this function when the player is fully loaded and the API is ready to receive calls. by YouTube JavaScript Player API Reference . Therefore you can rewrite your code in the following manner: function onYouTubePlayerReady(playerId) { var ytplayer = document.getElementById('e1'); ytplayer.playVideo(); } You can also mind passing playerapiid while embedding the player if there are plenty of them to distinguish in onYouTubePlayerReady handler.
