If all endogenous variables are I(1), and if just two of them are cointegrated, can I incorporate its cointegration in the VAR model?

Suppose a VAR(p) model containing $s$ endogenous variables such that $Y_{t} = (y_{1t}, \ \ldots, y_{st})$ . It was verified that, for all $i \in \{1, \ \ldots, s\}$ , $y_{it} \sim I(1)$ . In addition, it was verified by means of Engel-Granger test that $y_{1t}$ and $y_{2t}$ are cointegrated time series such that, given $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$ , $\alpha y_{1t} + \beta y_{2t} \sim I(0)$ . But this is not true for any other pair of endogenous variables; and this is not true, generally speaking, for the $s$ -vector $Y_{t}$ . As far as I know, since the nonstationary time series in $Y_{t}$ are not cointegrated, I am not allowed to use a VECM . My question is as follows: is there any way to include $y_{1t}$ and $y_{2t}$ as cointegrated time series and, accordingly, to continue using a VAR(p) model? Otherwise, ignoring cointegration, the model would be a VAR(p) with $s$ endogenous variables $(\Delta y_{1t}, \ \ldots, \Delta y_{st})$ . P.S. There are theoretical reasons which justify the fact that $y_{1t}$ and $y_{2t}$ are cointegrated time series.
