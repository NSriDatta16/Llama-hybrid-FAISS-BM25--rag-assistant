NHibernate Projections Duplicates To List

I have a problem with nHibernate projections. I don't even know if what I'm attempting can be done but if any nHibernate experts can help me I'd be grateful. I'm using nHibernate criteria to query a database and I'm returning the result projected to a different (slimmed down) object. I get a list of returns like Id CompanyId Description 1 1 Desc1 1 2 Desc1 1 3 Desc1 2 1 Desc2 2 3 Desc2 3 1 Desc3 3 2 Desc3 3 3 Desc3 when I use this object int Id int CompanyId string Description What I'm looking for is to get something more like Id CompanyId Description 1 [1, 2, 3] Description 2 [1, 3] Description 3 [1, 2, 3] Description From an object like this int id List` companyId string description The current code I have is similar to result = session.CreateCriteria () .Add(Restrictions.Eq("SiteId", 616)) .SetProjection(Projections.Distinct(Projections.ProjectionList() .Add(Projections.Property("Id"), "Id") .Add(Projections.Property("CompanyId"), "CompanyId") .Add(Projections.Property("Description"), "Description") .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean ()).List (); So I'd like to know if there is anything here I can do to achieve this, or even if this is completely the wrong approach and there is something better.
