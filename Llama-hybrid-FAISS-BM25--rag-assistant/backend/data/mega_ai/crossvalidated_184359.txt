For practical purposes, you're no more wrong to bet that your 95% CI included the true mean at 95:5 odds, than you are to bet on your friend's coin flip at 50:50 odds. If your friend already flipped the coin, and you think there's a 50% probability of it being heads, then you're just using a different definition of the word probability. As others have said, for frequentists you can't assign a probability to an event having occurred, but rather you can describe the probability of an event occurring in the future using a given process. From another blog: The frequentist will say: "A particular event cannot have a probability. The coin shows either head or tails, and unless you show it, I simply can't say what is the fact. Only if you would repeat the toss many, many times, any if you vary the initial conditions of the tosses strongly enough, I'd expect that the relative frequency of heads in all thes many tosses will approach 0.5". http://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_difference_between_frequentist_and_bayesian_probability
