On windows I had trouble using firefox on sharepoint. This should work on a mac as well. There is a setting in about:config network.ntlm.send-lm-response set to false by default. Toggle it to true and you should be able to log on manually. Before making this change I would be prompted for a password on every page. Note: you need to login with domain\username as username. The interface is a bit different in firefox without the activex but most functionality is still there. Sharepoint is highly integrated with internet explorer and the office suite. Without those two products sharepoint loses most of it's benefits. On a side note: I'm actually surprised Microsoft hasn't made a bigger push for sharepoint. Sharepoint makes it very hard for an organization to migrate away from windows and office. If I was Microsoft I would be giving away sharepoint for next to free; the benefits to Microsoft would be vendor lock-in.
