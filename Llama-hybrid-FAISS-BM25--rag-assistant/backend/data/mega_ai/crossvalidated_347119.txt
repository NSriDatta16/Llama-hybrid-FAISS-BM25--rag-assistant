How can you compare Cox regression models and rank them in terms of "prognostic significance"?

How can you compare different Cox regression models to see which one provides the sharpest prognostic information? I have a deep learning algorithm and more than 100 doctors diagnosing a disease as present or absent. I am presenting the univariate Cox regression models for the first 20 here I have ranked these in descending order based on hazards ratio. This I am guessing is not correct - what I am trying to achieve is a ranking to see where the algorithm places among these doctors. Alternatively, I would like to show that there is no statistical difference between the top performing doctor and the algorithm. But how can I tell who is the top performing doctor as the HR, p values, and intervals all seem to come into play. Is there one metric that can be used to rank these?
