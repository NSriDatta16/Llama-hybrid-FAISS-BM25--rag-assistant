Interpreting ICC in 3-level logistic regression

I've run a 3-level logistic regression in STATA- level one is maternal health clinics (N=200), level 2 is the primary health care centres(N=41) which run the clinics and level 3 is the district(N=8). I understand what the ICC is and how to calculate it but just need help interpreting the STATA output which is below. The top is the level 3 district ICC, but the second which includes the primary health care centre is what I'm findng confusing to interpret. Thanks!
