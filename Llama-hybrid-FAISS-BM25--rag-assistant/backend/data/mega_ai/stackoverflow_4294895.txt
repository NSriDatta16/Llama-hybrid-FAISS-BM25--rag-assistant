Thanks for the answer, Paul. I finally created an ArrayList of Rectangle objects for each control. Whenever the mousemove event triggers, I loop through each Rectangle and call Rectangle.contains() with the mouse coordinates. This solution turned out to be very organized. In my case, the control events are homogenous (they all do the same thing), but if anyone has multiple control actions, Rectangle.data can be used to contain a Command object.
