bias in SVM in a balanced set - effect of sample size?

I have a dataset with many subjects, and for each subject I have 100 samples for an X variable, while Y has exactly 50%/50% cases for label 1/2. I am trying to run cross-validation with SVM and found that accuracies are always below 50% despite the set being balanced. So I made up the following simulation and changed the sample size (see two figures for 50 and 1000). Still, I get the same below 50% bias. Changing k has an effect, and increasing the sample size also helps - but this doesn't go away - SVM keeps giving me a mean accuracy below 50%, over samples. Cost doesn't make a difference as well as far as I can tell. Any thoughts??? Thanks, Nitzan library(e1071) nsamples=100 N=2000 x
