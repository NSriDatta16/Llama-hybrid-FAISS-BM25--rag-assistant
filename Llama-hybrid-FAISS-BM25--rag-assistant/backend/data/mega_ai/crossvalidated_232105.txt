You just need to write the models in a consistent way -- so the parameters of interest in the larger model are present in the smaller model (but may be restricted in some way -- you'd just ignore the restriction when averaging). In your smaller model, you simply have $\theta_1=\theta$ and $\theta_2=\theta$. There's no obvious difficulty in averaging those $(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ values with the values from the model where they differ. The effect of averaging the full model with the reduced model would be to "shrink" estimates (well, at least ones like say posterior means) toward the common estimate in the smaller model. More fully, the model-averaged posterior distribution would be a mixture of the case where you have separate $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ and the case where $\theta_1=\theta_2$.
