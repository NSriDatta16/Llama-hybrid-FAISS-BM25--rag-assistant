Ext.get() returns an Ext.Element, not the underlying DOM element. The underlying element is in a property called .dom. Try: Ext.get('login-openid-form').dom.submit(); EDIT If you want to get more Ext-y, you can start to leverage Ext.form.BasicForm : var form = new Ext.form.BasicForm('login-openid-form', { standardSubmit : true }); form.submit(); That will expose a more robust form API, which is beyond the scope of this answer, but the docs (linked above) are pretty good.
