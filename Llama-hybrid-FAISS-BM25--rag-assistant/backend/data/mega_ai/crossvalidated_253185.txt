About seasonality. From the reference: . For example, if the data represent daily observations, use 7 for a day-of-week component. This interface currently only supports up to one seasonal component. and use model.args = list(nseasons = 7, season.duration = 24) to add a day-of-week component to data with hourly granularity So I take it that in your case I think nseasons=13, season.duration=24 as well. What is meant by stable: I take it to mean that the relationship of the covariates, to the series you are tracking is would have been maintained (but for the intervention). So if I was doing a study on some measure affecting house prices (y), and was using as covariates average pay, then if the UK leaving the EU would happen during the intervention period, that might change the relationship between house prices and pay. So the assumption that the relationship between the covariates and y was stable, would be broken. The prior.level.sd, I don't think is something you can infer from your data. It's a parameter used by the algorithm, isn't it?
