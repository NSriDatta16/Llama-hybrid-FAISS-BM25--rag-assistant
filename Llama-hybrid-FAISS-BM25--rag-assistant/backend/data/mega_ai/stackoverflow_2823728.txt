IMO putting upper bounds on the accepted version numbers is the right thing to do. Given the semantics of version numbers used by Hackage there is certainly no guarantee that your package will work with, in this case, transformers 0.3.0. I haven't seen any real discussion about this though and there doesn't seem to be a general recommendation to use upper bounds except for the base package.
