Confused with what statistical test to choose

Hoping someone can help me determine what statistical test to use if I am examining the relationship between categorical demographic variables and the number of times an individual goes backpacking. 4 Nominal/Categorical Independent Variables (age, 4 levels of race, 2 levels of occupation, 2 levels of sex) 1 Ratio Dependent Variable (number of times backpacking - 0-10) 1 purposive Sample (e.g., 100 individuals age 18-55 years from a specific organization)
