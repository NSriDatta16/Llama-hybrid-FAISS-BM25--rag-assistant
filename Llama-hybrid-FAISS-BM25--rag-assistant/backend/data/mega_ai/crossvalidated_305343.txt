A couple of reasons: First, you might not know how long your sequence will be ahead of time. RNNs let you use a variable length input. Second, RNNs are a good way to do parameter sharing between different time steps. Instead of having to learn how to extract useful information from each time step separately you can reuse the same parameter matrix recurrently.
