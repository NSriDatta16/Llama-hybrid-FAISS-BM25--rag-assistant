The elbow criterion is comparable to the scree plot method in factor analysis, but unfortuantely both are qualitative methods in a certain sense (Horn's parallel analysis is an alternative for PCA). The intuition is the following: Any increase in factor or cluster number will allow you to "explain" more variance (i.e., for cluster analysis it refers to decreasing within-cluster variance compared to the sum of between-cluster-variance and intra-cluster variance or the total variance). If you had as many clusters as data points, there would be no variance left. Now, the assumption is, that any meaningful clusters will be different in the sense that they explain more variance than what could be expected from random variations alone, whereas the last clusters will lead to smaller increments in variance. The resulting plot would therefore show a point form which on there is a more or less straight line creating an angle akin to a human elbow. One way to quantify this procedure is to repeat the analysis a large number of times with random data, and plot both the obtained pattern with the average of random runs. Neither technique will guarantee, of course, that you will discover the "true" cluster structure, if there even is such a thing in the problem that you are looking at. Basically you will have to calculate the relevant statistics for each cluster solution in the sequence.
