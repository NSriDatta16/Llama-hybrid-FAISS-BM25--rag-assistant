$\pi_i P^n_{i, j} =$ long-run proportion of time the chain is in $i$ and will be in $j$ after $n$ transitions?

I am currently studying the textbook Introduction to Probability Models by Sheldon M. Ross. Chapter 4.4 Long-Run Proportions and Limiting Probabilities says the following: Because $\pi_i$ is the long-run proportion of time that the chain is in state $i$ , and $P^n_{i, j}$ is the long-run proportion of time when the Markov chain is in state $i$ that it will be in state $j$ after $n$ transition $$\pi_i P^n_{i, j} = \text{long-run proportion of time the chain is in $i$ and will be in $j$ after $n$ transitions}$$ But it seems to me that this is describing $\pi_i$ and $P^n_{i, j}$ identically? So what is the difference supposed to be? I would greatly appreciate it if people would please take the time to clarify this.
