loading content from php file with jQuery

The following code fetch all data (by clicking a.info link) from a php file "info.php" and prints in the #content div. The problem is that it prints everything from info.php file. Can I possibly select only some part of data from info.php file to load in #content? The reason to ask this question is that, I want to load different data from the same php file for the different links. $("a.info").click(function(){ var id=$(this).attr("id"); $("#box").slideDown("slow"); $.ajax({ type: "POST", data: "id="+$(this).attr("id"), url: "info.php", success: function(html){ $("#content").html(html); } }); }); Html where content is loading: info.php paragraph1. paragraph2. For example, In the above info.php file, i only want to load paragraph1 in the #content. I hope my question is clear. Any help will be appreciated.
