Thanks to Jake Westfall for alerting me of this question. It does indeed sound like something that could be modelled with a multinomial processing tree (MPT) models. The experiment in your figure would provide a you with a multinomial distribution with four categories ( $C_A, C_B, C_C, C_D)$ , which provides three independent data points (i.e., maximum parameters). A simple saturated MPT model for the categories could be: $ Pr(C_{A}) = m_{A,B}*t_A\\ Pr(C_{B}) = m_{A,B}*(1 - t_A)\\ Pr(C_{C}) = (1- m_{A,B})*t_C\\ Pr(C_{D}) = (1- m_{A,B})*(1 - t_C) $ As in any MPT model, the parameter represent (conditional) probabilities that a certain event occurs. Here the three parameters are: $m_{A,B}:$ do animals choose the A & B mix over the C & D mix? $t_A:$ do animals choose the A over B? $t_C:$ do animals choose the C over D? In a typical MPT task, you would have other trees that share the same parameters. That allows you to fit a non-saturated model which provides some information whether the overall model and its assumption fits the data. However, in the present example there are four different and apparently unique stimuli. So sharing parameters across trees might not be easily be possible. One possibility might be to consider a baseline stimuli. For example, consider that stimuli B and D are the same. Then you could consider other experiments/trees in which A & B also occurs in one tree, but you have a different comparison in the other branch, say E and B. This tree would now share the same $t_A$ parameter as the tree you have, but all other parameters are different. This would allow you to estimate the various probabilities while allowing to test if the assumption that say $t_A$ is the same across tasks holds. Also, once you have specified the model equations as shown in the example, their exists easy to use software tools to fit such models, TreeBUGS , which even allows for a hierarchical Bayesian approach allowing for one random-effects term such as animal. They also have a good introductory paper: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TreeBUGS/vignettes/Heck_2018_BRM.pdf
