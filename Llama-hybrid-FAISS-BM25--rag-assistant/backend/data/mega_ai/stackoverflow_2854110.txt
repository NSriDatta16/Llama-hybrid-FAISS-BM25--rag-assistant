magento limiting number of returned items in product collection call

Im trying to limit the number of returned results manually in a copy of the list.phtml template, but its turning out to be alot harder than I anticipated. Ive tried manually setting the collection size, but ya once again nothing working. Can someone show me how to do this? Would be nmuch appreciated!
