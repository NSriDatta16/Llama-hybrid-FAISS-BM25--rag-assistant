I have been investigating this exact thing myself. Here are my findings in a nutshell LINQ to SQL Advantages Incredibly easy to use Disadvantages Cannot update the diagram from the database, you have to delete your class and then drag it back onto the diagram from the DB. This is a real pain if you modified the diagram at all. Not actively being developed any more (they will develop Entity Framework instead). Entity Framework Advantages Has much more functionality (Table inheritance, etc...) Can be updated from the database Has multiple providers (not just SQL) The model can be queried without using LINQ, you can use Entity SQL Microsoft seems to be investing heavily on it and proposing it as the main way to access a database: Update on LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Entities Roadmap , Clarifying the message on L2S Futures . Disadvantages Complicated and a lot less intuitive Conclusion I personally decided to go down the route of using the Entity Framework. I bought a book and have read the online material and I am very impressed with it. It took a little extra effort to learn, but the benefits really are great.
