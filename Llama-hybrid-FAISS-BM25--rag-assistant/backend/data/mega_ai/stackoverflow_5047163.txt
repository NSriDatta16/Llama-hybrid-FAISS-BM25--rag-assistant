It sounds a bit tricky, as JNI is supposed to be one-way only: Java code can invoke a native method, which of course may call back into Java code, but can't itself initiate the process. But it isn't impossible, I think the most straightforward solution is to have a native call that blocks until the signal is received. Another option would be to write a JVMTI agent, which can interfere with a running VM actively. But if we're talking about UNIX signals, you can handle then with the not public API (therefore not guaranteed in the future and Sun VM specific) but existing sun.misc.Signal class.
