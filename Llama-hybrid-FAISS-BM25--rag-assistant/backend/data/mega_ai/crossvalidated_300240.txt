One way to measure the distance between two distributions apart from the wellknown divergence measures as K-L Divergence, Mahalanobis etc.. is the MMD, which is a non-parametric measure so we do not need any estimation. We assume that we have two data sets which follow different distributions. The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a non-parametric distance of these two distributions. MMD is representing distances between distributions as distances between mean embeddings of features. Assuming that we have two distributions P and Q over a set X (feature set). The MMD is defined by a feature map φ:X→H, where H is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In general, the MMD is MMD(P,Q) = ∥EX∼P[φ(X)]−EY∼Q[φ(Y)]∥H.
