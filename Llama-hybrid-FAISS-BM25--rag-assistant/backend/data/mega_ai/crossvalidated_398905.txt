I don't think nlme can be used to fit a mixed effects logistic regression model. However, you have plenty of other options available for this task via packages such as the ones listed below, whose use is illustrated for your model 4. GLMMadaptive install.packages("GLMMadaptive") library(GLMMadaptive) model4 See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GLMMadaptive/vignettes/GLMMadaptive_basics.html . glmmTMB install.packages("glmmTMB") library(glmmTMB) model4 See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sjPlot/vignettes/tab_mixed.html . MASS install.packages("MASS") library(MASS) model4 See https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/sites/qdev/files/ILD_Ch04_2017_GeneralizedMLM.html . brms install.packages("brms") library(brms) model4 See https://bayesat.github.io/lund2018/slides/andrey_anikin_slides.pdf and What would be a Bayesian equivalent of this mixed-effects logistic regression model , for example. The brms package fits mixed effects models using a Bayesian framework; the other packages suggested here fit mixed effects models using a frequentist framework.
