One thing I've noticed using Mercurial is that it's changed the way I work, even locally on my workstation. The idea that every copy is a complete, stand-alone repo lends itself to keeping different copies with different work and merging them together or into the "common" repo. That's nice because patch sets for different things stay together, as well as keeping the work itself separate. These things can be done in some manner in traditional systems, but in Mercurial it's natural. Offering more flexibility in organizing workflow has other nice payoffs as well.
