Stuck with URL-rewriting in htaccess with Apache: 1 Rule to Rule them all

examine my current url rewrites for loading pictures: // Possibiities: 1 letter char, followed by `=` then the value (numbers/letters) // w= | h= | c= | q= | f= IMG-bla/blue_w100.jpg >> imgcpu?src=bla/blue.jpg&w=100 IMG-bla/blue_cp.jpg >> imgcpu?src=bla/blue.jpg&c=p IMG-bla/blue_h200.jpg >> imgcpu?src=bla/blue.jpg&h=200 IMG-bla/blue_w50_h200_fbw.jpg >> imgcpu?src=bla/blue.jpg&w=50&h=200&f=bw Essentially I would like to have 1 Ultimate rewrite url, that gives me the freedom to rewrite the below urls with any property, without having to hardcode that exact sequence of rewriting, with one rule per possibility: currently my code is very stupid, inpractical & incomplete its unelegant, thought does work! // works but utterly unelegant and unpractical as well as incomplete: RewriteRule ^IMG-(.+)_w(.+).jpg$ imgcpu\.php\?src=$1\.jpg&w=$2 [L] RewriteRule ^IMG-(.+)_w(.+)_h(.+)_c(.+).jpg$ imgcpu\.php\?src=$1\.jpg&w=$2&h=$3&c=$4 [L] RewriteRule ^IMG-(.+)_w(.+)_h(.+)_f(.+).jpg$ imgcpu\.php\?src=$1\.jpg&w=$2&h=$3&f=$4 [L] Now, how can I rewrite this complex rule with the optional property assets? I am in search for that 1 Rule to Rule them all. Your ideas & suggestions are warmly welcome and I deliciously upvote anything that dares to solve this complex puzzle!
