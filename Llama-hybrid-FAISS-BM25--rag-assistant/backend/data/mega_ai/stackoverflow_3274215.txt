Putting your data in one long string would defeat the purpose of a database. It would be the equivalent of writing it to a text file. Databases are a way to organize, index, and relate data to each other. To visualize a database structure imagine a table like so. id name url date ---- ------------ ----------------------- -------------------- 1 Example1 www.example1.com 10-07-14 13:56:13 2 Example2 www.example2.com 10-07-15 00:06:37 3 Example3 www.example3.com 10-07-16 16:20:00 4 Example4 www.example4.com 10-07-17 09:18:22 each one is a row in the database and you can pull out a bunch of them based on a query and then do whatever you need with them. Also you could relate this data to the user who entered that data by adding a user_id column and inserting their user id in each record which would reference their user record in the users table.
