Even if you hide the command line, the user can run lsof to see all the files that your ssh process has open - which will include the identity file. If obscuring the command line is truly the ultimate goal, though, you could start a key agent, load the identity into the agent, and then ssh using that agent. The path to the socket that the agent uses is controleld by an environment variable. This is by no means security, though. Pax is right - the "logged in as the same user" issue is what really should be solved here. Stop using someone else's account. ;)
