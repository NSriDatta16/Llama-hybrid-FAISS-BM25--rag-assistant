Correct inference on hierarchical data

I am doing an experiment on cell cultures comparing how some treatments affect the parameter of the cells. I have 3 replicates of the culture for each treatment, and in each culture, I measure the parameter of the interest in multiple cells (n is different for different cultures). Now, I want to infer if my treatment had an effect on the studied parameter in the cells. What would be the correct way to statistically support the hypothesis that treatment had an effect? In particular, the problem I am not able to understand is how to correctly deal with hierarchical data (in this case I have 3 replicates of cultures and some number of replicates (individual) in each culture). I see two options available: Mix all the data together and test group differences like there are no different cultures. Average the data through the cultures and compare means between groups (in this case though I would get a low number of observations, only n=3) I heard something about mixed models, but I am not sure it is applicable here.
