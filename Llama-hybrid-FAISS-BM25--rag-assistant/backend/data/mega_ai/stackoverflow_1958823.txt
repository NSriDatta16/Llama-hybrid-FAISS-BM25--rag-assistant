I encountered a similar issue when putting buttons inside the headerrender of a DataGridColumn. If the button was clicked, I wanted to prevent the column from sorting, otherwise if anywhere else inside the header was clicked, I wanted the column to sort normally. My solution was accomplished by adding a public property to the headerrenderer which indicated whether the mouse was down over the button or the rest of the header: On the parent application, listen for the headerRelease event of the datagrid (code abbreviated): private function handleSort(e:DataGridEvent):void { if ((e.itemRenderer as SearchHeader).searchClicked) e.preventDefault(); } There are probably more elegant solutions out there, but this is quick and dirty.
