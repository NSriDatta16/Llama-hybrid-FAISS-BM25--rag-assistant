How do you calculate precision and recall for multiclass classification with only two classes?

I'm trying to predict the gender of a Twitter account using only the profile information like tweet text, description and used colors. I've trained a SVM classifier and then tested dividing the initial data set in two portions (80% training - 20% testing). After that, i would like calculate accuracy and other metrics like precision and recall. My doubt here, is how should I calculate precision and recall? I mean, from my point of view it's more correct calculate them for both classes (male and female). It's like a binary problem but the two classes are equally important during the prediction phase. What do you think?
