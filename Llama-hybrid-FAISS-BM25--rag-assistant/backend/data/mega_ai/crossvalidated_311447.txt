The formula is the linear regression of the series (whatever the variable is), which I will call $y$, on time ($x$), giving units-of-$y$ per year. This is then divided by average $y$ and the result given as a percentage to get a percentage annual growth relative to the mean $y$ (the estimate of the middle-year value of $y$). Note that the slope of a regression line is $$\hat{\beta}=\frac{\sum_i (y_i-\bar{y}) (x_i-\bar{x})}{\sum_i (x_i-\bar{x})^2}\,.$$ Now for the $x$'s being five consecutive years $(x_i-\bar{x})$ will always be $-2,-1,0,1,2$ and $\sum_i (x_i-\bar{x})^2=10$. At the same time \begin{eqnarray} \sum_i (y_i-\bar{y}) (x_i-\bar{x})&=&\sum_i y_i (x_i-\bar{x}) - \bar{y}\sum_i (x_i-\bar{x})\\ &=&\sum_i y_i (x_i-\bar{x})\,, \end{eqnarray} but again the $x_i-\bar{x}$'s are just $-2, ..., 2$ so that's $-2 \, y_1 - 1 \, y_2 + 0 \, y_3 + 1 \, y_4 + 2 \, y_5$. (Note that $\sum_i (x_i-\bar{x})$ is always $0$, which is why the second term disappeared.) Consequently the estimated yearly increase using a least squares straight line fit is $\hat{\beta}= (-2 \, y_1 - 1 \, y_2 + 0 \, y_3 + 1 \, y_4 + 2 \, y_5)/10$. This will be in units-of-$y$ per year. Now to get this to be a yearly relative (or percentage) increase we need to divide by a $y$-value. The mean of the $y$'s, $\bar{y}$ (which is also the estimated middle value in the trend line) is what they've divided by. I don't know why that particular choice was made, rather than some other possible choice -- but for some things I guess this would be a reasonable thing to do. I don't know if this is standard, but I bet you could find a formula like this (estimated annual linear increase divided by the mean) in some business stats books or a similar source.
