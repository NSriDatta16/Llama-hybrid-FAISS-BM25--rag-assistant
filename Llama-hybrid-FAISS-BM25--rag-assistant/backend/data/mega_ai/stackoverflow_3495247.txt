Spring - using applicationContext.xml and XXXXX-servlet.xml

I am integrating Spring MVC into an existing project I have been working on. By integrating, I mean I am rewriting the project using Spring, and using much of my old code. I have already setup the environment and have began working on it. I will refer to this project as ProjectX . I have already setup and configured my ProjectX-servlet.xml that holds the view-resolver bean, and the controller beans, etc. I want to set up an applicationContext.xml file that I can place all my DAO beans in such as ... I want these values to be in the applicationContext.xml so that in my controllers I can do the following. public SomeController extends SimpleFormController{ private MemberDAO memberDao; private ProductDAO productDao; ...getter/setter methods for memberDao; ...getter/setter methods for productDao; and the values will be available(injecting them into the controllers) I have configured the controllers in the ProjectX-servlet.xml like the following definition. I believe I need to configure something such as the following in my web.xml so that it knows to load the application context. contextConfigLocation /WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml context org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderServlet 1 My question is, what do I have to do following creating an applicationContext.xml file, to be able to do what I showed above and inject beans such as the ProductDAO and MemberDAO into my controlellers which are configured in the ProjectX-servlet.xml I have been using Spring MVC for a contract for a couple months and am comfortable with how to use it, but I am new to configuring it on my own, for my own use, so I would appreciate if any advice or answers were explained a little easier for me. Thank you
