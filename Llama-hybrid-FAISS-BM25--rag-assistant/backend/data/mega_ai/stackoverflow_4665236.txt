Another Netbeans issue | cannot find symbol method, but correctly declared

this has been a crappy day, besides the IDE not compiling/deploying because of this bug and waisting valuable time, I finally get it to deploy it suddenly I start getting this weird message (after compiling and running it several times): T:\Users\Triztian\Documents\RHT System\RHTUBSDB\src\java\controllers\OrderSearch.java:64: cannot find symbol symbol : method metadata(java.lang.Long) location: class BO.CoverForm OrderExtraInfoDTO foundInformation = frmCover.metadata(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber()); it is my understanding that this means that my method isn't declared, but thats not the situation as my method is clearly declared and coded. CoverForm.java : public OrderExtraInfoDTO metadata(Long ReferenceNumber) { OrderExtraInfoDTO foundInformation = new OrderExtraInfoDTO(); try{ foundInformation = lnkAddInformation.fetchInformation(ReferenceNumber); } catch (DAOException daoe) { this.setError("additional_information", daoe.getMessage()); } return foundInformation; } And the servlet that calls the CoverForm.java method. OrderSearch.java (Extends HttpServlet): CoverDTO foundCover = frmCover.search(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber()); OrderExtraInfoDTO foundInformation = frmCover.metadata(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber()); UpgradesDTO foundUpgrades = frmUpgrades.search(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber()); I've tried renaming the method and didn't have any success, any help is truly appreciated as I'm getting frustrated with NB 6.9.1 because of some crashes and another weird bug (might catch an entomologist's attention) which locks the editor and displays a message saying: "Refactoring cannot be done in the given context" whenever I press delete, forcing me to restart the IDE. EDIT Ok, so I've removed the classes that I posted and merged them in a more appropriate place, however I still get that silly symbol not found error but on a different symbol(another method) this time.
