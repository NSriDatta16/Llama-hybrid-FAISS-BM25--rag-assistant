Sometimes you need a string value that isn't null if it isn't populated. Otherwise, for any given string-related task you need to perform, you have to include a null check which merely serves to bloat your code. And just to have it on record, in C#, it is encouraged to specify string.Empty instead of hardcoding in "". Edit: And as LBushkin pointed out, there is a difference between have an empty value versus having an unknown value.
