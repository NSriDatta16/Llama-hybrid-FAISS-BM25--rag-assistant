Interpretation of multinomial logistic regression output from R

I have used mlogit package and I am trying to summarize the results I have from my model. I have a question regarding the reference value and will get to that in a moment. redata.full I recognize that my data is ordinal in nature, but Im following other people's methods who have done this and used the reference based approach rather than ordinal logistic regression. However, I am still shakey on justification other than citing the other person and saying "he did it too!" If anyone has a suggestion I would appreciate it. My results for this model are: Call: mlogit(formula = no.C ~ 1 | WR + age + age2 + BP + noC.1yr, data = redata, na.action = na.fail, reflevel = "0", method = "nr", print.level = 0) Frequencies of alternatives: 0 1 2 0.233766 0.675325 0.090909 nr method 5 iterations, 0h:0m:0s g'(-H)^-1g = 2.16E-07 gradient close to zero Coefficients : Estimate Std.

Question: How do I test how well the model is actually working (i.e., goodness of fit)? Hosmer-Lemshow test? Ive read warnings about using the McFaddin's Pseudo R where they really aren't applicable to multinomial regressions. Ive found a HL test with ResourceSelection library and it says my model is NOT doing well at all. Now what? Interpretation: WR and noC.1yr are the only variables that are coming out as slightly significant. But this is only between the reference value of 0 and production of 2 calves. It is not significantly different between 0 or 1 for these variables. Question: Ive been trying to find somewhere in the vignette what the t-value is - it is just a t-test? How would I refer to the estimate as being significant? "The estimated odds for 2-offspring being produced versus 0 were 3.85 (95% CI = 1.0-14.88) which was significant (t= 1.99, P=0.05)" Referring to my statement regarding setting the reference value. When I run this exact same model using my other options of 0 or 1 offspring - I get completely different results of which variables are significant. If I use 2 as the reference value then Age+WR+noC.yr are significant. If I use 1, then Age only is sig. So, which one to use? I have read you want to pick one that is most relevant to your hypothesis, but in this case I could motivate any of the 3 levels.
