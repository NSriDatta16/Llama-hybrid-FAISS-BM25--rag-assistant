It's not practical to use stl or boost for any type of video game, for starters. You can be absolutely sure the second you use one stl container your memory is fragmented and your performance is hopelessly in the toilet compared to the ideal at least (since most everyone's code is in this category most people never notice and can't really compare to anything else). I didn't always think so strongly but over time I have seen even a couple lines of code is like a little gremlin that will eventually some day cause you great pain. The first method is most common, and as someone who's done both it's probably the only way that's practical if you don't want to spend a lot lot LOT more time and energy on the problem than it's probably worth to you. The second way is better because it's more general and yet can be tailored to your exact needs, but it's a lot of work and not something to jump into lightly.
