The screenshot is missing, but what you describe sounds as though you've incorrectly implemented the use of Apple's built-in view controllers. Both UINavigationController and UITabBarController will automagically shift all the content inside them down by 20-pixels, if they detect there is "supposed" to be a statusbar on screen at the moment. My guess is that you have some code that is removing the statusbar, but which is kicking-in after the Apple code has already detected it and shifted everything down to accomodate. The "fix" is to re-read the docs on Apple's classes very carefully and use them as Apple dictates (usually, people use them in ways that seem sensible - e.g. embedding them inside other views - but which Apple has expressly declared are unsupported. Sadly those classes from Apple are very fragile)
