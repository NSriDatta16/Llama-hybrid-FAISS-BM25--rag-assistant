To clarify, you are asking for information regarding an IRT model where a latent variable $\theta_y$ can be regressed onto one or more latent predictor variables $\theta_x$ , correct? I am unaware of any formal presentation of such a model, though it should be pretty straightforward in a Bayesian framework using probabilistic programming languages (e.g., jags , stan ). One article (Lu, Thomas, & Zumbo, 2005) does come close to what you are looking for. First, they estimate the SEM's measurement model parameters using IRT. Second, they convert IRT parameters to their CFA/SEM parameterization $^1$ ; and third, they keep these parameters fixed during the estimation of structural parameters using SEM software. $^1$ See Takane & De Leeuw (1987) for more information on the relationship between IRT and factor analysis of categorical data.
