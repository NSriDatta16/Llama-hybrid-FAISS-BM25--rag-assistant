These two time series seems to have a deterministic trend. This is one relation that you obviously want to remove before further analysis. Personally, i would proceed as follows: 1) I would run a regression for each time series against a constant and a time, and compute the residual for each time series. 2) Taking the two residuals series, computed in the step above, i would run a simple linear regression (without a constant term) and look at the t-statistic, p-value, and decided on whether or not there is further dependence between the two series. This analysis assumes the same set of assumption you make in a linear regression.
