This approach ignores leap-years (and other calendar-caused oddities), but is very straightforward: public boolean isWithinAYear(Date inputDate) { Date d = new Date() // Get "now". long dLong = d.getTime(); // You could multiply this next line out and use a single constant, // I didn't do that for clarity (and the compiler will optimize it // out for us anyhow.) long oneYearAgo = dLong - (365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); return inputDate.getTime() > oneYearAgo; } Your solution using GregorianCalendar is technically more correct.
