No, the average shared webhost provider does not because most are preconfigured with LAMP and Ruby usually isn't installed, but RoR support is on the rise. However, if you're interested in a dedicated/vps (unmanaged) then you pretty much can do whatever you want ( I would recommend slicehost/linode if you are looking for a vps and your budget is around $20/mo ). A decent web application ( ROR ) can handle many types of DBMS's including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite. What's your budget? How big will your site be?
