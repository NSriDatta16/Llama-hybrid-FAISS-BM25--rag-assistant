With StorageItem you created a many-to-many relationship. If you need just one-to-many (many storages are related to one item, but you don't need the vice versa), then you may just add another field to the Storage table (item_id) that would be a foreign key for Items table. Then you create an index on item_id in Storage table, and connect the two tables in master-detail relationship. If you do need many-to-many then you may add a query component with SQL (select * from StorageItem where item_id := :current_storage_id), and current_storage_id is your query's parameter.
