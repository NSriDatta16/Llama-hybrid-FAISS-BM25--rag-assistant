SPNEGO is an open source project that provides a servlet filter that provies Integrated Windows Authentication. if your organization uses java based web/application servers, and you prefer Kerberos/SPNEGO instead of NTLM as the authentication protocol, and you would rather have a Java Servlet Filter (JSR-53) based implementation instead of a container specific authentication module (JSR-196), and you want SSO (no username/password prompt), then this project may be of some interest to you. It has instructions for configuring both Tomcat and Glassfish .
