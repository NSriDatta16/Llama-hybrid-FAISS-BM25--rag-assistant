Creating a blended dataset/transitioning from one predictive model to another

I'm working with two different models right now using a variable X as an input. One of the models is said to be applicable for values of X less than A, and one is said to be applicable for values of X greater than A. However, around A, there is substantial discrepancy in the model outputs, which creates a discontinuity in my work if I simply transition from one model to the other at A. I'm sure there's a way to create a blended data set or some kind of weighting function to address the region surrounding A, but I have very little statistics background, and haven't been able find any information on how to effectively blend my output data within that region. I found a useful paper that suggests creating a weighted average to combine sets of observations based on an effective dataset, but that requires that some of the observations are common to both sets. In this case, while the inputs may be common to both sets, the outputs are not. Any insight you can offer would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
