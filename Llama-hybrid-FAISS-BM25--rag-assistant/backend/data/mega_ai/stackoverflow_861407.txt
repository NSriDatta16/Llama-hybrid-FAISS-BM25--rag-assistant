Dirty seems to mean 'idle' or 'was available', and clean means 'had to request it' or 'preempted it'. It says that a fork is 'dirty' if he picked it up (the fork wasn't contended when he wanted it), and 'clean' if he had to request it, and that its initial state is dirty. Pick up an available fork => fork is dirty => clean it and give it up when asked. No available fork => have to ask for it => will receive it cleaned. It reminds me of the Organizational Pattern called Don't Interrupt an Interrupt .
