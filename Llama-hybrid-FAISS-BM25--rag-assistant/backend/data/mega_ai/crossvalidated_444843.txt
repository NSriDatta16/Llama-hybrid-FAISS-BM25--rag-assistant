The staging does not explicitly state anything about the statistical relation of the variables, but rather tells us which conditional distributions we care about. For example, suppose some variable A is a first stage variable and B is a second stage variable. Then, the two probability distributions we care about are $P(A)$ and $P(B | A)$ . This is because at the first stage, we care about the value of $A$ , which is unknown. Since $B$ is also unknown, what we care about is the marginal distribution of $A$ . At the second stage, we know $A$ and care about $B$ , thus we are working with $P(B|A)$ . In contrast, the distribution $P(A|B)$ is irrelevant for our stochastic program. Note that this doesn't tell us anything about these quantities. For example, nothing restrains us from having $A$ and $B$ independent, although if we know they are, our problem just got easier. Why is this important? Well, in traditional probability courses, we always think about computing the conditional distribution from a joint distribution. In statistics, we often ignore the joint distribution and directly model a conditional distribution. As an example, in logistic regression we often model $P(Y|X)$ . However, we generally skip the step of modeling $P(X)$ and thus $P(Y,X)$ . So in our staging example, we know that we need to model $P(A)$ and $P(B|A)$ , but we can skip modeling $P(B)$ and $P(A,B)$ . Note that in general, modeling joint distributions is considerably harder than conditional distributions!
