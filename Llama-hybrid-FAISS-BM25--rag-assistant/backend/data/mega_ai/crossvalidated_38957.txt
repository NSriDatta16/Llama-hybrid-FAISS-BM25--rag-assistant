Specifying the Form of Prior, Likelihood and Posterior Distributions for Bayesian Analysis

I have recently begun to look into Bayesian Analysis, and, although I'm beginning to get to grips with the general framework (i.e. $\text{posterior} \propto \text{likelihood} \times \text{prior}$), I'm still having some difficulties in playing around with distributions. I hope to gain a more concrete understanding of these processes through worked examples; what follows is a template-like rendering of the kinds of problems I've seen in various books and online resources - I hope it makes sense. Assume I want to carry out a Bayesian analysis on some process. Data ($x$) gathered on this process over a certain time period suggests that the process is normally distributed with variance of $\sigma$ (known); however, the goal of the research is to discover the value of the mean ($\mu$) (unknown). Another researcher is asked his/her opinion on the same process and suggests a mean value of $\mu_{0}$ with standard deviation of $\sigma_{0}$. Now, assume I wanted to specify a gamma prior distribution from the fellow researcher's opinion. What would the pdf look like in this instance? (i.e. How do I embody the mean and variance into the gamma distribution?) Furthermore, for completeness, what would the likelihood and posterior pdfs of $\mu$ look like? As you can see, it's mostly the manipulation of the distributions that are causing my difficulties.
