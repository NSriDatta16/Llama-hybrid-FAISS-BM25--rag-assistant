Generalization vs Specialization of DB table

When I want to design database tables that model a finite parent-child relationship, for e.g., computer as parent, and the components inside as the child; or a simple organizational hierarchy, I am usually torn at which approach to use - A 'specialized table' approach, in which I create a table for each of the possible entity. In the computer component example, I would have a Computer table and a Component table, with the ComputerID as FK in the Component table referencing back to Computer.ComputerID. or A 'generalized table approach, in which I have one table table called Component, with ComponentID as PK, and a ParentComponentID as FK referencing to its parent's ComponentID.
