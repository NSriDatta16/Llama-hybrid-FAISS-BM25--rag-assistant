You can use the gateway option, when accessing your remote server through a proxy set :gateway, "proxy-user@100.200.300.400" ssh_options[:keys] = "~/.ssh/your-key" Make sure you have added your remote servers ssh key into your github repo deploy keys. You can also try the forward_agent option to make the remote server use your local machine ssh key to access github. ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true Hope this helps.
