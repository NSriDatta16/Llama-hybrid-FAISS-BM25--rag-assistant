i think in any code base, readability is much greater a concern than a few more clock cycles for all the well-known reasons, foremost maintainability, which is where most code spends its time, and as a result where most money is spent on the code. so im kind of dodging your question by saying that people dont concern themselves with it because its negligible in comparison to other [more corporate] concerns. although if we put other concerns aside, there are explicit inline statements, and more importantly, compiler optimisations that can often remove most of the overhead involved with trivial function calls. the compiler is an incredibly smart optimising machine, and will often organise function calls much more intelligently than we could.
