Edited I'm assuming you mean the Open Source code for Gallery3D . Instead of changing the content provider Uri in STORAGE_URI , have you looked at changing CAMERA_IMAGE_BUCKET_NAME in ImageManager.java and/or CAMERA_BUCKET_NAME in LocalDataSource.java ? I see several places where getExternalStorageDirectory() is mentioned. Old Answer Try using withAppendedPath(Uri baseUri, String pathSegment) to add your subdirectory to the Uri. Perhaps something like this would work for you: Uri.withAppendedPath(Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI, Uri.encode("mySubDirectory"));
