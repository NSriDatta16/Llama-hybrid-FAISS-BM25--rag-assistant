1) What you are doing is one-hot-encoding. That will give you a sparser dataset, but you do not need both at the same time. 2) You should leave categorical variables as categorical, what you are doing is dangerous. Numeric to categorical transformation would be acceptable however by digitization and grouping. I do not know your machine learning task. However, Iâ€™d recommend you to get features like week of the month, day of the week, season, hour, year or whether it is not a business day, etc.
