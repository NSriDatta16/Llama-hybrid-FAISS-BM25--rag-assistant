Mod_rewrite on all website images

I'm designing an image repository. I want to uncouple the filename from the image html link. For instance: image in filesystem is called images/items/12543.jpg HTML is Does anyone strongly discourages me to rewrite all image requests using PHP so when retrieving images/car.jpg , Apache really replies content from images/items/12543.jpg ? I don't know if I may get performance problems.
