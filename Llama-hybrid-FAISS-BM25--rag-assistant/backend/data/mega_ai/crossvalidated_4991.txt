Estimating parameters of a dynamic linear model

I want to implement (in R) the following very simple Dynamic Linear Model for which I have 2 unknown time varying parameters (the variance of the observation error $\epsilon^1_t$ and the variance of the state error $\epsilon^2_t$). $ \begin{matrix} Y_t & = & \theta_t + \epsilon^1_t\\ \theta_{t+1} & = & \theta_{t}+\epsilon^2_t \end{matrix} $ I want to estimate these parameters at each time point, without any look ahead bias . From what I understand, I can use either a MCMC (on a rolling window to avoid the look ahead bias), or a particle filter (or Sequential Monte Carlo - SMC). Which method would you use , and What are the pros and cons of these two methods? Bonus question: In these methods, how do you select the speed of change of the parameters? I guess we have to input an information here, because there is a bargain between using a lot of data to estimate the parameters and using less data to react more quickly to a change in the parameter?
