Trying to use Holt-Winters and SARIMA to fit this data

I want to find a time series model for monthly precipitation data. I checked SARIMA and Holt-winters seasonal multiplicative models. I can't find an appropriate model. These models underestimate high precipitation. I have 528 monthly precipitation observations. I used the initial 420 observations for modeling and 108 observations to verification. I added 1 to my data (because there are zeroes in my data) and then take the data to the power $\lambda=0.217$ (to transform data). Please help me! I upload my data to this link: http://up.persianscript.ir/uploads/f44c-data.rar
