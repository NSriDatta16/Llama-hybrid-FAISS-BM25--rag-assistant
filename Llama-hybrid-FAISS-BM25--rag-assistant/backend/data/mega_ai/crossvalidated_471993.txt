Expected Number of Trials to Terminate Random Sequence

I recently encountered this question and I'm having difficulty coming up with a rigorous explanation to back up the intuitive answer. Let $R$ be a random number generator such that $R(n)$ returns an integer in the range $[0, 1, ..., n-1]$ with uniform probability. Starting from $x_0=N$ , consider the sequence $x_i=R(x_{i-1})$ . Eventually the sequence terminates at $x_s=0$ for some $s$ and no further generation is possible. What is $\mathbb{E}[s]$ ? For large $N$ , I can see that intuitively the answer is approximately $\log_2N$ , since $\mathbb{E}[x_{i+1}]\approx x_i/2$ and after $\log_2N$ trials, on average we should be left with some value close to 0. I'm not sure how to come up with a more rigorous method to prove this and find a more precise answer.
