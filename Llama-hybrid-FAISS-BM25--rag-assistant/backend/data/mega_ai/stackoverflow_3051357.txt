I don't think this is a homework (way too hard!), and I don't think it's a research problem either (what's new?), so depending on the context of the problem, the easiest solution may just be to leverage Wolfram Alpha. WolframAlpha: solve x^2 + 5x + 10 x = -1/2 i (sqrt(15)-5 i) ~~ -2.5-1.93649 i x = 1/2 i (sqrt(15)+5 i) ~~ -2.5+1.93649 i Links WolframAlpha Web Service API
