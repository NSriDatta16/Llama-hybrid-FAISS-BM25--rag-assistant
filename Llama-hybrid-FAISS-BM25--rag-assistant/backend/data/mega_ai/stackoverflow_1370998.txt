Border flows over table but not paragraph with inline display

Using HTML and CSS. I have text surrounded by a border using display:inline to make the border just larger than the text. The problem is that the border overlaps certain surrounding block-level elements. It overlaps and , but not . CSS: .bordered { padding: 0.6em; border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; background-color: #FFFFCC; border-color:#E8E800; display: inline; } HTML: Some paragraph text Some bordered text Some paragraph text Some bordered text Table text Result: Why is this? And why is it inconsistent between different block-level elements? I would expect that the table cell text be vertically aligned the same as the paragraph's. Follow up : The whole reason why I have display:inline is so that the border is only as wide as the text. If using display:block (the default for ) then the border is as wide as the parent element.
