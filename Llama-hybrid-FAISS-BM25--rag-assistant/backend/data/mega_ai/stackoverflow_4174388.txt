With the exception of keyboard use, what you are trying to do has already been done in the jQuery Draggable module: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#default . You might be able to use what they have done their as a start point. The actual code is here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js . The downside is that you might have to put considerable effort into extending/modifying the code, and it will still likely depend on other jQuery code. Then again, you could probably whip something up in a fraction of the size of the jQuery code. But, I thought I'd post this in case no one else turned anything up. If you want to do it yourself, the general process would be: Wrap the item you want to move in a container (like another div ) and set the position to be relative using CSS. Bind keyboard events for the arrow keys When a key is pressed, modify the positioning of the element to move it (CSS attributes like left and top )
