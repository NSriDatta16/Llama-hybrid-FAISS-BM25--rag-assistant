CFDUMP began life as a custom tag before it was ever included in ColdFusion. It still appears to be downloadable: http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&extid=1002037 You may need to make changes to it to work (better) in more modern versions of CF, but it should probably do more than 90 per cent of what you need it for.
