For an overview of SVM: How does a Support Vector Machine (SVM) work? Regarding support vector regression (SVR), I find these slides from http://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~chhshen/teaching/ML_SVR.pdf ( mirror ) very clear: The Matlab documentation also has a decent explanation and additionally goes over the optimization solving algorithm: https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/understanding-support-vector-machine-regression.html ( mirror ). So far this answer has presented the so-called epsilon-insensitive SVM (ε-SVM) regression. There exists a more recent variant of SVM for either classification of regression: Least squares support vector machine . Additionally, SVR may be extended for multi-output a.k.a. multi-target, e.g. see {1}. References: {1} Borchani, Hanen, Gherardo Varando, Concha Bielza, and Pedro Larrañaga.
