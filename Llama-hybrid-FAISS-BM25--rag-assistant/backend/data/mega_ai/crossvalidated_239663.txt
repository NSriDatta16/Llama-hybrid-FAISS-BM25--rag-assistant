The rep argument is basically how many times you train your neural network. See the answer to this question. Therefore the higher the rep , the longer it will take. You should increase the stepmax to give your model more chances to learn/converge. Or you can increase your threshold to allow an earlier stop for convergence. Alternatively, you can adjust your model, e.g. lower the number of your hidden layers and nodes.
