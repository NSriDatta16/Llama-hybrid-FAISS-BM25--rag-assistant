It looks like the return value is in an array? That's somewhat strange... and also be aware that certain browsers will allow that to be parsed from a cross-domain request (which isn't true when you have a top-level JSON object). Anyway, if that is an array wrapper, you'll want something like this: $('#my-hidden-field').val(theObject[0].id); You can later retrieve it through a simple .val() call on the same field. This honestly looks kind of strange though. The hidden field won't persist across page requests, so why don't you just keep it in your own (pseudo-namespaced) value bucket? E.g., $MyNamespace = $MyNamespace || {}; $MyNamespace.myKey = theObject; This will make it available to you from anywhere, without any hacky input field management. It's also a lot more efficient than doing DOM modification for simple value storage.
