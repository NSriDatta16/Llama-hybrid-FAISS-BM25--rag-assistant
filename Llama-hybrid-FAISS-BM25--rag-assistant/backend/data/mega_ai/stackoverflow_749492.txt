I started out using Linq to SQL as the whole linq integration is awesome, but if you want to do Model First rather than Schema First and you want to have a rich domain model then nHibernate\Fluent nHibernate is really the way to go. We switched to this and is far simpler, better supported than l2s. However for straight dragging your schema into the dbml code generator, linq to sql is great. I have also heard very good things about Mindscape Lightspeed but have not used it.
