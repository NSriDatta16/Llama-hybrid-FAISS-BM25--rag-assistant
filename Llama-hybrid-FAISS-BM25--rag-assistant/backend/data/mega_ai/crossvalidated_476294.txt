Pairwise contrasts for logistic regression in emmeans, back-transform or not?

I ran a mixed effects logistic regression in R (glmer). The model identified a significant three-way interaction that I am interested in decomposing using post-hoc multiple comparison in emmeans. In this case Treatment is a factor (2 factors), Temp is a factor (2 factors), and mismatch.num is a continuous variable. I want to identify how the slopes of treatment differ within a given temperature. Since this is a logistic model, I typically back-transform the results when doing contrasts (on a side note, when I use type="response", nothing changes in my results, so I use transform). My question is why are my pairwise contrasts so different depending on whether I back-transform or not? Which contrasts should I use? Based on the Anova table, the non back-transformed contrasts seem to match what I expect more than the back-transformed contrasts emtrends(psit.tot8.4, pairwise ~ Treatment|Temp, var = "mismatch.num", adjust="Tukey", transform="response") I get the following output: $emtrends Temp = 24: Treatment mismatch.num.trend SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL C -0.0794 0.01498 Inf -0.1087 -0.04999 NC -0.0922 0.01605 Inf -0.1237 -0.06072 Temp = 28: Treatment mismatch.num.trend SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL C -0.0191 0.00507 Inf -0.0290 -0.00913 NC -0.0110 0.00285 Inf -0.0166 -0.00541 Results are averaged over the levels of: WaspSpecies, Species Confidence level used: 0.95 $contrasts Temp = 24: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value C - NC 0.01283 0.01362 Inf 0.942 0.3461 Temp = 28: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value C - NC -0.00807 0.00425 Inf -1.898 0.0577 Results are averaged over the levels of: WaspSpecies, Species Now if I run the exact same code, but omit the transform="response", these are my contrasts. emtrends(psit.tot8.4, pairwise ~ Treatment|Temp, var = "mismatch.num", adjust="Tukey") Here are the results: $emtrends Temp = 24: Treatment mismatch.num.trend SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL C -0.724 0.0599 Inf -0.841 -0.606 NC -0.947 0.0619 Inf -1.069 -0.826 Temp = 28: Treatment mismatch.num.trend SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL C -0.838 0.1119 Inf -1.057 -0.618 NC -0.662 0.0834 Inf -0.825 -0.498 Results are averaged over the levels of: WaspSpecies, Species Confidence level used: 0.95 $contrasts Temp = 24: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value C - NC 0.224 0.0858 Inf 2.606 0.0092 Temp = 28: contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value C - NC -0.176 0.1394 Inf -1.261 0.2073 Results are averaged over the levels of: WaspSpecies, Species Which result should I use for determining what is causing the three-way interaction? Why are the contrasts different? Is there something else wrong with what I am doing in my code? Thanks for the help. In case it is important, I am using emmeans version 1.4.3.01.
