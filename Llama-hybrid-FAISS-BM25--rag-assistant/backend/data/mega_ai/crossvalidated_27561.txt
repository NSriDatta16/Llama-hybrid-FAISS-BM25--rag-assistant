Disclaimer: I do not have a PhD in CS, nor do I work in machine learning; I am generalizing from other knowledge and experience. I think there are several good answers here, but, in my honest opinion, they do not yet quite make the main issue explicit. I will attempt to do so, but recognize that I don't think I'm saying something radically different. The main issue here pertains to skill development vs. signaling . With respect to skill development , ultimately you want (as an employee) to be able to get the job done, done well and done quickly, and the employer wants (or presumably ought to) such a person. Thus, the question here is how much extra skill development do you get with the extra couple of years of academic training? Certainly you should be gaining something, but recognize that people who don't continue with graduate school probably don't just sit on their duff until they would have graduated. Thus, you are comparing one set of experiences (academic) vs. another (work). A good bit depends on the quality and nature of the Ph.D. program, your intrinsic interests, how self-directed you are, and what kind of opportunities and support would be available in your first job. Outside of the effect continued academic training has on skill development, there is the question of the effect and value of the signal (i.e., of having "Ph.D" appended after your name). The signal can help in two ways: First, it can help you land your initial job, and that shouldn't be dismissed--it can be very important. Research has shown that people who are obliged to start out in a first position that isn't as appropriate for them never tend to do as well (career-wise, on average) as people who get to start in a job that is a good match for their abilities and interests. On the other hand, the consensus seems to be that after your first job, your future prospects are much more strongly influenced by your performance in your previous job than your academic credentials. The second aspect of the signal has to do with the relationship between the analyst and the consumer of the analysis. @EMS does a good job of bringing this point out in a comment . There are a lot of small consulting shops, and they love to have Ph.D.'s to show off to potential clients: in initial meetings trying to land a contract, on letterhead, in presentations of finished work-products, etc. the Ph.D.'s are always there. It's easy to be cynical about this, but I do think there's legitimate value for the consulting firm and the consumer (who may not know much about these matters and can use credentials to help them select a firm that will do a good job for them). Behind the scenes, some of the work may be farmed out to competent people with less credentials, but they want the Ph.D. for the front end, and to sign off on the work-product before it's delivered. I could see something analogous happening with a start-up if they're trying to attract capital and want to reassure investors. On the other hand, if you are going to do work for internal consumption, and your boss is capable of evaluating it, this doesn't matter.
