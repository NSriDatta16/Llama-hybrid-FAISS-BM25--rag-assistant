You can drill down into properties in the PropertyGrid of course. This is a vast subject, but maybe your properties simply need to have the ExpandableObjectConverter attached to them? Or if you are going more into details, the attached TypeConverter needs to override the GetPropertiesSupported and GetProperties methods. There is another way to tell the grid what properties to show underneath a property. You can implement ICustomTypeDescriptor and return your own PropertyDescriptors. But usually this is for more complex scenarios. Let me know if you need any specific detail on this. Update: in the comments, you asked about displaying a Dictionary. If you want to see each entry of your dict as a subproperty, then this is the complex scenario mentioned above. Your TypeConverter or custom TypeDescriptor will have to generate a PropertyDescriptor for each entry. Its name will be the key and its value will be ... well ... the property value. If you are new to the PropertyGrid, I encourage you to read a lot about it because it can be quite complex and you will find a good list of resources to start here: www.propertygridresourcelist.com
