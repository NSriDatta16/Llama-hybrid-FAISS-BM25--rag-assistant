Embedding Silverlight control in WPF app - is it possible?

Background: One of the most attactive feature of Silverlight is PlanProjection because of its ease of use and the stunning effect. Unfortunatelly, it is not available in WPF. I know that similar effects can be achieved using Viewport3D but certainly not with that simplicity. The App: I would like to build a Win app designed for dualscreen computer, a bit similar to PowerPoint: 1 fullscreen viewer window for the audience, and 1 regular window to control the app. The problem : Building the app in SL is not very appealing: Going to fullscreen always requires user confirmation due to (understandable) security reasons. Detecting primary/secondary screens, their positions is only possible with System.Windows.Forms.Screen class (pls, correct me if I am wrong), which is not available in SL. The odd solution: Would it be possible to write my controls in SL utilizing the fancy and simple PlanProjection features and reuse them within a WPF application? If yes, what impact will I have on the installer? I assume that the installer would need to deploy both .NET framework and SL runtime. Do you have alternative ideas to facilitate cherry-picking features from the two different worlds?
