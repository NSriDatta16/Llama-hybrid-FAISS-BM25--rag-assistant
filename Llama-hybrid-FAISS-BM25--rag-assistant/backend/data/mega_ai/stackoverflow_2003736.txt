I'm unclear on whether you want to add the tab bar "inside" one of the navigation controller views, or whether you want to take a navigation controller view and make it just one of the tabs in a tab bar controller with multiple tabs. I think people would find a tab bar inside of a navigation controller subview to be a little odd so I'm going to guess you mean that you want to put a navigation controller inside a subview of a tab bar controller like I have in the image below: alt text http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/7671/screenshotve.png "Logging View Controller" is loaded from a NIB file which contains a view and some other stuff. If you want something like a tabbed view inside one of the subviews of a navigation controller, I would used a segmented control to switch views around inside that particular subview or something. If you're trying to do what I did in the window above, just drag a new Tab Bar Controller into your main nib file, then drag the existing Navigation Controller onto the tab bar controller icon. That will make the nav controller one of the tabs inside the tab controller.
