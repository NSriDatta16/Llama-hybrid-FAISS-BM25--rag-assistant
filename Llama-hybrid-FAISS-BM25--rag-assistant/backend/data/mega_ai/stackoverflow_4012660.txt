Is the stripes framework dead? Anyone using it?

I am a big fan of the http://www.stripesframework.org and using it heavily for my projects. However the project seems to be dead. It is not possible to register to the website anymore (no license) and I couldnt contact any of the administrators. Also the mailing-list is not available. Is anyone aware of the status of the project? It would be a pity if it was dead as I think it is one of the most elegant frameworks for java web development.
