Instance weighing in libsvm/liblinear

I often use the instance weights with Libsvm for classification problems. http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/#weights_for_data_instances Does anyone know the details of the algorithm that is implemented when one uses instance weighing in libsvm? The standard SVM model learning algorithm assigns equal weights to all training instances, and thus to the error on the training instances. I believe that the algorithm that Libsvm uses would be different. Upon searching online, I do find some papers that do something similar. For example [1] but I need to confirm with someone who may be sure about this. Thanks! ps: i have also posted asked this on stackoverflow. Will update if I get any answer there.
