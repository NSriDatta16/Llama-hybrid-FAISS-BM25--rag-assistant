How to interpret zero-inflation model for Bayesian regression?

I am trying to understand the zero-inflated poisson (ZIP) model used in Bayesian regression modelling. I came across code here for the ZIP model. My question is related to the 3rd line of code within the for loop, that is: phi[i] I am not sure why the 10,000 is used here. For instance, when you look at appendix A for the ZIP regression Winbugs code in a paper found here , there is no use of this 10,000 . Any clarification would be appreciated
