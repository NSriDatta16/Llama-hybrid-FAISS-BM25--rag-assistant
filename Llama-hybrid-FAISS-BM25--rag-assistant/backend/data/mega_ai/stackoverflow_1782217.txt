How do you make a draggable using YUI3?

I'm using YUI3 and I've been trying to make tags inside a table draggable with no luck. I've found that I can drag nodes around, but for some reason I can't drag a . It shouldn't be a limitation, I've found examples of YUI2 where this is done, but the code is completely different from YUI3 and I can't figure this out. Does anyone know if you can drag nodes in YUI3, and how to do this? Here's my code: YUI({combine: true, timeout: 10000}).use("dd-drop", "dd-constrain", "node", function (Y) { var drags = Y.Node.all('#draftable-players tr.drag'); drags.each(function(v, k) { var dd = new Y.DD.Drag({ node: v, dragMode: 'intersect' }).plug(Y.Plugin.DDConstrained, { constrain2node: '#draft' }); dd.on('drag:end', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); }); }); And the relevant HTML: some stuff some more stuff another table, i'm trying to drag s from the other one to this one Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
