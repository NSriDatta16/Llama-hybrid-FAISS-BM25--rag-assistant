Best way to find correlation between categorical response variables and continuous explanatory variables

Sorry if this is a really simple question, but I'm very new to multivariable statistics and I'm trying to find a best method to deal with my ecological dataset. I recorded the environmental parameters ( temperature , humidity and light ) of each survey site that I found specific plants ( PlantA , PlantB , ...). For example, a reduced version of my dataset would look something like this: SiteID temperature humidity light PlantA PlantB PlantC PlantD ... 1 80 0.7 200 Y N Y N ... 2 90 0.9 150 N N Y N ... 3 75 0.85 175 N Y N N ... 4 80 0.9 180 N Y Y N ... I'm trying to see which explanatory variables can best explain the presence of specific plants, so that I can say something like "light is the most important factor in explaining the presene of Plant A" and such. I tried running a logistic regression in R with the glm function but couldn't build a good model, as all my z values were 0 and Pr(>z) were 1. I'm suspecting that the number of my observations are too low for me to include all my predictors, as I have 15 predictors and only 30 observations. So I think my next step should be to reduce my explanatory variables, like how NMDS can reduce the number of dimensions. (I think NMDS may be better than PCoA since PCoA assumes a linear relationship, which wouldn't be necessarily true for my data) I'm not sure how to fit in my binary variables into NMDS though, as all the (few) examples I've found so far didn't include binary variables in their example dataset. 1) Would just treating Y as 1 and N as 0 work? 2) Also, since I'm trying to find the importance of the explanatory variables on each of my response variable, would it make more sense to cut off the data for each plants for each NMDS analysis, like below? Data 1 SiteID temperature humidity light PlantA 1 80 0.7 200 Y 2 90 0.9 150 N 3 75 0.85 175 N 4 80 0.9 180 N Data 2 SiteID temperature humidity light PlantB 1 80 0.7 200 N 2 90 0.9 150 N 3 75 0.85 175 Y 4 80 0.9 180 Y ...
