if you dont want to bind an event to each individual button, you can bind one event to a parent of all those buttons (e.g., the parent div holding the buttons for example), and then use event bubbling to achieve a similar effect. e.g. text text text text text text $("#parent").click(function(e){ if ($(e.target).attr("id") === "b0") { // do b0's stuff } else if ($(e.target).attr("id") === "b1") { //do b1's stuff } //etc }); another way to do it is to use jquery live events - they are essentially doing what i have written above (more elegantly of course). As for the arguments, how do you obtain the arguments in the first place? without knowing that, i cant really tell you the best way forward.
