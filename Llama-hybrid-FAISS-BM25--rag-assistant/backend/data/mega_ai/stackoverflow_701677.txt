To some degree. It depends on what degree of freedom you want to give the user. One solution that comes to mind is a TableLayout with predefined cells. A user can then tap and drag components. When dragging a component you'll just want to draw an image of it under the user's finger, but when they release, remove the component from it's previous parent and add it to the new parent using the ViewGroup add/remove methods. While you can programmatically shift Views around, it would be difficult/impossible to switch layouts on the fly as far as I can see.
