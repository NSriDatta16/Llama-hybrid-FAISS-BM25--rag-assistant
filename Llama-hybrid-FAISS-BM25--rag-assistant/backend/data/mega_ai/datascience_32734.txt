Everything looks good. However, what I doubt about is the myDimensionReduction function. When you apply the PCA on the test data, you have to multiply $X_{test}$ by the matrix $C$ that has been generated from the training data, not by the test data . This is to stress that the test data should not be used in any step of the training process. If this is what the myDimensionReduction function does, that is alright. Otherwise, if this function creates the matrix $C$, then it is not right. I know you didn't ask for the library, but I think it makes sense in here: The whole philosophy of scikit-learn is to create objects that correspond to algorithms, use the training data with the fit method and apply the transform method to the test data.
