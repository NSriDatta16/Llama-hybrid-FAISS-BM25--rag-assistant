Programming on Leopard for iPhone OS 3.1.3

I got Leopard with XCode 3.1 and SDK 3.0, when opening the organizer and trying to debug on my ipod I received "The version of iPhone OS on "..." does not match any of the versions of iPhone OS supported for development with this copy of xCode...". It tells me with my xCode I can only develop for iPhone OS 3.0 or less, so I downloaded the new xCode + SDK installation bundle, knowing the SDK can't be installed on Leopard. In the installation it tells me "If you don't want to install the SDK, press disagree", and so I did, but in the next screen he forces me to choose a drive for the SDK, and then says "you can't install the SDK on leopard system", and I can't pass this screen. My question is: is it even possible to program on Leopard for iPhone OS 3.1.3? I really want to debug my apps on my iPod (framework 3.1.3, 3G) Thanks ahead!! Edit: Downloading seperatly xCode without the SDK didn't work, now I just got no SDKs for iPhone OS. I can't program for 3.1.3 without upgrading to snow leopard? By the way: I can't so simply upgrade to snow leopard because it's a hackintosh, so I prefer a different way..
