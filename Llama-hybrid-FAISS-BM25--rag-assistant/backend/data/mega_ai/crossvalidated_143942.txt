Imputation is a means to a goal, not the goal in itself. In some circumstances, replacing missing data might be the wrong thing to do. Make sure that you first pay attention to why your data are missing, as explained for example in the Missing data Wikipedia page, and that imputation is actually appropriate for answering the question your project seeks to answer. If some assumptions are met (for example, if the probability of a variable having a missing value does not depend on the value itself, technically called "missing at random") and your study involves multiple variables, you might be better off using multiple imputation rather than replacements by means or medians. In multiple imputation, known values of all variables are used to provide several sets of estimates of the missing data. This approach can provide better estimates both of the underlying relations among the variables and of the reliability of your estimates. See questions on this site having the multiple-imputation tag for more information.
