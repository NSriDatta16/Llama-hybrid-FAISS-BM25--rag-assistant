The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test does not have an alternate hypothesis that the data "are stationary." Rather, the ADF tests for evidence that the coefficient $\beta$ in the below equation is not equal to 0 (equivalent to testing whether $\rho=1$ in the un-augmented Dickey Fuller test): $$\Delta y_{t} = \alpha + \beta y_{t-1} + \delta t + \zeta_1 \Delta y_{t-1} + \dots + \zeta_{k}\Delta y_{t-k} + \varepsilon_{t}\text{where }\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2})$$ While it is true that a $\rho = 1$ (or $\rho = -1$ ) imply nonstationarity of a time series' data, but note that it is possible for $\beta=0$ , and yet for $\sigma^{2} = f(t)$ , so the ADF's usefulness in providing evidence that data are stationary is not robust to this issue.
