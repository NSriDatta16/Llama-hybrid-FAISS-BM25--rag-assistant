I've done this in a queue system to cache data where there were 4 or 5 steps involved and had to allow delays for replication between the steps. It was rather time consuming to implement as there were parent tasks which spawned 1 to n child steps which sometimes needed to be executed in order, sometimes irrelevant. If you go down this path, you then need to create a location for error messages and process logs. I highly recommend if in any way it can be created as one job with multiple steps, you should use the existing jobs agent. Each individual step can be configured to exit on fail, continue on fail, email on fail, etc - It's rather flexible.
