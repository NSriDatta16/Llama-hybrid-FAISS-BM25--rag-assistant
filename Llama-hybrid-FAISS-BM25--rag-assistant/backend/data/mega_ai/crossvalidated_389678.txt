How p-value is calculated in random forest when using measure_importance?

I am using random forest for importance analysis of my variables. I use measure_importance() and at the last column, p values are given. I used R. I used randomForest() and RandomForestExplainer() packages. 1. I am confused how they were calculated. 2. Should I think the variables with high p values (i.e. p>0.05) are not significant so should i omit them? I also added my result. Thanks in advance
