There is a difference between the process you use to test and the technology that is used to support it. The various frameworks used for unit testing are generally very flexible and can be used for testing small units of code, large units and even testing entire processes. This flexibility can lead to confusion. My recommendation is that whatever specific methodology or process you adopt that you segregate the various Unit Test into distinct assemblies or modules. The exact arrangement depends on your code and your company's organization. The accumulative effect of using the Unit Test framework is that much of the testing of the code is automated. Adopted correctly developers can evaluate changes to the code code better with out going through a full Q&A process. As for the Q & A Process itself it makes their time more productive as the quality of the code coming out of development should be higher. Understand it is not THE answer to all quality issues it just a useful tool like the other you use.
