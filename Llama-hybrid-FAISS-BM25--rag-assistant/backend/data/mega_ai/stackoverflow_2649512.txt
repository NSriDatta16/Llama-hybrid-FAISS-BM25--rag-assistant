Here is a recent discussion about the topic: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/adodotnetdataservices/thread/e66651c0-9202-4049-a8f4-55971b8b359d Basically it says: A single request does not support transactions and it doesn't make sense to support them since only one entity and CUD operation is involved in a single POST/PUT/DELETE request. But transactions can be implemented on server side by: using batch requests (a whole bundle of POST/PUT/DELETE requests being sent in one step from client to the server) and leveraging the processing pipeline (begin a transaction in the Processing event and commit/rollback the transaction in the Processed event)
