As well as extreme confounding examples like the one you mention in your question, the thing with shuffling is reproducibility. If you accidentally discover a certain order that gives better than average results, if you publish those results they could be misleading. In your case I’m not sure what the answer if as I’m not sure what algorithm(s) you are using, what sort of database, etc. Maybe you could add these details to your question. In principle, most databases should allow you to retrieve records really quickly as long as your search is supported by an index, so you could probably generate a random shuffle of your index outside of your database to determine the order in which you retrieve training examples. If you really do need to only use a small number of preset shuffles, 2 is probably fine. Use statistical tests like this one to show that sufficiently large consecutive queries using each ordering behave like samples from the same population.
