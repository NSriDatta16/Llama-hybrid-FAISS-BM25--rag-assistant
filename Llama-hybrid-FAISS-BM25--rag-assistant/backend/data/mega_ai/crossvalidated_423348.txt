Interpreting snake-like structures in the UMAP visualization of a FASTA data set

I'm looking for some guidance to interpret a UMAP plot. I started with two FASTA files for two different genes. I concatenated everything into a single string of only ACGT. Then I split that into non-overlapping segments of length 400. Then I mapped each character into a value {'A':0.0, 'C':0.333, 'G:0'.666, 'T':1.0}. That gave me a numpy array of 500000 rows by 400 columns containing both genes. I fit_transformed that with UMAP and plotted it as shown. The two colors are the two genes from different organisms. I've used UMAP and tSNE in other project and successfully understood the formations of clusters (ex MNIST). And I've done the same transform on np.random.random() uniform data and know that you just get a big round blob. I'm trying to undertand the structure of this plot and what I call the "snake". My question is whether or not this interpretation makes sense: Knowing that UMAP puts two similar points "near" each other that would mean that "AAAA.....AAAA" should be near "AAAA....AAAT". There certainly will be variation between the 400 character segments so maybe that accounts for points from the same genome that are "close", but there's no way I have enough data to statistically fill the 4^400 possible space..... is that why I have a thin structure? I have empirically noted that if I set the window to 100 instead of 400, the "snake" is fatter and shorter. Since I have the same amount of data, I would then be covering more of the 4^100 possible space. If I increase it to 1000, I see a longer and even thinner "snake".
