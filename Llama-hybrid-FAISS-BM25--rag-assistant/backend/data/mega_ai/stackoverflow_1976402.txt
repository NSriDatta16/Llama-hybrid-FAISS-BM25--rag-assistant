You might be able to create a neural network to identify "photos" contained within images. A quick google search came up with this code project article on image recognition using neural networks , in case you feel like coding it ;) EDIT You can use this NN in conjunction with however you plan on identifying people in photos. If a "photo" overlaps a person, then that person is in the photo.
