Best way to display a list of events by month

I have a mySQL table of events and want to display them in a list using PHP. Pretty simple, except I only want to display the month name once, for example: May 2010 12th, 7 pm. Event 1 - event one description 15th, 5:30 pm. Event 2 - event two description June 2010 9th, 7 pm. Event 1 - event one description 11th, 5:30 pm. Event 2 - event two description I'm very new at SQL and PHP. I can think of one way to do it. It would involve selecting all records grouped by date, then looping through all records, comparing the month/year value each time and the first time the month/year doesn't match, print a new header row to my HTML table. I can't believe it's the best or most efficient way to go. Any ideas for a newbie? I'm sure my way would work, but it's inelegant at best, and processor-intensive at worst.
