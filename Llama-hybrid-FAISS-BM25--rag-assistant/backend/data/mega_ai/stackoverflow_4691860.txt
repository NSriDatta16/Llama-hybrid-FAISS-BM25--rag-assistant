Rails 3 autoload_paths versus Rails 2 load_paths

So, I figured out that I needed to change my config.load_paths to config.autoload_paths but when I did that, I start seeing this exception: Expected /path/to/myapp/app/helpers/controllers/my_helper.rb to define Controllers::MyHelper In Rails 2, it never complained about the helpers/controllers folder, but now it seems that it expects a namespaced module. Do I have rename all of my helpers, or is there some other way this can work? I have so many helpers that I use helpers/models helpers/views and helpers/controllers to keep them all organized. Thanks in advance!
