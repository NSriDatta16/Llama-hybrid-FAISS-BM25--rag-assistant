T-SQL Time Averaging

I have a table in SQL Server that stores statistics for a piece of hardware, rows in the table represent data for a given second. It contains for example, these columns: timestamp (DateTime) value (int) What I want to do is select the data from the table for a given date/time range but return it in such a way that it averages for a given time period (such as 1 minute, 5 minute, 1 day etc) between the given range. So for an hour I'd have 60 rows of 1 minute averages. Where do I start with this? Anybody any points or ideas?
