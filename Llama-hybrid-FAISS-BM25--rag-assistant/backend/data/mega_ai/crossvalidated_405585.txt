From a strictly probabilistic perspective, that weight will depend on how much overlap there is between name and speech pattern variables, so there is not one right answer. $P(gender|name,speech)$ can be equal to $P(gender|name)$ if speech pattern did not tell us anything about gender that name did not already tell us (in other words, if we took a name, all individuals with that name had the same speech pattern). (And similarly with $P(gender|name,speech)$ equating to $P(gender|speech)$ ). If, however, every instance of a particular name was associated with a different speech pattern and with a different gender, then it is possible for $P(gender|name,speech)$ to equal to $P(gender|name) + P(gender|speech)$ or to $P(gender|name) - P(gender|speech)$ . Having said all that, you may want to try ensemble methods / model stacking to try to get better predictions from your separate models. It can be as simple as taking a simple average of predictions from different models, but it can also involve implementing second-level (and higher order) prediction models using predictions from the original models as input.
