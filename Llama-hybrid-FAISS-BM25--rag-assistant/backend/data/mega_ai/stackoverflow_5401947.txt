Questions about developing GAE apps on Eclipse with Clojure

After getting counterclockwise working on my Eclipse setup and GAE development server running in interactive mode I found these things still unclear for me: 1) How can I start server and application without commanding it on REPL? 2) When I deploy application to Google servers, how and where do I define the entry point of application? I mean, how Google will know which application, application handlers and routes to use? 3) Can I combine using java classes and clojure files on same project so that both are compiled automatic when creating and editing them on my src folder? 4) Which files and jars are actually needed for uploading to GAE at the end? Im used to deploy PHP apps to GAE, but here I dont know if I should make jars, include compiled clj files. I also might like to organize files different way than counterclockwise or appengine-magic does, so where do I specify paths to resources and classes? 5) Finally is it possible to connect Google production server with Emacs - Slime - Swank combination? That would be the fulfill of dreams, lol. I'm using appengine-magic with Jetty, Compojure, Ring and Hiccup.
