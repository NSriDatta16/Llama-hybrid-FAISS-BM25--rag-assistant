What are the best practices for multilanguage sites?

I want to make a multi-language site, such that all or almost all pages will be available in 2 or more translations. What are the best practices to follow? For example, I consider these language selection mechanisms: Cookie-based selection of the preferred language. Based on Accept-Language header if the cookie is not set. Based on GeoIP otherwise (probably). Is there anything else? How should different translations be served? as LANG.example.com/page as example.com/LANG/page as example.com/page?hl=LANG ... any of the above with a redirect to example.com/page ? (It seems to be discouraged ) How to ensure that all the translations are properly indexed? Sitemaps with all pages + correct Content-Language header are enough? What is the best way to let the users know there are other translations, but do not distract them? list available languages in the header/footer/sidebar (like Wikipedia) put “Choose a language” selector next to the content What is the best policy to deal with missing/outdated translations? do not display missing pages at all or display a page in a different language? display old translation, old translation with a warning or a page in a different language? What else should I take into account? What should I do and what I definitely should not?
