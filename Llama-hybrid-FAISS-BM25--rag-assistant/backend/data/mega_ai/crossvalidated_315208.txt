You want to do time-series prediction, but the CRFs are used for sequential supervised learning. There are two key differences between time-series prediction and sequential supervised learning. First in sequential supervised learning, the entire sequence x1,..., xT is available before we make any predictions of the y values, whereas in time-series prediction, we have only a prefix of the sequence up to the current time t + 1. Second, in time-series analysis, we have the true observed y values up to time t, whereas in sequential supervised learning, we are not given any y values and we must predict them all. taken from Machine Learning for Sequential Data: A Review
