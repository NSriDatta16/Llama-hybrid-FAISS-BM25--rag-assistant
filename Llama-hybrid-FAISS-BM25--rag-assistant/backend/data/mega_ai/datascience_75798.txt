When thinking of rnn/lstm/gru layer keep few points in mind. What is your inputs size? In this case we have 5 word sentence so 5 input circle going into lstm layer with that every word value will be multiple by same weight value. How many lstm cell will be present inside lstm layer? To keep it simple as we have 5 words we are keeping 5 lstm cell for each word then carry forwarding it's memory into next lstm cell. How many output categories we have? The last lstm cell will be connected to the all 3 dense layer neurons and at each of the neurons softmax operation will happend just like normal fully connected neural network dense layer works.
