Export iQueryable of complex objects to Excel

We have some code that exports data from a database to Excel and it works well. The main problem is we use a DB view to gather all our data. This creates the issue of having a sizable view as we have multiple types of objects of which we export. class Event int id string title List Dates string desc class EventDate DateTime start DateTime end List Locations class EventLocation string address string city string zip class Birthday : Event int balloonsOrdered string cakeText class Meeting : Event string Organizer string Topic So, above is the model. Birthday and Meeting inherit from Event and all Event objects have a list of EventDate objects. Each EventDate object has a start date, end date and a list of Location objects. Our goal is to find a dynamic way to get data from the DB to an Excel doc. We'd rather not maintain a massive view in the database (as we'll add more event types eventually). I'm not all that familiar with .NET's XML capabilities, but the solution we are using now uses OpenXML and the code makes sense.
