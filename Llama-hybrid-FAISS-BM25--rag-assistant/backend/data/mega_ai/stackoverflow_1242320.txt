As rezzif mentioned what you need to do is check with an isset() call. If you're using arrays a lot and don't want to go back and add a bunch of isset() calls you can always us a function. Something like: function get_index($array, $index) { return isset($array[$index]) ? $array[$index] : null; } Then you could change your if-statement to something like: if (get_index($_GET, 'p') == "account.edit.topfriends" || get_index($_GET, 'action') == "newmember" || get_index($_GET, 'p') == "account.profile.name") { //some more code here } If all the checks being done are against $_GET you could always nix the first parameter of the function and hardcode $_GET in it, my example assumes you're doing this against several different arrays. This solution isn't necessarily the most elegant, but it should get the job done.
