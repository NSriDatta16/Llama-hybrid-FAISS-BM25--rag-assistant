Edit: Your query is slow when you sort the result - this can be caused by the index if the given order is incorrect. MySQL defaults to ASC sort order. See mysql manual: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-index.html An index_col_name specification can end with ASC or DESC. These keywords are permitted for future extensions for specifying ascending or descending index value storage. Currently, they are parsed but ignored; index values are always stored in ascending order. Please check this links: http://www.ozzu.com/programming-forum/mysql-index-cardinality-t71876.html Why does the cardinality of an index in MySQL remain unchanged when I add a new index? You might need to optimize your index: OPTIMIZE TABLE users; It might make sense to have an Index with id and verified combined. You have a lot of Indexes - this might confuse mysql.
