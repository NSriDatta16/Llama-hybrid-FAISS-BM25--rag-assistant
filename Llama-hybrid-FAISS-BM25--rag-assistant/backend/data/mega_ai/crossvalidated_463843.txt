Bellman's equation solution for grid problem

While solving an RL problem from the University of Alberta online course, I made a modification to check if my understanding is written. I came upon the answer which I suspect is not correct. I will state the problem first. The image is below. The grid has 4 subgrids and each subgrid is an state $S$ , $S$ = $\{A,B,C,D\}$ . The agent can take any of the following action from action set $A$ with equal probability (i.e. $\pi(a|s) = 4$ ). $A$ = $\{L,R,U D\}$ . I will appreciate if someone can find tell me if it is wrong or correct? The agent will earn a point when it moves to State $B$ , even if it is a rebound from within $B$ . If the agent leave $B$ , then it will be penalized with $-1$ reward. Every other action has a reward of $0$ . I suspect that the value function for $\{A,B,C,D\}$ should have been $\{V_A, V_B, V_D, V_D\} = \{3.52,3.92,2.0,3.52 \}$ . Instead I am getting teh value as shown in the figure below.
