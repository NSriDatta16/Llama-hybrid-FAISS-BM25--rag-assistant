BIC and DIC are "Bayesian" tools similar to AIC. A slightly different Bayesian model selection tool is the Log-Predictive Score. Note that, with exception of the BIC, Bayesian tools are based on the posterior distribution (or the posterior sample) rather than on point estimators. This is common in Bayesian statistics since the goal is to account for the variability of the parameters which is not considered by using point estimators.
