In every garbage-collected system I know of, the garbage collection machinery was designed to run in the background as an abstraction the programmer should theoretically pay no attention to. There are some special situations where forcing a collection is useful, but these usually involve interrupts (real machine interrupts, not actionscript events), testing/debugging scenarios, or some tricky latency management necessities. Odds are you will never need to call System.gc() and you can safely ignore it.
