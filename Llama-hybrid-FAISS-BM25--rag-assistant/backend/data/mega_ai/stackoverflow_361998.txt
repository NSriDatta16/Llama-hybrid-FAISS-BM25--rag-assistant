Average time complexity of quicksort vs insertion sort

I'm lead to believe that quick sort should be faster than insertion sort on a medium size unorderd int array. I've implemented both algorithms in java and I notice quicksort is significantly slower then insertion sorrt. I have a theory: quiksort is being slower because it's recursive and the call it's making to it's own method signature is quite slow in the JVM which is why my timer is giving much higher readings than I expected, whereas insertion isn't recursive and all thwe work is done within one method so they JVM isn't having to do any extra grunt work? amirite?
