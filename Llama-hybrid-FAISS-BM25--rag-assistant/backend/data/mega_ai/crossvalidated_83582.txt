(1) You will likely need some kind of autoregressive structure, simply because we expect measurements taken further apart to be less correlated than those taken closer together. Exchangeable would assume they are all equally correlated. But as with everything else, it depends. (2) I think this kind of decision comes down to thinking about how the data were generated, rather than seeing how they look. (4) it depends. For example, kids nested in schools should not, in most cases, be treated as independent. Due to social patterning, etc, if I know something about a kid in a given school, then I probably know at least a little bit about other kids in the schools. I once used GEE to look at relationships between different social and economic indicators and obesity prevalence in a birth cohort where participants were nested in neighborhoods. I used an exchangeable structure. You can find the paper here and check some of the references, including 2 from epi journals. (5) Apparently so (e.g. see this example ), but I can't help with the R specfics of doing this. Zeger SL, Liang KY, Albert PS.
