I second mlowen's suggestion to use GtkTable for the main organization of the grid, it's very easy to get a grid-like look. You might also want to investigate populating each cell with a plain GtkEventBox , if you don't need the built-in drawing of the button. The eventbox is an invisible widget, that basically adds a window and makes the covered area clickable. It's useful to make some of GTK+'s otherwise "silent" widgets more interactive, for instance it's commonly used behind a GtkLabel to make it clickable; if the label provides enough drawing capability for your needs, that's a possible way to continue too.
