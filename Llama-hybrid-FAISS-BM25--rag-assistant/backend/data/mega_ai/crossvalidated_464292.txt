How would I test whether the average of multidimensional data is different

I have data points in two dimensions. Each point has associated errors in both dimensions (see figure). I would like to test whether the data are different from each other. So e.g., is orange different from green? I could do individual tests along each axis, but it would be great if a test existed that would allow me to test both dimensions at once. I hope this makes sense. thank you!
