I found a wonderful resource online that describes this question in much detail. Bayesian Methods for Neural Networks: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15782-f06/slides/bayesian.pdf Also, see chapter 10 of 'Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition' book by Bishop: http://cs.du.edu/~mitchell/mario_books/Neural_Networks_for_Pattern_Recognition_-_Christopher_Bishop.pdf#page=400
