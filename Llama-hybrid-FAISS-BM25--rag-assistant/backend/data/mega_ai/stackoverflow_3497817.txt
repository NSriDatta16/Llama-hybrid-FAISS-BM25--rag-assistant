For the specific data shown in your question... var yourData = File.ReadAllLines("yourFile.csv") .Skip(1) .Select(x => x.Split(',')) .Select(x => new { Plant = x[0], Material = x[1], Density = double.Parse(x[2]), StorageLocation = int.Parse(x[3]) }); If you already have a type declared for your data then you can use that rather than the anonymous type. Note that this code isn't robust at all . It won't correctly handle values containing commas/newlines etc, quoted string values, or any of the other esoteric stuff that is often found in CSV files.
