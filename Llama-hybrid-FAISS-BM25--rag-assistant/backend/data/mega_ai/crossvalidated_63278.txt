One way to approach the solution would be building two models: one for the values which are in line with the distribution and other for the outliers. My suggestion in this regard would be to create a binary response variable (0,1) with 0 being the value if the datapoint is within the bounds of your distribution and 1 if it lies outside. So for the cases of the outliers which you want to keep in your data, you will be having 1 in your target variable and the rest as 0. Now run a logistic regression to predict the probabilities of the outliers and you can multiply the average value for the group of outliers with the individual probabilities to get the predictions. For the rest of the data, you can run your SVM to predict the values. Because the values are outliers, they will have low probabilities associated with it and even if you take mean of the outliers which will be skewed, the expected value of the outliers will be pulled down by their attached low probabilities and there by making it a more reasonable prediction. Had met with a similar scenario while predicting claims amount for an Insurance service provider. I had used the above-mentioned technique to increase the performance of my model drastically. Another way could be taking log transformation of your target variable which is possible if you have only positive value in your target variable. But make sure if you are taking a log transformation of your target variable, while predicting the variable you need to include the error component as well. So, $\log(Y) = a + B'X + \epsilon$ is your model equation for e.g then, $Y = \exp(a+B'X+\epsilon)$ You can take a look into the following link for log-transformation: http://www.vims.edu/people/newman_mc/pubs/Newman1993.pdf
