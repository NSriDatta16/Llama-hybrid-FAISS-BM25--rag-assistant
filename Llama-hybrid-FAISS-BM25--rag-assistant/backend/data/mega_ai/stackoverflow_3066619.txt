How to use AIR 2.0 NativeProcess API with Java?

How do you use this great new API in connection with Java? Do you use just pure native process API like nativeProcess.standardInput.write() and nativeProcess.standardOutput.read() with which you cannot debug Java side neither invoke remote java method. Or you are using some library that leverages remote method invocation such as flerry lib but that also cannot debug Java side? Or maybe you are using Merapi with which you can debug but cannot remotely invoke Java method? I'm asking this because this is maybe the most important question regarding this API and its ease of use.
