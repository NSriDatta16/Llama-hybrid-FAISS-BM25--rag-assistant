Eclipse plugin: popup menu extension for ILogEntry (CVS revisions history) not showing (objectContribution at plugin.xml)

Possible Duplicate: Any known problems/bugs with objectContribution (popup) to CVS History view? It's not working I'm migrating an old eclipse 3.0 plugin to eclipse 3.4 and the popup menu contributed to the CVS revisions history is not showing at all. I have another popup menu contributed to another perspective (CVS repository exploring) and that's working without problems (ICVSResource). The one not working is org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.ILogEntry Here is the concrete XML fragment at plugin.xml FYI. Anyone can help me? Thanks. I'm updating this issue here: Any known problems/bugs with objectContribution (popup) to CVS History view? It's not working
