Generating short license keys with OpenSSL

I'm working on a new licensing scheme for my software, based on OpenSSL public / private key encryption. My past approach, based on this article , was to use a large private key size and encrypt an SHA1 hashed string, which I sent to the customer as a license file (the base64 encoded hash is about a paragraph in length). I know someone could still easily crack my application, but it prevented someone from making a key generator, which I think would hurt more in the long run. For various reasons I want to move away from license files and simply email a 16 character base32 string the customer can type into the application. Even using small private keys (which I understand are trivial to crack), it's hard to get the encrypted hash this small. Would there be any benefit to using the same strategy to generated an encrypted hash, but simply using the first 16 characters as a license key? If not, is there a better alternative that will create keys in the format I want?
