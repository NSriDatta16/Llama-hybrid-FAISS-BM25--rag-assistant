After a deep diving into the lme code and after carefully reading Pinheiro and Bates (2000) Mixed-effects Modles in S and S-PLUS , I realised that it is not possible (and it is nonsensical) to provide a starting value for sigma . This is so because $\sigma^2$ is profiled out from the rest of the parameters and its estimation given the rest of the parameters, is performed in analytically by the average (or corrected average depending on which method is used) of the squared residuals. Hope this may be useful.
