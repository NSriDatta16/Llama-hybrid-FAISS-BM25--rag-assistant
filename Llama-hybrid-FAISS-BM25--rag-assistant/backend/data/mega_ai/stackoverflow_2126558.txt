There are various Smalltalk implementation that support Seaside and that have an excellent integration into the Windows platform: Dolphin Smalltalk , VA Smalltalk , and Cincom Smalltalk . I assume that it is possible to call Excel with any of these. There are various command line tools available that you could call to convert an XLS file to something you can easily parse (like CSV). However, I think the most elegant solution (also from an end-user perspective) is the one of Magic/Replace .
