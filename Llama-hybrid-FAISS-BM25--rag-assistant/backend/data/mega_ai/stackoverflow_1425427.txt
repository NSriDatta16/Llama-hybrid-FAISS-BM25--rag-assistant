There is a way to generate a sample of the subsets that is random, guaranteed not to have duplicates, uses O(1) storage, and can be re-generated at any time. First, write a function to generate a combination given its lexical index . Second, use a pseudorandom permutation of the first Combin(n, m) integers to step through those combinations in a random order. Simply feed the numbers 0...100000 into the permutation, use the output of the permutation as input to the combination generator, and process the resulting combination.
