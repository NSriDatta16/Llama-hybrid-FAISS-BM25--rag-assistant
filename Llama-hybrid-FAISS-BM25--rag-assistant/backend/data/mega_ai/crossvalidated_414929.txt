Regression shows high multicollinearity even after a PCA

I am comparing men and women using a measure of personality which has 24 variables. I did a oblimin rotated PCA for women and men separately so that they are truly representative of the population and obtained 4 components. I conducted a step wise regression for women in relation to my DV and obtained results with a VIF of 7-9 which is barely below the threshold of 10 but is acceptable. However, while doing the analysis for men, my VIF is off the charts reaching upto 22! The components in the correlation matrix show high correlation ranging from .800 to .900. Researchers have used oblique rotation to extract the principal components for this data before. I included variables which have a loading of .45 and above in the pattern matrix. How do I solve this issue? What could be the reason for this?
