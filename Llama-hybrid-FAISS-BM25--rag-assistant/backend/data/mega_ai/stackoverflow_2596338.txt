Where are tables in Mnesia located?

I try to compare Mnesia with more traditional databases. As I understand it tables in Mnesia can be located to (see Memory consumption in Mnesia ): ram_copies - tables are stored in ets , so no durability as in ACID. disc_copies - tables are located to ets and dets , so the table can not be bigger than the available memory? And if the table are fragmented, the database can not be bigger than the available memory? disc_only_copies - tables are located dets , so no caching in memory and worse performance. And the size of the table are limited to the size of dets or the table has to be fragmented. So if I want the performance of doing reads from RAM and the durability of writes to disc, then the size of the tables are very limited compared to a traditional RDBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL. I know that Mnesia aren't meant to replace traditional RDBMS:s, but can it be used as a big RDBMS or do I have to look for another database? The server I will use is a VPS with limited amount of memory, around 512MB , but I want good database performance. Are disc_copies and the other types of tables in Mnesia so limited as I have understood? CanÂ´t the database be partially on memory and a full copy on disc?
