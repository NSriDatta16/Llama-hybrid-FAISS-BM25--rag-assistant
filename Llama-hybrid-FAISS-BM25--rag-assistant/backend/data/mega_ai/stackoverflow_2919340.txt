I've never used that function before - interesting. Now, all the major search engines will declare themselves with a distinct User-Agent header, which is where I assume this function is getting most of its information from - it's probably matching the User-Agent value against a lookup table, and it could be that newer indexers are not being identified correctly. You could write your own list, and test the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] superglobal against that - but you'd have to monitor for updates. It also won't stop bad or malicious indexers, since they would tend to disguise themselves as a normal browser (just like any other header from the client, User-Agent is not to be trusted).
