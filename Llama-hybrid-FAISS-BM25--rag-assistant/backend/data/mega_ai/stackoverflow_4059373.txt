A block of memory which isn't interrupted by other memory. Or to be more precise it requires an uninterrupted block of virtual address-space. The real RAM backing that address space doesn't need to be contiguous. This is important if you allocate a large memory block. The OS has to give it to you as a contiguous block, but if memory is so fragmented that only smaller pieces are free then this memory allocation cannot be satisfied even if the total free memory is larger than the requested space. This isn't such a big problem on 64 bit apps since the address space is large there. But in 32 bit processes it can happen that the heap gets so fragmented(between freed blocks there are still unfreed blocks) that larger allocations fail.
