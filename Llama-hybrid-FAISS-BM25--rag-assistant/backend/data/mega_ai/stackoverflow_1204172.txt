How to control placement of paste menu in a UITextView in iPhone SDK

I have a UITextView placed just below a view containing an ad and when the user tries to paste in text the paste menu overlays the ad which is just above the insertion point. I don't want to encourage accidental clicks so I'm looking for a way to make the menu display below the insertion point instead of above it. Or maybe there's a way to trick the menu controller into thinking that text view is already at the top of the screen. I've tried using the setTargetRect:inView: method on the sharedMenuController but that has no effect. Apparently the text view doesn't use the shared menu controller. I've tried adding variations of the following line to my view controller's textViewDidBeginEditing:textView and viewDidLoad methods with no luck. [[UIMenuController sharedMenuController] setTargetRect: CGRectMake(140, 120, 5, 5) inView:self.view];
