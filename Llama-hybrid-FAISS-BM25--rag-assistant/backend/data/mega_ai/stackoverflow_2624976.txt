Another thing you should be aware of: If you open and mount ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/SnapshotRepository.sparseimage as a disk image and then start Xcode to recover or look into your snapshots Xcode will complain that the Snapshot Repository is broken and move it into the Trash! So remember to unmount the repository before starting Xcode. To recover a trashed Snapshot Repository just drag it into the correct path (see above) and remove the date stamp inside the filename.
