If i understand implicits correctly from http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2007/06/scala-implicits.html then yes, there are several languages that support it. Best example are C# Extension methods. A recent example where i used them: I often had to do distance calculations between two Point s. A Point has no method to calculate the distance to another point so i added the following code to my project: class MyPointExtension { public static Double GetDistance(this Point p1, Point p2) { return /* the pythagoras code */ } } I could then do: Point unitPosition = new Point(x,y); Point target = new Point(x2,y2); Double distance = unitPosition.GetDistance(target);
