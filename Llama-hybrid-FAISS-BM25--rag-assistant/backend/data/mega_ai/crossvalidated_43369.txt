You have several options. Two of them might be: If you transform your $Y$ through the $\log(\frac{y}{1-y})$ logistic transformation you could try fitting a linear regression via ordinary least squares to that transformed response variable. Alternatively, you could fit the original variable into a generalized linear model with the logistic transform as your link variable and with a relationship between $Y$'s variance and mean the same as though it were a binomial variable, fitting by iterative reweighted least squares. This is basically the same as "using logistic regression". Which one to use would depend on the error structure, and the only way to decide is to fit them both and see which one has a residual structure that best fits the model's assumptions. My suspicion is that there would not be much to choose between them. Certainly, either of these options would be a big improvement on straight linear regression with the untransformed $Y$, for the reasons you say.
