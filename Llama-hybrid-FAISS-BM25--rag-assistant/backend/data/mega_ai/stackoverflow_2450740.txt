There is an alternate approach to this, depending on the task you are trying to accomplish. If cond is entirely a function of the input data you are looping over, you might try something like the following: def check_cond(item): if item satisfies cond: return True return False for item in filter(check_cond, list): ... This is the functional programming way to do this, sort of like LINQ in C# 3.0+. I'm not so certain it's all that pythonic (for a while Guido van Rossum wanted to remove filter, map and reduce from Python 3) but it certainly is elegant and the way I would do it.
