You can't have the Play command in the same method as the SetSource command since the file will be opened asynchronously. By setting AutoPlay to true (which is also the defualt). You ensure that it will play as soon as it's loaded. MediaElement ME = new MediaElement(); ME.AutoPlay = true; IsolatedStorageFile ISF = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); ME.SetSource(ISF.OpenFile("foo.wma", FileMode.Open)); Silvelright doesn't natively support wav files, so to play wav files you need to download http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wavmss , then use the following code. MediaElement ME = new MediaElement(); ME.AutoPlay = true; IsolatedStorageFile ISF = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); ME.SetSource(new WaveMediaStreamSource(ISF.OpenFile("foo.wav", FileMode.Open))); Although not ideal, you can use the file extensions to detect when a wav file is being played and use the second code sample only in this case.
