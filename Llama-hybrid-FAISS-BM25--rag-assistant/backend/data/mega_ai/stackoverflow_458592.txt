It does seem to me that the processes of convert-object-to-text-format and store-text-somewhere could and should be separable. Which of those things would be "primary" I guess would depend on how exactly your application is structured. That is, whether you Tell the object, "go store yourself," and the configuration of the application determines that that means X format, and Y storage. Tell the object, "go store yourself in the database," and the database storage asks the object for its text format (or passes the object to a service layer that returns that text). Tell the object, "go store your XML," and then that serialization process knows which storage mechanism to choose. When I say "configuration," that could be as simple as something in the app settings, or as complicated/robust as an IoC container instantiating particular components when the app launches. You should be able to encapsulate the serialization and storage processes such that changing your mind about how they get wired together, or adding new options, doesn't require you to rewrite too much of your application.
