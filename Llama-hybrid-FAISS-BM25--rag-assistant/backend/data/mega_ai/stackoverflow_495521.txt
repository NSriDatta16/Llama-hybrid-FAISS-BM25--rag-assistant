OK, I found the answer.. I used a border to wrap the grid and then caught the Border1_MouseLeftButtonDown event. I also had to set the borders Background to "Transparent", and now everything works like a charm. Private Sub Border1_MouseLeftButtonDown(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventArgs) Handles Border1.MouseLeftButtonDown DragMove() End Sub
