Basis expansion for regression using neural network?

I am trying to approximate a nonlinear function using a neural network. There are 3-4 input units. The network is struggling a bit to generalize the function outside the vicinity of the training data set. I asked someone and he suggested that basis expansion might help. Can someone please provide a reference for the same, I am not able to find any. Also, he suggested "basis expansion using kernel method".
