primitives are always faster. however there are times, when objects are really useful: 1. upcasting. Your function can take Number(is a parent for all numeric objects: Integer, Float, etc.) for an argument. 2. Possible null value. For example it is used while storing in database. Object can be null, primitives must have value. So if field in db is nullable, it is better to use object version of primitive value. 3. if function takes object and you always give it a primitive there are expenses on autoboxing(turning primitive into object). The same for returning from function. 4. Objects have certain methods, such as getHashcode(), toString() etc., which can be really useful in some cases.
