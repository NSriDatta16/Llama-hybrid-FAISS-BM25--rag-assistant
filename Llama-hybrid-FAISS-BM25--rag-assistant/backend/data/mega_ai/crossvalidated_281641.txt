Reduce data set dimension to one variable

Which methods could be used in order to reduce dimensionality from n to 1? Giving an example: I have a data set of 8 variables, and I would like to obtain one combination that describe the maximum information in order to get a score of the importance of each variable. Going deeper: Imagine these 8 variables are related with interaction's web user, so I would like to score each website depending on this iteration(8 variables). So, a way to get this? As far as I worked with, I know PCA T-SNE FA(Factor Analysis) CFA(Confirmatory Factor analysis) can be a way to do that. Which method could be the best one? EDIT:(EXAMPLE) Simulating some data.. names= ('page1','page2','page3') n_clicks = (30, 1,10) Time_visit = (100,2,50) n_likes = (2223,10,100) With some algotihm we would get the following Scores: page1_Score = 120; page2_Score = 10; page3_Score = 60
