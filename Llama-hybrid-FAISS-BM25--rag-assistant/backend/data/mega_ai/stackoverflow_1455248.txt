in ASP.Net MVC, what is the most elegant way to access objects stored in the session?

In my asp.net mvc project I store two objects in the session when the user logs in. One is a User object (representing the logged in user) and the other is the Organisation object (representing the user's organisation). I need one or both of these objects to be available in every action method. What's the most elegant way of dealing with this? At the moment each action takes parameters for each of these objects, with a custom model binder retrieving the objects from session. This at least encapsulates the session access but it's annoying to have the params in every method signature. Is there a better way? Here's what most of the action methods look like. public ActionResult Pending(IUser CurrentUser) { var users = CurrentUser.GetMyOrgPendingUsers(); return View(users); }
