Nonrepresentative sample for causal analysis

Suppose I observe an outcome $Y_i$ for a binary policy $Z_i$ with random assignment and no spillovers such that $Y_i(1),Y_i(0) \perp Z_i$ . I run the regression $$ y_i = \alpha + \beta z_i + \varepsilon_i $$ to get the average treatment effect of the policy $E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)]$ . However, the dataset I have at hand was collected as a non-random sample which is not representative of the population. There exist no weights to compensate that. Will $\hat{\beta}$ give an unbiased estimate of $E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)]$ ?
