Another thing that may be helpful is to factor in variable bitrate encoding , which means that it is difficult to predict exactly what the average and maximum bitrate will be for any given segment. When encoding, set the target bitrate of your audio-only stream low enough so that no segments go above 64kbit/s (the right number takes a bit of trial and error).
