Help needed for 'cross-thread operation error' in C#

In the following code MessageReceived is on a different thread to label1 and when trying to access it I will get this error: Cross-thread operation not valid: Control 'label1' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on. foo.MessageReceived += new Agent.MessageReceivedHandler(foo_MessageReceived); void foo_MessageReceived(Message message) { label1.Text = message.Body; } How can I solve this? More : apparently I need to use delegate and invoke , but I don't know how, can you please explain in more detail?
