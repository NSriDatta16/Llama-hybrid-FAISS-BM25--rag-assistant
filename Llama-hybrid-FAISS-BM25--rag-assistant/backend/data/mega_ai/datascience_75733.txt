PCA for complex-valued data

I'm quite shocked for encountering this error on PCA from sklearn ValueError: Complex data not supported After trying to fit complex-valued data. Is this just unimplemented thing? Should I just go ahead and do it 'manually' with SVD or is their a catch for complex-values?
