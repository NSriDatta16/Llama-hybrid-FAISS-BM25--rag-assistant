It's not clear what you mean by 'derive from' in this case. I can explain how an MA(1) fits into what the theorem says. The MA(1) process is a process of the form: $$ Y_t - \mu = \varepsilon_t - \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} $$ or it is sometimes written: $$ Y_t - \mu = \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} $$ (e.g. see here ) Now Wold's decomposition theorem says every covariance-stationary time series $Y_{t}$ can be written as the sum of two time series, one deterministic and one stochastic: $$Y_t=\sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j \varepsilon_{t-j}+\eta_t$$ Here $\eta_t$ is the deterministic part. Let $\eta_t=\mu$. Let $b_0 = 1$ and $b_j=0$ for all $j>1$. Then starting from the Wold decomposition: $$Y_t=\sum_{j=0}^\infty b_j \varepsilon_{t-j}+\eta_t\\ = 1\cdot\varepsilon_{t-0}+b_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}+\mu\\ =\mu + \varepsilon_t+b_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}$$ which is an MA(1) with $\theta_1=-b_1$ (if the MA(1) is written in the first form above) or with $\theta_1=b_1$ (if written in the second form above). This makes it clear that the Wold decomposition holds for an MA(1) process.
