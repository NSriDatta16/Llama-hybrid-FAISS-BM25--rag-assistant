How to plot binary vs. categorical (nominal) data?

I am building a machine learning model for a binary classification task in Python/ Jupyter Notebook. I am currently in the "Exploratory data analysis" phase and try to create multiple plots/ graphs for my data set. My data set consists of 20 columns (19 features and 1 labeled target). Each row in my data set represents a person. There are many categorical/ nominal features in my data set and only few numerical/ continuous ones. Unfortunately I cannot upload the real data set, so I will create a dummy one. personID age car TARGET_happiness 1 27 ford 0 2 41 tesla 1 3 55 bmw 0 4 34 tesla 1 5 62 ford 1 6 38 ford 1 7 51 bmw 0 8 46 tesla 1 9 72 bmw 0 10 59 tesla 0 11 48 ford 0 12 51 bmw 1 My aim is to create a plot/ graph to visualize the relationship between the binary variable TARGET_happiness (meaning "is the person happy?") and the categorical variable car (meaning "which car does this person own"). The plot I've used for binary TARGET_happiness vs. continuous age is a box plot, see: This seems fine. Now I also try to use a box plot for binary TARGET_happiness vs. categorical car : I'm not sure if this plot is useful / appropriate. Sure, you can see that Tesla owners seem to be happier than BMW owners. But the box for Ford owners looks strange. Which type of plot/ graph can I use to better visualize the relationship between binary and categorical data?
