Based on your edit, it seems like you always have 106 numbers, all of which are initialized... is that correct? If so, you don't need to count, just return 106. EDIT: @PuppyKevin, based on your comment, what you can do is make another constant variable to keep track of the total number of ints in class one, like public static final NUMBER_OF_INTS_IN_CLASS_ONE = 106; and just refer to that in class two, like for(int i = 0; i That way you only have to remember to update one place, and it's in the file you're already editing, which will reduce mistakes. Also, do you have a specific reason for avoiding arrays or collections? If not, as you might expect from the other answers, I encourage you to use one of those. It's better style for a number of reasons, and would eliminate the problem you're asking about in this post.
