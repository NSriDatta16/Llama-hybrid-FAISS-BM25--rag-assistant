Random Forest is invariant to monotonic transformations of individual features. Translations or per feature scalings will not change anything for the Random Forest. SVM will probably do better if your features have roughly the same magnitude, unless you know apriori that some feature is much more important than others, in which case it's okay for it to have a larger magnitude.
