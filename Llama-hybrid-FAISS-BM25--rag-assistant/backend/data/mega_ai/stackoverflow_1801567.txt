Please see my similar question regarding Kanji/Kana characters . As @coobird mentions it may be tricky to decide what range you want to check against since many Kanji overlap with Chinese characters. In short, the Unicode ranges for hiragana and katakana are: Hiragana: Unicode: 3040-309F Katakana: Unicode: 30A0–30FF If you find this answer useful please upvote @coobird's answer to my question as well. がんばって！
