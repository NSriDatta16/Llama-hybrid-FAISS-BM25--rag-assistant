Char array in "ch", byte array as "out" byte conv[23] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}; // Loop over the byte array from 0 to 9, stepping by 2 int j = 0; for (int i = 0; i Untested. The trick is in the array 'conv'. It's a fragment of an ASCII table, starting with the character for 0. The -1's are for the junk between '9' and 'A'. Oh, this is also not a safe or defensive routine. Bad input will result in crashes, glitches, etc.
