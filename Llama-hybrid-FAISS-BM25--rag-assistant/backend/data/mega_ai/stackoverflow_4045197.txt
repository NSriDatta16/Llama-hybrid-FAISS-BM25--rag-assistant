How to organize a GAE + GWT project with multiple modules

I would like to know if someone can recommend a tutorial to organize my project, or to explain how to do it. In my project I need these modules: a) Core (entities classes + daos) b) Backend (gwt module where the users can admin their app data, the user must logu in) c) Widgets (gwt module that loads an id in the url and displays a widget that the users can put in their webpages, no need to be logued to display the widget) d) Restlet API 1 (an api that the users can use, i'm thinking to develop this api with http://blog.noelios.com/2009/04/11/restlet-in-the-cloud-with-google-a ...) e) Restlet API 2 (another resltlet api for other purposes) Modules b, c, d, e will load module a (Core). And nothing else :) Can someone give me an idea about how to organize the project?
