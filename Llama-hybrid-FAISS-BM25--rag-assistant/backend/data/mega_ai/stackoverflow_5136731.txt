It has nothing to do with the port. They're blocking you because you're not using a browser user agent. curl does let you fake the user agent, but that may be a violation of the site's terms of service. According to this post it's not about blocking scripts, but just distinguishing between Shoutcast clients and everything else. So the code is: curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla");
