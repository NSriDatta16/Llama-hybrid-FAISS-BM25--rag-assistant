Why is the normalisation constant in Bayesian not a marginal distribution

The formula for Baye's rule is as follows $$p(\theta |D) = \frac{p(D|\theta)p(\theta)}{\int p(D|\theta)p(\theta)d\theta}$$ where $\int p(D|\theta)p(\theta)d\theta$ is the normalising constant $z$ . How is $z$ evaluated to be a constant when evaluating the integral becomes the marginal distribution $p(D)$ ?
