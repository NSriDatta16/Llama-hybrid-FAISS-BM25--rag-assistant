VS2010 project conversion is fraught. And if you haven't applied VS2010 Service Pack 1 you will almost certainly be wasting your time. Regarding project dependencies (you might not like this): MSBuild 4.0 (the VS2010 build agent) no longer looks in the solution file for project dependencies. Even if you managed to get your solution to build okay in the IDE, if you ever plan to build your solution from command-line build scripts, or a TFS build server, then all your project inter-dependencies must be applied in each project . Otherwise your projects will almost certainly build out of order, especially on multi-core machines where, by default, MSBuild 4.0 uses as many cores as it can find. My team had to bite the bullet and manually recreate project dependencies in each project so the VS2010 solutions would build correctly in both Visual Studio and our TFS build servers.
