You can use axes properties 'position' and 'units' and make them overly. Pay attention to create small axes after big one or use uistack() function so that big does not hide small one. What you can not do is to make an axes child of another one (like Mathworks do with legend ). But you do not need it anyway. For the second plot you have to use axes and line instead of plot and hold on . Units as 'normalized' (which is default) allows uniform resizable look when parent figure is being resized (e.g. manually maximized).
