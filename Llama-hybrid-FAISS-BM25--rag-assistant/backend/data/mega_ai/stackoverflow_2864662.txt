Pros and cons with automated/manual cache

I am thinking a lot about whether to head for a complete automated cache or manual cache. Our automatic approach would be a solution that digs through the database, queries and format each potential and future data request and saves it to an appropriate cache storage(memcache or disk based). Data would then not be invalidated and just overwritten by the automated cache update action. The manual approach is to let each request check if there's an valid and stored cache version that contains the requested data, and if not recreate it and save it to appropriate cache storage. What's common sense to do? How does the big guys do this? Thanks a lot!
