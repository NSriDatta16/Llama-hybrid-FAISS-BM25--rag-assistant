Why are the confidence intervals so large for the difference of differences?

I have run a generalized linear mixed effects model with the glmmTMB package to determine if there is an interaction between two categorical predictors, treatment and location, in predicting the number of birds detected. mod3 I'm interested in looking at comparing the levels of treatment and location to each other, so I have used the emmeans package to computer the difference of differences. mod3.emm trtmt = pulsed_nofood: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value near - far -0.273 0.586 124 -0.467 0.6416 trtmt = constant: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value near - far 2.024 0.376 124 5.381 c contrast estimate SE df lower.CL upper.CL near - far,constant - near - far,pulsed_nofood 2.297 0.696 124 0.652 3.94 near - far,pulsed_food - near - far,pulsed_nofood 3.011 0.935 124 0.801 5.22 near - far,pulsed_food - near - far,constant 0.714 0.820 124 -1.223 2.65 Results are given on the log (not the response) scale. Confidence level used: 0.95 Conf-level adjustment: mvt method for 3 estimates These results seemed okay, except for when I back-transformed these I realized that the confidence intervals are gigantic! c.response And the same is for the locdiffs: locdiffs.response Why is that? Does it have to do something with the log of differences turns into a ratio? If so, why does that mean the standard errors become gigantic?
