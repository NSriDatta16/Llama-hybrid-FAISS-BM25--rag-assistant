Which values to use for scaling out-of-sample PCA data?

I have centered and scaled inputs via prcomp () : prOut I now want to use my completed model on new (future) data. I assume the correct approach is to use the training data prOut$scale and prOut$center values and apply them to prior to calculating the principal component scores for my new data? It doesn't seem right to scale the new data using the scale and center values for the new data set.
