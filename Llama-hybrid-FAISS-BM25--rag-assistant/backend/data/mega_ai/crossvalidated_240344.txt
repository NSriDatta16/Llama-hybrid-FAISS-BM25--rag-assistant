Random Forest with seasonality

I watched everywhere on the Internet, but I cannot figure out how to use random forest with a seasonality matrix. I would start with a toy example: getSymbols("GOOG") seasonality where 1s are Monday, Tuesday,etc. How do I integrate this in: fit Also, am I going to have problems when one business day is a holiday ?
