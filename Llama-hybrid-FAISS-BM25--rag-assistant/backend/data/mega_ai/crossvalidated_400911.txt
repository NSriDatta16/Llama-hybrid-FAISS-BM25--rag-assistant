Lasso for time series - Independence assumptions violated?

I know it is not uncommon to use LASSO for time series. But as LASSO is actually only linear regression or a GLM with a constraint, what about the assumption of independent observations these models have? I don't think it is justified to assume the observations in a time series to be independent, or am I wrong?
