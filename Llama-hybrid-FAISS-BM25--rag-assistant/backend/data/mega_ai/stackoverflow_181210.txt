Update the database maintaining the Null status

I have an asp.net text form that contains numerous decimal fields that are optional. I want to selectively update the database but not inserting a "0" for fields that do not have data (maintaining the null status). Typically, I would create multiple functions, each with a different signature to handle this. However, I am inserting the data through a webservice which does not allow a function with the same name to have multiple signatures. I can think of a couple ways to work around this, but none "pragmatically".
