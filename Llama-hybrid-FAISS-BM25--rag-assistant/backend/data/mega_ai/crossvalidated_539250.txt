Can the horseshoe prior be expressed analytically?

My question is about the horseshoe prior, described by Carvalho et al. It is specified as: $$ \beta_i|\lambda_i,\tau\sim\mathcal N(0,\tau^2\lambda_i^2)\\ \lambda_i\sim\mathcal C^+(0,1) $$ I have read a few sources (including this question ) implying that the horseshoe prior cannot be expressed in closed form, that is, we cannot integrate over $\lambda_i$ and find a closed form expression for $f(\beta_i|\tau)$ . However, with some help from Wolfram Alpha , I found this: $$f(\beta_i|\tau)=\exp\left(\frac{\beta_i^2}{2\tau^2}\right)\text{erfc}\left(\left|\frac{\beta_i}{\tau\sqrt2}\right|\right)$$ Is this result correct? Is it considered a closed form expression? Also, can this be used to improve MCMC sampling, since one does not need to sample $\lambda_i$ ? Thanks! Edit: I am afraid this result is wrong because the original paper by Carvalho has a plot showing $f(\beta|\tau)\rightarrow\infty$ when $\beta\rightarrow0$ , while the equation I got implies $f(\beta|\tau)\rightarrow1$ . But I cannot find my error!
