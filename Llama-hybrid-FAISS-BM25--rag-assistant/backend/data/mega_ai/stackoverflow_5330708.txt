You need to allocate a depth-buffer (you're most likely doing this already) and then use glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST) This is happening because without depth-testing, OpenGL does simply not react to different depths relative to the camera. When you enable depth testing, GL will reject all new pixels/fragments that further away than the current closest. If you want to move around in your scene, you probably want to clear the depth by adding GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT to glClear , or else it will remember the closest fragment from the previous frame. Other than that, your perspective matrix might be malformed. This is especially likely, since the red teapot is drawn in front of the green one, while you draw them such that the green one would overdraw the red one with correct depth buffering. Hence, the depth values themselves are probably bad.
