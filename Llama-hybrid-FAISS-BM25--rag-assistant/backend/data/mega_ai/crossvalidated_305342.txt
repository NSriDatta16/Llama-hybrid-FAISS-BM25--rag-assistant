Why use LSTM or in general RNN instead of plain NN?

I understand that in LSTM, there are 3 gates to help keep the memory. But why do we use LSTM instead of NN in the first place? For example, in a LSTM, my features are just 1-D, time steps is set to be 60, which means the longest memory my LSTM can remember is just 60 days ago, you can't use any information 73 days ago to predict today's target. But in a plain NN, we can reconstruct the 1-D variable into a 60-D variables with the other dimensions being the variable's value 1-day ago, 2-day ago, ..., 60-day ago. And we predict today's target variable. What is the difference here? We are all just using 60-day information to predict a single variable.
