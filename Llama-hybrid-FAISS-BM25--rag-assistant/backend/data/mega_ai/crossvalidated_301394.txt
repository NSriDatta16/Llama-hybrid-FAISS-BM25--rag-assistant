Time Series Stationarity

I know there are many questions here about stationary tests etc however I have a question about general time series modeling. Is stationarity important for all models? For example, if I model a time series using a Gaussian process of the form $$y_t = f(y_{t-1}) + \epsilon$$ where $$f \sim GP(.,.)$$ Should I use differencing? If I should, how do I transform my predictions on the differenced time series back to the original axis?
