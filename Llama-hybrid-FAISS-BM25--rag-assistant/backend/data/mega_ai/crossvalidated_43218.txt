You are not wrong. From: Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Second Edition, Roderick J.A. Little & Donald B Rubin, John Wiley and Sons, 2002. p41: Complete Case analysis confines attention to cases where all variables are present. Advantages of this approach are .... . Disadvantages stem from the potential loss of information in discarding incomplete cases. This loss of information has two aspects: loss of precision, and bias when the missing-data mechanism is not MCAR , and the complete cases are not a random sample of all the cases". From: Bias and efficiency of multiple imputation compared with complete-case analysis for missing covariate values. Ian R.White and John B. Carlin. Statistics in Medicine, Volume 29, Issue 28, 2010 In particular, while MI has negligible bias and CC is biased under MAR mechanisms , there are other mechanisms under which CC has negligible bias and MI is biased. This point is widely misunderstood, but it has important implications. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.3944/pdf
