Glen_b is correct in that "good fit" is a very subjective notion. However, if you want to verify that your poisson distribution is reasonably normal, you can use a hypothetical Kolmorgov-Smirnov test with the null hypothesis being $H_{0}:$ The CDF came from a $N(\lambda,\lambda)$ distribution, assuming your sample will come from a poisson($\lambda$). Since you are not actually testing a sample, but one distribution against another, you need to think carefully about the sample size and significance level you assume for this hypothetial test (since we are not using the KS test in its typical fashion). That is: Pick a representative, hypothetical sample size, n, and adjust the significance level of the test to a typical value, e.g., 5% . Now, calculate the Type II error rate for this test assuming your data actually come from a poisson($\lambda$). Your degree of fit with a normal distribution will be this Type II error rate, in the sense that samples of size n from your particular poisson distribution will, on average, be accepted $\beta$% of the time by a KS normality test at your selected significance level. Anyway, that's just one way to go about getting a sense of "goodness of fit". However, all rely on some subjective notions of "goodness" that you will have to define for yourself.
