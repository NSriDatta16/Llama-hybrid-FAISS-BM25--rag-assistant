One possible solution is to run a logistic regression model that uses correct answer (yes or no) to the question as the response and then the other independent variables can but controlled for in teh model as main effects and interaction terms. You could always run 8 separate logistic regression models (i.e., one for each question) or you could put a 8-level covariate into the model that is basically an indicator function for which question you are considering.
