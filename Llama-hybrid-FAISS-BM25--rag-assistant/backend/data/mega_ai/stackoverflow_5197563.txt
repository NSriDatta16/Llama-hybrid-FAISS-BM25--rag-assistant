I don't know of such a module for Drupal but if you'll go for the custom module route here's some pointers to how it could be implemented: Create a content type called Subarticle, enable comments and add a Node reference field to it. Allow your users to create nodes of that type. For the widget of the node reference, use the Node Reference URL Widget module which will create a link on each Article, something like Create a Subarticle, automatically making the new subarticle point to the article. For display, views could be used with a node argument on the node reference field. For invites and visibility, check out Organic Groups . When a new subarticle is saved you'll have to programmatically create a new organic group, make the current user the owner and add the subarticle to that group. With an organic group he can then invite users.
