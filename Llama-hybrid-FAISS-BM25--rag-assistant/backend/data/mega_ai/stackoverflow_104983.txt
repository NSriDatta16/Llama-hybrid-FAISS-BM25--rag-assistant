What is "thread local storage" in Python, and why do I need it?

In Python specifically, how do variables get shared between threads? Although I have used threading.Thread before I never really understood or saw examples of how variables got shared. Are they shared between the main thread and the children or only among the children? When would I need to use thread local storage to avoid this sharing? I have seen many warnings about synchronizing access to shared data among threads by using locks but I have yet to see a really good example of the problem.
