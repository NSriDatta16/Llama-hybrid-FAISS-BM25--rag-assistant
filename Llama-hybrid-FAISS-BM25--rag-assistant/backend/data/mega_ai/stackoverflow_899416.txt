I would avoid drag and drop coding if at all possible. If you play too much with magic then you will get burned. The connection string should only reside in one place in your application. If all of your tiers are concerned with the connection string then that is a problem. You DAL should be the only tier concerned with the connection string. A nice way to have the DAL get the connection string is through IoC (Inversion of Control). So that you don't have to pass the connection string in through all the constructors. DataSets are somewhat dated. If you are working on a new application you might consider using an ORM such as NHibernate or Linq
