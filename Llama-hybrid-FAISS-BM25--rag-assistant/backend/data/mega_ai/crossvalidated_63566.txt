Unexpected residuals plot of mixed linear model using lmer (lme4 package) in R

I have conducted an experiment with multiple (categorical) conditions per subject, and multiple subject measurements. My data-frame in short: A subject has one property, is_frisian which is either 0 or 1 depending on the subject. And it is tested for two conditions, person and condition . The measurement variable is error , which is either 0 or 1. My mixed linear model in R is: > model However, the residuals plot of this model gives an unexpected (?) result. I was taught that this plot should show randomly scattered points, and they should be normal distributed. When plotting the density of the fitted and the residuals, it shows a reasonable normal distribution. The lines you can see in the graph, however, how is this to be explained? And is this okay? The only thing I could come up with is that the graph has two lines due to the categorical variables. The output variable error is either 0 or 1. But I do not have that much knowledge of the underlying system to confirm this. And then again, the lines also seem to have a low negative slope, is this then perhaps a problem? UPDATE: > model binnedplot(fitted(model),resid(model)) Gives the following result: FINAL EDIT: The density-plots have been omitted, they have nothing to do with satisfaction of assumptions in this case. For a list of assumptions on logistic regression (when using family=binomial), see here at statisticssolutions.com
