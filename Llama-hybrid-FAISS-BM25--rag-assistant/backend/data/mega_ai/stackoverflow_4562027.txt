It is hard to tell what the other methods quoted were, but the preferred way of embedding flash is to use swfobject, a javascript library that does not require any special tags (nor server-side support). It boils down to preparing a div for your flash content, giving it an id, and then calling a single function that takes the swf file url, size of the clip, flasvars and so. The javascript could easily contain EL expressions. You might want to read this: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/swfobject.html but skip to the Under the hood: dynamic publishing section, you will not be using the static publishing nor GUI.
