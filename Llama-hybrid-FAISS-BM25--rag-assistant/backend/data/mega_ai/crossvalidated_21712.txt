A paper that might be of interest is "Estimating a Kernel Fisher Discriminant in the Presence of Label Noise" by Lawrence and Scholkopf, which deals with KFD rather than SVM, but the two classifiers are closely related and will give similar results for most problems. Note that the KFD is equivalent to kernel ridge regression, and a 2-norm SVM is equivalent to KRR computed on only the support vectors, so it may be possible to port this approach to SVM. In general dealing with label noise is easiest when you have a fully probabilistic classifier, so as tdc suggests, the SVM is probably not the best approach. It might be worth looking at semi-supervised versions of the SVM, as the problem is similar in that in both cases you only have uncertain information about some of the labels (very uncertain for semi-supervised methods). The approach tdc suggests is probably worth trying, or alternatively present each pattern twice, with different labels each time, with weights $p$ and $1-p$.
