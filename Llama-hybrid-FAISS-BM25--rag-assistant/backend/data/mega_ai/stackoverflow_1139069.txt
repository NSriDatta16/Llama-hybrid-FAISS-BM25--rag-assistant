My best win out over a compiler was on a simple memcpy routine... I skipped a lot of the basic setup stuff ( e.g., I didn't need much of a stack frame, so I save a few cycles there ), and did a few pretty hairy things. That was about 6 years ago, with some proprietary compiler of unknown quality. I'll have to dig up the code I had and try it against GCC now; I don't know that it could get any faster, but I wouldn't rule it out. In the end, even though my memcpy was on average about 15x faster than the one in our C library, I just kept it in my back pocket in case I needed it. It was a toy for me to play with PPC assembly, and the speed boost wasn't necessary in our application.
