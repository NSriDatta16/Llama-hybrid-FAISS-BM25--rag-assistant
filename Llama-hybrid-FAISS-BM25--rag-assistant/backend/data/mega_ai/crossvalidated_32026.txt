This exercise will be pretty useless unless the sample of the surnames is statistically sound, i.e., a random sample with known probabilities of selection. Otherwise, you are estimating the number of female drivers by first picking a color (say yellow), counting the fraction of female drivers in the yellow cars, and then obtaining the estimate of the population total as the (total # of cars) * (fraction of women drivers based on the red cars). If you did not pick up your color at random (and preferably repeated this selection a bunch of times to ensure better coverage of different types of cars), God only knows how good your estimate might be. Getting a good sample of US surnames is far from a trivial task. The studied distributions of surnames are very odd, to say the least. Most of the surnames will be unique, with just a handful of people having this last name (mine is an example). On the other hand, a few surnames ( Smith, Johnson, Williams ) may cover as much as 1% of the population). The problem of weird distributions is frequently encountered in establishment surveys where you have monstrous corporations like Microsoft and Adobe, and millions shops-on-the-corner with two-three local geeks. One practice in working with the distributions like that is to perform probability proportional to size sampling: you take the whole list, but you will sample the surnames (or companies) with greater probabilities if they represent a greater share of the total. You then control for unequal probabilities of selection with weights. Another approach is to use cut-off sampling : you sample all the surnames with frequency greater than (businesses with sales greater than) 0.1% of the total, and then wave hands about the potential non-sampling error for the remaining surnames.
