Yes. Yes, we can. I use DNLA applications very often to stream media to/from my devices (iPhone, iPod, Android, Laptop) and a server in my home. The WAV format is most certainly supported among many others. You can read up on DNLA here. It's an organization that outlines a set of interoperability guidelines that allow servers and clients to stream various formats of media. I love it. There is no shortage of DNLA compatible apps for both the iPhone and Android. On my wife's iPhone, I use the free version of iMediaShare . And on my Android, I use AndroMote . Now, if you want to know how to do this as a developer, I have no idea since I don't write for the iPhone. However, the answer to your actual question is "Yes," it can be done and there are plenty of apps that do it via the DLNA or Universal Plug N Play (UPnP) guidelines.
