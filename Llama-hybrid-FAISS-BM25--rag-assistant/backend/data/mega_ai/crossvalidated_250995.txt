In principle, no. One cannot optimize one parameter and then the other. There is (at least) one paper that proposes a method to optimize first the C (using a Linear SVM) and then the gamma. http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089976603321891855#.WE3VlpJrWLA but I tried this and it did not work well on many datasets. Two problems (a) the selection it makes is not that great and (b) it takes a surprising long time - because the linear SVM is not that fast (I did not use the LibLinear implementation - I used libSVM with the linear kernel).
