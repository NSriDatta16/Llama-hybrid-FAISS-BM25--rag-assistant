Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) with CoreData

I'm using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) in my application to do some heavy lifting. The application is using Core-Data for data storage purposes. Here's my scenario (along with relevant question): dispatch_queue_t main_queue = dispatch_get_main_queue(); dispatch_queue_t request_queue = dispatch_queue_create("com.app.request", NULL); dispatch_async(request_queue, ^{ MyNSManagedObject *mObject = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:[NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:0]]; // … // // … // … // // … [self saveManagedObjectContext]; }); As a result of [self saveManagedObjectContext] , fetchResultsController delegate methods are called automatically. Consequently, the UI updation logic kicks. Now my question is, do I need to use main_queue for -saveManagedObjectContext ? Should I perform all operations on my NSManagedObject in main_queue ? Some of the operations that update the NSManagedObject might take 2-3 seconds. Please advise.
