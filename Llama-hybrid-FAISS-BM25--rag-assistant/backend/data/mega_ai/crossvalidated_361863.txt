Extensions of LSTM for huge data

Consider dealing with a huge high frequency financial data forecasting, RNN/LSTM is a popular way to solve the task. But the problem is that say you have 1 million data points and you want to predict the data for 10-period ahead, LSTM allows you to choose a look-back period so that it analyses more past information. But is there anyway to set up an "infinite" look-back memory LSTM, so that even you are dealing with the 20000th data point prediction, one of your cells can possess information from all the previous 19999 data point information?
