You can easily run all of your Django unit tests through the Django testing framework as your nightly build. That's what we do. We also have some ordinary unit tests that don't leverage Django features, and we run those, also. Even though Python (and Django) don't require the kind of nightly compile/link/unit test that compiled languages do, you still benefit from the daily discipline of "Don't Break The Build". And a daily cycle of unit testing everything you own is a good thing. We're in the throes of looking at Python 2.6 (which works perfectly for us) and running our unit tests with the -3 option to see which deprecated features we're using. Having a full suite of unit tests assures us that a change for Python 3 compatibility won't break the build. And running them nightly means that we have to be sure we're refactoring correctly.
