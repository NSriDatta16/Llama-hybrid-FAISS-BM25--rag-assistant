Where should I put the interfaces for MEF?

When organizing a project where should I put the provider interfaces which are used in MEF? Currently I just have them in the same project as everything else but it seems like it might desirable for me to extract them into a separate dll such that it was a very small dll and would easily be linked to by others attempting to write extensions. What is good practise for this?
