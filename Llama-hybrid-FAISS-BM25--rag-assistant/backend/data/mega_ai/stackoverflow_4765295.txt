OpenGL copy ColorAttachment0 from a Renderbuffer to a Texture2D

I'm using OpenTK and C#. I'm rendering to a renderbuffer and I need to copy it's contents(ColorAttachment0) to a Texture2D so I can do some post-processing on it, and the draw it to the screen. How do I do this? I would use texture instead of a renderbuffer, but I need to Anti-alias the framebuffer, and using GL.RenderbufferStorageMultisample is the only way I know how to.
