I think you have a few issues. Element ID's must be unique inside the dom. if you are looping over that html fragment then you will end up with multiple li tags with an id of like. You need to remove the id and use a class e.g (3) Likes Do You Like it? This will then allow you to write script as follows $('li.someClass a.likeon').click ( function(){ $(this).parent().text('Yes I Like It'); }); Also the context selector you were trying would never have worked as when you passed in the 'this' context it looks for elements below that match the selector. You did not have any child elements of the anchor with an id of like. If you are changing these classes in script during the lifespan of the page then I would advise to use .live instead. This will mean that the event will fire even for anchors that do not currently have a class of likeon. If you later change the anchor to have that class it will still run $('li.someClass a.likeon').live('click' , function(){ $(this).parent().text('Yes I Like It'); });
