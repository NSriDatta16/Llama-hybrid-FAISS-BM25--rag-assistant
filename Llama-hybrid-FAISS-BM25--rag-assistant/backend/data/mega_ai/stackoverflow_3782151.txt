Whichever you want :-) At work, for example, our Linux servers run Red Hat Enterprise Linux , which is loosely based on Fedora , so that might be a good distribution to use that might be similar to what you would experience in the 'real world'. Tomcat or JBoss Application Server would be good app servers to start with. Tomcat is just a servlet container, whereas JBoss supports more of the Java EE technologies. That said, many organisations find that a 'lightweight' app server like Tomcat is perfectly adequate. MySQL and PostgreSQL are both widely-used open source database servers.
