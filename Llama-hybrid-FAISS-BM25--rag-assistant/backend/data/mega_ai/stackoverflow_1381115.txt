Alternate (user-scoped) settings in a C# desktop application

1) I use Visual Studio 2008 (C#) 2) I want my desktop application to "remember" certain settings (preferences) for every user individually. 3) The application would use its own database of users (logins + passwords), so they have nothing to do with Windows accounts. How can I accomplish that? Trying to find an answer 4) I've found the "Using Alternate Sets of Settings" subject on MSDN => http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730869%28VS.80%29.aspx - but 5) it suggests that even these alternative settings need to be added in design time. That's a bit of a problem, because: 6) I don't know in advance, how many users would be in the database - and I want the "main user" (admin) to have an option of adding more accounts any time he wants. So 7) how do I accomplish that? So far I thought about: 8) using isolated storage files? (but they, too, are user-scoped in the sense of referring to Windows accounts) 9) deriving my own class from ApplicationSettingsBase class and supplying it with a SaveAs() method (which it lacks by default)? Thanks for any answers / suggestions. If my problem is not quite clear, I'm happy to clarify
