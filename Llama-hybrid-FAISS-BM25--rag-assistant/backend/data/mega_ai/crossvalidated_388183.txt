I know it's been a while, but just for future users, one way can be to develop an XMR/SPC process control chart, and implement some rules, such as if a data point is 1/2/or 3 sigmas away from the moving average, it can be considered an outlier. Similarly, if consecutive points fall outside of sigma range, that group of points can be considered anomalies. XMR charts have been used heavily to analyse process variability and stability.
