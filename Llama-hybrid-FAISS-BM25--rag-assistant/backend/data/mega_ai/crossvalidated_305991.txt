Prescriptive analysis using random forest

Here is a general question in machine learning: Suppose I have a random forest to predict a failure event in an experiment, the variables consist of both categorical(e.g. type of equipment) and continuous types (time of exposure/amount of reactant). When it comes to make recommendations to the user (such that he is not going to blow up things), how should I make specific prescriptions, for example use equipment A and add X amount of chemical B? I was thinking about doing a grid search by building a lattice of potential solutions, and find the optima. But this is expensive and has no guarantee to always return the best solution.
