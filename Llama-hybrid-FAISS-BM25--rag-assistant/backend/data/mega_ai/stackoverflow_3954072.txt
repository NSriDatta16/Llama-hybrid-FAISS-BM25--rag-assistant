First - you do not have to #include "functions.c" in main.c - the definitions already exist in definitions.h . Generally speaking, you should avoid including another source file. Second - you probably don't have #include -guards in your definitions.h file, which would cause this problem since you were including both functions.c and definitions.h in main.c , and functions.c includes definitions.h as well, which would lead to multiple definition madness. /* include guards */ #ifndef definitions_h_ #define definitions_h_ /* all of definitions.h content */ #endif http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard edit Additionally, depending on the compilers you use, you may be able to use the simpler #pragma once directive. Visual C++ supports it, as do recent (> 3.4) versions of GCC.
