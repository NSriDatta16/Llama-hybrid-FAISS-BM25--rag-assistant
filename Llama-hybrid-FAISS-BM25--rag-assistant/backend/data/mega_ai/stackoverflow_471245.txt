A regular expression is the way. But maybe more robustly: re.search(r"load average: (\d+.\d\d), (\d+.\d\d), (\d+.\d\d)$", s).groups() Unless you're doing this really often in a tight loop or some such you needn't worry about performance. Clarity is what's most important. And there I'd say this regexp is hard to beat.
