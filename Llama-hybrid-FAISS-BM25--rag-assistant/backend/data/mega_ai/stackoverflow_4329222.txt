Its completely a false dichotomy. They solve different subproblems of a goal. Apparently though, Microsoft ASP.NET stuff is pretty good at integrating Client-side with Server side (I have never used it myself however, so please correct me if I'm wrong). Client-side libraries are focused on presenting the data to the user. Server-side libraries need to be focused on CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and authentication the user. When data needs to be centralized, it needs to be dealt with on the server. No server-side library will ever have drag-or-drop or accessibility features. No client-side library will ever have MySQL and Access Control List implementations.
