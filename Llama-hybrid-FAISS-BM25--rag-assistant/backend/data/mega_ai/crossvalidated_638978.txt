The randomization of participants into different groups, eg, treatment and control. is central to the inference of causality about the treatment. The randomization makes the treatment groups closely similar, on average. Larger randomized groups are more similar. High variation among the participants is essential to concluding that any treatment will work in the larger population, with its high environmental, social, and even genetic variation. Designers of trials make a serious effort to include human variation in their study populations. Randomization makes the two groups as similar as possible in the presence of wide individual variation. There is a chance, of course, as with any experiment, that the appearance of a real difference between treatment and control with a significant statistical test is wrong. This chance is reflected in the p-value. If this is small then the chance of a false result is small. This supports the conclusion that the treatment caused the difference. Many clinical trials are done on groups of people with one strong similarity, the presence of a disease, such as a specific diagnosis of cancer. Otherwise, participants often reflect the variety found among humans. That variety is necessary to conclude any effect can be relied on in other people with the same disease. A large clinical trial is usually planned after a treatment is found to be reasonable safe and promising for a small number of people. If a study is well designed with adequate power and does not yield a significant difference then this is usually thought to mean the effect of the treatment is small or nonexistent,certainly not as large as originally thought.
