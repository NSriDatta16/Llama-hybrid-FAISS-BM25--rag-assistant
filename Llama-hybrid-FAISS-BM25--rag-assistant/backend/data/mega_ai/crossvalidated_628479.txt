How to explain unbiasedness in basic terms?

If I take some estimator X. Lets say that X is unbiased. Suppose I have 100 samples and each sample has 5 points. I now calculate the value of X on each sample. Because X is unbiased, this means that the average value of X will equal to its population value (ex: real value)? And because X is unbiased, this will be true if the 100 samples have 4 points, 3 points, 18 points, etc for all points? And because X is unbiased, this will be true even if the 100 samples have unequal numbers of points (ex: sample1 has 6 points, sample2 has 10 points, etc)? So basically, unbiased estimator means that when the value of the estimator is calculated for many samples, on average the average value of the estimator will be equal to the population value?
