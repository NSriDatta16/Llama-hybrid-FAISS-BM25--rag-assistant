(Original Answer: February 2011) Launch your program in debug mode in Eclipse. You can then see the exact command in the properties of the Debug views (see this thread or this thread ) First run or debug one of the configurations. In the Debug view in the Debug perspective, right-click the running process and select "Properties". The command line used to launch the configuration is displayed. Bug 10820 was about "[java launching] Launch config: show cmd line before launch"... but it is closed as WONTFIX. Update (March 2012) bbuser reports in the comment having had to remove -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,address=localhost:60019 from the command line shown in properties in the Debug view. Otherwise I got connection errors. Also changing javaw.exe to java.exe might be advisable
