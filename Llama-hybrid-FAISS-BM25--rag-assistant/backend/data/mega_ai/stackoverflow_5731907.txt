Problem launching an applet with a browser

I designed an Client/Server application allowing to download PDF files from the server. I tried to convert my application to an Applet. Everything works when I launch the applet with the Eclipse Applet viewer. However, when I try to launch my application with a browser(any browser), the browser sends to the server the following http request and waits for an answer : GET /crossdomain.xml HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (Windows 7 6.1) Java/1.6.0_24 Host: 127.0.0.1 Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, */*; q=.2 Connection: keep-alive Cookie: __utmz=96992031.1301339630.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none); __utma=96992031.1102947305.1301339630.1301339630.1301339630.1 What am I supposed to do? Any help is appreciated
