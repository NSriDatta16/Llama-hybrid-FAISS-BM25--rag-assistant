To summarize previous two posts: You can either try to find new predictors which have higher predicting power. This is called feature engineering ( http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/ ). You can try and use a more complicated (non-linear) classifier. An overview in which you can try to select the right one specific to your demands, is given in the book the Elements of Statistical Learning or in this presentation: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/classes/534/slides/part2.pdf .
