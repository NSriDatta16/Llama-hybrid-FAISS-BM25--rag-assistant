In answer to another question on this forum I referred the OP to this site where there is open source code for a function called HT_PERIOD to measure the instantaneous period of a time series. There are also functions called HT_PHASE, HT_PHASOR and HT_SINE to respectively measure the phase, the phasor components of the sine wave/cyclic component and to extract the sine wave itself (scaled between -1 and 1) of a time series. As the calculations in these functions are causal they would be appropriate for an on-line function that updates as new data comes in. The code for these functions might be of help to you.
