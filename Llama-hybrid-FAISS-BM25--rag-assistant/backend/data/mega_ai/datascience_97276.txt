CNN+LSTM ValueError: Input 0 of layer sequential_10 is incompatible with the layer: expected ndim=5, found ndim=4

currently making human action recognition to detect a cheating kind on the exam from CCTV using AlexNet+LSTM My Data are raw images in each class folder with like this But I got error like this: ValueError: in user code: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py:830 train_function * return step_function(self, iterator) /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py:813 run_step * outputs = model.train_step(data) /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/training.py:770 train_step * y_pred = self(x, training=True) /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/base_layer.py:989 __call__ * input_spec.assert_input_compatibility(self.input_spec, inputs, self.name) /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/keras/engine/input_spec.py:212 assert_input_compatibility * raise ValueError('Input ' + str(input_index) + ' of layer ' + ValueError: Input 0 of layer sequential_10 is incompatible with the layer: expected ndim=5, found ndim=4. Full shape received: (None, None, None, None) The error comes when I do the model.fit . From what I read it said that the problem at the input_shape but I am still doesn't found the solution to my problem the link of my code at collab can be found here , I still don't understand what is the problem, I check the documentation for input_shape in TimeDistributed and it's the same for (timeSteps, height, width, channels) I did try to remaking the model but the problem is still the same is it from my ImageDataGenerator? I would appreciate if anybody has the experience in this matter and tries to help my problem Thank you so much!
