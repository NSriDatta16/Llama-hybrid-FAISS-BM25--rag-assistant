Bayesian Linear Regression to assess looking time behavior

I study perceptual development in infancy and recently came across an interesting article using Bayesian linear regression to identify phoneme discrimination in individual infants. Let me set the stage first. These researchers used a habituation/discrimination procedure, which examines novelty response by way of looking time. In other words, when working with infants, a robust way to examine whether or not they noticed a change in a stimulus is whether or not their attention spiked in response to a new object when shown on a computer. Made up data: Trial 1 - 10s looking time to a ball Trial 2 - 8s looking time to a ball Trial 3 - 6s looking time to a ball Trial 4 - 3s looking time to a ball Trial 5 - 9s looking time to a star From the made up example above, this is the looking time spike I'm talking about,i.e. the child noticed the change from ball to star. Normally these types of procedures are used with groups of infants, not individuals. To make a long story short, the authors in the paper listed at the end of the post used Bayesian linear regression to examine if individual infants exhibited response recovery to the novel trials in a 12 trial test period where 4 of the trials were novel. I've only used linear models and a few robust models, so I have no idea how this was done. Can anyone explain this to me? I've looked at the bayesm and WinBugs packages in R, but am having trouble figuring out how to apply this technique if I wanted to do it myself. Thanks in advance for any input.
