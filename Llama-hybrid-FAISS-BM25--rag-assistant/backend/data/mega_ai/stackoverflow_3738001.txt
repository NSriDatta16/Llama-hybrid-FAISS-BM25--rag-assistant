CakePHP is interrupting images

I am using fckEditor as text editor. When i upload images thru it the images were uploaded to app/webroot/fckeditor/images. And when they're embedded it looks like /fckfiles/SalmonSashimi.jpg Until now it looks right. But the image doesn't appear. So when I browse the image directly, at here http://www.in-culture.info/fckfiles/SalmonSashimi.jpg instead of displaying the URL, Cake interrupts the image call and trying to render it in a layout. I often face this error when I point .html file for iframe scroller and .xml file for flash embedding. This is really embarrassing You can see the page here http://www.in-culture.info/events/view/42 That image should appear before the text - "More" dont appear for short text. Thanks for you help.
