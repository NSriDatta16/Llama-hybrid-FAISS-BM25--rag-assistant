ColorStatistics' answer is already very good. I'd just add that there is no need to look to structural breaks for an explanation. Straightforward sampling variance, as ColorStatistics discusses in the first paragraph, will do quite nicely. That is: even if your data generating process does not change (i.e., there is no break), the variability inherent in a stochastic process will mean that the result of your automatic ARIMA fitting will give slightly different results each time you take a sample. I like simulations to get an idea of the effects of inherent variability. Let's simulate a series of 10,000 realizations of an ARMA(1,1) series, with AR parameter $\phi_1 = 0.3$ and MA parameter $\theta_1 = -0.2$ . Now we fit an ARIMA model to observations 1-100. Then to observations 2-101. Then to 3-102. And so on. We end up with 100 different ARIMA models, all from an underlying ARMA(1,1), so we know the underlying reality. Questions: How often do the fitted ARMA models yield different orders? How often do we recover the actual ARMA(1,1) model? Answers: The majority model is fitted 83 times, others 17 times. We do not recover the original model order a single time . Of course, the effect will depend strongly on the length of your subsamples (if we take samples of length 1,000, things will look better), and the strength of the signal (if the ARMA coefficients are larger in absolute terms, things will look better). But even so, we will get variable results each time we sample the data. So, to answer your question: no, it's perfectly fine if your models differ between model runs with different observations. That happens. (And if you are looking at monthly data, I'd encourage you to also look at seasonal models, like seasonal ARIMA, also known as SARIMA . Your software should consider these automatically if you correctly specify that your data may have a period of length 12.)
