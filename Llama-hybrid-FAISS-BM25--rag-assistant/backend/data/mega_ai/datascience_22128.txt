Text comparison using word embeddings

Currently I have a list of Books which I need to compare to a different list. For example in my local list I have: - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone | J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows | J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire | J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban | J.K. Rowling When I compare I end up having a simple operation: Book Title + Author (local list) vs [Book Title + Author] (remote list) I'm currently using Levenshtein distance, based on that I can find out if Book is in remote system or not. In this case if Book1 vs Book2 result score exceeds X, I assume is the same Book. levenshtein(Book1 Title + Author, Book2 Title + Author) I read about Word Embeddings and before I start coding want to check if converting my text information to embeddings may improve my results.
