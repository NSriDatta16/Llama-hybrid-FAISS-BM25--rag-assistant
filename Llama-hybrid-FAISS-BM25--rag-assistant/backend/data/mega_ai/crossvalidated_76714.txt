Running multiple for loops for multinomial regression in R

I'm using the ANES dataset, which is a repeated cross-sectional study of public opinion and knowledge. I am trying to predict knowledge by individual level characteristics. The data is organized by year, and each respondent is grouped by age into an age cohort. Essentially, I am trying to run multiple multinomial regression models (the knowledge question has 3 levels: correct, incorrect, and don't know), but I want predictions specific to year the questions were asked and the cohort the respondent belongs to. Basically, for each year and each cohort = multinom(knowledge ~ gender + education +...) I have 8 years and 8 cohorts. I tried to do a for loop within a for loop, but for whatever reason it is not working. I tried: for(i in 1:length(year)){ for(j in 1:length(cohort)){ model Can someone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong, please? Right now, all this does is give me coefficients for the same year and cohort 100 times...
