I ran into the same problem but found the answer. Your Window_MouseDown event will not run if the MouseDown has already been handled, so all you have to do to prevent DragMove from interfering with your control's mouse events is add this code: Private Sub YourControl_MouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventArgs) Handles YourControl.MouseDown e.Handled = True End Sub
