Okay, so I think the question you are asking relates a little bit to the causal inference literature and to RCTs (randomized control trials). I am going to change your example a little bit to a classic question studied by econometricians. What is the effect of college on wages. Now we might be tempted to run the regression, $$wage_i = \beta\times college_i + \epsilon_i$$ And take $\beta$ to be our effect but this would be wrong. One reason is that there may be selection bias. In particular, it is not hard to imagine that choose to enter college do so because they believe it will increase their wage. That might be a problem because those students may have some intrinsic quality that makes them achieve higher wages. This is related to an endogeneity problem in which we may believe students who enter college may have higher ability and so they will also earn higher wages. Essentially, these issues confound our ability to infer what the effect of college on wages are. So we turn to randomness. The idea behind randomness is that if we are able to randomly assign and force individuals to go to college (the treatment group) or not go to college (the control group) and then compare their wages we should then be able to extract an effect of college on wages. Why? Well essentially randomizing lets us average out the effect of ability because we imagine that both the treatment and control groups have the same distribution of people with ability since they were randomly chosen and no selection into treatment (in this case a college education occurred). Formally we want to know the counterfactual effect of what would have happened if person $i'$ who went to college had not gone to college: $$Y_{1i'}-Y_{0i'}$$ Where the 1 indicates going to college and the 0 indicates not going to college. This notation is called potential outcomes notation and I highly encourage you to check out some of the references at the bottom that go into more detail about it. It turns out that under random assignment we can actually identify the distribution of $Y_d$ where I use $d$ to refer to the potential outcome (college or no college here). To see this consider, $$\Pr[Y_d\leq y] = \Pr[Y_d\leq y|D=d]=\Pr[Y\leq y|D=d]$$ Where the first equality holds due to random assignment. Since the assignment is random conditioning on $D=d$ does not change $Y_d$ . Thus we have identified the distribution of the potential outcomes as the conditional distribution of $Y|D$ for which we have data. This is essentially the idea behind RCTs and this idea has been expanded on in many different cases. I encourage you to look up terms like: "Average Treatment Effect" and "Selection on Observables" As you might have guessed we usually cannot force someone to go to college or not go to college. In these cases, another popular technique that can be used to "induce randomness" are instrumental variables. In particular, the "Local Average Treatment Effect" is a very popular way to apply the same idea as above in observational studies where we cannot randomly assign individuals.
