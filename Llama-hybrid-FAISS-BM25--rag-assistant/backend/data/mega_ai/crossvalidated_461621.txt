Probability of reaching goal in n steps?

Consider a simple grid-like setup where an agent starts at the first state (s0) and has to reach the absorbing state (G): | s0 | s1 | G | Also, when it tries to get from s0 to s1 or from s1 to G, there's a 50% chance that it succeeds (it can only go rightwards). The transition function would be: $P(s_0 | s_0) = 0.5$ , $P(s_1 | s_0) = 0.5$ $P(G | s_1) = 0.5$ , $P(s_1 | s_1) = 0.5$ $P(G | G) = 1$ (The probabilities that aren't shown are equal to $0$ ). I needed to know the probabilities that the agent reaches the goal in $n$ steps (let's call it $P(X = n)$ ), so I wrote a little program to run a Monte Carlo simulation and return estimates of the probabilities. I got something like this: (2, 0.25002725) (3, 0.250135) (4, 0.187178) (5, 0.12498175) (6, 0.0783475) (7, 0.0469035) (8, 0.02724025) (9, 0.015646) (10, 0.00877575) ... Where (n, p) means that $P(X = n) = p$ . The results look nice, but I'd like to know how to calculate these probabilities analytically. I tried thinking about $P(X = n)$ as the probability of getting 2 successes (getting two successful moves from one state to the other) with 50% probability in $n$ trials in a binomial distribution setting, but the values did not match. For example, for 3 steps: $$P(x = 3) = \binom{3}{2} * 0.5^2 * 0.5 = 0.375$$ What am I doing wrong?
