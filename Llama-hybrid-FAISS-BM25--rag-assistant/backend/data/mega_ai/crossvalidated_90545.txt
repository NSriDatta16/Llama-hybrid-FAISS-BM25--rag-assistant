Interpreting Principal Component Analysis output

If I have 50 variables in my PCA, I get a matrix of eigenvectors and eigenvalues out (I am using the MATLAB function eig ). I have normalised the eigenvalues to sum to 1, and they are returned already sorted by magnitude. I just want to know how to match them to the variables, by looking at the matrix of eigenvectors. I know the largest eigenvector coefficient corresponds to the largest eigenvalue, but is that the largest absolute value , or is it always the largest positive value , so closest to positive infinity? From the image below, you can see in the command window the normalised eigenvalues (64.39%, 15.01% ...) and in the window at the top there is a part of the corresponding eigenvector matrix. You can see there are positive and negative values. I hope that helps make my question clear. Here is an example from the MATLAB website. Which is the principal component of each of those 4 column vectors? Example load hald covx = cov(ingredients); [COEFF,latent,explained] = pcacov(covx) COEFF = 0.0678 -0.6460 0.5673 -0.5062 0.6785 -0.0200 -0.5440 -0.4933 -0.0290 0.7553 0.4036 -0.5156 -0.7309 -0.1085 -0.4684 -0.4844 latent = 517.7969 67.4964 12.4054 0.2372 explained = 86.5974 11.2882 2.0747 0.0397
