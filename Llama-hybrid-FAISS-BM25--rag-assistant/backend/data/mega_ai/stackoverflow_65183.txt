There are some common performance tweaks. SVN is very I/O heavy, so faster hard disks are an option (on both ends). Add more memory to your server. Make sure your clients have a defragmented hard disk (for Windows). What access method you use also matters. Repositories stored on remote filesystems (using file:/// access) are going to be much slower than either svnserve or Apache with mod_svn. Consider using one of the latter if you have the repository on a simple file share.
