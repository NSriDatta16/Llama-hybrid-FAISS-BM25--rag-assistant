Using Weka for Game Playing

I am doing a project where I have neural networks (or other algorithms) play each other in poker. After each win or loss, I want the neural network (or other algorithm) to update in response to the error of the loss (how this is calculated is unimportant here). Weka is very nice and I don't want to reinvent the wheel. However, Weka's API seems primarily designed to train from a dataset. Game playing doesn't use a dataset. Rather, the network plays, and then I want it to update itself based on its loss. Is it possible to use the Weka API to update a network instead of a dataset but on one instance and do this over and over again? I'm I thinking about this right? The other idea I also want to implement is use a genetic algorithm to update the weights in a neural network, instead of the backpropogation algorithm. As far as I can tell, there is no way to manually specify the weights of a neural network in Weka. This, of course, is vital if using a genetic algorithm for this purpose. Please help :) Thank you.
