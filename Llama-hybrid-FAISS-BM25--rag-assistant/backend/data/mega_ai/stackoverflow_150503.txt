the only coding guidelines I've seen suggested for this is to put fields at the top of the class definition. i tend to put constructors next. my general comment would be that you should stick to one class per file and if the class is big enough that the organization of properties versus methods is a big concern, how big is the class and should you be refactoring it anyway? does it represent multiple concerns?
