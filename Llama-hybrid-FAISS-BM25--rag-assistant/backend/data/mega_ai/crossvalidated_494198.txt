Can't you just write \begin{align} \mathbb P(X_0 = a, X_n = b) &= P(X_0 = a) P(X_n = b \vert X_0 = a) \\ &= \pi(a) P^n_a(b), \end{align} where $P^n_a$ is the $n$ -step kernel of the Markov chain started in $a$ , and you assume that $X_0$ is drawn from $\pi$ . By irreducibility and aperiodicity, this kernel converges to the stationary measure in the limit, so you just get $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P^n_a(b) = \pi(b),$$ and the result follows. What am I missing?
