Subclipse with SVNKit Adapter

I have two questions and some context. I am installing Subclipse 1.4.x into Eclipse Ganymede and I'm thinking that I should use the SVNKit Adapter. I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 which comes with Subversion 1.4.x and since the JavaHL Adapter requires Subversion 1.5.x using a pure Java solution like SVNKit seems like a good solution. Which pros and cons do you see with using the SVNKit Adapter? I can't find any documentation on what the JNA Library, SVNKit Client Adapter and SVNKit Library actually provides. And I'm interested in knowing what I install. What do they provide?
