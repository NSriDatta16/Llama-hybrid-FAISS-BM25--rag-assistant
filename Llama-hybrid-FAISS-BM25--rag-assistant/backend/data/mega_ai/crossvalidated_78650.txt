Bayesian inference on possibly-non-linear effects

In my field, it is occasionally the case that we want to evaluate the degree to which some variable, Y, might be influenced by another variable, X, where X is measured across a range of continuous values, and we are not sure whether to assume that the effect of X on Y forms a linear relationship or some sort of non-linear relationship. Previously, I found generalized additive modelling (GAM) very useful in such cases, because it permitted me to evaluate whether there was a relationship between X and Y without being sure of the precise form of that relationship because GAM uses data-driven methods to find functions that best fit the data (linear or otherwise). I'd typically achieve evaluation by computing likelihood ratios comparing nested models. However, more recently I've been trying to move to the Bayesian statistical framework, and I no longer know what to do with such cases of possibly-non-linear effects. Is there any standard Bayesian approach to this scenario?
