Visual Studio: Code coverage not generated for signed assemblies

We are developing a system using c# in Visual Studio 2008. When I configure VS to instrument my dll's and run the tests, only the dll that is not signed gets instrumented (nice way to find that we forgot one). Is there a way to generate code coverage on signed dll's or do I have to un sign them, run the analysis and then sign them again? Thanks Shiraz
