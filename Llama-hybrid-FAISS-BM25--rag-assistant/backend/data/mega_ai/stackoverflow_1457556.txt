windows-1252 character 146 is stopping POST data reaching servlet in glassfish v2

An HTTP POST request is made to my servlet. There is a posted form parameter in the http request that my code in the servlet retrieves for further processing named "payload". When the value of the payload includes the windows-1252 character "â€™" (ascii value 146), HttpServletRequest instance method getParameter("payload") returns null. There is nothing in the server.log related to the problem. We think the character encoding used to produce this character is windows-1252. The character encoding glassfish defaults to for http requests appears to be ISO-8859-1. Ascii value 146 is a control character in ISO-8859-1. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could solve this problem? The http request headers in the post that showed the problem are: POST /dbxchange/TechAnywhere HTTP/1.1 CONTENT_LENGTH: 13117 Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (Windows Vista 6.0) Java/1.6.0_16 Host: localhost:8080 Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, *; q=.2, */*; q=.2 Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 13117
