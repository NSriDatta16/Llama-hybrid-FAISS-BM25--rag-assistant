If you really want to more centralize this, you could define your own error classes such as class does_not_open {}; class cannot_write {}; or so. You'll need more work in your different parts, e.g., check if open succeeds; if not, throw does_not_open (etc.). But after you organize yourself this way, you can put the entire main part of your code into the following form: try{ } catch(does_not_open &e){ } catch(cannot_write &e){ - your code here - } catch(...){ - your code here - } Not sure this accomplishes what you were hoping for...but gl. :)
