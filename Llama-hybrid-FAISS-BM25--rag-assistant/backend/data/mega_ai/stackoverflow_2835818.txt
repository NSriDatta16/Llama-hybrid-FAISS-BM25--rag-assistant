How do I enable mod_deflate for PHP files?

I have a Liquid Web VPS account, I've made sure that mod_deflate is installed and running/active. I used to gzip my css and js files via PHP, as well as my PHP files themselves... However, I'm now trying to do this via mod_deflate, and it seems to work fine for all files except for PHP files. (Txt files work fine, css, js, static HTML files, just nothing that is generated via a PHP file.) How do I fix this? (I used the "Compress all content" option under "Optimize Website" in cPanel, which creates an .htaccess file in the home directory (not public_html, one level higher than that) with exactly the same text as the "compress everything except images" example on http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html ) .htaccess file: SetOutputFilter DEFLATE # Netscape 4.x has some problems... BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine # BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # NOTE: Due to a bug in mod_setenvif up to Apache 2.0.48 # the above regex won't work. You can use the following # workaround to get the desired effect: BrowserMatch \bMSI[E] !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # Don't compress images SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI .(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ no-gzip dont-vary # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary
