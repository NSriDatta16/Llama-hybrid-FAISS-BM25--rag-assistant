Significantlly different from zero at the 1% and 5% level of significance

You want to estimate a logistic regression model in which you want to explain if a person is employed (= variable “employed”, 0 if unemployed and 1 if employed) with with the work experience of the individual in years (= variable “experience”). The coefficients of the model yield the following output Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(> |z|) (Intercept) −2.00 1.00 −2.00 0.046 experience 0.50 0.20 2.50 0.012 Correct statements: The coefficient of “experience” is not significantly different from zero at the 1% significance level. The coefficient of “experience” is significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. The intercept is not significantly different from zero at the 1% significance level. The intercept is significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. Why are these statements correct? Assumptions: Critical values of the (two-sided) t- and z-statistics at the 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels are 2.58, 1.96, and 1.64, respectively.
