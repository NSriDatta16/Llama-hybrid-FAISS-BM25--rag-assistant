This would depend on the loss function that is used. For example, in the case of logistic regression, where the loss function is the binary cross entropy function , if the conditional probability distribution is modeled by any distribution from the exponential family , then the binary cross entropy function will be convex in the parameters. More precisely, if the conditional probability distribution is modeled as $$ q(c|\mathbf{x}) = \sigma(g(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\theta})) $$ where $c$ is the class, $\mathbf{x}$ is the input feature vector, $\sigma$ is the logistic function , and $g$ is a chosen function parameterized by the parameters $\theta$ , then the binary cross entropy function is convex in $\theta$ if $g$ is a linear function of $\theta$ . Otherwise, if $g$ is a non-linear function of $\theta$ , then the binary cross entropy function will be non-convex in $\theta$ .
