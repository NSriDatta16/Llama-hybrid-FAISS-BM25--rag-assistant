As answered by Erwan the training data needs to be similar to testing data. But what if your training data and testing data contains similar emails but not the exact words? This scenario cannot be addressed using BoW term frequency because it doesn't incorporate semantics knowledge (Inability to learn similarity between text like 'old car' and 'used vehicle'). I would suggest you use Word Embedding (with Word2Vec ) or the advanced Language models (with BERT ). This article would be handly if you are a beginner.
