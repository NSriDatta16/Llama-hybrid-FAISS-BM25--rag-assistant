The ordered LASSO seems to be what you're looking for: It computes the regularized regression coefficients $\beta_{1...j}$ as in the standard LASSO, but subject to the additional constraint that $|\beta_1| \geq |\beta_2|...\geq|\beta_j|$. This accomplishes the second goal of zeroing out coefficients for higher-order lags, but is more restrictive than the sole restriction of preferring a lower lag model. And as others point out, this is a heavy restriction that can be very difficult to justify. Having dispensed with the caveats, the paper presents the method's results on both real and simulated time series data, and details algorithms to find the coefficients. The conclusion mentions an R package, but the paper is rather recent and a search on CRAN for "ordered LASSO" comes up empty, so I suspect the package is still in development. The paper also offers a generalized approach in which two regularization parameters "encourage near-monotonicity." (See p. 6.) In other words, one should be able to tune the parameters to allow for a relaxed ordering. Sadly, neither examples nor comparisons of the relaxed method are provided. But, the authors write that implementing this change is a simple matter of replacing one algorithm with another, so one hopes it will be part of the coming R package.
