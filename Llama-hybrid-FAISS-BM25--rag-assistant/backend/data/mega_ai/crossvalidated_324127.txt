So having not looked at your data, the sample size and dimensions does not look too small, assuming you will be fitting a regularized model instead of vanilla logistic regression. Then, you can first try stratified 10-fold CV, which should give some good coverage. However, if this does not work (model fits poorly across all CV's), you can try leave-one-out cross validation, although it is known to have high variance in estimates.
