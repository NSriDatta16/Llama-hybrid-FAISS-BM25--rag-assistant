It is actually fairly simple to do this with WinDbg if you have a crash dump. Load the dump into WinDbg, load sos, and run the printexception command. >.load sos >!printexception This will tell you the exception as well as point you to the inner exception. Output will be something like: 0:000> !printexception Exception object: 0135b340 Exception type: System.ApplicationException Message: GetAverage failed InnerException: System.IndexOutOfRangeException, use !PrintException 01358394 to see more If you don't have a memory dump already, you can create one using adplus (which comes with WinDbg). >adplus -crash -o -quiet -pn If you prefer to use PID use the -p option instead.
