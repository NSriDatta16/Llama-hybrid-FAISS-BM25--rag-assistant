Are there any published frameworks or standards for passwords and website membership?

I am currently working on a project in which we are creating a large public website for my organization. This site is going to allow out clients to register and log in to obtain sensitive personal information. From experience I know some of the basics like requiring a complex password and requiring an email address for a password reset that are common used. Basically what I'm looking for is some sort of well documented recommendation or standards(like NIST or ISO) for these kinds of requirements. I need to present this to a higher level director who is insisting on us: not requiring the users to have an email address asking us to allow the users to have our site display the password back to the user just by verifying a Name, Birthday and SSN emailing the password in plain text as opposed to emailing a temp password and having them come to our site to reset the PW. requiring we assign simple system generated username like first intial, first 3 characters of the last name with a 4 digit randomly generated number. (as opposed to the user picking any name they want) If I can present some type of industry standard on why these are such risks it would really help.
