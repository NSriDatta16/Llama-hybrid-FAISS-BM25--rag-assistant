Loading jQuery plugins and multiple scripts best practices

I'm currently looking for a way to load in multiple scripts/plugins without having a laundry list listed out in the header. To simply have a load.js have everything load in would be very elegant to me. $(function() { var scripts = ['scripts/jquery1.5.js','scripts/easing.js','scripts/scroll.js','scripts/main.js']; for(var i = 0; i I currently have something like this but can't get it to work for some reason. Any ideas?
