Hudson "Source code is unavailable."

I'm using Hudson to continuously build a Python project. Unit tests and code coverage work great, but this message appears when drilling into the Cobertura Coverage Report for my files that are not unit tests: Source code is unavailable.Some possible reasons are: * This is not the most recent build (to save on disk space, this plugin only keeps the most recent builds source code). * Cobertura found the source code but did not provide enough information to locate the source code. * Cobertura could not find the source code, so this plugin has no hope of finding it. The strange thing is that the source code for the unit tests are found and displayed. I tried to manually copy the source files for other .py files into ~/.hudson/jobs/ /cobertura (where the unit tests get copied), but it did not work. Any suggestions?
