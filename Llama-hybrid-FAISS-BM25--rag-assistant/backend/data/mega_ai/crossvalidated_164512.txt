If you maintain the assumption that the daily dependent variable $Y_{ji}$ of month $i$ follows a log-normal distribution, this means that $$\ln Y_{ji} \sim \mathbf N (\mu_{ji}, \sigma_{ji}^2)$$ Then, denoting $d_i$ the number of days of month $i$, we also have $$ \frac {1}{d_i} \ln Y_{ji} \sim \mathbf N\left(\frac {\mu_{ji}}{d_i}, \frac {\sigma_{ji}^2}{d_i^2}\right)$$ If you also maintain the assumption that your sample is comprised of independent observations, the sum of independent normal random variables is certain to also follow a normal distribution and so $$\sum_{j=1}^{d_i}\frac {1}{d_i} \ln Y_{ji} =\frac {1}{d_i} \sum_{j=1}^{d_i}\ln Y_{ji} \sim N\left(\frac {1}{d_i} \sum_{j=1}^{d_i}\mu_{ji}, \frac {1}{d_i^2} \sum_{j=1}^{d_i} \sigma_{ji}^2\right)$$ In words, if a log-normality assumption is stated at the level of a sample of independent daily data, then the monthly average of the logs of the original daily variables (their geometric mean, as a comment mentioned) will also be normally distributed.
