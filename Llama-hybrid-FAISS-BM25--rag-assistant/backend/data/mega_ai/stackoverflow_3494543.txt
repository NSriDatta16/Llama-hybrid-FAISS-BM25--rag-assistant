Could you use QMap instead? Your dialog would have member variable QMap items . Then the checking and creating new X's would be like: QString name = "foo"; if (!items.contains(name)) { items[name] = new X(name); } else { // "foo" already exists } Maybe this is not as elegant solution as using QSet might be, but I think this is shorter and easier to understand.
