NN converges quickly but is it a problem when performance is good on test set?

I have an LSTM model I'm using for time series predictions. In training it converges already after 3 epochs. The model performs quite well on the test data, but should I still be concerned about the fast convergence or should performance on test set be the overruling factor to decide if a model is good or not? There is plenty of data points(100k) and two hidden layers with 124 and 64 nodes, so I don't think the model lacks complexity or data
