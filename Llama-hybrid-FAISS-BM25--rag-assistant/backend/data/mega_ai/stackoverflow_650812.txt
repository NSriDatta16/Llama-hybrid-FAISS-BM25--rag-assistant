There is no nice way to do it. You can find workarounds for specific cases, e.g. listen to MouseDown or something instead of valueChanged on the numeric drop down. Set a flag in button click event handler that will prohibit the message box from showing. In general you should try to organize your form in a way that it doesn't matter where the value got changed.
