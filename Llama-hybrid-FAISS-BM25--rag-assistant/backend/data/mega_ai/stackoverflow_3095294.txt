Facebook Comments not showing up in IE 8

Having an issue with the Facebook Comments Social Plugin - it works fine in FF and Chrome, but never shows up in IE 8. I've stripped it down to the bare minimum, just in case there's a problem with my company's CMS - but it still doesn't show up in IE 8. Page is here: http://www.idigbig.com/pages/fbcommenttest23.html Error in IE: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.1; OfficeLiveConnector.1.3; OfficeLivePatch.0.0) Timestamp: Tue, 22 Jun 2010 16:23:33 UTC Message: 'document.getElementById(...)' is null or not an object Line: 11 Char: 5 Code: 0 Any help would be greatly appreciated!
