I think Daniel hit the nail on the head. I have just started reading up on Facebook Development, and it seems they are providing a great set of tools to do very powerful things, but they aren't particularly explaining which bits do what. I think you need to be sure of the difference between; a) creating a web app that will leverage the facebook api to enhance its functionality (i.e. using the login button to allow a user to login/create a profile on that website) and b) creating a Facebook app that makes use of the api to simplify development (i.e. authorize and authenticate a facebook user for an app request) I don't think they have outlined that distinction very well throughout their documentation
