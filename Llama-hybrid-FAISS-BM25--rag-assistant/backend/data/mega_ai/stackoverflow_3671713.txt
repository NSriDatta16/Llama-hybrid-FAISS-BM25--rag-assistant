Does Agile Web Development With Ruby on Rails (Third Edition) Create Bad Coding Habits?

Does Agile Web Development With Ruby on Rails (Third Edition) teach best practices as well as Rails coding? My concern is that, as I use this book, I'm developing bad Rails coding habits resulting from the rather basic nature of the examples used in the book. Case-in-point: The Product Model: class Product "title" ) end The Store Controller class StoreController The Store Index View Your Pragmatic Catalog Is it a best practice to declare a 'helper' function of sorts just to pull in all the available products in the catalog? Shouldn't they have just done this? @products = Products.find(:all, :order => "title") ; I understand that they were probably just trying to demonstrate class-level methods, but they don't add any caveat in the code stating that this isn't really how you're supposed to do this.
