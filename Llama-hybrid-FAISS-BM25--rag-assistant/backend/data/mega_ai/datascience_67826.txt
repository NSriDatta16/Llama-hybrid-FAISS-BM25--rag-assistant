Keras BatchNormalization axis

I use spectrogram as input to a Convolutional Neural Network I have created with tensorflow.keras in Python. Its shape is (time, frequency, 1). The input's shape of the CNN is (None, time, frequency, n_channels) where n_channels=1 and the first layer is a Conv2D. In between every Convolutional layer I use a BatchNormalization layer before an Activation layer. The default value for BatchNormalization is "axis=-1". Should I leave it as it is or should I make it with "axis=2" which corresponds to the "frequency" axis? The thought behind this is that the features of a spectrogram are represented in the frequency axis.
