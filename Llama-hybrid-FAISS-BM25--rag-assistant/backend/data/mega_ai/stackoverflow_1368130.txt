ASP.NET MVC Caching scenario

I'm still yet to find a decent solution to my scenario. Basically I have an ASP.NET MVC website which has a fair bit of database access to make the views (2-3 queries per view) and I would like to take advantage of caching to improve performance. The problem is that the views contain data that can change irregularly, like it might be the same for 2 days or the data could change several times in an hour. The queries are quite simple (select... from where...) and not huge joins, each one returns on average 20-30 rows of data (with about 10 columns). The queries are quite simple at the sites current stage, but over time the owner will be adding more data and the visitor numbers will increase. They are large at the moment and I would be looking at caching as traffic will mostly be coming from Google AdWords etc and fast loading pages will be a benefit (apparently). The site will be hosted on a Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database (But can upgrade to 2008 if required). Do I either: Set the caching to the minimum time an item doesn't change for (E.g. cache for say 3 mins) and tell the owner that any changes will take upto 3 minutes to appear? Find a way to force the cache to clear and reprocess on changes (E.g. if the owner adds an item in the administration panel it clears the relevant caches) Forget caching all together Or is there an option that would be suit this scenario?
