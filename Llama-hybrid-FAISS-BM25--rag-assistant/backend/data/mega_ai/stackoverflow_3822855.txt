WPF StringCollection + TextBox

ApplicationSetting: RenameSettings - System.Collections.Specialized.StringCollection - User - *wall of text" StringCollection... I'd like to bind it to a TextBox, Text, for viewing/editing. Following a similar patterns I've seen here and there: I've tried TextBox, TextBlock, Label (only shows the word "(Collection)")... How can I bind this elegantly?
