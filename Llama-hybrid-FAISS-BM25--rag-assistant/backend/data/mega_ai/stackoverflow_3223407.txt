iPhone Touch View and Sub ImageViews

I have a UIView (mainview), including 50 UIImageViews (image1 .. 50)) (all are set to clickable (UIVIEW and also UIImageViews) Now to test if one of my images is touched I do in 'touchesbegan': touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([touch view] == image1) { NSLog (@"image1 clicked"); } But when i test on if my "mainview" (where all images are in) came clicked with: if ([touch view] == mainview) { NSLog (@"mainview clicked");} I dont get an confirmation!?? In Short: When mainview alone is clickable i get an OK if clicked But when I activated all images (in the mainview) to be clickable .. I just can check if they are clicked but not anymore my mainview. view mainview image1 image2 image3 ..image50 Any ideas?? Thx Chris
