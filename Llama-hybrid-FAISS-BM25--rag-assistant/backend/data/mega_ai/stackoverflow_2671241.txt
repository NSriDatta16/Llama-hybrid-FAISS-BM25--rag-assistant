The Pragmatic Bookshelf also has an excellent series of screencasts on Ruby Metaprogramming : Its hosted by Dave Thomas, author of several great programming books including: The Pragmatic Programmer and Programming-Ruby-1-9 (ThePickaxe book). This series was a key inflection point in my understanding of and appreciation for Ruby. The Ruby Programming Language by Flanagan and Matz is another great resource and its co-authored by the creator of Ruby (Matz).
