How do I analyse data with a ceiling effect?

We generated repeated measures data from a sample of people evaluated at 4 timepoints in 2 groups. We wish to compare the groups over time. There are significant missing values. The questionnaire is very insensitive and has a score range from 1-30, however the vast majority of people are scoring 29 or 30. The numbers fall off exponentially below 29. Admittedly there is more of a downward spread in the measurements made at the first timepoint. Log-transforming (nor any transformation) has not made a difference. Notwithstanding the obvious rubbishness of the actual questionnaire, have people encountered this situation before? At the moment we are simply using 29 as a cutoff for a categorical analysis. Is there anything more elegant which can be done?
