We use Redmine . We have previously used Trac, but have found Redmine to be much more intuitive , flexible and user-friendly . It supports easy creation of new projects without the need to perform any command-line tasks and has a much more steady flow of updates than Trac. As for the exact answer to your questions related to Redmine: be centralized, mulitple programmer/machine should read the same tasks. Redmine is a centralized and supports easy creation of multiple users with ACL's. support subtasks, in order to organise my tickects, assign features to components and so on. Redmine supports projects, subprojects, tracker categories, versions. Subtasks are not available out of the box (yet), but there is some community patching being done to make this possible. cheap enough to personal use It's free. All you need is a server and Ruby running on it. have mylyn connector. Becouse of this point, the options are very limited. There are several options to connect Mylyn to Redmine.
