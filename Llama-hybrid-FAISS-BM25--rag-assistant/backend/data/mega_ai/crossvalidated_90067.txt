I would consider omitting the opponents' data entirely. The reason is that you cannot account for their skill level and how that affects their car choice. For instance, if long time players unlock certain cars, and start using them, they will likely have a great number of wins even if the car is not very good objectively (they are winning because they are good at the game). This would make the car look like it is good, but really the player who is using that car is good. You can, however, correct for your own skill level by using your "race #" as a covariate. Also, this eliminates the problem of not having "independent observations" that @Nick Stauner brought up. Then you could use logistic regression with "W/L" as the response variable, and "E", "N", "T", "B", "PP", and "race#" as regressors. I don't think "time" should be included either, since it is more or less a response variable assuming all tracks are equivalent. Maybe you could even substitute "time" as your response variable, but this largely depends on the game itself.
