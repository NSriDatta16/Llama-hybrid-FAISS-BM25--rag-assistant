You might be able to make your own code thread-safe, but there is no way for you to inject the necessary synchronization primitives into the builtin WinForm and WPF code that match up with the ones in your code. Remember, there are a lot of messages getting passed around behind the scenes that eventually cause the UI thread to access the control without you really ever realizing it. Another interesting aspect of a controls thread affinity is that it could (though I suspect they never would) use the Thread Local Storage pattern. Obviously if you accessed a control on a thread other than the one it was created on it would not be able to access the correct TLS data no matter how carefully you structured the code to guard against all of the normal problems of multithreaded code.
