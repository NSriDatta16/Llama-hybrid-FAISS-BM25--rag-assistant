Suppose $X \sim \mathsf{Norm}(0, 1),$ the standard normal distribution. Consider four functions $f(X):$ Square. Let $Y = f(X) = X^2.$ Then one can derive that $Y \sim \mathsf{Chisq}(\nu = 1),$ the chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom, so that $E(Y) = 1.$ Starting with a sample, $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n,$ where $n$ is large, you could average values $Y_i = f(X_i) = X_i^2$ to get a good approximation of $E(Y) = 1.$ The approximation is better for larger $n.$ For $n = 10^6$ (a sample of a million), you get $E(Y)$ accurate to two or three places. set.seed(2020) x = rnorm(100, 0, 1) y = x^2; mean(y) [1] 1.252143 x = rnorm(10^6, 0, 1) y = x^2; mean(y) [1] 0.9983859 # aprx E(Y) = 1 Linear function. Let $Y = 15X + 100.$ Here $Y \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu=100, \sigma=15),$ so that $E(Y) = 100.$ set.seed(410) x = rnorm(10^6, 0, 1) y = 15*x + 100; mean(y) [1] 99.9901 Here are histograms of simulated values along with appropriate density functions for the square and linear functions. (Making nice histograms for the exponential and reciprocal functions below is problematic.) Exponential function. Let $Y = e^{X},$ so that $Y$ has a lognormal distribution with $E(Y) = e^{1/2} = 1.648721.$ set.seed(1234) x = rnorm(100, 0, 1) y = exp(x); mean(y) [1] 1.523783 x = rnorm(10^6, 0, 1) y = exp(x); mean(y) [1] 1.652365 Reciprocal. Let $Y = 1/X$ so that $Y$ has a standard Cauchy distribution for which $E(Y)$ does not exist. The difficulty is that there is a relatively high probability of dividing by a number very near $0.$ If you try the simulation method, you can get a wide variety of bogus answers for the nonexistent $E(Y).$ This shows that the simulation method has to be used with discretion. set.seed(4321) x = rnorm(10^6, 0, 1) y = 1/x summary(y) Min. 1st Qu.
