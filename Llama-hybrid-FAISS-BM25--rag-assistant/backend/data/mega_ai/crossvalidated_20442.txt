The presumptions that motivate the desire for a rapidly mixing chain are that you care about computing time and that you want a representative sample from the posterior. The former will depend on the complexity of the problem: if you have a small/simple problem, it may not matter much whether your algorithm is efficient. The latter is very important if you are interested in posterior uncertainty or knowing the posterior mean with high precision. However, if you don't care about having a representative sample of the posterior because you are just using MCMC to do approximate optimization, this may not be very important to you.
