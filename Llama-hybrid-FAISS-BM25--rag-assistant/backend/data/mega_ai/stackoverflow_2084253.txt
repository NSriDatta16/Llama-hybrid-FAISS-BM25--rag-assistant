I suggest you take a look at the Three20 project which contains a feature called "URL-based navigation", which might help you, since you only should to store the URL of the current visible view controller, and restore it when the app resumes after the phone call: TTNavigationCenter is for those grizzled old web developers like myself who want to organize their app by "pages" which can be displayed by visiting a URL. Your view controllers can simply register URL patterns that they handle, and when those URLs are visited the controllers will be created and displayed. You can also register generic actions that are called when a URL is visited. TTNavigationCenter also persists and restores the full path of navigation controllers and modal view controllers, so your users can quite the app and come back exactly where they left off.
