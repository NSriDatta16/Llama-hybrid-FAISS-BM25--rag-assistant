For your first question the compiler counts the number of characters in a string and creates an array of that size. char *theString="hello"; creates a char array on the heap. char []theString="hello"; creates that array on the stack. For your second question int *thenum=new in; is dynamic. Standard declarations store there data on the stack which means memory doesn't have to be allocated. Memory allocation can be a slow process especially when the heap is fragmented. Stack space is limited though, so the general rule is use dynamic allocation when you need a lot of memory or have a data structure requiring pointers, use standard allocation when you just need a variable or small object.
