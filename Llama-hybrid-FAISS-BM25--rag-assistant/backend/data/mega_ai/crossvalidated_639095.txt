How would one describe such irregular data?

The situation is as follows (physics based): I have an array (7) of pixel sensors (imagine phone cameras) and a ton (millions) of particles crossing them (very large N). Each particle crossing a sensor will produce a specific kind of "event" (a cluster of pixels that responds to the passage of particles), based on the physics of charge transport inside the sensor. The cluster of pixels has, of course, an integer number. Take a few such particle crossing. For each such event, one would get for the 7 sensors the following cluster size : Sensor 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Cluster size event 1: 4 4 6 6 6 6 2 5 Cluster size event 2: 6 4 6 6 4 6 4 5 Cluster size event 3: 6 5 6 6 4 5 4 4 Here are the distributions of sensors 0 and 1, as well as for the rest, overlayed As you can see, they are rather similar, since the sensors are operated at similar settings (differences from manufacturing or electrical components). My question is: How can I describe such data, such that in the end I can quote an "average" cluster size per sensor (including the uncertainty). And finally, per such set of settings of the sensors, I want to quote an "average" number +- uncertainty. Note: There is no underlying distribution that describes this data (there is probably some Landau-like charge distribution from, which the cluster is produced, but this is truncated, since the response of the sensor is digital: if the amount of charge per pixel is bigger or smaller than a set threshold, we get a "yes" or "no" binary response). What I have tried: Mean, RMS: In my opinion they do not make sense, as I do not have a normal behaving distribution. Median ? But how can I calculate the error on the median?!? (using the $\frac{\sigma\sqrt(pi/2)}{\sqrt(n)}$ from the asymptotic variance implies a normal distribution). Boxplots: I have produced them, see below: The pink line is the median. Maybe looking at the median, one would say to just use this, but look at other settings :) Here, you see just how much they can differ... Any hints would be greatly appreciated! Cheers!
