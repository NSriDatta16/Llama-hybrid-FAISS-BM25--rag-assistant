Mac OS X: Best way to implement a card game GUI

I've started programming on Mac OS X in Objective-C and decided to create a little card game. At first I create a command line version. If everything works fine I would like to implement a GUI: Nothing big, just a green window with cards which can be dragged and dropped. Since I don't have any idea about how to do this: What can I use to implement my card game GUI? Since Objective-C and Cocoa looks like a "bundle" on Mac OS X, is it possible to use Cocoa for this (and how)? If not, what else should I use or is there already sth. like this? Regards, inno
