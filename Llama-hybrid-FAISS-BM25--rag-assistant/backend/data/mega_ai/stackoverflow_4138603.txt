BlackBerry 8330 connection issue

I'm able to connect to a webservice and download the data using a variety of devices, such as the BlackBerry 9000 with OS 4.6 or greater. However, with the 8330 and OS 4.5.0.77 it doesn't work. I have not tried this code on any devices older than the 8330 with 4.5.0.77. On the 8330 it hangs on the resultObj = op.invoke(inputObject); line in the JSR172 webservice call. This is after making the first webservice call successfully -- it hangs on the second. There are actually two webservices: The webservice used for authentication. The webservice used to download all the information. Things I've tried thus far: Wiping the device - did nothing Connecting the device to Eclipse to see what is going on - didn't find anything useful Running the code on a 8330 simulator with 4.5 (MDS running)- works flawlessly with no problems Does anyone know how to fix this issue? Here is how I build my connection string: String webserviceURL = developmentUrl; // if it is simulator then force the network that is available on // the PC if (DeviceInfo.isSimulator()) { webserviceURL += ";deviceside=true"; } else if ((CoverageInfo.getCoverageStatus() & CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_MDS) == CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_MDS) { // go through MDS webserviceURL += ";deviceside=false"; } // else if ((CoverageInfo.getCoverageStatus() & // CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_CARRIER) == CoverageInfo.COVERAGE_CARRIER) // { // webserviceURL += "'deviceside=true";// go direct // } // check if the wifi is available and change the url to use the wifi // signal if ((RadioInfo.getActiveWAFs() & RadioInfo.WAF_WLAN) != 0) // check for carrier { if (WLANInfo.getWLANState() == WLANInfo.WLAN_STATE_CONNECTED) // check for wifi { // WebService URL when the app is being used in the // actual device webserviceURL = webserviceURL + ";interface=wifi"; } } // WebService URL when the app is being used in the actual device _propertyValues = new Object[] { webserviceURL };
