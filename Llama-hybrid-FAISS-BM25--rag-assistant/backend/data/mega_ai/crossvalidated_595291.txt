When $$\alpha = \min \left( 1,\frac{f(y|\theta^{'})f(\theta^{'}) q(\theta|\theta^{'})}{f(y|\theta)f(\theta) q(\theta^{'}|\theta)} \right)$$ involves an intractable likelihood function $f(y|\cdot)$ that cannot be computed, several (exact) alternatives are available: the intractable part of $f(y|\theta)$ may also appear in $q(\theta|\theta')$ and hence cancels in the ratio. This is the idea of the auxiliary variable device of MÃ¸ller et al. (2006). Also pursued by Murray et al. (2012). They mostly address the setup of doubly intractable distributions where the likelihood function $f(y|\theta)$ involves a multiplicative factor $\mathfrak c(\theta)$ that is itself intractable. the intractable likelihood $f(y|\theta)$ may unbiasedly estimated by a random variable $\xi(y,\theta)$ , even up to a normalising constant: $$\mathbb E[\xi(y,\theta)]=\alpha(y)f(y|\theta)$$ where $\alpha(y)$ may be unknown / intractable. This is the idea of pseudo-marginal MCMC of Andrieu & Roberts (2009) . Demarginalising $y$ into $(y,z)$ and $f(y|\theta)$ into $\tilde f(y,z|\theta)$ such that $$\int_{\mathbb Z} \tilde f(y,z|\theta)\,\text dz=f(y|\theta)$$ and $\tilde f(y,z|\theta)$ tractable is a more general auxiliary variable method, where the augmented $(\theta,z)$ is simulated conditional on $y$ through an MCMC method. When using a Gibbs sampler, the ratio $\alpha$ may then be replaced at iteration $t$ by $$\tilde\alpha = \min \left( 1,\frac{\tilde f(y,z^t|\theta^{'})f(\theta^{'}) q(\theta^t|\theta^{'})}{f(y,z^t|\theta^t)f(\theta^t) q(\theta^{'}|\theta^t)} \right)$$ equivalent to $$\tilde\alpha = \min \left( 1,\frac{\tilde f(y|\theta^{'},z^t)f(\theta^{'}) q(\theta^t|\theta^{'})}{f(y|\theta^t,z^t)f(\theta^t) q(\theta^{'}|\theta^t)} \right)$$ which is a special case of 1. If none of these (related) approaches can be used (in a sufficiently efficient manner), then a approximate approach is to resort to ABC (Approximate Bayesian computation).
