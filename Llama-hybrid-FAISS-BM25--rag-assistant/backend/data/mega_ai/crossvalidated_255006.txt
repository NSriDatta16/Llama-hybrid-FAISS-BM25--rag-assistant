PCA with anomaly detection

I am developing an algorithm which should find anomalies in a dataset. In order to reduce computation time I used PCA on the data - reduce number of features will reduce the computation time. When reviewing it with a colleague a question came up about the impact of PCA in such use case, with the following example: I have a dataset with n samples and m features (m>1), suppose an anomaly is reflected only in one feature - a feature where the value is always 0 and in the anomalous case it is 1. Our consideration is that the PCA will neglect this feature and when we will reduce the number of columns after the PCA (say we take 95% of data) the anomaly will "disappear". Is using PCA for finding anomalies discouraged? or we are missing something? note this might appear as an extreme case as presented here: will-i-miss-anomalies-outliers-due-to-pca but the answers there are not suitable for my case and anyways as far as I understand their anomaly shouldn't be affected by the PCA (appears on all scales).
