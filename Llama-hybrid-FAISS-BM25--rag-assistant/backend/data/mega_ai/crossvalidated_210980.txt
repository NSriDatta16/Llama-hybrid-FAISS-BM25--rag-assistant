I would guess your variable on Y axis is exponentially distributed ($p(y) = \lambda e^{-\lambda y}$), but it seems that the rate parameter $\lambda$ is varying accordingly to the normal density probability of your variable on X axis. I've generated random data with MatLab using normal distribution for X and exponential distribution for Y, with $\lambda = p(x)$ and I got a similar result with your data: You could try machine learning to fit the parameters, changing your cost function to compare the probability density and the rate parameter for each bin on your 'histogram'. If so, don't forget to run the random generator a few times on each iteration to minimize the cost. Here is the code I used for the plot: % Normal distribution generation. x = randn(10000,1); x = x - min(x); % Shifting curve so every x is > 0. % Histogram informations k = 100; % Number of bins. binSize = (max(x) - min(x)) / k; % Width of bins. y = 0:(k); y = y .* binSize + min(x); % Array with Intervals. p = zeros(k,1); data = []; % For every bin... for i = 1:k a = x(x >= y(i) & x
