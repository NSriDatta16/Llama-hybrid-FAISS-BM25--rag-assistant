It works well for me to subclass UIScrollView and listen to touches like so: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if([touch tapCount] == 1) { NSLog(@"One Touch!"); } } If you are having problems, perhaps you have views inside the scroll view that block the touches? To test things out create a new View, add a scrollview that you subclass with the touchesBegan code above and at least you'll see that it works. Then add more elements from your original code to see where your problem really is. Good luck!
