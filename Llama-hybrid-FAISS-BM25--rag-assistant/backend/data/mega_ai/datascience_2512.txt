UCL - CSML. It covers computer science, machine learning and statistics. Firstly, reputation of the university. Secondly, you are from Mathematics background, hence I assume you don't have sufficient programming knowledge. Thirdly, Statistics and Machine Learning dominates this field. Employers would prefer these 2 before Mathematics. In short, this course provides everything that you are lacking. HOWEVER, they don't teach programming languages like Java, C++,... but Matlab, R, and Mathematica. Hence, it would be essential if you pick up the former from somewhere.
