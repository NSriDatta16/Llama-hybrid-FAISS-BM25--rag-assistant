Flash doesnt show up until mouse over on ie. How to fix that?

I developed something in flex. It works great on FF and Safari. But on IE the "swf area" remains blank until mouse moves over it. I am embedding it like that: What can I do? I dont want to use javascript for it, because I need to easily copy/paste my "embedding code" on other webpages. Any suggestion?
