Measure Code Coverage only on New Code

We are looking for a creative way to measure code coverage on new code separate from existing code. We have a large legacy project and want to start getting 90+% coverage on any new functionality. We would like a way to easily view a report that filters out any older code to make sure the new functionality is meeting our goal. Obviously still looking a increasing overall coverage on the project, but need a non-manual way to give us feedback on the new code activity. We have this working for Static analysis since we can look at the dates on the source files. Since Cobertura is analyzing the class files they have new dates and this technique doesn't work. Any Ideas? Stack: Java 1.5 JUnit Cobertura Hudson
