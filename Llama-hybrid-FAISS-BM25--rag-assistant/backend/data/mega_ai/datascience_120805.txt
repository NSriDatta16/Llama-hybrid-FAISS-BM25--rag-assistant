I think you are interested in knowing whether the model learns distributions of linear combinations of the input data. In the special case of Gaussian latent space, the encoder estimates the mean $\mu_1$ , $\mu_2$ and variance $\sigma_1^2$ , $\sigma_2^2$ from $a_1$ and $a_2$ . Then we sample from the two distributions $N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)$ and $N(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)$ . If $a_1$ and $a_2$ are independent, their sum (difference) is also normally distributed, with mean equal to the sum (difference) of their means, and variance equal to the sum of the variances. So, in this case, you can easily extrapolate points that represent linear combinations of the observations from the parameters of their distributions. If they are not independent, their linear combination is still normally distributed, but you need to take into account of their covariance. Does VAE learn these directly from the observations? Not true in general.
