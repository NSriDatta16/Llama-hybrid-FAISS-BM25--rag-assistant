Significance test for different time series

I have two different experimental setups with three replicas each. The data describes the growth of bacteria over time. I am looking for a test to determine whether the time series of the two setups are significantly different (p Multiple t-tests Since I have two time series with 3 replica each, I have six datapoints for every time. I did a t-test on every timestep, leading to some t-tests being negative (red background, no significant difference) and some positive (green background, significant difference). I would probably need to combine those t-test into one p-value but I don't kow how or whether this is possible. Note that this is not the real data (I cannot post the real data here) but artificial data that resembles the real data quite well. Model-based Inspired by this answer I tried to fit a model to the data. I guess the ARIMA model is not suitable here, because even with differentiation, the data will not be stationary. I used the logistic growth model instead which describes the data quite well. However, it is unclear to me, how and why I would do an F-test (which tests for variance as far as I know) on the sum of the residuals as the answer on the mentioned question suggests. I fitted the model to all replica and tested the parameters for a significance between the setups with a t-test. In this case, one parameter was significantly different (K) and one was not (r_max), which brings me back to the problem of combination of t-tests. I don't need a solution to all approaches. I am happy if you can fix one of them or present an entirely different solution. I uploaded the data , if anyone wants to try anything with it (link will only be valid for a week).
