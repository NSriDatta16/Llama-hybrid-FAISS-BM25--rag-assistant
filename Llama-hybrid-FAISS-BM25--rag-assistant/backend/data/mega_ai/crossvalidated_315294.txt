Your problem doesn't really need complex Machine Learning algorithms. I think one good option is Stephan's sugestion, a Exponential Regression. This means you assume your dependent variable follows a exponential distribution, with p.d.f: $$f(x) = \lambda \exp(-\lambda x)\ I_{(0, \infty)}(x)$$ where $\lambda$ is the occurrence rate per unit of measurement, which can be time, distance, etc.
