in general, network round trip latency is several orders of magnitude greater than the capacity of a database to generate and feed data onto the network, and the capacity of a client box to consume it from a network connection. But look at the width of your network bus ( Bits/sec ) and compare that to the average round trip time for a database call... On 100baseT ethernet, for example you are about 12 MBytes / sec data transfer rate. If your average round trip time is say, 200 ms, then your network bus can deliver 3 MBytes in each 200 ms round trip call.. If you're on gigabit ethernet, that number jumps to 30 Mbytes per round trip... So if you split up a request for data into two round trips, well that's 400 ms, and each query would have to be over 3Mb (or 30Mb for gigibit ) before that would be faster...
