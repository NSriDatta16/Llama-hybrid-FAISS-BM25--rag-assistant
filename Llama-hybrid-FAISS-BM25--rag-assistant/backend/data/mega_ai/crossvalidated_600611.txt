I agree with you that the distinction between multiple and multivariate is typically fishy for novices. However rest assured that, multiple regression is one which considers more than one explanatory variable (aka features). On the other hand, multivariate regression is a model which considers many response variables at a time. As a rule of thumb to distinguish between them MULTIPLE are the features you include MULTIVARIATE is the response you deal with Thus, regarding the models listed Your description is correct. In addition, Mixed models could be multiple or multivariate or both. Your description is correct. Multinomial logistic regression has necessarily a multivariate response, e.g. realizations from a multinomial random vector. This is also correct. To perform multivariate or univariate multiple regression in R use lm . To perform logistic regression you may consider glm . Multivariate logistic regression is more elaborate because you have to setup a model yoursel depending on the context of study (e.g. longitudinal data analysis, etc.). For multinomial logistic regression, there is multinom from the nnet package (see here for an example)
