(I've dithered over adding this, as it appears @JarleTufto has already given a nice mathematical approach; However I'm not clever enough to understand his answer, and now I'm curious if it is exactly the same approach, or if the approach I describe below ever has its uses.) What I would do is guess an average length, and guess a few distributions around it, and then, for each, make a simulation of my population, and sample it regularly. You said to assume the total population of vegetarians is not changing, so each time my model has someone stopping, a brand new vegetarian is created. We need to run the model for a number of simulated years to make sure it has settled down, before we can start to sample. After that I think you can take samples every simulated month (*) until you have enough to form your 90% confidence interval. *: or whatever resolution works with your data. If people gave their answer to the nearest year, sampling every 6 months is good enough. Out of all your guesses, you choose the mean and distribution which (averaged over all the samples you took) gives you the closest result to what your real-life survey gave. I would iterate my guesses a few times, to narrow in on the best match. The best distribution may not be single-peaked. The ex-vegetarians I personally can think of stopped because of major lifestyle changes (typically marrying/living with a non-vegetarian, or moving country, or falling seriously ill and a doctor suggesting it might be diet); on the other side is the power of habit: the longer you've been a vegetarian the more likely you are to carry on being one. If your data had asked age and relationship status, we could throw that in the above simulation too.
