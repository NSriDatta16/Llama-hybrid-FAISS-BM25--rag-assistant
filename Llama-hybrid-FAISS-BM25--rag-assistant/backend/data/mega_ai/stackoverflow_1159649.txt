How to access context menu in UserControl Resources + Infragistics Control(WPF), C#

I have a context menu situated inside a User Control Resource. This resource is bound to a WPF grid. Now, after the grid is filled with data, I am right clicking on the grid. And I am able to find the context menu. The problem is how can I know at runtime which menu item has been clicked? I have tried with this var t = this.TryFindResource("Menu1") as Style; in the grid's SelectedItemsChanged event but it is null. Please help me and also tell me in which event of grid should I will be able to acess this! Thanks in advance. I am using C#,WPF,Infragistics Control(WPF)
