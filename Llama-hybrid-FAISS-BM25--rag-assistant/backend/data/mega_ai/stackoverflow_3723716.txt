Is there a more modern, OO version of "Let's Build a Compiler"?

Is there a more modern, maybe object-oriented, equivalent to Jack Crenshaw's " Let's Build a Compiler " series? A while back I stumbled across " Let's Build a Compiler " and could just not resist writing some code. I wrote a recursive-descent C compiler in C# that output .NET CIL. "Write once, leak everywhere" was my slogan. Too bad I did not realize until too late that parsing C is a nightmare. I am now interested in writing a Java compiler in Java that outputs .NET CIL or assemblies with the goal of being self-bootstrapping. I was hoping there might some newer tutorials kicking around. As an aside, would you spend more time with up-front design or would you just write a ton of tests to support the ability to mercilessly refactor. Thinking back, I am leaning towards the latter. The compiler worked but the code was really awful.
