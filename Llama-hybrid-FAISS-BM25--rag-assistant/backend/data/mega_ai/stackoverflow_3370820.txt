Referencing Assemblies in a .Net Application

In my application, I would like to load Assemblies that reside on a network share (The application itself is on that share, too) without having to add them to the project's output path. What I'd like to have is an output directory that contains next to nothing but the application. Merely adding the target directory to my project's reference path's won't work. I tried setting the probing directory in the App.Config, but that didn't work (even tested it on my local diks instead of the network share) Thanks in advance for any hints! EDIT : Seems the way this is going leads through reflection. Isn't there a more elegant way using Dependency Injection containers like NInject?
