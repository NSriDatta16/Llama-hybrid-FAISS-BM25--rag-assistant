Reporting the effect of a predictor in a logistic regression fitted with a restricted cubic spline

I have been playing around with using restricted cubic splines using the RMS package. Output below. library(rms) nlmodel_ni_bi_4 chi2) |Z|) Intercept -7.2339 0.3149 -22.97 I am used to running logistic regression where all of the predictors are either continuous linear or categorical. Here, when describing the individual predictors effect on the outcome, we would present the adjusted odds ratio, associated p value and sometimes relative risk. I am not sure how to report the age predictor in my current model with RCS. I am lost on a number of issues: Exactly what are the three terms associated with the age variable in the output (age, age', age''). Is this the derivative and the derivative of the derivative? or is it a term for each knot that has been fitted? With a linear term the adjusted odds ratio has a simple interpretation, with a consistent slope. Given that the RCS is not linear, what is the recommended way to describe its effect? Are there any guidelines for how to report predictors fitted with splines? Thanks
