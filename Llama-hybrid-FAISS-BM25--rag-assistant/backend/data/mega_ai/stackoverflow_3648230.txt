Your public and private keys are automagically generated when required - if you use the certificate assistant to request a signing certificate as the provisioning profile describes you will find your new private/public keys created. Once you begin this process you should also use spotlight to remove all .mobileprovision and .cer files you may have remaining in downloads, and also use organizer to remove profiles from devices. If you are starting from scratch you want to make sure none of that stuff remains to cause you problems. This is an overcomplicated process to be sure, but once everything is really deleted and a fresh start is made it should be good for some time. The biggest problems I have had are when getting a new Mac and having hiccups with exporting/importing keys in an effort to keep my old certificates/provisioning valid.
