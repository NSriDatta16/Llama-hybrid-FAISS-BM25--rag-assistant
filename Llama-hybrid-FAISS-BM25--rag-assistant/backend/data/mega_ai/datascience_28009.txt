Supervised learning refers to learning a concept from examples. Those examples typically require work from a human, which is usually "expensive". In fact a huge part of practical ML-work is to come up with smart ways of obtaining training data (think of reCaptcha's for instance). Un supervised learning is learning without labeled data, that is all there is to it. Clustering is one example, PCA is another and autoencoding is the newest hottest thing (imho). In some sense unsupervised learning try to compress the data (by finding subspaces of high dimensional representations along the lines of which the data is ordered, or manifolds ): You are trying to formulate concepts that describe the data on a higher level, this involves finding smarter descriptions. It might be somewhat of a leap from K-means, but consider this: I could easily describe a photograph to you using a set of abstractions (fi: I see a dog with a bone -> 23 bytes). This would give you a picture of the scene without the need of me sending you the full dataset (fi: 1080 * 768 points ~ 10^6 bytes). Conceptually this would be somewhat similar to: 4 examples of cluster one and one example of cluster 4, instead of sending 5 complete instances of, say, 10.000 features.
