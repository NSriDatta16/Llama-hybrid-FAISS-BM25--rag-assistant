How do I produce generative neural networks?

To my understanding, a learning method is used to train a neural network on a dataset by training it's outputs. I'm aware that the same neural network can be run backwards to generate data. I'd like to learn how to reverse a neural network's algorithm to generate. Any ideas? See this video.
