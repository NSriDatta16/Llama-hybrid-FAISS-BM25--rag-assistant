Which ICC should I use for inter-rater reliability?

In my study a dog's owner and dog's walker each filled out a personality assessment for a target dog. I have 60 dogs in total. There were multiple questions that scored the dog on 5 dimensions. I'm comparing the inter-rater reliability of these assessments. I'm trying to determine if I should be using Pearson correlation or Intraclass Correlation (ICC). If I use ICC, (which I think I should be using) I'm trying to determine the following settings in R: one way or two way; agreement or consistency; average or single.
