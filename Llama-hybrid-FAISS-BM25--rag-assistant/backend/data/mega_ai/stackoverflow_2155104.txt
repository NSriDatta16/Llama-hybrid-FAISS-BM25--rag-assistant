You can use Apache FOP 's free Batik SVG toolkit which has a transcoder api to transform SVG to PDF. download link You will need to write a tiny bit of java. There are code examples here – note you will need to set the transcoder to org.apache.fop.svg.PDFTranscoder instead of Java. You should be able to do this without installing anything on your machine – just drag the jars on there and run a script. I quote: All other libraries needed by Batik are included in the distribution. As a consequence the Batik archive is quite big, but after you have downloaded it, you will not need anything else.
