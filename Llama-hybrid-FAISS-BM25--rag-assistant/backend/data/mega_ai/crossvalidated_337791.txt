Why is the result a set of factors instead of just only one?

I am trying to get into SEM and factor analysis. I understand a factor is a latent construct, say e.g. $intelligence$, user-defined by the (weighted) average of a set of indicators $x_1, x_2\dots x_n$. The $x_i$ load (i.e. correlate) on the factor differently and the loadings should be over $0.40$ at minimum. So far so good (presumed). When I run a factor analysis in Stata with the factor command, in the output there are a number of factors being displayed instead of only one which I define. The literature I found tells then, the factor with the highest eigenvalue is the best one. Why there are a number of factors being displayed since with my indicators $x_i$ I intend to define just one? All the literature I found just says e.g. "the first factor has the strongest eigenvector" or "only one factor has an eigenvector greater than $1$" . I'm missing the step where factors or their sets respectively are derived from their sets of indicators. I'm confused now, what factors actually are since in a defined set of indicators there could be more than one. I am quite sure my question is very obvious to anybody being familiar with this stuff. I'd appreciate any clarification though. Here is an example of a Stata output that should look familiar to anybody. . factor x1-x9, pcf (obs=1,625) Factor analysis/correlation Number of obs = 1,625 Method: principal-component factors Retained factors = 1 Rotation: (unrotated) Number of params = 9 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Factor | Eigenvalue Difference Proportion Cumulative -------------+------------------------------------------------------------ Factor1 | 3.76124 2.80650 0.4179 0.4179 Factor2 | 0.95473 0.10627 0.1061 0.5240 Factor3 | 0.84847 0.10176 0.0943 0.6183 Factor4 | 0.74671 0.05561 0.0830 0.7012 Factor5 | 0.69110 0.07429 0.0768 0.7780 Factor6 | 0.61681 0.07780 0.0685 0.8466 Factor7 | 0.53900 0.09177 0.0599 0.9065 Factor8 | 0.44723 0.05252 0.0497 0.9561 Factor9 | 0.39471 . 0.0439 1.0000 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- LR test: independent vs. saturated: chi2(36) = 3863.18 Prob>chi2 = 0.0000 Factor loadings (pattern matrix) and unique variances --------------------------------------- Variable | Factor1 | Uniqueness -------------+----------+-------------- x1 | 0.6243 | 0.6103 x2 | 0.5883 | 0.6539 x3 | 0.7222 | 0.4785 x4 | 0.7131 | 0.4915 x5 | 0.5818 | 0.6615 x6 | 0.6197 | 0.6160 x7 | 0.6085 | 0.6297 x8 | 0.5968 | 0.6439 x9 | 0.7392 | 0.4535 ---------------------------------------
