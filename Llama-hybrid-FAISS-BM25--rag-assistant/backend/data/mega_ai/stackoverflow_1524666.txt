WPF audio manipulation

I want to do some slightly advanced audio playing using a standard WPF application. Here is what I need: ability to smoothly loop change pitch play multiple sounds at once I know the SoundPlayer class in not sufficient because it cannot play multiple sounds at once, so I began looking into the XNA SoundEffect class (and similar) but Im not sure how exactly the interoperability between XNA and WPF works. Can someone shed some light here for me? Cheers Mark
