What would be the best way to impute data?

Other than just filling in with the mean of a feature, what other methods are there which can work well? I am trying to decide whether or not to use a denoising-autoencoder or just impute with the mean or any other method which can perform well enough which is quickly implementable. Also is it necessary to make any assumptions about the underlying distribution? The denosing-autoencoder seems attractive here because you do not need to make any explicit assumptions.
