How regularization parameter in SVM affects hyperplane parameters

While learning the SVM classification I came across the regularization parameter $\lambda$ : $F(w,b) = \left\lVert w\right\lVert_2^2 +\lambda \sum_{i=1}^n max(0,1-y_i(w^Tx_i +b)).$ So from what I understand, the main point of SVM is to find the hyperplane $\{w^Tx+b=0\}$ separating 2 classes. How does $\lambda$ affects the hyperplane parameters w and b? I tried to plot the 2D case, but still can't get it. Can anyone give the interpretation in this case? Thanks.
