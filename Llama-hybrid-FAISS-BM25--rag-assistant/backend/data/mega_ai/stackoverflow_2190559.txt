Using Stored Procedure for reading records from Database in NHibernate?

Is reading the database records from the Database using Stored Procedures in NHibernate a good approach?If yes then why or if No, then also why? The application has only the feature of reading values from the database using NHibernate in the data access layer no updates and no inserts just only retrieval.
