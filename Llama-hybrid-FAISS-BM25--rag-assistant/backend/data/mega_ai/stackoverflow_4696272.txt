Want to Drag and Drop Table loaded in Ajax into a Tab

On my Index.html page, many tabs. Into some of them, I load a table (grid) from an .asp file. It works fine. I want that table to be "drag and dropable". The .asp file works fine when run by itself, but doesn't into the tab. I make a sample .html file with a drag and dropable table (exact same structure as the result table of the asp file), it works... Why? :-) Here is part of the code : the html : the jQuery : $(document).ready(function(){ $("#sort tbody").sortable().disableSelection(); }) I remember once reading a solution somewhere but don't seem to find it again.
