Logistic regression fitting problem

I'm trying to make a GLM with binomial distribution to evaluate the effect of the diameter at breast height and the occupation of tree termites in species of tree. I'm using the following model: model My response variable is the occupation of termites on the tree (data of absence and presence); the independent variable is the dap and the interaction with kind of species. But when I run the model the following errors appear: Warning message: glm.fit: odds adjusted numerically 0 or 1 occurred Error in seq.default(1, length(levels(eval(as.name(qvar)))) - 1, by = 1) : wrong sign in 'by' argument Error in solve.default(t(X) %*% W %*% X) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 1.93217e-38 > Warning messages: 1: not plotting observations with leverage one: 10, 24, 26, 36, 37, 40, 43, 57, 71, 72, 73, 116, 138 2: not plotting observations with leverage one: 10, 24, 26, 36, 37, 40, 43, 57, 71, 72, 73, 116, 138 3: In sqrt(crit * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced 4: In sqrt(crit * p * (1 - hh)/hh) : NaNs produced The same thing happens when I rotate the contrasts in the analysis Error in seq.default(1, length(levels(eval(as.name(qvar)))) - 1, by = 1) : wrong sign in 'by' argument Can someone help me? I understand very little about R.
