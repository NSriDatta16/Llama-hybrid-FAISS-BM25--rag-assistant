Heap Behavior in C++

Is there anything wrong with the optimization of overloading the global operator new to round up all allocations to the next power of two? Theoretically, this would lower fragmentation at the cost of higher worst-case memory consumption, but does the OS already have redundant behavior with this technique, or does it do its best to conserve memory? Basically, given that memory usage isn't as much of an issue as performance, should I do this?
