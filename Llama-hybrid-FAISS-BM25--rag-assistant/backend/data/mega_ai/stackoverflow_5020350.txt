Yes, you should test only a single method/unit. For instance TestNG encourages you to make such an assumptions by allowing you to define test dependencies. If you test method foo() which depends on method bar() , make your test dependent on the one that tests bar() . If bar() test(s) fail, tests for foo() won't even run. The downside of this assumption (when you don't have the ability to define test dependencies) is that when bar() method is broken, tests for both foo() and bar() will fail, making it harder to find the root cause of the problem.
