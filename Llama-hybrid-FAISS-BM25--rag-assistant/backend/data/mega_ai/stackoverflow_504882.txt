Ah, I think I've got it. Turns out the call to DoDragDrop is actually synchronous (how lame), and returns a value of DragDropEffects , which is set to None if the op fails. So basically this means the app (or at least the UI thread) will be frozen for so long as the user is in the middle of a drag. That does not seem a very elegant solution to me. Ok cz_dl I see you just posted that very thing so I'll give u the answer. This I don't understand though: how can the destination determine whether the op should be a move or a copy? Shouldn't that be up to the source app?
