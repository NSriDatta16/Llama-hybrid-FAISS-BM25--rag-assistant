Haskell, 102 characters (wow, so close to matching the original): import List (take 10.map snd.sort.map(\(x:y)->(-length y,x)).group.sort.words)`fmap`readFile"input.txt" J , only 55 characters: 10{.\:~~.(,.~[: (I've yet to figure out how to elegantly perform text manipulations in J... it's much better at array-structured data.) NB. read the file split into lines split into words ;;:&.> count reptititions |:~.(,.~[: sort |:\:~~.(,.~[: take 10 10{.\:~~.(,.~[:
