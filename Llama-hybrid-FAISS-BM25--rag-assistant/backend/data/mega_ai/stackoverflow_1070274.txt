Using foreach to create grid

I am creating a grid in GD and was wondering if this is the right way to do it. I have 2 arrays. One contains all X values, the other contains all Y values. foreach ($xpointsArray as $xvalue) { foreach ($ypointsArray as $yvalue) { // Draw point at coordinates $xvalue, $yvalue } } I just think there must be a more elegant way to set this up, and I would like to further access the points values without doing this every time.
