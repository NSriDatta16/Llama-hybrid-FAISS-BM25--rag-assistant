How to identify transfer functions in a time series regression forecasting model?

I am trying to build a time series regression forecasting model for an outcome variable, in dollar amount, in terms of other predictors/input variables and autocorrelated errors. This kind of model is also called dynamic regression model. I need to learn how to identify transfer functions for each predictor and would love to hear from you about ways to do just that.
