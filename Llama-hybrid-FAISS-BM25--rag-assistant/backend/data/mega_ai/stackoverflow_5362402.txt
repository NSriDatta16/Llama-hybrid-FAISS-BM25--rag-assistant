It looks like Visual Guard will do what you want...(I haven't used it myself, i believe it is used in places within an organisation i work with)...It appears to have all the things you mentioned according to its features page (it does specifically mention being able to hide or disable controls, have an admin interface, users/roles/permissions etc). http://www.visual-guard.com/EN
