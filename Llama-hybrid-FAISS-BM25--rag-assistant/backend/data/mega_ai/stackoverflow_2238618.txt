Now there are some other scripts that recognize this spit out information and apply tooltips to the products and make them draggable. And there lies your problem. These scripts are probably initiated on page load, when all the elements already exist. If you use the AJAX method to fill the html (and I'm assuming these scripts are part of the received html), the onload event will never fire. What you will have to do is find out what events are called on page load, and fire them again. A work-around could be to use an iframe to load the contents instead of AJAX. I'm not a big fan of iframes, but in this particular case it sounds like a fast solution.
