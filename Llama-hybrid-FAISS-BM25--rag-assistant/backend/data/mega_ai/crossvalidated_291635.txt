Since @mattbarstead answered question two so competently, I thought I should answer question one. Your question is "should I trust my Bayesian or my Frequentist model" and the answer is "no." You should only do one or the other, but never both. This isn't because they could differ and there would be no objective way to solve your problem, but because they are not answering the same question in the first place. A couple of qualifications about the two methods should be noted. Frequentist methods are ex ante optimal. That is to say, prior to picking up your data, there is no better way to analyze your data. This optimality is understood that if you were to cover the sample space that, on average, the solution meets some set of optimality criteria, such as unbiasedness, consistency and so forth. Bayesian methods are ex post optimal. That is they only become optimal models after they have seen the data and the solutions are specifically unique to the sample seen. There is no way to extract more information about the location of a parameter than a Bayesian method. That said, the specific Bayesian result from one sample could be a poor solution when seen over the whole sample space, but the averaging rules of Frequentist methods mean using a Frequentist method could be a poor method for the sample that happened to be seen in the study. The second is the nature of hypotheses. Frequentist hypothesis must be binary. The null here is the "no effect" hypothesis, that is in a broader form $\mu=k=0$. This is treated as intrinsically true before it sees the data. The data may reject this, but it is assumed true. Bayesian hypotheses are combinatoric. There is nothing similar to the hypothesis that $\mu=k$ because if your solution is in the real numbers then $\Pr(\mu=k)\equiv{0}$. Just because zero is in the Bayesian credible interval does not mean that $\mu=k.$ It is just one of an infinite number of possible solutions. You should be choosing a Frequentist method because you have an existential or true/false style question that needs to be answered. This is especially true if you want to use the "no effect" hypothesis. There is no real Bayesian equivalent to the "no effect" hypothesis. You should choose the Bayesian method when you have multiple competing models of the world. The Frequentist methodology has to jump to the Bayesian in order to do model selection through tools like the AIC or BIC, which are really stylized and constrained Bayesian summary statistics. For any one Frequentist method, an infinite number of Bayesian models exists. A t-test covers an unbelievably wide set of possible solutions that are different and distinct when constructed as a Bayesian problem. The t-test just depends upon how the sample was collected, whereas the Bayesian posterior depends upon how the likelihood is constructed. This implies that the Bayesian depends upon how you model the laws of the universe. It is built on modeling. The Frequentist is an algorithm based on the sampling rules. The second case for using Bayesian methods is when real prior knowledge exists, such as prior research where there is at least partial information on the parameters. If real prior knowledge exists then Frequentist methods are statistically inadmissible. The Bayesian solution will always stochastically dominate the Frequentist in that case. You need to think through the question of "what do I need to know?" Do you need to know if these variables really do not impact the dependent variable? Do you need to discover which of many possible models of the world is the closest to the model nature uses to generate the data? The former is Frequentist, the later, Bayesian. The former permits you to make deductive statements, the latter is not considering the models you did not test and so is an incomplete form of reasoning. Because there could be models you did not think of, the Bayesian posterior is incomplete. All possible models, except the alternative hypothesis, exist in the null by its very construction. Your construction of the Bayesian model looks like a Frequentist construction. Have you considered all possible ways to combine the variables, including dropping variables?
