Java servlet and authentication

I have a small application with 3-4 servlets and a basic module that provide me authentication like: public class Authentication { public boolean isUserAuthenticated(){ .... } } Is there a way to check the authentication using my class BEFORE every other servlet calls, without have to add code in each of them? I'd like to avoid the check of the user for every servlet I have and for every servlet I will have to add. Any suggestion is well accepted :) Thanks, Roberto
