This is why I encourage programmers new to AJAX to learn the basics before adopting a library - when you understand what's actually happening, this sort of optimization becomes obvious. so is there an alternative to send only response data? Like, you have a method that will return only a date? Yes. The most basic way is to just write the date string to the response stream and end the response before anything else is sent - HTTP Handlers (ashx) work great for this. For a more ASP.NET AJAX-friendly technique, check out Web Methods.
