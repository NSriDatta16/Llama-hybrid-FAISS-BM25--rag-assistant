The hash format of specifying conditions such as :conditions=> {:col1 => params[:gm], :col2 => nil} can only be used to specify conditions that are all = joined with AND . It's nice to read so use that format when applicable, but when you need an OR , or a comparator other than = , you'll need to use a slightly different format: :conditions => ["col1 = ? AND col3 != ? AND col2 = ?", params[:gm], nil, nil] This format takes an array, the first element of which is an sql fragment, and the remaining parameters are sql sanitized (preventing sql injection attack, and converting nil to 'NULL' etc) and inserted into the sql fragment replacing the ? (in order of appearance).
