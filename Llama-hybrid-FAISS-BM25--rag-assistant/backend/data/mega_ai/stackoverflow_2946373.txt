Backend storage, database handling, front-end dynamic content, and caching is one thing. Consideration of your host service provider and available network bandwidth is the other. Check with your hosting service on their bandwidth caps, max memory allocation per request, max file upload sizes, and max database queries. If your current host doesn't offer cheap services that match your scaling requirements, then move to another host before you're either shut down or caught offguard by a triple-digit monthly bill for going over your alloted bandwidth. Edit: just re-read and caught your "internal network" reference. So, in this case, you probably won't be stuck with a several hundred dollar bill by your network admin, but they can still shut you down. Be sure to keep the lines of communication open with your network admins and admins of any other services your own site interacts with, or you'll likely make enemies of them all pretty quickly. In other words: good network etiquette. Furthermore, if you actually own and build the server, make sure the OS, software stack, and hardware are all up to date with stable software and firmware versions only, able to handle the load, and monitored to run smoothly at all times. Edit #2: I know you asked specifically how your application can handle the load, and I may just be ranting off-topic here, but you also have to consider whether you and your team mates can handle the load. Manpower bandwidth is just as important, and getting discouraged by the work load is how projects like this fail. Beer is a programmer's best friend, especially when tackling complex and creative programming tasks, but it can lead to serious drinking problems if manpower isn't managed correctly or if manpower resources are lacking. Who's going to respond to that outage notification at 3 in the morning? Who's going to respond to hatemail from religious fundamentalists or trolls, or crawl through law and patents to verify if that take-down notice is bogus? Unless it's a gig that can pay the bills, likely most folks can't devote a lot of time and energy. I don't mean to discourage you at all, and hopefully you got this covered already.
