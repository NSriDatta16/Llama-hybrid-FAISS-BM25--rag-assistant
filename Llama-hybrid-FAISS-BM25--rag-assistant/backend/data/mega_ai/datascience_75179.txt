Any outlier, whether it is a point outlier or a collective outlier can also be a contextual outlier when analyzed with respect to a context. By incorporating context information, an outlier detection problem to detect a point outlier or a collective outlier can be transformed into an outlier detection problem for detecting contextual outliers. Source: https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/154074/4/04_chapter%201.pdf Hence you are correct when you say that Global outlier detection does require context. But let's think of time series data where context is temporal. A data point is considered a global outlier if its value is far outside the entirety of the data set. And it is considered a contextual outlier if values are not outside the normal global range, but are abnormal compared to the seasonal pattern.
