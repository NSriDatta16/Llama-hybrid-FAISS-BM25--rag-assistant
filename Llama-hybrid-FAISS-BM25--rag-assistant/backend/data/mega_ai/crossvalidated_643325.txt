Adding a factor to a model can change the estimates and confidence intervals of the present factors. An example that is easily illustrated is the case of an intercept term. For example: Why do my (coefficients, standard errors & CIs, p-values & significance) change when I add a term to my regression model? A simple example for a change in the main effect when an interaction term is added is a model like $$y_i = a+b x_iz_i + \epsilon$$ Such model has only an interaction term and no main effect. So when you fit your model 1, you may observe a significant main effect because the main effect can correlate with the interaction term, and this 'disappears' when we include the interaction term. The interpretation of the main effect also changes when we include an interaction term. In the figure below you can see an example. With a main effect only the model fits reasonably and the coefficient for $x$ relates to the average slope. With the interaction term included the model fit is improved. But now the interpretation of the main effect changes and the coefficient for $x$ relates to the slope when $z=0$ . In the example this slope is very close to zero and 'not significant'. R-code for the image: set.seed(1) n = 200 x = runif(n,0.5,3) z = sample(6:9,n,replace = 1) y = 30+2*x*z+rnorm(n) plot(x,y, col = z-5, pch = 20, main = "fit with lm(y ~ x)", xlim = c(0,3.5), c(30,80)) legend(0.5,75,9:6, col = 4:1, pch = 20, title = "z") xs = seq(0.5,3,0.01) b = lm(y ~ x)$coef lines(xs, b[1]+b[2]*xs) plot(x,y, col = z-5, pch = 20, main = "fit with lm(y ~ x*z)", xlim = c(0,3.5), ylim = c(30,80) ) legend(0.5,75,9:6, col = 4:1, pch = 20, title = "z") b = lm(y ~ x*z)$coef lm(y ~ x*z) for (z in 0:9) { lines(xs, b[1]+b[2]*xs + b[3] * z + b[4] * xs*z) text(3, b[1]+b[2]*3 + b[3] * z + b[4] * 3*z, paste0("z = ",z), pos = 4) } You can still call one of the variables a moderator, which one that depends on your viewpoint ( One of the main effects not significant, but interaction term significant ) Also note that by translation of the variables we can change the specific slope that is regarded as the 'main effect'. The interpretation of the 'main effect' is subjective and often it doesn't matter whether it is significant or not when the interaction is significant.
