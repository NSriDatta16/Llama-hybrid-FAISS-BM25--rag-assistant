Even in ARIMA models, the noise is still IID; it's just that the model part has an auto-correlation component, a moving-average component, and a differencing component. Now, if you were to take data generated by one of these models and then model it with some simpler model (e.g., lacking the auto-correlation component) then the "noise" from the simpler approximation is going to be non-IID due to the fact that it does not take account of a part of the original model.
