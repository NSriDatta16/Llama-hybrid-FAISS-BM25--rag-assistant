PHP MySQL JQuery Back-End for Data Driven Menu

I am looking for tutorials, articles etc. on how to create a JQuery reorder list for administration of a data driven menu. Instead of typing in parent ids for positioning, I want to be able to drag menu items into position or use up/down arrows or something similar that creates a more intuitive and visual way to manipulate menu items. Can anyone suggest anything. Thanks!
