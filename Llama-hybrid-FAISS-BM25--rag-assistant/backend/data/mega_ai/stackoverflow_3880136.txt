Assumming you have a StringBuffer sb that already contains the text: int start = sb.indexOf("start"); int end = sb.indexOf("end"); if (start != -1 && end != -1) { String fragment = sb.substring(start + "start".length(), end); System.out.println(fragment); } Note that this finds text between "start" and "end" as you asked for in your question. However if the text in the StringBuffer has line breaks, you might actually want to search for text between "start\n" and "end\n" .
