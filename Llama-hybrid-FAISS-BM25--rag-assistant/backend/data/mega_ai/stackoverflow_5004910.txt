Android Cursor Management w/ListView

I've got a ListActivity that displays a list of items from a database using a CursorAdapter, which initially contains all items in the table. I also provide an EditText view where the user can enter search text, and as characters are entered, I requery the database using a "LIKE" or "MATCH" where clause to filter the results (IOW, what lots of apps do when searching). Currently, I do this in an AsyncTask by creating a new Cursor from the query, creating a new instance of my CursorAdapter class, and then calling list.setAdapter from the UI thread when the task completes. This is all working, but is there a more elegant way of effectively requerying the database with a new WHERE clause from withing the existing adapter/cursor and avoiding having to create new object instances each time? Any examples of this technique? Doug Gordon GHCS Software
