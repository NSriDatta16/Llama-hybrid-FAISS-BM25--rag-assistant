Python Launcher.app is a somewhat neglected app; there have been some discussion about removing it all together because it could be somewhat of a security risk if someone downloads arbitrary Python scripts from the web. It can also be kind of hit or miss if you have multiple Python versions installed. And many people just run Python from a terminal window command line so they don't need Python Launcher.app and that's probably the safest thing to do. To do so, you should first run the Update Shell Profile command in /Applications/Python 3.1 which will ensure that the proper Python framework bin directory is added to your shell path. Then you can just type: $ python3 /path/to/script.py That said, you can make Python Launcher work by changing the interpreter path to: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/bin/python3 but I discourage you from doing so. Another better GUI option is to launch IDLE.app and drag-and-drop files onto it in the dock or open them in its File menu.
