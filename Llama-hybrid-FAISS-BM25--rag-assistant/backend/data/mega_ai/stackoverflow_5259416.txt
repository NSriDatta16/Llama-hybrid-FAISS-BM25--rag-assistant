add two navigation controller to one Tab bar Item

I want 2 navigation Controller to be attached to one Tab bar item. Basically the idea is to have 2 views on a single tab Item and there should be a navigation bar to push and pop the screens. (same like settings application in iPad). edited====== It will look like on left hand side there is a View with its own navigation Controller and on right hand side there is another View with its own navigation controller(or some other UI) to achieve the Push Pop stuff. I know how to attach 1 navigation Controller to one Tab bar Item. Edited For ModalView Issue :- by implementing conmulligan code everything works property. But if I try to display some ModalViewController in lansdscape mode and when I try to close this ModalView the FirstViewController navigationbar becomes portrait(along with its View) and SecondViewController NavigationBar remains landscape(at it should be). This happens only in Device not in simulator. Below is my Code of presenting the ModalViewController. ModalTableViewController *modalTableViewController = [[ModalTableViewController alloc]initWithNibName:@"ModalTableViewController" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]; UINavigationController *localNavigationViewController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:modalTableViewController]; localNavigationViewController.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationFormSheet; [self presentModalViewController:localNavigationViewController animated:YES]; [modalTableViewController release]; [localNavigationViewController release]; For Dismising the ModalViewCntroller I do it as below:- [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; Waiting for your replies.
