Javascript + HTML5 localstorage

So I'm searching for a good crash course on localstorage and interacting with it in Javascript. I want to build a to-do list webapp with some extra functionality but it would be just for 1 user. I don't want to mess with php/mysql and have the server doing anything. Links to tutorials would be best :-D
