Netbeans GUI Builder with Java Swing; What's the easiest way to organize Widgets?

I'm developing a GUI application rapidly using a GUI buidler (Netbeans). I am frustrated with the Swing widgets... when I resize one the rest seem to "reorganize" themselves in the wrong places. What do you guys use to tame such chaos? I was thinking of tables.... but couldn't find any in the Netbeans Palette. Regards
