Use progressive enhancement. A lot of the HTML5 features (application cache, the custom form fields, the extra semantic tags) will do no harm in unsupported browsers (though you might need the HTML5 shiv from Remy Sharp), but give a bonus to users and spiders who can use them. Other features (video tag, database storage, web workers, geolocation) can use workarounds for compatibility with older browsers - the Modernizer library linked by Mark Pilgrim makes this very easy. If your app is usese Geodata, for example, you could use the browser-based geolocation where available and fallback to something IP-based.
