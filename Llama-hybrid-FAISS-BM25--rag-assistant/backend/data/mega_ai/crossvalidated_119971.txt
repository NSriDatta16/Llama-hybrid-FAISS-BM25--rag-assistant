If you are going to perform the standard decomposition method, then it's the question of how many data points make the sample of each seasonal index, calculated as a geometric mean. So, how many data do you consider sufficient for a reasonable estimate of the mean value? On the other hand, if you proceed with the ARIMA, it's the question of how many data points make a reasonable estimate of autocorrelation on the series reduced by a full season. So think about it in this way. I have been working with time series analyses, 50-60 sounds reasonable to me.
