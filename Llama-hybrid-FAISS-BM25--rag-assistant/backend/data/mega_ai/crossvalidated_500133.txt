When should you not use logistic regression GLM with a binary response variable?

I came across a set of data that does not seem to "flip" from 0 to 1 (binary response variable) when the predictor variable increase. Thus, this is the plot I got after plotting the variables. Should this not be used as a logistic generalized linear model with binomial family? Since my glm fitting, and subsequent curve plotting gave a non-sigmoidal curve, that looks like below: The curve came out non-sigmoidal unlike most, so did I not pick the right variables or should I not use this model to begin with?
