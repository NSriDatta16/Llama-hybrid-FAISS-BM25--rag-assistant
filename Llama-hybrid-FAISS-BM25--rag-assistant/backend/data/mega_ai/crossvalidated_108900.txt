Answer to question 1 You need to adjust for multiple comparisons if you care about the probability at which you will make a Type I error. A simple combination of metaphor/thought experiment may help: Imagine that you want to win the lottery. This lottery, strangely enough, gives you a 0.05 chance of winning (i.e. 1 in 20). M is the cost of the ticket in this lottery, meaning that your expected return for a single lottery call is M /20. Now even stranger, imagine that for unknown reasons, this cost, M , allows you to have as many lottery tickets as you want (or at least more than two). Thinking to yourself "the more you play, the more you win" you grab a bunch of tickets. Your expected return on a lottery call is no longer M /20, but something a fair bit larger. Now replace "winning the lottery" with "making a Type I error." If you do not care about errors, and you don't care about people repeatedly and mockingly directing your attention to a certain cartoon about jellybeans , then go ahead and do not adjust for multiple comparisons. The "same data" issue arises in family-wise error correction methods (e.g. Bonferroni, Holm-Sid√°k, etc.), since the concept of "family" is somewhat vague. However, the false discovery rate methods (e.g. Benjamini and Hochberg, Benjamini and Yeuketeli, etc.) have a property that their results are robust across different groups of inferences. Answer to question 2 Most pairwise tests require correction, although there are stylistic and disciplinary differences in what gets called a test. For example, some folks refer to "Bonferroni t tests" (which is a neat trick, since Bonferroni developed neither the t test, nor the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons :). I personally find this dissatisfying, as (1) I would like to make a distinction between conducting a group of statistical tests, and adjusting for multiple comparisons in order to effectively understand the inferences I am making, and (2) when someone comes along with a new pairwise test founded on a solid definition of $\alpha$, then I know I can perform adjustments for multiple comparisons.
