The singular vectors are closely related to principal components in PCA, and there is an exact correspondence if the data has unit variance and zero mean (or if you center and normalise the data before you apply SVD). I think understanding this connection will help you interpret your singular vectors. You'll find resources explaining both SVD and PCA and the connection between the two in many places on the web, such as: http://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-the-relation-between-PCA-and-SVD
