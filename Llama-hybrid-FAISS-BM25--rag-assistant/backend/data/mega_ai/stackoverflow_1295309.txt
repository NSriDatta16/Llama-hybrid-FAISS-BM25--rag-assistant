We use the ScriptDataBlock control from JsonFx to emit variables into the page itself. It acts like a dictionary where the key is the variable name (e.g. "MyNamespace.myVar") and the value is a normal C# value (including whole objects). The control emits appropriate namespace generation and type conversion to native JavaScript types. So in that sense it ends up not being "awkward" or "error prone": myDataBlock["MyApp.myVar"] = myObject; If you are doing an external file, then a generic .ashx handler is probably your best bet. It will be lighter than a whole aspx page and gives you pretty raw control over the output. Things you will want to be sure to do are to set the "Content-Type" response header to "text/javascript" (technically incorrect but most common MIME type) and for Internet Explorer which tends to not respect the Content-Type header, also set the "Content-Disposition" header to "inline;MyScriptName.js" so it knows the extension of the content. Also, if these really are "constants" rather than runtime calculated data, you will want to set the "Expires" header to some future date to encourage the browser to cache the result. That will further reduce your server requests. Edit: no DocType if you are creating JavaScript. DocType is only for markup.
