Why SHAP base/expected value is 0.5 for all my instances?

I am working on a binary classification using random forest model, neural networks in which am using SHAP to explain the model predictions. I followed the tutorial and wrote the below code to get the waterfall plot shown below. My dataset shape is 977,6 and 77:23 is class proportion row_to_show = 20 data_for_prediction = ord_test_t.iloc[row_to_show] # use 1 row of data here. Could use multiple rows if desired data_for_prediction_array = data_for_prediction.values.reshape(1, -1) rf_boruta.predict_proba(data_for_prediction_array) explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(rf_boruta) # Calculate Shap values shap_values = explainer.shap_values(data_for_prediction) shap.plots._waterfall.waterfall_legacy(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0],ord_test_t.iloc[row_to_show]) This generated the plot as shown below But one thing that I realized was that for all row indices my SHAP base value is 0.5 . Do you know what does that mean? Is this waterfall plot specific or data specific? My feature contribution adds on top of 0.5. sometimes my feature contribution takes it to 0.80 or sometimes, it ends up at 0.36. The point is expected value is always 0.5. But why is that? When I did explainer.model_output , I see that it gives raw as output. Does it mean it uses a scale of 0 to 1 and outputs 0.5 as random base value? Please note that this question is not code related question. Instead, I would like to know why does SHAP base value is always 0.5? update I found the below text from SHAP documentation here
