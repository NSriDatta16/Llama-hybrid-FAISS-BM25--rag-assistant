What econometrics method is better for the analysis?

I need some tips and tricks to figure out what would be an appropriate econometric method to find causal relationships between $x₁$ and $Y$ in my model $Y = α + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + \dotsm + βᵣxᵣ + ε$ where x₁ is the predictor variable, which addresses exclusion restriction and exogeneity criteria. However, x₁ doesn't change over time; the rest of the data are cross-sectional time series. Can I use Fixed Effects Panel Data Analysis?
