Create users based on a text file using Bash script?

So, I have a text file that is organized like this : : I need to create a new user for each line and put them into their groups. I am stuck with trying to set username into a variable to use with useradd . I have tried using cut but it needs a file name, I can't just pass it a line. Here is what I currently have: #! /bin/bash linesNum=1 while read line do echo name=$( cut -d ":" -f1 $( line ) ) ((lineNum+=1)) done Thanks for your help!
