Session isn't always available. For instance when XSS (cross-site-scripting) security settings on IE prevent the storage of third-party cookies. If your site is being called within an IFrame from a site that's not your DNS domain, your cookies are going to be blocked by default. No cookies = no session. Another example is where you have to pass control to another website that will make the callback to your site as a pure URL, not a post. In this case you have to store your session parameters in a querystring parameter, something that's tough to do given the 4k size constraint and URL encoding, not to mention encryption, etc. The issue is that most of the built-in serialisation methods are pretty verbose, thus one has to resort to a roll-your-own method, probably using reflection. Another reason for not using sessions is simply to give a better user experience; sessions get cleared after N minutes and when the server restarts. OK, in this case a viewstate is preferable, but sometimes it's not possible to use a form. OK, one could rely on JavaScript to do a postback, but again, that's not always possible. These are the problems I'm currently coding around.
