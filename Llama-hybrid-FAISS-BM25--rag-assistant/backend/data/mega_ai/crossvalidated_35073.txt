I may have mentioned this on the site once before. I will try to find a link to a post where I discussed this. Around 1977 when I was a graduate student at Stanford we had a Fisher seminar that I enrolled in. A number of Stanford professors and visitors participated including Brad Efron and visitors Seymour Geisser and David Hinkley. Jimmie Savage had just at that time published an article with the title "On Rereading R. A. Fisher" in Annal of Statistics I think. Since you are so interested in Fisher I recommend you find and read this paper. Motivated by the paper the seminar was designed to reread many of Fisher's famous papers. My assignment was the article on the Behrens-Fisher problem. My feeling is that Fisher was vain and stubborn but never foolish. He had great geometric intuition and at times had difficulty communicating with others. He had a very cordial relationship with Gosset but harsh disagreements with Karl Pearson (maximum likelihood vs method of moments) and with Neyman and Egon Pearson (significance testing via fiducial inference vs the Neyman-Pearson approach to hypothesis testing). Although the fiducial argument is generally considered to be Fisher's only big flaw and has been discredited, the approach is not totally dead and there has been new research in it in recent years. I think that fiducial inference was Fisher's way to try to be an "objective Bayesian". I am sure he thought long and hard about the statistical foundations. He didn't accept the Bayesian approach but also did not see the idea of basing inference on considering the possible samples that you didn't draw as making sense either. He believed that inference should be based only on the data at hand. This idea is a lot like Bayesian inference in that the Bayesians draw inference based soley on the data (the likelihood) and the parameters (the prior distribution). Fisher in my view was thinking a lot like Jeffreys except that he wanted inference to be based on the likelihood and wanted to dispense with the prior altogether. That is what led to fiducial inference. A Link to the Savage article The Biography by Fisher's daughter Joan Fisher Box R A Fisher An Appreciation, Hinkley and Feinberg editors A book by Erich Lehmann about Fisher and Neyman and the birth of Classical Statistics This is a link to an earlier post that I commented on that you also posted. Behrensâ€“Fisher problem In conclusion I think I need to address your short question. If the statement you quoted "Fisher approximated the distribution of this by ignoring the random variation of the relative sizes of the standard deviations" is what you are referring to I think that is totally false. Fisher never ignored variation. I reiterate that I think the fiducial argument was grounded in the idea that the observed data and the likelihood function should be the basis of inference and not the other samples that you could have gotten from the population distribution. So I would side with you on this one. With respect to Bartlett as I recall from my study of this so many years ago, they also had heated debates on this and Bartlett made a good case and held his own in the debate.
