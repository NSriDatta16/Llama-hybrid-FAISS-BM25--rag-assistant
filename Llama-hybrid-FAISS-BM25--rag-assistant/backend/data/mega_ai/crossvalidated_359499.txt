The problem of finding shortest paths on graphs is well-studied . I don't think it's too important to know whether or not your method is better than random because there are a number of well-studied algorithms that solve (some specific) graph traversal problems quite well. I think the more relevant comparison is to ask wether your method is better (1) for some special graph, such as a planar or chromatic graph or (2) for graphs of a certain size or density or number of edges. Note that better can mean any number of things: lower working memory requirements, lower computational complexity, better worst-case behavior, better average behavior.
