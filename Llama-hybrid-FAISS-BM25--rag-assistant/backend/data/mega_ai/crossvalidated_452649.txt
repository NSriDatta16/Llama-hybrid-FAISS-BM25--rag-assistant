Should I adjust the number of epochs if it was determined using cross-validation?

I use 2-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal number of epochs to train a neural network. Lets assume this number is 100 epochs. As a next step, I want to train the network using the full data set. Should I adjust the number of epochs to 50 epochs or should I train it for 100 epochs? If I train it for 100 epochs the network effectively sees double the number of observations that it saw during cross-validation, which does not feel right to me. What do you think?
