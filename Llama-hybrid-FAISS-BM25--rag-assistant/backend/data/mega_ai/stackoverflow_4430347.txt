The original assumption that value types live "on the stack" is not correct. However, The Truth About Value Types has been revealed by Eric Lippert: It is usually stated incorrectly : the statement should be "value types can be stored on the stack", instead of the more common "value types are always stored on the stack". It is almost always irrelevant . We've worked hard to make a managed environment where the distinctions between different kinds of storage are hidden from the user. Unlike some languages, in which you must know whether a particular storage is on the stack or the heap for correctness reasons. It is incomplete. What about references ? References are neither value types nor instances of reference types , but they are values. They've got to be stored somewhere. Do they go on the stack or the heap? Why does no one ever talk about them? Just because they don't have a type in the C# type system is no reason to ignore them.
