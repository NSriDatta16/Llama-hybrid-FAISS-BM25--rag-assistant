Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) for classification analysis of gene expression data

I am interested in applying Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) for classification analysis of gene expression data. I am relatively new to R (and Bioconductor packages) and I am unable to find some code or vignette that I can use to learn from. I will be thankful if someone can point me in a good direction.
