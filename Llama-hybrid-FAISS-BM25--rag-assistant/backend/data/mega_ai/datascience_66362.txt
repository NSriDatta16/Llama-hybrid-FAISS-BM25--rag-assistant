Probability of the recipient to open the email

I am trying to build a model using logistic regression, where my dependent variable is y=1 if the mail was opened, y=0 if it was not. I have data approximately 10 records (10 rows) for every recipient who got an email and want to calculate the probability of opening the email per user. However, do not know how to edit the dataset based on this requirement. Because the results (probabilities) now are like for every row (every mail) and I want it for every recipient. ID is an ID of the recipient(see the screenshot) If I counted the number of openings, I would lose binary operator, what is necessary for logistic regression. Got any ideas?
