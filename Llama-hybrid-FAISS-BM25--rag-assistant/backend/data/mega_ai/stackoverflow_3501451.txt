SQLite is extremely slow in Samsung Galaxy GT-I9000

I am having problem with performance of SQLite database in Android application in Samsung Galaxy GT-I9000 device. The database contains 10 tables with 3 - 8 columns each. As soon as a database file gains about 400 KB update/instert queries need much more time to execute - 2 seconds! In comparision to other devices (HTC Magic, HTC Desire) update/insert queries take about 40 msec ! The database file is located in application data directory. Moving database file to sd card increases the speed significantly. Periodic ANALYZE and VACUUM commands do not affect the speed. As well as PRAGMA cache_size command. Do you have any ideas how to improve the performance? Any idea is welcome except for keeping the database in sd card or splitting the database into many files containing one table each.
