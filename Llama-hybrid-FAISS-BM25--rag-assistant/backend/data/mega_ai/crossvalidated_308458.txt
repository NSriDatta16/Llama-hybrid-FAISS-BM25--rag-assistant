Your approach is as silly as everyone else's. Look at what the FRB is doing to forecast losses for CCAR Banks, their approach is described in: Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test 2016: Supervisory Stress Test Methodology and Results, June 2016 . Read “Operational Risk Model Enhancement” section in Box 1 and “Losses Related to Operational-Risk Events” Section in Appendix B. They using forecast combination approach where they average outputs of historical simulation and panel regression on macroeconomic variables. The historical simulation is essentially a bootstrapping variation of LDA . It assumes that the losses are compound random variables, such as Poisson compound . They don't call it LDA anymore, because the term is out of favor in US banking supervision. The main difference with LDA is that instead of modeling the severity they bootstrap it from actual losses in the event database. In other words each loss in the compound Poisson is a random draw from the actual event losses observed historically. The regression part is a simple panel regression on a bunch of variables such as firm characteristics and macroeconomy. You can get a flavor of the model from the FRB paper: U.S. Banking Sector Operational Losses and the Macroeconomic Environment
