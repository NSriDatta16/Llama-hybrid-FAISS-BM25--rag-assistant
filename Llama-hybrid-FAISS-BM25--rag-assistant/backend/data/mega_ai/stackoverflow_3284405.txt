Hmm, if you have a list that isn't too massive you might just do it naively like: (This assumes you have a model Company which has a name attribute) @grouped = {} Company.all.each do |company| letter = company.name.slice(0,1).upcase @grouped[letter] ||= [] @grouped[letter] And now you can, in your view, do something such as: Update : If you want to extend the logic on what the 'letter' is, you would probably move the logic into the model, eg: class Company # ... code def initial # find a number at the start of the string if it exists m = self.name.match(/^\d+/) return m[0] if m # or return the first letter upcased otherwise return self.name.slice( 0, 1 ).upcase end end
