Allocators allocate the data storage of the container, not the container data members, which are allocated as normal. This must be the case, or you would not be able to create the vector using new or on the stack. This is clearest for a node based container like a list - the list nodes are allocated by the allocator, but the other data members, including the pointers to the first and last nodes (if implemented that way) are allocated normally.
