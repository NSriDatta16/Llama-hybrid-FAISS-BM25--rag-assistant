In addition to Charles Bailey's answer , you might want to add the -C parameter to the commands. Otherwise file renames count as lots of additions and removals (as many as the file has lines), even if the file content was not modified. To illustrate, here is a commit with lots of files being moved around from one of my projects, when using the git log --oneline --shortstat command: 9052459 Reorganized project structure 43 files changed, 1049 insertions(+), 1000 deletions(-) And here the same commit using the git log --oneline --shortstat -C command which detects file copies and renames: 9052459 Reorganized project structure 27 files changed, 134 insertions(+), 85 deletions(-) In my opinion the latter gives a more realistic view of how much impact a person has had on the project, because renaming a file is a much smaller operation than writing the file from scratch.
