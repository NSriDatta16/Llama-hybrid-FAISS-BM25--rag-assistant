Predicting a Markov chain next state using previously predicted states

Suppose we have a Markov chain with two states A and B . This associated transition matrix is: \begin{equation} P_{mc}= \begin{pmatrix} 0.3 & 0.7\\ 0.6 & 0.4 \end{pmatrix} \end{equation} This matrix is empirical and computed from a set of observations: e.g : A->B->A->A->A->B->A->A->B->B->A->B->B->A->B->A->B->A->B->B->B My question is, After predicting a new state ( B or A ) how accurate is it to generate a new transition matrix P_mc based on the new sequence and is there any theoretical limits to doing this?
