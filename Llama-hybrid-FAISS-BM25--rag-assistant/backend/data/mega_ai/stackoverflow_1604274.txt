The setup looks good. And yes, passive mode is the default (see WAGON-143 ). That said, according to the trace ( java.lang.AbstractMethodError is thrown when something tries to call an abstract method), it's obvious that your wagon isn't compatible with your version of maven. Wagon madness... It's surely not the best place but this is actually documented in the Guide to using Extenstions (pay a special attention to the " Note " at the bottom): Extensions are used to enable Wagon providers, used for the transport of artifact between repositories, and plug-ins which provide lifecycle enhancements. Wagon providers ... org.apache.maven.wagon wagon-ftp 1.0-beta-2 ... Note: Wagon 1.0-beta-3+ requires Maven 2.1.0 or above. For Maven 2.0.10 and earlier, use Wagon 1.0-beta-2. EDIT: About the new error, the maven deploy plugin FAQ describes something very similar: If you are using the deploy:deploy-file goal and encounter this error: "Error deploying artifact: Unsupported Protocol: 'ftp': Cannot find wagon which supports the requested protocol: ftp" Then you need to place the appropriate wagon provider in your %M2_HOME%/lib . In this case the provider needed is ftp, so we have to place the wagon-ftp jar in the lib directory of your Maven 2 installation. If the error description is something like this: "Error deploying artifact: Unsupported Protocol: 'ftp': Cannot find wagon which supports the requested protocol: ftp org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTP" Then you need to place the commons-net jar in %M2_HOME%/lib . I don't get why one would have to do that but try to put wagon-ftp-1.0-beta-2.jar in %M2_HOME%/lib . EDIT2: I've read the question again and it looks like you did install a "sources" jar which, of course, doesn't contain the required classes for the runtime. Before following the advice above, try to put wagon-ftp-1.0-beta-2.jar in your repository (and not wagon-ftp-1.0-beta-2-sources.jar ).
