PHP: How to get a Date when a person reach to a specific age?

I am working on task in which dates are involved. I have a person's age in months+days . Now I want to get a date when this person reach to a specific age in months. For example: A person is 250 months and 15 days old on 2010-1-25. On which date this person will become 300 months old? Function Signature may be: function getReqDate( $startDate, $currAgeMonths, $currAgeDays, $reqAgeMonths ) { //return date }
