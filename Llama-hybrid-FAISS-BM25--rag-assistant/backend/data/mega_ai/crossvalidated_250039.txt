coverage probability vs. rejection rate

I am trying to calculate the coverage probability and rejection rates for confidence intervals based on the ttest. I have the null hypothesis $H_0 = 0$ and $H_a \neq 0$ I am having a hard time understanding the difference between rejection rate and coverage probability here. Is the rejection rate equivalent to the number of confidence intervals that contain 0? I KNOW that my population has a mean of 0. Thank you!
