AdvancedDataGrid dynamic text Value Coloring - ItemRenderer problem

In my AdvancedDataGrid, I am adding dynamic values to cells by dragging a cell value to other cells. While copying, I am setting the value to listData and setting the Red color to the value in ItemRenderer. Everything is working fine, but when I scroll down/up, the values remains in the cells where thay are supposed to be(as I am setting to listData) but the coloring behaves wierd(as I am trying to set the color in ItemRenderer). I don't want to store the color of the value, but I should be able to see the dynamically created values in Red color. Is there a way, I can do this? Do I need to set the color to actual dataprovider object and then check in ItemRenderer? Can anyone help me with this? public class CustomItemRenderer extends AdvancedDataGridItemRenderer { private var _isDynamicValue:Boolean; .... .... //_isDynamicValue is set to true if the value is dynamic if(_isDynamicValue && listData.label) { setStyle("color", 0xFF0000); setStyle("fontWeight", "bold"); } else { setStyle("color", 0x000000); }
