When the capture group is annotated with a quantifier [ie: (foo)*] then you will only get the last match. If you wanted to get all of them then you need to quantifier inside the capture and then you will have to manually parse out the values. As big a fan as I am of regex, I don't think it's appropriate here for any number of reasons... even if you weren't ultimately doing NLP. How to fix: (?:(\s)?,(\s)?(\w+?))* Well, the quantifier basically covers the whole regex in that case and you might as well use Matcher.find() to step through each match. Also, I'm curious why you have capture groups for the whitespace. If all you are trying to do is find a comma-separated set of words then that's something like: \w+(?:\s*,\s*\w+)* Then don't bother with capture groups and just split the whole match. And for anything more complicated re: NLP, GATE is a pretty powerful tool. The learning curve is steep at times but you have a whole industry of science-guys to draw from: http://gate.ac.uk/
