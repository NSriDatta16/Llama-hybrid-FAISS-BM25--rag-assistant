div column layout, stretchable column with min-width

I'm trying to code this 2 column div layout and I can't think of a way to do what I want... Here is the code: #prospectDetailMainWrapper div{ border:1px solid purple; } #leftPanel{ height:600px; padding-right:266px; } #rightPanel{ height:600px; position:absolute; right:0; top:103px; width:265px; } #prospectDetailMainWrapper .clear{ height: 0; font-size: 1px; margin: 0; padding: 0; line-height: 0; clear: both; } So what I'm trying to to is to have the rightPanel with a fixed width and the leftPanel to stretch, and that is working right now... but the tricky part is that I want the rightPanel to not show when the browser window gets smaller... so if I'm dragging the browser window to make it smaller, once the leftPanel reaches a certain min-width I wan't the rightPanel to start hiding. The reason is that if my users have a small monitor I wanna make sure they can the the entire leftPanel.
