I assume that you are using PHP --- md5() function, and $ preceded variables --- then, you can try looking this article Shadow Password HOWTO Specially the 11th paragraph. Also, you are afraid of using message digest algorithms, you can try real cipher algorithms, such as the ones provided by the mcrypt module, or more stronger message digest algorithms, such as the ones that provide the mhash module (sha1, sha256, and others). I think that stronger message digest algorithm are a must. It's known that MD5 and SHA1 are having collision problems.
