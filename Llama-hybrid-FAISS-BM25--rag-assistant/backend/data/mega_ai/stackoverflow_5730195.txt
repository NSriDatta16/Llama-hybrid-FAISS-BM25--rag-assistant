Allright, I found it. I had to reinstall iTunes and the "Mobile Device Service", as shown in here , and now crash logs are visible again. Edit: as the page fell, here are the steps from the archive.org page. Note that those steps worked on Mac Os X 10.6, but may be different on current versions. If the issue persists, follow these steps to remove and reinstall the Apple Mobile Device Service on Mac OS X. You'll need to authenticate with an administrator account and password to complete these steps. Disconnect your device from your Mac. In the Finder, locate iTunes in the Applications folder and drag it to the Trash. Move the iTunes icon to the Trash. Choose Go > Go to Folder . Enter /System/Library/Extensions and click Go. Locate the file AppleMobileDevice.text and drag it to the Trash. Choose Go > Go to Folder . Enter /Library/Receipts/ and click Go. Locate the file AppleMobileDeviceSupport.pkg and drag it to the Trash. If prompted, authenticate with the administrator password. Note: This file may not be present in Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard; skip to the next step if this is the case. Restart the computer. Choose Finder > Empty Trash and restart the computer. Download and install the current version of iTunes. Connect your device to the Mac again and open iTunes
