Predicting rare events using machine learning algorithms in R

I am working on a dataset in which independent variables have 80 % missing values. The dependent variable contains 0 and 1 only (binary class) in which 0.02% are "1" and rest 99.98 % are "0". The observations of dependent variable and independent variable varies with respect to time and with respect to type of a indicator variable. Since the events are very rare, I am not getting any good result with SVM one- classification, RandomForest and GBM in R. What should be the best strategy to deal with such kind of dataset in order to predict the minority class accurately ? Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
