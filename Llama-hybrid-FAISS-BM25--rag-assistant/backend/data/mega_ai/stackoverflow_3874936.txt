If you're already communicating with other computers using IP, the packets will already be announcing a return address that the far end can use to determine where its messages should go. Attempting to deduce the right interface address to use and embedding it in a message isn't a good idea for four reasons (probably more). First, you're going to end up reimplementing all of the logic your OS does to figure out how to route outbound packets. Second, if the routing table changes between the time you make that decision and the time you actually need to connect to the other computers and tell them where to send traffic, you'll be sending them the wrong address. Third, the destination computers may not always be on the same subnet, in which case none of the interfaces will match. Fourth, if the packets undergo any form of rewriting (e.g., NAT) between you and the destination, the software doing it will have no idea that it needs to dive into your packets and the systems at the far end won't be using the right address.
