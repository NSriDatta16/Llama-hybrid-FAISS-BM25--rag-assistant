There are no extensions that allows you to ignore a file that is already tracked by Mercurial. How ever, there are few approaches which you can follow. As Ry4an suggest , block commits that include the file and then do a explicit hg commit file1, file2, ... Another elegant approach is to tell the commit method to ignore certain types of file while committing files. I like this approach better. hg commit --help ....... -X --exclude PATTERN [+] exclude names matching the given patterns Example: say I have two files a.py, b.py in my repo. I have changed them both. hgt $ hg status M a.py M b.py hgt $ hg commit -X a.py -m "Added new line to b.py" hgt $ hg status M a.py
