What is the difference between `new` and `new()` for a struct in C/C++?

Possible Duplicate: Do the parentheses after the type name make a difference with new? In some code, I recently saw a struct like this: typedef struct MyStruct { int numberOne; int numberTwo; } MYSTRUCT; Later, I tried instantiating one of these structs using MyStruct *pStruct = new MyStruct(); which worked fine with Visual Studio 2010, but failed with an obscure linker error on a different compiler. It took a while until we found out that omitting the braces like this MyStruct *pStruct = new MyStruct; solved the issue. So, what exactly is the difference between these two invocations and which one is the right one to use?
