Video classification is nothing but when we send each frame of video which is a image and classify it individually and independently to predict the largest probable outcome. For the presented use case it seems that you want the result to be real time then we need to treat it as video classification problem. What we can do is that create a dataset of type of products in the factory or a open source dataset. Train Resnet model on this dataset. Run the trained model on each grabbed frame of the video and then average all the individual probabilities to get the final probabilities vector. This is a single frame cnn architecture for video classification and would work best for this use case and ther Refer: Video Classification , Video classification Tutorial
