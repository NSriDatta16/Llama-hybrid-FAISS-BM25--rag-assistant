Interpretation of coefficient of logistic regression in case of one hot encoding

When we use dummy encoding in logistic regression, then we can interpret coefficients as log of ratio of odds (relative to some base value). I am curious what is interpretation of coefficients when we use one hot encoding? Update: by dummy encoding I mean "reference level coding" and by one hot encoding I mean "level means coding" as stated by gung in the following post proper teminology
