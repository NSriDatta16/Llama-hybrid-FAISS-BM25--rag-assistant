notations in the Wilks' famous paper

I'm reading the famous paper where Wilks' theorem was first introduced. In the last sentence of the first paragraph, the author says that A set $\omega$ of simple hypotheses is specified by taking all simple hypotheses of the set $\Omega$ for which $\theta_i = \theta_{0i}, i = m+1, m+2, ... , h$ . However, the variables $\theta_{0i}$ and $m$ have not been defined in the paper. How can we interpret those?
