I'd second the Webform module. Create a really simple webform with name and email (results can be emailed or stored automatically in the DB, and can be exported easily in several formats). Then check out the Webform Block module to put that webform in a block and place wherever you need it on your site. No custom coding required! Here is an excerpt from the Webform Block project page: Allows embedding a webform node into a block which can be positioned in any block region (theme space permitting). Handles redirecting back to the current page on validation errors. A good use for this is to add a site wide contact form inline on your pages, such as in the footer or sidebar. Multiple webforms can appear on the same page. The contents of the block is simply a node, so theme work can be done in the node-webform.tpl.php file as usual.
