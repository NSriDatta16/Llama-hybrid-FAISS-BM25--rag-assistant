Touches in UIScrollView

I've got a view of size 320x480 and in it an UIScrollView that takes all the place in my view. The scroll view can scroll only in horizontal direction and I want to implement my own method for handling vertical swipes. UIScrollView seems not to respond to touchesBegan and to touchesMoved. What is the solution to my problem? How can I get touches that were made on UIScrollView? Thank you in advance.
