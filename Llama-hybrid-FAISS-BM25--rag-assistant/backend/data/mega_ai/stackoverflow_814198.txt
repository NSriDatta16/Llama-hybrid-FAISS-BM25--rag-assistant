This question is VERY much a repeat of this question so I'll quote my answer to that one here. I came up with a different solution that didn't require me to roll my own view engine. Basically, I wanted to keep MVC as "Convention" driven as possible, but I still wanted to organize all of my "Admin" views under the ~/Views/Admin folder. Example: ~/Views/Admin/User/ ~/Views/Admin/News/ ~/Views/Admin/Blog/ My solution was to create a new base class for my specific admin controllers and "force" the path to the view for that controller. I have a blog post and sample code here: Organize your views in ASP.Net MVC
