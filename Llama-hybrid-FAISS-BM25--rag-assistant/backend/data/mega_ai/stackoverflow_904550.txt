What can be the reason that my UIImageView subclass doesn't receive any touch events?

I have made sure that all superviews of my customized UIImageView and the UIImageView itself have userInteractionEnabled = YES; Also in the nib all views and subviews have userInteractionEnabled = YES; But for some reason, these get never called when I click on the UIImageView: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"check!"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"other check"); } I have an UIView that acts as an grouping for some subviews. Can that be a problem?
