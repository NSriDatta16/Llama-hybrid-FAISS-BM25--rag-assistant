Looks like I posted a little too soon. Here is what I was able to come up with (but I'd be open to a more elegant way to do this): My static HTML file with my menu looks like so: Manage Events I was able to register the mouse down event and listen for it by assigning it to that element. The main downside I see is that I have to do this for every menu item. Here is some code I came up with: Element e = RootPanel.get("manage_events").getElement(); DOM.sinkEvents(e, com.google.gwt.user.client.Event.ONMOUSEDOWN); DOM.setEventListener(e, new EventListener() { @Override public void onBrowserEvent(com.google.gwt.user.client.Event event) { Log.debug("test"); } });
