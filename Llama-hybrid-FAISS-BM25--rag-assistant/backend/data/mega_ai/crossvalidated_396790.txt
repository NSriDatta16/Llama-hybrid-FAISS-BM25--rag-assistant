Decomposition of time series vs ARIMA model

I am new to time series analysis, and I amm trying to understand the concepts behind this analysis. But I am still confused about the methods used to do such analyss, and what is the difference between the decomposition of time series or using an ARIMA model. Thank you in advance.
