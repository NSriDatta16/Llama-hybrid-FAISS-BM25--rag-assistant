Very easy. In Notes you can setup any database to be a target for email. It gets its own eMail ID (e.g. productupdates@acme.com). Then you write an agent that runs on "when new eMail arrives". The new documents are in the session.currentdatabase.unprocesseddocuments collection. Your email must of course contain something that allows you to figure out what document to update. Notes uses internally the NotesDocumentUniqueID as primary key, but I guess you would rather pick a business field. Using NotesMimeEntry you can access HTML formatted content in your email in case you emailed a form or so.
