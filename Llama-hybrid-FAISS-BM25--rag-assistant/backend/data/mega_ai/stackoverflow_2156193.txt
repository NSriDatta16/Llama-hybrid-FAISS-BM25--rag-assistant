I tend to find grouping of related methods far more useful when reading someone else's source code, than some arbitrary pseudo-order such as alphabetical. Although the book is specifically about Java, Uncle Bob 's Clean Code contains some excellent general principles for readability in OO classes. In particular, he uses the metaphor of a well-written newspaper article, with a headline at the top followed by a synopsis paragraph and then increasing detail as you read further down the article. By aiming for a similar top-down structure in your classes, it makes the task of reading or understanding your code much easier for others.
