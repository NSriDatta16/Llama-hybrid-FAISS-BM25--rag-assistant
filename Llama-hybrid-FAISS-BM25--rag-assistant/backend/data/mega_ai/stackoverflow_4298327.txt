First of all, not all browsers handle local files equally, indeed, not all computers will be running windows or have a C: drive. Secondly, you don't have much control over a user's cache. Cached pages are usually handled by the browser automatically. You can use headers to specify how a browser ought to cache files, but it's not even required to do so. You can read the W3C recs on caching for more information. It's unclear what you're trying to do here, but it sounds like it might make more sense for you to use HTML5 local storage or offline files than trying to mess around with their file system directly. The security model of most browsers is such that web apps don't interact with local files, which may be why it's not working for you with your current setup. Dive Into HTML5 has a good overview of HTML5 local storage and offline pages . Edited based on comment below: Most browsers' security settings won't let a page on a website access files stored locally. Only locally saved files can link to other locally saved files. Therefore, if the page with a link is on a website, your link won't work. Try creating a link to your file from another locally stored file and see if that works.
