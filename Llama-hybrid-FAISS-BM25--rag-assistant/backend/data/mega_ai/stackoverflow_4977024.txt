For clients, you build the installer (ClickOnce or SetupProject) which handles the required components (.NET 4.0, PIAs). VSTO 2010 does the job of embedding the PIAs into the installer DLLs. VSTO for 2007 did not allow for this and always required the installation of the PIA (primary interop assemblies) which overwrote any existing PIA versions. VSTO 2010 has many fixes for memory leaks and speed issues. VSTO 2010 is also backwards compatible with Office 2007.
