AFAIK, streaming video is not loaded sequentially, although the protocol tries it. It is possible that a part is not yet completely downloaded, while on average, most of the video is. Halting the moving download bar would give the feeling that nothing happens. Another possibility, but I don't know the protocol well enough to be certain, is that a particular package wasn't received completely, but the application thinks it did. Upon trying to execute that part of the stream, the video halts while it loads the missing bits.
