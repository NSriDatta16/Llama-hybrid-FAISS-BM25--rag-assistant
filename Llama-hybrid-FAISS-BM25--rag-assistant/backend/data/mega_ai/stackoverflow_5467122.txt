There is: DefaultIfEmpty . I 'm not sure about what your DbVersions and DbRatings are and which collection exactly has zero items, but this is the idea: var emptyCollection = new List (); var average = emptyCollection.DefaultIfEmpty(0).Average(); Update: (repeating what's said in the comments below to increase visibility) If you find yourself needing to use DefaultIfEmpty on a collection of class type, remember that you can change the LINQ query to project before aggregating. For example: class Item { public int Value { get; set; } } var list = new List (); var avg = list.Average(item => item.Value); If you don't want to/can not construct a default Item with Value equal to 0, you can project to a collection of int s first and then supply a default: var avg = list.Select(item => item.Value).DefaultIfEmpty(0).Average();
