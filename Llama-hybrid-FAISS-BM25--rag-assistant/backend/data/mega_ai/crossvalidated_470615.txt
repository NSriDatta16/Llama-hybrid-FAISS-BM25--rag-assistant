Machine learning algorithm for finding most similar entries in dataset

I have a pandas Dataframe, which has data as structured below. s.hp s.attack s.defense s.speed s.special_attack s.special_defense p.name 0 39 52 43 65 60 50 charmander 1 40 45 40 56 35 35 pidgey 2 83 80 75 101 70 70 pidgeot 3 65 90 65 100 61 61 fearow 4 60 95 69 80 65 79 arbok ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 320 68 64 60 117 111 60 salazzle-totem 321 60 60 100 60 60 100 minior-violet-meteor 322 55 90 80 96 50 105 mimikyu-busted 323 55 90 80 96 50 105 mimikyu-totem-busted 324 75 110 125 85 100 105 kommo-o-totem I'm looking for a simple machine learning algorithm or neural network structure. That can help me find the most similar pokemon, given a certain pokemon. This would mean, that the p.name would be the label, and each of the other columns would be the features. In essence, I would like to have the functionality so that I can find the most similar pokemon, based on a given name. I have thought about PCA just to find similarities or use KNN. But I have not found an ML algorithm, that can allow me to predict on the same dataset. Any suggestions?
