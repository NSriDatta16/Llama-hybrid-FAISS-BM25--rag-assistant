I was facing the same problem when running the Random Forest code. I wonder if this problem is already solved or not, but I found this source of the latest sklearn's glossary of Random Forest ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#:~:text=value%20may%20be%3A-,None%20(default),-Use%20the%20global ). Based on the source, we should set the "random_state" parameter (0 or 42)in order to make the model reproducible. Otherwise, the random_state will be set as None and the output models will always be different.
