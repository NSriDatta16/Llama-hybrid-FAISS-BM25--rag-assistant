What's the best agile toolchain for Qt?

I'm curious if anyone else has a good recommendation for a Qt friendly toolchain. We're currently evaluating using The following: Bug/Issue Tracking - Atlassian JIRA (already in use) IDE - Qt Creator (already in use) Code Coverage - gcov (are there easy ways to integrate this into the dev/CI environment?) Unit Testing - QTestLib and Boost Test Code Review - Either Atlassian Crucible (expensive) or ReviewBoard (free) Nightly build/check-in build - Hudson, CruisControl or Atlassian Bamboo. Any advice? Code Analysis/Style Checker - Vera++? CppCheck? Any suggestions? Source Code monitoring - Atlassian Fisheye (only if we go with Crucible), ViewVC. Any advice? Are there any other tools I should take a look at? Thanks!
