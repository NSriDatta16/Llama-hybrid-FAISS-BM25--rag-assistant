How do I determine if a neural network can be computed by a network that contains only an input layer and an output layer?

I have a homework problem where the neural network below is given with its description. We have been asked "Can the functions that the above network computes also be computed by a network that contains only an input layer and an output layer that has a single node?" If we can, we're to provide the network, weights, and activation function. And if not, we have to explain why. I am very unsure how to approach this problem as I am not that strong with neural networks. Any starting point would be very helpful. Thanks in advance.
