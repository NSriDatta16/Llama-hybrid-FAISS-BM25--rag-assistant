When you add something to a base class like Control that has such a huge number of descendents, it's going to get inherited by everything whether it makes sense or not (e.g. would many programmers care that a radio button is starting to get resized?). Every method, property and event you add makes an API that much more complicated. Now there are plenty of other examples of things in Control that don't make sense for every child (e.g. a Leave event on a Label control), but that's part of the contradictory morass that is Forms. The attached property system used in WPF is much more elegant.
