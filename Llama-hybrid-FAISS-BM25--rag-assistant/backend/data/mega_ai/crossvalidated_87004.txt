Found the solution, Each new measurement is a signal with a given size - 3500 Samples. Hence, it is a point in $ {R}^{3500} $. The data matrix has its signal in its rows. Using the SVD and according to the PCA, the column of the Matrix $ V $ spans this base (The rows of the data matrix) in a manner that each direction maximize the variance along that direction. Hence the columns of the matrix $ V $ should be selected according to the Singular Values (To keep the error minimal, take the 16 columns which relates to the 16 most significant Singular values). If the number of taken vectors is less than 3500, they don't span the whole space, hence new measurements doesn't necessarily lie in this "Base / Dictionary" Range Space (Space which is spanned by its columns). Hence the LS method should be used - $ \hat{V} = V(:, 1:K) $ -> The way to calculate the coefficients of the new measurement is $ {\left( {\hat{V}}^{H} \hat{V} \right )}^{-1} {\hat{V}}^{H} {x}_{new} $. By the way, the coefficients of $ {X}_{Data} $ are given by $ U D $. It can be shown by $ {X}_{Data} = U D {V}^{H} $. Since $ V $ spans the whole space, no need for the LS solution and multiplying by $ {V}^{H} $ is enough. So $ {X}_{Data} V = U D $ -> $ {F}^{H} = UD $.
