Making a list through vlookup in Microsoft Excel?

I have a table in excel with three columns: name, organization, contract expiring (YES/NO). I have 20 other sheets, one for each organization. On each sheet, I want the names of the people whose contracts are expiring from that company. I can do a vlookup for the first one listed, but I need the full list for each organization. Any suggestions?
