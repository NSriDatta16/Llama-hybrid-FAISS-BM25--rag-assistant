This picture from Lambert is admittedly bad and confusing. It represents on the same graph three probability densities for three different random variables, $$\theta\,,\quad\zeta=\theta^2\,,\text{ and }\xi=\theta^{10}$$ This means that the value $0.4$ on the first axis leads to the density at $\theta=0.4$ for the black flat line and to the density at $\zeta=0,4$ , i.e. at $\theta=\sqrt{0.4}$ , for the red curve and to the density at $\xi=0.4$ , i.e. $\theta={0.4}^{1/10}$ for the black dashed curve. There is no reason to plot them together! The three curves $$f_1(\theta)=\mathbb I_{(0,1)}(\theta)\,,\quad f_2(\zeta)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\xi}}\mathbb I_{(0,1)}(\zeta)\,,\quad f_3(\xi)=\frac{\xi^{-9/10}}{10}\mathbb I_{(0,1)}(\xi)$$ obtained by the change of variable formula should have instead been plotted on different graphs.
