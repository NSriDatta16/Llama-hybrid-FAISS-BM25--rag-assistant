Why aren't there two integrals in 'Model evidence' in 'Bayesian linear regression'?

From the Wikipedia article on Bayesian Linear Regression : Model complexity is already taken into account by the model evidence, because it marginalizes out the parameters by integrating $p(\mathbf{y},\boldsymbol\beta,\sigma|\mathbf{X})$ over all possible values of $\boldsymbol\beta$ and $\sigma$. $$p(\mathbf{y}|m)=\int p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{X},\boldsymbol\beta,\sigma)\, p(\boldsymbol\beta,\sigma)\, d\boldsymbol\beta\, d\sigma$$ Should there be two integrals instead of just one? Why or why not?
