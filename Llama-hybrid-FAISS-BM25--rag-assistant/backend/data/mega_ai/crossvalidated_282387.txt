Machine Learning: Feature Comparison

I am working on a machine learning algorithm which performs a binary classification. I have different features, and I would like to know which of them are better for the classification, I mean what of them really make a difference between classes and what of them are not important. I have thought of computing the normal distribution of every feature in class A and B and getting the overlap between them. If they have a big area in common the feature is not good. I have also heard about Principal Component Analysis. I do not know what is the best way of determining which are the best features , so I ask or your help. Thanks a lot!!!!
