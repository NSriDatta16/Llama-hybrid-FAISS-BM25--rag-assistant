Using WiX to package an installer with many files

I have a WiX 3 project that has hundreds of files, and I can't seem to figure out how to include them all using a wildcard. I have tried this: heat.exe" dir ".\!Build" -gg -ke -template:fragment -out "Files.wxs" This produces a fragment .wxs file, but I'm not sure what to do with it. Any help would be much appreciated.
