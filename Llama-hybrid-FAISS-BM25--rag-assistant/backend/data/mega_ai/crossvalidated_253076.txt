This is more of a comment but too long. In the following paper: The Dawning of the Age of Stochasticity (David Mumford) Mumford have the following interesting comment: While all these really exciting uses were being made of statistics, the majority of statisticians themselves, led by Sir R.A. Fisher, were tying their hands behind their backs, insisting that statistics couldn't be used in any but totally reproducible situations and then only using the empirical data. This is the so-called 'frequentist' school which fought with the Bayesian school which believed that priors could be used and the use of statistical inference greatly extended. This approach denies that statistical inference can have anything to do with real thought because real-life situations are always buried in contextual variables and cannot be repeated. Fortunately, the Bayesian school did not totally die, being continued by DeFinetti, E.T. Jaynes, arid others.
