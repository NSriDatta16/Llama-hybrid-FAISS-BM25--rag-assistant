I think your crawlers visits need to be organic. I'd start by crawling the list once a week, and when a sites content changes, set that one to crawl twice a week, [and then] when you see more frequent changes, you crawl more frequently. The algorithm would need to be smart enough to know the difference between one off edits and frequent site changes. Also, never forget to pay attention to the Robots.txt... that's the first page you should hit in a crawl, and you need to respect it's contents above all else.
