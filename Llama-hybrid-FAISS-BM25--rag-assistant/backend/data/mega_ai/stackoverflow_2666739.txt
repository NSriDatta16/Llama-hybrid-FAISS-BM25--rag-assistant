Running the FindBugs, CheckStyle or PMD on every build would slow everyone's builds down, and I imagine that is why you are looking at the Eclipse approach. Unfortunately, that may also be problematic, depending on availability (and robustness) of plugins. Plus, you'll still take a performance hit in incremental and (especially) full project builds. Another alternative would be to set up a Hudson continuous integration server and configure it to run style checkers, coverage tools and so on, tracking the results over time using the Sonar plugin .
