In theory, yeah. I haven't the time to actually whip up a prototype, but I envision doing it with as simple markup as: where the two child DIVs are floated. You can set #rectangle1 to be resizable (via jQueryUI), and constrain the resize to #container if you'd like. What will happen is, the vertical border you want to drag around is essentially just the right border of #rectangle1 . You can write a bit of script to resize #rectangle2 as well by hooking up to the resize event of the resizable. (Check the docu page for both constrain and the resize event) UPDATE Here's a working prototype: jsFiddle Using the markup above, you can: Drag the container rectangle around. Resize the any rectangle except the last and the next rectangle resizes along with it to fit the container while constraining the resize inside the container, and to not disturb the other rectangles. All with minimal code and markup.
