Not sure when you're firing the animations and whether they loop (like a UIActivityView spinner or something) - sounds like it's every single pixel the table view is scrolling? In any event, perhaps you could use the UIScrollView delegate methods and tell each cell to start animation on scrollViewWillBeginDragging: and tell each cell to stop at scrollViewDidEndDragging: You could set a boolean isAnimating for your UITableViewCell and if an animation is currently underway, do nothing. if (isAnimating) { // ... do nothing } else { // Start your animation } Or stick with whatever you have now and use a boolean still, but only fire the animation if it's not currently animating. Then in your finished parameter just set isAnimating to NO . if (isAnimating) { // ... do nothing } else { [UIView animateWithDuration:0.3f animations:^{ // animations... isAnimating = YES; } completion:^{ isAnimating = NO; } ]; }
