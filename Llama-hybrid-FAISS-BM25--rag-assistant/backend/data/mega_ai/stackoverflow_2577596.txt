How can i use 'log' inside a src/groovy/ class

I'm encountering this error: groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: log for class: org.utils.MyClass Here's the content of the class: package org.utils class MyClass { int organizationCount = 0 public int getOrganizationCount(){ log.debug "There are ${organizationCount} organization(s) found." return organizationCount } } Do i need to add an import statement? What do i need to add? Note that the class is located in src/groovy/org/utils. I know that the 'log' variable is accessible in controllers, services, etc. Not sure in 'src' classes. Thanks.
