Use Quickfix library alongwith the documentation of how FIX messages are constructed. Else it would be very difficult to decipher how the messages are organized. This is an example from Quickfix website Your message is the MarketDataSnapshotFullRefresh class object. FIX::NoMDEntries noMDEntries; message.get(noMDEntries); -> You get the count of repeating groups, how many times you need to iterate over the object message to get all the entries. Remember FIX::NoMDEntries is a field. FIX42::MarketDataSnapshotFullRefresh::NoMDEntries group; -> This is a little tricky. You go inside a message to get the groups. Here NoMDEntries is an enclosed class inside MarketDataSnapshotFullRefresh class. Remeber this is the class which will give you the data. Now either you run through a loop or write the same code multiple times to extract all the fields inside each group. getGroup gives you the group from which you extract fields. getField will give you the field data. Most of the nomenclature of Quickfix is FIX messages. So refer a FIX message website like Fiximate and your life will be much easier. FIX::MDEntryType MDEntryType; FIX::MDEntryPx MDEntryPx; FIX::MDEntrySize MDEntrySize; FIX::OrderID orderID; message.getGroup(1, group); group.get(MDEntryType); group.get(MDEntryPx); group.get(MDEntrySize); group.get(orderID); message.getGroup(2, group); group.get(MDEntryType); group.get(MDEntryPx); group.get(MDEntrySize); group.get(orderID);
