"Error 404 Not Found" in Magento Admin Login Page

I just transfered my magento installation from one local machine server to another. Now, I cannot login to admin panel. When I go to the admin login url, I get the following error message:- "Error: 404 Not Found" Some of my module's pages also show this error. Can anyone please figure out the problem?
