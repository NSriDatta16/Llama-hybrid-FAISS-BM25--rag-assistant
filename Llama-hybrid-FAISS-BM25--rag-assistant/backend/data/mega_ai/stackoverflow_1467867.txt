To copy the entire directory tree, create the root folder ("Create Project") in visual source safe. Then from Windows Explorer select all files and folders you want to add to this new project (folder). It should prompt you for a comment. Enter your note and click ok . That should add all files and folders. If you only need to add a folder, drag the folder in to it's root in VSS. It will create the folder in VSS. I think VSS always calls folders "projects".
