First you have to make sure the youtube player you're embedding supports javascript by passing enablejsapi=1 as a get param. Here's how I insert a (chromeless) player using SWFObject: var player_id = "your_player_id"; var params = { allowScriptAccess: "always" }; var url = "http://www.youtube.com/apiplayer?enablejsapi=1&version=3&playerapiid=" + player_id; swfobject.embedSWF(url, player_id, '320', '240', "9.0.0", null, null, params, {'id': player_id}); Then you need to add a global function that is called when the player is ready, and in that add a listener for when a video is complete: var player = null; function onYouTubePlayerReady(player_id) { player = document.getElementById(player_id); player.addEventListener('onStateChange', 'playerStateChanged'); player.loadVideoById(youtube_video_id); }; function playerStateChanged(state) { // State code 0 means playback ended if (state == 0) { player.loadVideoById(next_video_id); } }; I wrote this code for my youtube playlist bookmarklet. Here's a link if you want a working example: http://zaius.github.com/youtube_playlist/ And if you want to do anything more in depth, here's the youtube javascript reference where I worked out how to do all this: http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/js_api_reference.html
