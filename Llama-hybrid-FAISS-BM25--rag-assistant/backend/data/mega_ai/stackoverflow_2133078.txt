How do you set hotspot co-ordinates on a Windows cursor generated from an icon file?

I'm setting a custom cursor on my app from an icon file, but the click point is at the wrong co-ordinates. I'm setting the cursor with SetClassLongPtr(hwnd, GCL_HCURSOR, reinterpret_cast cursor) where cursor is the result of; LoadImage( NULL, "some_path/cursor.ico", IMAGE_ICON, //also tried IMAGE_CURSOR 0, //width. 0 uses the width of the file provided 0, //height. 0 uses the height of the file provided LR_LOADFROMFILE ); The cursor loads fine, but its clicks come from the bottom-left corner of the cursor image, rather than top left. The wikipedia article on .ico files says the hotspots are only specified on .cur files, not .ico. Edit: Clarified question ref: LoadImage() and SetClassLongPtr() on msdn.
