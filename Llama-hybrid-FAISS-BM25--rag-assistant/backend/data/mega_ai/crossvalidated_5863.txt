If you are targeting the general population (i.e. a non statistical-savvy audience) you should focus on eye-candy rather than statistical accuracy. Forget about boxplots, let alone violin plots (I personally find them very difficult to read)! If you'd ask the average street man what a quantile is, you would mostly get some wide eyed silence... You should use barplots, bubble charts, maybe some pie charts (brrrr). Forget about error bars (although I would put SD in text somewhere where applicable). Use colors, shapes, thick lines, 3D. You should make each chart unique and immediately easy to understand, even without having to read all the legends/axes etc. Make a smart use of maps by coloring them. Information is beautiful is a very good resource to get ideas. Look at this chart for instance: Caffeine and Calories : anyone can understand it, and it's pleasing to the eye. And, of course, have a look at Edward Tufte's work.
