(Summarizing answer in comments) They are really the same, after you put in that minus sign you lost. Just multiply in numerator and denominator of first form with $\exp(-\beta_0-\beta_1 x)$. Logistic regression is usually estimated by maximizing the likelihood function, but the negative of the loglikelihood function is often (especially in machine learning circles) called the log-loss. It is really the same thing, only wrapped differently.
