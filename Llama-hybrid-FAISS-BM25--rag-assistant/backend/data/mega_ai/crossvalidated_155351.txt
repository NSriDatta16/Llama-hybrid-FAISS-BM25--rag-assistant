Set prior for logistic regression in R when using unequal group sizes (29 versus 48 cases)

I have 29 cases for negative outcome (0) and 48 cases for positive outcome (1). I fit my data with logistic regression model LogisticReg Then I have large set of observations (~800) that I want to classify using this model. LogisticProb Now I take a look at probabilities and classify 0.5 to the second group. However, this doesn't take into account unequal sizes of two groups in my training data. I need to incorporate this prior information, presumably using Naive Bayesian classifier. I took a look at weights argument for glm and verified that LogisticReg$prior.weights right now gives equal weights for all observations, however I am still not sure how to implement this prior. Any help will be appreciated.
