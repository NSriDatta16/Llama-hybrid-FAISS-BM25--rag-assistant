This particular issue is addressed in logFaces , in fact it's one of the major problems it was design to solve - centralize and reduce log flooding. In your application config. you specify application name, for example, "My production app". All log statements from the application will then flow into centralized log server and will be available in storage for queries and in real-time viewing. You don't change your code, it's only a matter of configuration. Usually we have several instances of same application in development and several versions in QA, each developer can tune it's viewer to fetch what is going on on others. I often have a watch on QA hosts and know there is a problem even before they realize it. Another interesting scenario is when you want to see what is going on in all applications at once but focusing only on, say, data layer. Disclosure : I am the author of this product.
