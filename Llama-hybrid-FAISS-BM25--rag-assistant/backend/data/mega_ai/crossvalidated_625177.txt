As Ted mentioned, binning/aggregation and oversampling/imputation are usually performed. You could also try interpolation between timestamps for the sparser series. You could build a local model between the n points in the sparer series and sample from the interpolated region. If your goal is to use the resultant time series for modeling, and the sampling mismatch is quite small, you could try modeling with lstms/transformers. These complex models would be able to perform well even if there is a small timestamp mismatch or a small amount of missing samples.
