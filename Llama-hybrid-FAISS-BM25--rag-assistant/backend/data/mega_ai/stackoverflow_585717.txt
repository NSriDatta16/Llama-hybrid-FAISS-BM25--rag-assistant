From "LINQ to SQL" to "Azure Table Storage" or "SQL Data Service"

I have a Silverlight application where I use LINQ to SQL to store my data. Now I have added this application to an Azure cloud, and want to use an Azure method to store my data. But I don't know whether I should use "Azure Table Storage" or "SQL Data Service", and how I can use it.
