Recreate Linq to Sql code when table changes where customised

I have a Linq to Sql Model generated by VS ORD, but I want to make a changes to it to work around a couple of issues. I can change the designer.cs generated code , but if I ever need to recreate a table within the model, then I delete it and drag it back to the ORD. This however loses all of my customisations. Is there another way? I have seen reference to sqlMetal.exe , but not sure how I would use this to get around the issue. For information my customisations are as follows: I am using Guid 's and want the db to default these values, therefore I want to change the default linqtosl behaviour to add the attribute [Column(IsDbGenerated= true)] to the ID properties. the Default Model Binding for MVC is not working for a collection ( EntitySet ). To work around this I need to change the setter for these collections slightly. Neither of these changes are particularly big, but my database could change considerably over time, and I need to remember to do each customisation each time.
