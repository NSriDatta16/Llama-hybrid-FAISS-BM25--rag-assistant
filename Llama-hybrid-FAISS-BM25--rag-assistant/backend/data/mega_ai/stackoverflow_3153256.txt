XSD: How do I import a data type from another XSD?

I have the following start of an XSD: ...and then some other definitions... Where in_dat exists in a schema written by another organization. What I essentially want to do us create a schema that will contain an element of the in_dat type that is defined in the other ogranization's XSD. Am I even close to having this correct? I'm pretty new to XML. I keep getting http://location_of_my_xsd/temp.xsd:79:9: Invalid: Undefined element no{http://www.sychophants.com}:in_dat referenced from content model from http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv , which is a schema validator. Thanks. edit: Thanks to the two of you who replied. The problem appears to be that the other organization did not define a targetNamespace attribute in their schema. The result is that I cannot import the namespace into my schema, which means I cannot use the type provided. I had to copy/paste the code, which is what I wanted to avoid... but you can't have everything you want, I guess.
