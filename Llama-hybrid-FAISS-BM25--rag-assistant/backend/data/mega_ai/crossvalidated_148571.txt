One approach for this would be to use Poisson regression . You could do a separate Poisson regression for each entry: after estimating the regression parameters, you could substitute the current day (e.g., $x=30$) into the model of the mean, to estimate the current popularity. Alternatively, you could model each entry as a time series of counts. These techniques would enable you to more effectively estimate the "current" popularity, as opposed to the average popularity over the entire month. However, if the data are "noisy", you should still expect to get large margins of error -- these techniques do not really address the problem of having noisy data. For that, some things you could do would be to (1) collect more data (e.g., going back further than 30 days), or (2) aggregate the data in some way prior to performing the analysis, e.g. by lumping together related Wikipedia entries instead of considering each entry separately.
