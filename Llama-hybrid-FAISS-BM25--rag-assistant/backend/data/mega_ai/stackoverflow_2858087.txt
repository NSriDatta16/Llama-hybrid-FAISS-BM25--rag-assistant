In JPA2, the combination of EntityManager and CriteriaQuery is very powerful: http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/criteria/CriteriaQuery.html http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html#createQuery(javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery%29 You define a basic CriteriaQuery (somewhat like a view) using the CriteriaBuilder and then use the entitymanager to create a query based on the criteriaquery. Since criteriaquery are objects, they are reuseable on the java side. Possibly providers also implement caching against criteriaqueries, but I don't know about that.
