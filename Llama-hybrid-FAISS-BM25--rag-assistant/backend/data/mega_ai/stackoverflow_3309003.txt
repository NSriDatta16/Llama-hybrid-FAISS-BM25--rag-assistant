1)To check the color of a turtle/agent you can do: let the-agent ...get the agent some way... if ( [color] of the-agent = orange) [show "the agent is orange"] 2) I'm puzzled. Turtles in netlogo do not collide with each other, by default, they pass over each other. The only thing that can stop a turtle from going "forward" is the end of the grid. You must have written some code that makes them collide.
