Modeling the effect of a very erronous initial prior on Bayesian Inference

I am trying to get a grasp of the case that a very intuitive initial prior provided to a Bayesian Inference process turns out to be entirely wrong. Is there a standard model for the effect of error in an initial prior? That might just get me more comfortable in picking an initial prior and choosing Bayesian Inference in the first place.
