How to retrieve foreign host's MAC address in C++

Currently we're parsing arp request output from the command line. string cmd = "arp -n "; cmd.append(ipaddress); cmd.append(" | grep "); cmd.append(ipaddress); fgets( line, 130, fp); fgets( line, 130, fp); ret.append(line); ... It works, but is there a way to do this using a library function that wont depend so much on the native command line interface? The project is using libpcap currently.
