Prepared Statements and Stored Procs Used Together

I'm in the planning stages of a Microsoft ASP.NET / SQL Server 2008 based web application and In thinking about database design, I began to think about injection attacks and what strategies I should employ to mitigate the database as a vector for injection attacks. I've heard from various sources that using stored procedures increases safety, I have also read that these are equally as infective if they are still used with dynamic SQL as this presents an injection point Question Is it possible to use a Parametrized Query inside a stored procedure? My thinking is that if I pass the arguments to the stored procedure into the prepared statement the database engine will sanitize those arguments for me.
