I can't correct the OLS model with heteroskedasticity by the lmtest means

i'm using a selvaggio model to explain the behavior of deposits in a bank's data, and i need to use the estimated parameters, the problem is the heteroskedasticity that i detectect with breusch-pagan test bptest(model) and when i'm trying to use the correction with what ever methods, sandwick for example. i get the same estimated coefficients . coeftest(model, vcov = sandwich) what should i do ?
