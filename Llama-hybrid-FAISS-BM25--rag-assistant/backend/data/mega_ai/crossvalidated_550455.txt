Classification of time series according to linearity, ergodicity and stationarity

I'm new to the subject of Time Series and I have some difficulties understanding some cross definitions: Linear and non-linear time series Ergodic and non-Egordic time series Stationary and non-stationary time series. By cross definitions I mean the relationships between them. Is there any reference with a general framework to classify the time series according to the 3 items above? Some questions are pertinent and easy to ask: What is the definitive mathematical definition of linearity? Is each linear time series an ergodic TS? Is each linear time series an sationary TS?
