Are Matérn class kernels universal kernels or not?

This is a question that I can't find the solution. I don't know it is a open question or it is a well-known result that can be attained from several lemmas. Here are the definition of Matérn class kernel: $M_{\sigma^2,\nu,\rho}(x,y)=\sigma^2\frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{||x-y||}{\rho})^{\nu}K_{\nu}(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{||x-y||}{\rho})$ where $\sigma^2$ is a length scale parameter, $\Gamma(.)$ is gamma function, $K_{\nu}$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind, and $\nu,\rho$ are non-negative parameters of covariance. I use the definition of universal kernel in Universal Kernels(Charles A. Micchelli) : Given any prescribed compact subset Z of a Hausdorff topological space X, A kernel is universal if for any positive number $\epsilon$ and any function f ∈ C(Z) (continuous function on Z) there is a function g ∈ K(Z) (RKHS space generated by the kernel) such that sup norm $||f-g||_{Z} I know that frequently used Gaussian and Laplacian kernels are universal kernels and they are special case of Matérn class so I am wondering what kind of $\nu$ will lead to a universal kernel. I am interesting in this problem because I am now studying Gaussian Process and Bayesian Optimization [ Niranjan Srinivas , Jonathan Scarlett , Jasper Snoek ] and I find that not only in theory they consider Matérn/Gaussian Kernel but also in real-world implementation. The default Kernel choice of many Bayesian optimization tools are Matérn 5/2. I don't think it is reasonable if it's not universal but I don't know how to prove it.
