What does the new Facebook Connect platform offer over a traditional Facebook App?

Facebook Connect seems like the cool new way to leverage a user's Facebook account on your own site (get their friends list, write to their profile, etc). What I don't understand is what the new Facebook Connect platform offers over a traditional Facebook App with the Offline Access permission granted. Can anyone help me out by providing a clear explanation of the differences between the two options? When would it be better to use one over the other?
