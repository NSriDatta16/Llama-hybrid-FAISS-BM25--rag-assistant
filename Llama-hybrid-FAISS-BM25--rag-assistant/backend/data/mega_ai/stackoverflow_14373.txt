CVS to SVN conversion and reorganizing branches

I am converting from existing CVS repository to SVN repository. CVS repository has few brances and I'd like to rename branches while converting. Wanted conversion is like this: CVS branch SVN branch HEAD -> branches/branchX branchA -> trunk branchB -> branches/branchB branchC -> branches/branchC That is, CVS HEAD becomes a normal branch and CVS branchA becomes SVN trunk. Both CVS and SVN repositories will be on same linux machine. How could this be done? Also conversion where CVS branchA becomes SVN trunk and all other CVS branches are ignored might be enough.
