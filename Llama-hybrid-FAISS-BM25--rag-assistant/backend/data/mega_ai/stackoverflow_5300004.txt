To remove your app use the Organizer (Window > Organizer). Then select your device, then your app and press the minus button. You could also delete your app from the device in the conventional way: hold icon for few seconds, then click X after it starts to shake. To clean use Build > Clean (or Product > Clean on Xcode 4).
