Forecast time series with breakpoint using Holt-Winters (R)

I have a time series dataset for forecast using Holt-winters model, but my problem is the time series contains breaks or change point, Should we remove the first break? Or is there any other solution for managing breaks in the Holt-Winters model? Knowing that by removing the first breaks data the error rate of my model decrease.
