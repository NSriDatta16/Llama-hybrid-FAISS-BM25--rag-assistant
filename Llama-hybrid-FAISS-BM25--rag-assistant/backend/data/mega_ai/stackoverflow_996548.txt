You should definitely separate your data from your application. As I am unsure on the reasons you originally had for putting member data (apparently images and something else) I can offer suggestions based on a more ideal environment. If you are storing information on a lot of different people and need access to it in multiple places, why wouldn't you choose to use a database? Perhaps even a free one like PostgreSQL or MySQL? If you store your data in a database it is easy to retrieve through java, either use a ORM like Hibernate or just some basic JDBC libraries. This assumes you understand SQL and the database layer in Java. Then if you need access to certain files you can either create a Service Orientated Architecture (SOA) and use a restful web service to pull the images based off a url. This would allow storage to be offloaded to another machine in your trust zone. It is hard to offer a good solution without more details on the problem and your server setup.
