In my opinion heat should be used as a first pass to generate a fragment. Opinions vary on this and many people like to use it in a build process. Only use -sreg if would don't want the registry values. If you have COM you would want them. This is where answer 1 comes in, I think you run heat then edit the output to suit what you want to do. Depends, .NET itself doesn't need the registry values but if you use COM it will. What values do you get for non-com assemblies?
