Mean Average Precision (MAP) in two dimensions

I want to compute Mean Average Precision (MAP) from Average Precision (AP) over all users and over every 5 minute intervals of a day. How do I compute MAP from AP for both these dimensions [user, time interval]. That is I get an AP per user, per 5 minute. I want MAP for whole day averaged across all users. Is there a "MMAP" (for lack of better word)? Does it even make sense as I am computing average over an average?
