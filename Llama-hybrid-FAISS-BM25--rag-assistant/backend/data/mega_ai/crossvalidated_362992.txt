Why do descriptive statistics contradict with regression coefficents?

I am estimating a binary logistic regression with L1 norm. According to the regression coefficients, the sign of x1 's coefficient is positive. However, the descriptive statistics indicates that the mean of x1 variable for class 0 is greater than that of class 1. Could you please explain me how to justify this contradictory results? It should be noted that descriptive statistics are calculated before the standardization of independent variables.
