Line 2339 of wmd.js may be a good place to start: Attacklab.wmd_defaults = {version:1, output:"HTML", lineLength:40, delayLoad:false}; Add an option for each div id you need to change. You override these settings by adding a script block before including wmd.js, for example: wmd_options = {"output": "Markdown"}; Then change the wmd.PanelCollection function to.. wmd.PanelCollection = function(){ this.buttonBar = doc.getElementById(wmd.wmd_env["wmd-button-bar"]); this.preview = doc.getElementById(wmd.wmd_env["wmd-preview"]); this.output = doc.getElementById(wmd.wmd_env["wmd-output"]); this.input = doc.getElementById(wmd.wmd_env["wmd-input"]); }; Note this is totally untested, and may not work, but compared to auto-generating the WMD editor or making multiple copies it's slightly more elegant.. Edit : I tried making the edits, but it's not quite as simple as adding to wmd_defaults - various items (mainly the button-bar) use an ID rather than a class, but, it's close.. Edit 2 : After much fiddling, I would say the answer is basically "no". A better answer is no, not without some fairly large changes to WMD (changes that are beyond my very limited javascript experience).. I tried moving all the hard-coded div names to settings, and added a "elementNamePrefix" setting for all the button class names, rather than use "wmd-spacer1" it used wmd.wmd_env["elementNamePrefix"] + "spacer1" ... but even with this you need to duplicate items in the CSS file, and the changes caused weird behaviour I couldn't fix (I think because of the global AttackLab variable defined on the first line? Not sure).. Perhaps, as an alternative to having multiple WMD controls, you could have a drop-down which loads different posts via AJAX? It would certainly be easier than modifying WMD to allow multiple instances..
