Web Service: Single String Parameter Or Complex Type Parameters

Is it more or less acceptable (i.e. standard) to create a publicly-exposed web service with these method signatures: ThisMethodDoesSomething(ComplexType param) ThisMethodDoesSomethingElse(AnotherComplexType param) Or this: ThisMethodDoesSomethingAndSomethingElse(string xml) Where the operation being performed depends upon the XML string passed to a single does-it-all method? I have always gone with the former, but a coworker of mine prefers the latter and I'm trying to weigh pros and cons of both strategies before we begin a new project. Which is more accepted and easier for the public to work with and why?
