Use a Sharepoint-style UserData table, that has a set of string columns, a set of int columns, etc. and a Type column. Then you have a list of types table that specifies the schema for each type - its properties, and the specific columns they map to in the UserData table. With things like Azure and other utility computing storage you don't even need to define a table. Every store object is basically a dictionary.
