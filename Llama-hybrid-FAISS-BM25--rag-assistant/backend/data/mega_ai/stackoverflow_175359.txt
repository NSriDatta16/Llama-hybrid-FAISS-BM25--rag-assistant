That is a good question. I belive it is worth using multisite so long as you can figure out the mastership of elements. If an element is mastered at site A you can't edit it at site B until you have transfered the mastership. So if each site is working on the same pieces of code then multisite is going to be more trouble than it is worth, if the coverage is disjoint then multisite is a good call. Clearcase is very chatty on the network and keeping as much local as possible is a good idea.
