Note, that the first posted answer does only work in a half of all cases, thus not work at all on average. First january is known not to be in daylight saving time only in the northern hemisphere. However that's only half of the world. var jan = new Date( 2009, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0 ), jul = new Date( 2009, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0 ); var offset = ( jan.getTime() % 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ) > ( jul.getTime() % 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ) ?jan.getTimezoneOffset() : jul.getTimezoneOffset();
