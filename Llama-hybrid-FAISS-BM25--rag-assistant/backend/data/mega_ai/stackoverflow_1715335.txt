How to use the secure desktop in Windows Vista and W7?

Windows Vista added a new feature called the "Secure Desktop". It looks great and really draws the user's attention. But now, I want to use this desktop in my .NET/C# or Delphi/WIN32 application. And use it for my own dialog, which will ask the user for about 5 different but sensitive pieces of information. Is there a way to use it in .NET? Is there a way to use it in WIN32?
