Machine Learning Methods for Binary Classification

I was hoping to get a nice list of alternatives to logistic regression and decision trees for binary classification ("Yes vs. No" or "Cured vs. Not cured"). I am more interested in identifying the variables associated with the outcome than finding the model which predicts the outcome best. Obviously logistic regression is a great, simple way to do this. I have used classification trees as well. It would be great to learn about other methods. Could support vector machines be used for this task as well?
