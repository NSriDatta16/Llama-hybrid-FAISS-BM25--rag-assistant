Bayesian design for a small sample and how to include informed priors

I am new to Bayesian approaches so thank you in advance for your patience. I am looking to investigate the influence of a specific type of brain lesion on the lateralization of verbal memory in a data set of 38 individuals with epilepsy. My outcome of interest is verbal memory lateralization which can be typical (left) or atypical(right or bilateral). I also have information about other covariates that may be related to the outcome, including participants' handedness and speech lateralization. I am interested in using a Bayesian approach to analyze this data given the small sample. My questions are: What would be the best Bayesian approach to answering my research question (is there substantial evidence that this lesion influences lateralization)? What would be the best way to include informed priors? I may be able to find information about the covariates, e.g. incidence of handedness and/or speech lateralization in the epilepsy population, but there is not much research about the outcome (memory lateralization). Can you recommend any programs in R that would be appropriate for the recommended approach? Thank you so much for your responses!
