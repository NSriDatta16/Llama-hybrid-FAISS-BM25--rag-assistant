What is a good resource for database design on Bigtable/S3/Azure style databases?

Coming from a relational database background, I can make the transition to document oriented databases pretty quickly. Many of the most valuable "relations" are maintained by the hierarchy of the document. Many of the DODB variants of NoSQL also offer a very rich query language as well. This subset of NoSQL I think I understand. I am looking for a good reference for designing around the database style implemented by Azure Table Storage, S3, and BigTable. It seems like all of the samples I see are trivial implementations. Do you know of any non-trivial treatments of design in this space?
