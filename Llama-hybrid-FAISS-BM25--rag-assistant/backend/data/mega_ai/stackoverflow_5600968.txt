I think if you have to test your tests you're doing something wrong. In my opinion tests should be really easy and simple. However, what you can do is measure how good your tests are. Maybe you want to know how much code coverage your tests have.. but that's not testing the tests as you thought, is it? In any case, it's probably a waste of time.. :)
