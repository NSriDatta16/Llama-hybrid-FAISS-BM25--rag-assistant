I don't know for sure how the code coverage engine you're using works, but they usually employ the profiling API + some reflection to figure out what managed code is executed. I suspect RCWs are primarily native code, bridging between the managed objects and their native COM counterparts. You could verify this by running .NET Reflector on the generated interop assemblies (which host the RCWs for your COM objects), and see how much managed code they actually contain. Once you get past the interop border, however, all is lost, then you're no longer in managed territory. You'd need a native coverage tool to collect statistics from that side.
