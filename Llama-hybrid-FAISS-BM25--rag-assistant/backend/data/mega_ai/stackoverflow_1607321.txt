How to programmatically impose printing restrictions/DRM on PDF for confidential documents using Microsoft .NET

I came across stackoverflow from a podcast recommendation and I'm very impressed. This is my first post. I'm a Microsoft .net developer and I'm on a project with following requirements. 1) Confidential PDF document should be displayed to user with NO OPTION TO PRINT AT ALL. The reason to do this is the PDF's are for view only and users are not supposed to print/archive/distribute the confidential data We have a bunch of PDF's (100's or even 1000's and more to come) that needs to be displayed like this and I'm looking for a pragrammatic solution that can be done on the fly. I'm ware of the security tab in Acrobat Professional but that needs opening each and every file in acrobat and putting restrictions. Also new files that gets created everyday is a big problem Is there anyway I can introduce DRM into the PDF's programmatically Is there a good .NET API that this DRM job on the fly when an open PDF is requested and has to be presented in a restricted format with no printing available? Thanks in advance.
