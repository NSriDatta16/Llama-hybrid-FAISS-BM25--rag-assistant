Yes, You could use an off-site load balancer.. and on bare metal LVS is a great choice, but your latency will be awful! Rumour has it that Amazon is going to fix the CNAME issue. However they are unlikely to add https, indepth or custom health checks, feedback agents, url matching, cookie insertion (and some people with good architecture would say quite right too.) However thats why Scalr, RightScale and others are using HAProxy usually two of them behind a round robin DNS entry. Here at Loadbalancer.org we are just about to launch our own EC2 load balancing appaliance: http://blog.loadbalancer.org/ec2-load-balancer-appliance-rocks-and-its-free-for-now-anyway/ We are planning on using SSH scripts to intergrate with autoscaling in the same way rightscale does, any comments appreciated on the blog. Thanks
