Your data is 3-order tensor (no_examples x no_features x no_time_steps), so as you remarked, you can't use just PCA which works for matrices (matrices are 2-tensors, since a matrix $M = (M_{ij})_{i You can use a technique that is called higher-order, or tensor, SVD . This technique is a generalization of SVD to higher order tensors. In R there is a package rTensor which seems to be aimed at this.
