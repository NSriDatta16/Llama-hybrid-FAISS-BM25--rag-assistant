What your challenger was perhaps trying to communicate is that the problem you are posing is a very standard problem in statistics and lots is known about how to solve it and using one of the standard solutions may be easier and better. Rephrasing your problem in statistical lingo: Your "training set" is a "sample". Each of your "examples" is an "observation". The variable indicating whether or not an anomaly exists is your "dependent" variable. The variables the features of the examples are your "independent" variables (also known as predictors, covariates, etc.) Lots of different algorithms have been developed for this problem, including regression, CART, discriminant analysis and so on. A wonderful book which gives detail about the various methods that have been developed is The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction (Second Edition) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman (2009)
