You're asking about positive-unlabeled learning (PU learning). It's a niche field within machine learning. Typically it arises because the data generation practices of an organization are entirely focused on capturing one class ("positives") and ignoring other classes. For example, police will have lots of data about crimes that have been reported and criminals they have arrested, but little data about law-abiding citizens, and only some data about not-yet-apprehended criminals. Applying machine learning methods to PU data is more involved, because unlabeled data can either be "positive" or another class, so you need to include that uncertainty explicitly in your model; simply substituting an alternative loss function is not sufficient to tackle the problem. A recent review paper is " Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data: A Survey " by Jessa Bekker and Jesse Davis. The authors outline current research in seven areas: How can we formalize the problem of learning from PU data? What assumptions are typically made about PU data in order to facilitate the design of learning algorithms? Can we estimate the class prior from PU data and why is this useful? How can we learn a model from PU data? How can we evaluate models in a PU setting? When and why does PU data arise in a real-world setting? How does PU learning relate to other areas of machine learning?
