First, the choice of family and link in a GLM shouldn't start from the distribution of raw outcomes. The skew in the outcome (energy expenditure) values doesn't matter, if it's accompanied by corresponding skew in combinations of predictor values. The question is whether some combination of predictor variables can account for the distribution/skew of outcomes. There is no need to jump immediately to a GLM. If the errors around the model predictions are well enough behaved, a simple linear regression might do. If errors around predicted outcomes are expected to be proportional to their values, then a prior log transformation of the outcomes and linear regression might work well. Second, I wonder if you are under-fitting the data that you have. Your model only includes strict linear associations with outcome for each of your 3 continuous predictors. It's quite possible that the true associations are more complicated than simple linear relationships. Flexible regression splines can readily model more complex associations. There is no need to scale() the continuous predictors first; that removes any intuitive interpretation of regression coefficients in terms of things like a "decrease in energy expenditure per year of age." You also could consider interaction terms among your predictors to make your model more flexible. For example, might energy expenditure depend in part on the combination of terrain roughness and distance to salmon rather than on each of them independently? Third, you do have to take the repeated measurements on the same individuals into account in some way. The model that you show doesn't do that, so it ignores the correlations among observations within individuals and is likely to provide incorrect (probably over-optimistic) estimates of errors in coefficients. Mixed models are one way to do that, but there are others. Fourth, I worry about reducing to daily averages. Within the same day there seem to be substantial differences in terrain roughness and distance to salmon. Also, you lose any ability to evaluate circadian patterns in the data. (Do you have information on sleep/wake patterns?) In general, it's not a good idea to throw data away. With 70,000 observations, over 2000 or so per animal, it should be possible to find any true associations of your predictors with outcome if you model the data flexibly enough to start. I'd recommend stepping back a bit and looking into principles of flexibly modeling data via regression, then applying those principles to your data. Frank Harrell's course notes and textbook discuss ways to do that. They also cover approaches besides mixed models for handling multiple observations within individuals, and quantile and ordinal regression methods that don't rely on assumptions about the distribution of outcome values given a set of predictor values. Those might work better than your GLM. Even if you end up using a GLM, many of the general principles for model building will apply.
