There is no &nbsp; in XML. The only character entities that have an actual name defined (instead of using a numeric reference) are &amp; , &lt; , &gt; , &quot; and &apos; . That means you have to use the numeric equivalent of a non-breaking space, which is &#160; or (in hex) &#xA0; . If you are trying to save HTML into an XML container, then save it as text. HTML and XML may look similar but they are very distinct. appendXML() expects well-formed XML as an argument. Use the nodeValue property instead, it will XML-encode your HTML string without any warnings. // document fragment is completely unnecessary $otherElement->nodeValue = $row['message'];
