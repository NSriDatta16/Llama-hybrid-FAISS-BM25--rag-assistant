It's not that it can be compressed only once, it's that there is a minimum size you can compress any data before you start losing bits of it (the way you do with a low quality jpg or MP3 file). Most compression algorithms these days are good enough that one pass gets you within a couple of % of that so a second time isn't really worthwhile rather that in not being possible. To understand the minimum size without reading too much theory, think of a question with two possible answers Yes and No. The smallest you can make this result is a single bit where 0 = No and 1 = Yes (or vice versa). Even that has made a bunch of assumptions (that the person receiving the data understands this encoding already for instance). On a more complex level the same is true for all other data. In a situation where you have eight possible answers, all equally probable (this is important), the minimum size is three bits - the smallest number of bits to allow you eight options (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111). There are some clever things you can do to reduce it a little under certain circumstances (for instance you use a smaller number of bits for very common answers at the expense of needing more than might be needed for less common ones but at a lower overall average) but ultimately there is a minimum amount of storage needed to contain the information.
