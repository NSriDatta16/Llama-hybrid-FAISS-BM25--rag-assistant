The sample standard deviation is the root mean square deviation from the mean, with a correction to make the sample variance unbiased. So it is a much more complicated calculation (for example the means are different and then change) than taking the average for two different sets of the same size (you have $7$ elements of each) What you have done with the mean or average is really via the sums of the data and back = (0.046286 * 7 + 0.048714 * 7) / (7 + 7) though you took a shortcut and did = (0.046286 + 0.048714) / 2 The equivalent combining calculation with the standard deviation is much more complicated because there are so many steps to undo and redo, in effect going to the variances and sum of squares of the original data and back; indeed I cannot fit it on one line: =SQRT(((0.003352^2 * (7-1) + 0.046286^2 * 7 + 0.002498^2 * (7-1) + 0.048714^2 * 7) - (0.046286 * 7 + 0.048714 * 7)^2 / (7+7)) / (7+7-1)) Even if you have both samples equal size and if they had the same mean (let's suppose we leave the first sample the same and changed the last observation of the second sample to 0.032 so the second sample now also has mean 0.046286 and has standard deviation 0.0067753 , and you used both shortcuts from having the same mean and having the same sample sizes, it would still not be as simple as with the means, since you would use =SQRT((0.003352^2+0.0067753^2)*6/13) to get the new combined standard deviation of about 0.005135
