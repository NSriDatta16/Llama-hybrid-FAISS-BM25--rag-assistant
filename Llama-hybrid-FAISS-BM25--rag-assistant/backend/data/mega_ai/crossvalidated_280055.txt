How can I identify a step in an increasing time series?

The time series data, as shown in image 1, has 3 separate steps connected by increasing data. How do I detect these steps? An easier set of data with one step could be created in R as follows: x The output is shown in image 2. How would I detect this step? I think a solution to this simple problem would be similar to finding the steps in the earlier dataset.
