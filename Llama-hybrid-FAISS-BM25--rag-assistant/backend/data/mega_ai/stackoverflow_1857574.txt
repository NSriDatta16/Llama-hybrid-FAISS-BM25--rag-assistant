The view functions don't have to be in views.py , they can be anywhere, as long as they're mapped properly in urls.py . So it's up to you how you organize your project. but it appears that the script that generates the file structure creates a "views" module when it creates the file, and I don't see a way to change/override this behavior from the script. You can totally ignore that script and what it generates. It doesn't do anything magical behind the scenes; it just creates those files for you.
