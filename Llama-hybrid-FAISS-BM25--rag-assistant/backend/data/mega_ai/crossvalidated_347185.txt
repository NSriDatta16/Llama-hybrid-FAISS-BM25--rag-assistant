What is the parameter nu in oneClass svm?

According to this link , nu specifies the nu parameter for the one-class SVM model. The nu parameter is both a lower bound for the number of samples that are support vectors and an upper bound for the number of samples that are on the wrong side of the hyperplane. The default is 0.1. The nu parameter must be in the range [0,1]. I do not understand it very well, graphically as it would be? Of theory I find the rank to which nu belongs, but what is the goal of nu for oneClass SVM, is nu equal to C?
