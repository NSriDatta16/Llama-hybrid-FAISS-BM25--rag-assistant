How do I store the contents of an array in tablestorage

I need to store the contents of an array into Azure tablestorage. The array will have between 0 and 100 entries. I don't want to have to create 100 different elements so is there a way I can pack up the array, store it and unpack it later. Any examples would be much appreciated. I just don't know where to start :-(
