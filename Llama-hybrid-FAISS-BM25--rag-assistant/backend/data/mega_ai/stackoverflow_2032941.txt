See, developer and site lard are expecting only safety, but users are expecting fast retrieval. Only, in InnoDB there is no fulltext support, so we manage in that situtaion. Is there alternate constraints there, or is there any tips? Example, I have postcode file in my table, I have around 100000 postcodes, I have autocomplete for postcode, in this situtaion, if I use the MyISAM, I make the filed as fulltext, so my user will not experience a performance issue. So is there any idea for this creteria? Basically I am not a database engineer, I am a developer.
