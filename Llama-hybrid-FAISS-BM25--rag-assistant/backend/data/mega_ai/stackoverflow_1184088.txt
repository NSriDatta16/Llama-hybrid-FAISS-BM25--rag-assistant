Any Ideas to Optimize the ASP.Net Server Load?

I am developing using VSTS 2008 + C# + .Net 3.5 to develop an ASP.Net application. At the client side, in order to keep the session live, I will refresh the server every 5 seconds. Here is my code at the client side, server side Default.aspx will do nothing -- the only purpose is to keep client alive. I have monitored the traffic and found each time that the client will send a couple of headers to the server side. Any ideas to reduce the server load or traffic? If the number of clients are big, I am afraid the server workload will be increased significantly. Here is the request and response header I monitored, Request headers Connection : Keep-Alive Accept : / Accept-Encoding : gzip, deflate Accept-Language : en-us Host : localhost:20000 User-Agent : Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; CIBA; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MS-RTC LM 8; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; OfficeLiveConnector.1.4; OfficeLivePatch.1.3) Response headers Server : Microsoft-IIS/7.0
