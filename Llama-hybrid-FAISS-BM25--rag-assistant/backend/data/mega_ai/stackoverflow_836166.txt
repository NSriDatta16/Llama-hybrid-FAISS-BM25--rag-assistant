Here are a few open source solutions I have come across that deserve further research: Apache Sling (JCR based CMS ( JSR170 , JSR283 ), RESTful interface). Apache Hadoop (Java based distributed data-store, map reduce functionality). HBase (built on top of Hadoop, provding Google Bigtable-like capabilities). CouchDB (Erlang based key/value DB with Map/Reduce functionality, RESTful interface). Dynomite (Erlang based, Amazon dynamo clone). Voldemort (Distributed key-value storage system). Cassandra (highly scalable, eventually consistent, distributed, structured key-value store). MongoDB (highly scalable, JSON document based storage).
