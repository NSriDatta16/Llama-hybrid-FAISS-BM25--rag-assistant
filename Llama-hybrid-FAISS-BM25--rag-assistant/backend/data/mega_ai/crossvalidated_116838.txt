Maybe you should put the problem description at the beginning of your question, so everyone sees it. I would suggest you use a mathematical model of scratching, and then do statistics on the model parameters. This would both be more satisfying from the biologist's point of view, and remove the statistical issues of heteroscedasticity. As an example, which i am sure is wrong, you could have markov chain model...ie you could have probability of stopping scratching, given have been scratching for minute, and then this model gives you expected stopping time, variance etc. ..and you would try to regress the probability of scratching on your biological variables..I would have thought a mathematical model of scratching already exists for which you can try to fit parameters.
