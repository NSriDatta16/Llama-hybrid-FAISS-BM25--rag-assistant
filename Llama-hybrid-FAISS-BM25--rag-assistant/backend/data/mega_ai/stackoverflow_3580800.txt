You can intercept the paste with jQuery using the bind('paste', function() {}); , compare string before and after pasting and apply your formatting. The following was tested in IE7/FF3.6/Chrome/Safari 5 $("#textarea").bind('paste', function(e){ // Do whatever you needed to do with the code here. }); Live Example http://jsfiddle.net/VSrTg/2/ Edit An approach would be something like this: $("#textarea").bind('paste', function(e){ var oldText = this.value; setTimeout(function() { // Compare oldText to $("#textarea").val() and format accordingly. }, 1000); }); â€‹ Edit 2 Given your revisions to your original post, if you're worried about the giant market share that is Opera, you're going to have to monitor the value of your textbox with a setInterval() and compare it against itself for changes. Ultimately there will always be a way around your script , even the above example is susceptible to simply dragging text from another text box (or the address bar) into it without triggering the paste event defined above.
