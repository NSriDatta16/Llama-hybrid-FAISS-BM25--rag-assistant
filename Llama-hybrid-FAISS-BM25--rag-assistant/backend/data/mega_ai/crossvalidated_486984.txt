How to encode ordinal variables when null value is valid?

Tl;dr how can I encode a feature that has multiple distinct states each with different numbers of parameters. Am I going to have to break this into multiple models? I'm sorry, I'm sure this has been asked before, but there's a vocab word I don't know, so I've been researching in circles. Specifically, I want to encode music data, where pitches are different distances from each other, but all pitches are the same distance from silence. I don't need silence to literally be a null value, but I can't just encode it as zero either. Silence is a valid category, but it's not on the same dimension as pitch. What is the vocab word I need to research this further? Everything I'm finding says how to fill in null values with no consideration as to whether or not null is a valid answer. And it looks like the other people doing machine learning on music haven't found a good answer either. Edit: So far this seems to be the closest answer, but it doesn't work because null represents an unknown in that example which does not add information, whereas in my case, null is a known value, that does add information
