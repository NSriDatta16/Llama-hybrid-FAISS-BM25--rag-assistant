Is it a good idea to evaluate cross-validation using correlation coefficient?

I am doing cross-validation of my model. I was looking for a metric, that would be able to compare the predictions with the independent data, and I thought that correlation coefficient r would be very easy to interpret. So, just correlate the predictions with the data. But I am not a statistician, so I might have overlooked some issues. So, is it actually a good idea to do this? P.S.: in my particular model the data are counts or sometimes averaged counts, so numbers >= 0, poisson-like distributed, so maybe some normalization would be needed.... but let's keep the question more general :-)
