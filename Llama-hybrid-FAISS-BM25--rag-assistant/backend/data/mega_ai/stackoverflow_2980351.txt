Depends. I mean, seriously - I do write a LOT of UI widgets at the moment... for a financial trading application that is "widget oriented" (like sharepoint, just WPF). IN Them, though, and that is the level most developers will work, I use Microsoft + Infragistics and - that is it. What for should I write more low level widgets? I mean, the offers out there, especially with the tremendous skinning support, are simply good enough. Most applications can be ok with the stock offers from Microsoft (especially as a Ribbon is downloadable). It is not enthusiasm dying, it is need not being there, if you ask me.
