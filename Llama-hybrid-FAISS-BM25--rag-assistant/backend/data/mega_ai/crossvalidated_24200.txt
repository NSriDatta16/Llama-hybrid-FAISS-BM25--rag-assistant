This is not a complete answer, but too long for a comment. A few notations: let $D(t)$ and $B(t)$ be the number of downloads / buys on day $t$, and let $C(i|t)$ be the conversion probability, that is the probability of buying $i$ days after downloading given that the download happened on day $t$. Then $$B(t) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty D(t-i) C(i|t-i)$$ You know $D$ and $B$, but would like to estimate $C$. If the conversion behaviour does not change over time, that is $C(i|t)=C(i)$, then the above formula reduces to a convolution with two known components. Fourier transforms give a standard solution for deconvolution, since the Fourier transform of a convolution equals the product of the two Fourier transforms. Here $\mathcal{F}(B) = \mathcal{F}(D) \mathcal{F}(C)$, so $C = \mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{F}(B)/\mathcal{F}(D))$. I would certainly try this out, as this should at least give you an idea how your conversion probabilities look like. Now, your main questions are in fact assuming that $C(i|t)$ does depend on $t$, and you also want to do statistical inference. This is where I hit the limits of my knowledge. Intuitively, if we allow $C(i|t)$ to change every day, then there is no way we could estimate its effect, so we would probably want to assume some smooth functional effect of $t$. This could be combined with some parametric or semiparametric (eg splines?) form for $C$ as a function of $i$. If you don't have too many parameters, perhaps you could do some numeric optimization. For additional ideas, I would suggest time series and signal detection literature. This does seem like something that might have been solved already
