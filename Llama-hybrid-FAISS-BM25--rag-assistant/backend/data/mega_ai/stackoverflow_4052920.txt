Query to find a weekly average

I have an SQLite database with the following fields for example: date (yyyymmdd fomrat) total (0.00 format) There is typically 2 months of records in the database. Does anyone know a SQL query to find a weekly average? I could easily just execute: SELECT COUNT(1) as total_records, SUM(total) as total FROM stats_adsense Then just divide total by 7 but unless there is exactly x days that are divisible by 7 in the db I don't think it will be very accurate, especially if there is less than 7 days of records. To get a daily summary it's obviously just total / total_records. Can anyone help me out with this?
