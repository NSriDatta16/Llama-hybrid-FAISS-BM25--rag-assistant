SARIMA initial identification of parameters

I am trying to fit a time series with SARIMA models, where the seasonal period is 7. The figure shows the series after applying a logarithmic transformation and differentiating it for the regular (d=1) and seasonal (s=7) part. I can observe that the ACF and PACF plots suggest a mixed ARMA model for the regular part, but I don't know which configuration of the model should I try first based on the plots. Nor the configuration I should use for the seasonal part. The raw log series is: and the differenced log series d=1: The acf and pacf are: So, how should I interpret that acf and pacf?
