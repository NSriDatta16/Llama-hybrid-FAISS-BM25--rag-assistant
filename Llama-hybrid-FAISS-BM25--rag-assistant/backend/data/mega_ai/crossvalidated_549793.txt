I can think of two ways in which you can establish prior distributions on regression parameters. The first one is standardizing the data (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation), then you know that the effect of any single covariate on your variable of interest is very unlikely to create a variation of more than two or three standard deviations on the variable of interest. In that case, you can use a standard normal as a prior for all parameters. This is called a weakly informative prior. Alternatively, you can use prior predictive checks. You already have the knowledge of how your variables are approximately distributed, so you can simply generate data according to the data generation process you are assuming until a distribution matches what you know. Using the example you have above: you want to predict age from weight and height. You know the approximate distribution of all of them. Simply generate a bunch of samples from weight and height from the distributions above, and then sample some parameters parameters from a simple distribution, say a standard normal. Then check whether with such parameters, and the fake data the age is reasonable with respect to what you already know. If that is not the case, you will have to adjust the prior on the parameters. Notice that there are not changes in the distribution of your covariates, as you assume you have information of these. And also notice that you are not violating any Bayesian principle because you are only using prior information in order to establish your priors. You are not using the data itself. For practical Bayesian inference, I highly recommend the paper "Bayesian workflow" by some of my favorite authors in Bayesian inference. Here goes the link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808 PS. I found a bit strange one of your prior bullet points: "For simplicity sake, we assume that there are no correlations and covariances between these variables." Why then, would you run a linear regression on age given the other variables? can you elaborate, please?
