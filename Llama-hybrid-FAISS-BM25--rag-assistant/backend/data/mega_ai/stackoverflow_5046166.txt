"But is my pragmatism making it harder on myself at this point?" I wouldn't call it pragmatism. I'd call it fear of change; staying in your comfort zone. Life is actually far easier if you abandon your old way of thinking and embrace the new (and I know exactly what you mean - I was in the same boat as you with code-behind). Now, off my soap box and to a more practical answer: When you want to detect changes in your model, then hook into the events that allow you to detect changes in your model . The DataContext is not really the model... All of your model objects are going to have an implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged. You should either be hooking into that for a given model, or hooking into something similar for an ObservableCollection. Silverlight/WPF make all of this sort of stuff WAY easier now that databinding actually works . Don't fight the framework. Don't bring old ASP.Net practices with you to this game... It will not help you. You'll lose the best parts of the framework's power that way. Cheers.
