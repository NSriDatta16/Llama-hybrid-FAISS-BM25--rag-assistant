Allowing embedding of HTML to other pages. Iframe-, Script-tag?

I need to allow other people to embed some of my HTML and Javascript code. The HTML code itself is too much to be copy&pasted. Should I use Iframes or script-tags for embeding it? The script tags and iframes are used for example by Stackoverflow on Flair page How does those even exactly work? Aren't those a security risk? What method would you prefer?
