Some quick partial answers... The statistics, estimates, SEs, etc. produced by emmeans are based on the model . If the model appropriately accounts for ID effects, then so do the emmeans() results. That said, with a mixed model, it might be advisable to do a bias adjustment in the back-transformed results. See the vignettes for examples/discussion; for instance, this example . It will use the Size values you specified. It does this by creating a model matrix for model predictions with the predictor combinations you specify, based on the model formula. The square-rooting is done when that model matrix is constructed. Yes, these are Wald tests/intervals. One way to do a kind of parametric bootstrap would be to construct bemm This creates a sample from the estimated sampling distribution of the estimated probabilities or odds ratios. (again, you might want to add sigma and bias.adj = TRUE ). Anything else you do subsequently with emmeans functions treats these like MCMC results; for example, summary(bemm) gives you HPD intervals. Or you can use coda::as.mcmc() to obtain a matrix, each column being the sample you obtained.
