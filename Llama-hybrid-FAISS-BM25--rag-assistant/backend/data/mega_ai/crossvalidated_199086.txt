Is repeated measures ANOVA right for this experimental design? Unsure

I have 2 to 5 subjects (different sea organisms) that will be exposed to several different treatments (varied doses of bacteria). Each group is done in triplicate due to the variability of the measuring instrument and organismal growth. For example, 3 controls of subject A, 3 of subject A with concentration X of bacterium 1, etc. The response measured will be relative fluorescence units by the treated and untreated organisms as a measure of viability and growth. These measurements will be taken at multiple time points for the same treatment, but again, in triplicate. In my mind this has the appearance of a repeated measures ANOVA, but the fact that each group/treatment is done in triplicate seems to violate what I've read about a repeated measures ANOVA.
