Installing OpenCV on OSX 10.6 using MacPorts

I tried installing OpenCV following the instructions for a MacPorts install on http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port , typing sudo port install opencv in the terminal. The install/compilation seemed to go fine, and the files are in /opt/local subdirectories as they should be. As a first test, I then tried including highgui.h in a C++ source file: #include but when compiling with g++ or gcc, I get error: highgui.h: No such file or directory . I'm new to developing on a Mac, so maybe I'm missing something? I thought I might have to set some path variable and after reading some posts I found when googling, I tried setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib, but that was wild guess and it didn't seem to help. What should I do to make the compilers find the library? Thanks!
