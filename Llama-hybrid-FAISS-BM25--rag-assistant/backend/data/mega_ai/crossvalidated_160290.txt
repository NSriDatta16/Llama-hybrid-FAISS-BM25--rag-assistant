Both forms of notation are informal shorthands for more rigorous ones. A random variable $X$ is a (measurable) function defined on a sample space $\Omega$ , with values in a real vector space $V$ , endowed with a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ (on a sigma-algebra $\mathfrak{F}$ ), $$X:\Omega\to V.$$ We may ignore all details of the parenthesized conditions about measurability and a sigma-algebra, but they should remind us that probabilities are numbers assigned to events , which are subsets of $\Omega$ , not outcomes , which are elements of $\Omega$ . In the context of the question $\Omega$ has not been specified but would, in practice, be the set of all possible outcomes of a sequence of $n$ binary experiments. The process of encoding those outcomes with zeros and ones, with the intention of performing arithmetic operations on those values, is what creates the random variable $X$ . Although its values are in the strictest sense only elements of $\{0,1\}^n = \{(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)\,|\, x_i\in\{0,1\}\}$ , in order to make sense of sums, averages, and other arithmetic combinations of them we automatically--with no further announcement--consider them to be elements of $\mathbb{R}^n = \{(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)\,|\, x_i\in\mathbb{R}\}$ . Notice the use of conventional mathematical set-builder notation . This abbreviates more formal descriptions of sets, which themselves are permitted by virtue of the Axiom schema of specification . This axiom schema is essentially a set of templates that assert the meaningfulness of defining a set as consisting of elements of a given set that satisfy some additional logical condition. The corresponding notation is of the form $$\{x\in A\,|\, P(x)\}$$ where $A$ is a set and $P$ is a logical predicate (that is, will be definitely true or false for any element of $A$ ). Although $P$ can have any logical form, in the instances below it typically is an assertion that something is an element of some set; that is, " $P(x)$ " is in the form " $x\in B$ ", or else it is an assertion that some function attains a specified value; that is, " $P(x)$ " is in the form " $f(x) = y$ " for a given function $f$ and possible value $y$ . Continuing with the question, we can identify the statistic $T$ as a real-valued function $$T:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$$ Consequently, via functional composition and an abuse of notation, " $T$ " is also used to represent the random variable indicated in this schematic: $$T\circ X:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R};\\T\circ X(\omega) = T(X(\omega)).$$ We are now in a position to translate the informal language of the question into these more rigorous terms. " $T$ generates a partition of the sample space... ." For each $k\in\mathbb{R}$ , define $$\mathcal{X}_k = \left(T\circ X\right)^{-1}(k) = \{\omega\in\Omega\,|\, T\circ X(\omega) = k\}.$$ This is a subset of $\Omega$ . It is an event because $T$ is (obviously) measurable, whence $T\circ X$ is measurable. In words: $\mathcal{X}_k$ is the set of outcomes (event) for which the statistic $T$ has the value $k$ . " $\{\boldsymbol{x}\} \cap \mathcal{X}_k$ " clearly is intended as a set intersection. We know what the second set is. The first is a very informal shorthand for $$``\{\boldsymbol{x}\}" = X^{-1}(\{\boldsymbol{x}\}) = \{\omega\in\Omega\,|\, X(\omega)\in\{\boldsymbol{x}\} \} = \{\omega\in\Omega\,|\, X(\omega)=\boldsymbol{x}\}.$$ Notice the two different meanings of " $\{\boldsymbol{x}\}$ "! The correct, mathematically conventional meaning used in the middle is that of a (singleton) subset of the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ . The intended meaning of the shorthand on the left is that of an event in $\Omega$ . Since $\{\boldsymbol{x}\} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is measurable, $\{\boldsymbol{x}\}\subset \Omega$ is an event. (How's that for a confusing statement?!) In words: $\{\boldsymbol{x}\}$ is the set of outcomes (event) where $X$ has the particular value $X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \ldots, X_n=x_n$ . " $\boldsymbol{X} = \boldsymbol{x} \cap T (\boldsymbol{X})=k$ " is a little clearer, being a bit more explicit. It would be interpreted as the intersection of $$``\boldsymbol{X} = \boldsymbol{x}" = \{\omega\in\Omega\,|\, X(\omega)=\boldsymbol{x}\}$$ and $$``T (\boldsymbol{X})=k" = \{\omega\in\Omega\,|\, T(X(\omega)) = k\}.$$ In words: These are the same two events described in (2) and (1) above, respectively. " $P_{\theta}^T(\{k \})$ " contains a lot of baggage, but the key part is the interpretation of " $\{k\}$ " in the context of the superscript " $^T$ ". This is intended to refer to the event $$``\{k\}" = \left(T\circ X\right)^{-1}(k) = \{\omega\in\Omega\,|\,T\circ X(\omega) = k\}.$$ In words: $P_{\theta}^T(\{k \})$ is the probability (according to some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_\theta$ as defined on $(\Omega, \mathfrak{F})$ ) that $T$ will have the value $k$ . The informal rule that seems to be operating in (2) and (4) is to abbreviate expressions of the form " $\{\omega\in\Omega\,|\, Z(\omega)= y\}$ ", where $Z$ is a random variable and $y\in\mathbb{R}$ or $y\in\mathbb{R}^n$ , in favor of some notation that mentions only " $Z$ " and " $y$ ". This is enough of a concordance to decipher the quotations in the question and to see the equivalence in the intended meanings . Although the mathematically more rigorous notation is more explicit, and (hopefully) less subject to misinterpretation, it also grows cumbersome and--taken to an extreme--becomes almost unreadable. Good expository writing is a compromise between being explicit and being readily understandable. Reference Halmos, Paul, Naive Set Theory. Princeton, NJ: D. Van Nostrand Company, 1960.
