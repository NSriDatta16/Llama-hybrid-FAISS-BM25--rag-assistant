How to detect if JavaScript is disabled?

There was a post this morning asking about how many people disable JavaScript. Then I began to wonder what techniques might be used to determine if the user has it disabled. Does anyone know of some short/simple ways to detect if JavaScript is disabled? My intention is to give a warning that the site is not able to function properly without the browser having JS enabled. Eventually I would want to redirect them to content that is able to work in the absence of JS, but I need this detection as a placeholder to start.
