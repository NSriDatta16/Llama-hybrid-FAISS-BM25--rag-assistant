As I understand it, you have nested data: 8 males, that differ in rank multiple females for each male multiple data points (copulations) for each male-female pair This model can be estimated just fine, e.g. (using lme4 ) glmer(call_present ~ 1 + male_rank + (1|female_id), family = binomial) The intercept term that varies across females, (1|female_id) , captures how the log-odds of a call occuring for female $f$ , who is paired with male $m$ , differs from the average log-odds for all females paired with that male.
