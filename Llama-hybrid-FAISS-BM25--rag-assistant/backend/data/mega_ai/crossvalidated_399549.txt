This does not appear to be the best way to test your hypothesis. In fact, there is a very simple way to test your hypothesis: You should just run model b, where time is a dummy variable indicating whether you are in the second time period. Then you can test whether the coefficient on time is significantly different from zero, just using a simple t test. Of course, the controls (age, sex, etc) you include matter, they should capture all the relevant differences in sampling. More importantly, note that this procedure will test a slightly different hypothesis: Whether, conditional on your controls the average preference has changed. For example, let's say for comparable persons, attitudes towards Q have not changed at all. Thus, running model B will result in an estimate of approximately zero. Probably this is the effect you are interested in. However, say old people like Q much more than young people. If average age goes up a lot, average attitudes will thus improve. If you want to include those indirect effect in your estimates (as your questions suggests), you can insert the average values at t1 (for age and sex) into model B (with estimated coefficients) and thus calculate the conditional expectation at time t1 (insert zero for time). Note that these should not be the averages in your sample but rather in the population (so look them up somewhere else). Compare that to inserting the averages for time t2 and inserting time=1. This is the best estimate of how the average attitude has changed over time.
