Why might k-means be inappropriate for contextual time series data?

Why is k-means not considered a good option to use for time series data? I have read answers saying it is not a good option, but none that describe why. Let's say we have a time series data of a shop just for one day. On the x-axis, we have a range of 24 hours. On the y-axis the number of sold shirts. Let's make the data contextual as well. Say, the number of sales at 10:00 and 15:00 are really high. Why would using k-means be a bad idea here?
