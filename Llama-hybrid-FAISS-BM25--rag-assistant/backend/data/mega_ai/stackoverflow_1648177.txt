OU is created through AD Users and Computers tool - by clicking on New->Organization Unit and a CN node is created by doing New->User or New->Computer as needed. If you are using softerra LDAP Admin tool then you need to do New Entry on the node and select the user/computer or your own custom schema class to proceed. You can also do this using ldif import command : ldifde. CN is the leaf entry and can only have another CN under it. So you can have a CN under OU but not other way round.
