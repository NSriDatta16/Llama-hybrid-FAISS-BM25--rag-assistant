Dragonfly question

I tried switching from gem rails 3.0.0.rc to rails 3.0.0 in my Gemfile recently and when doing so I got a problem with Dragonfly when starting the server. The error message says: /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/aws-s3-0.6.2/lib/aws/s3/extensions.rb:206:in `const_missing': uninitialized constant Dragonfly::Config::HerokuRailsImages (NameError) from /Users/erikostling/Spatziba/config/initializers/dragonfly.rb:4 Switching back to RC doesn't help. Does anyone have an idea on what is wrong? My dragonfly.rb looks like this: require "dragonfly" app = Dragonfly::App[:images] app.configure_with(Dragonfly::Config::HerokuRailsImages, "static.my-app-domain.com") app.parameters.default_format = :jpg Dragonfly.active_record_macro(:image, app) Any help would be greatly appreciated!
