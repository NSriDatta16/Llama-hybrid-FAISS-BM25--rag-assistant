Grid of Buttons on iPhone that Can be Dragged Over

I am looking to create a simple colour palette, and have setup a grid of buttons in interface builder. I'd like a user to be able to interact with the palette (buttons), by selecting any button, then drag the finger between buttons (firing events on entering and exiting a button and changing the selected colour with each event). Is this possible? For example, the user touches down on a blue button (the color is updated), then drags the finger over to a green button (the color is updated). The "Touch Drag Enter" and "Touch Drag Exit" events appear to only fire if a user's initial selection was on the sender (does not allow dragging between two buttons). Thanks!
