Estimate the mean, variance and correlation separately to make off-diagonal elements of covariance matrix "identically distributed"?

I have a $d$ -dimensional data with $n$ observations. So the matrix for the dataset is $d\times n$ . One possible way to fit the data is to assume that each column is a random sample from a multivariate normal distribution so I could use MLE or Bayesian method to estimate the mean vector and the covariance matrix. However, I am looking for a model to make the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix "identically distributed" -- that's the property I want. To better illustrate, my naive solution is to estimate the mean, variance and correlation separately. To be specific, I would like to assume that the means of each element in the random vector, $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_d$ are sampled from a distribution, for example, $F_1 = N(0, \sigma)$ . And the standard deviation of each element, $\sigma_1^2, \dots, \sigma_d^2$ are also sampled from another distribution, say $F_2$ . And in the correlations of each two elements, $r_{12}, r_{13}, \dots, r_{d(d-1)}$ are also sampled from a distribution $F_3$ . Then I could use the dataset to estimate the three distribution separately. It seems that each of the three distribution has nothing to do with the other two. In particular, the covariance of element $i$ and $j$ from the random vector could be expressed as $\sigma_i\sigma_jr_{ij}$ where $\sigma_i, \sigma_j\sim F_2$ and $r_{ij}\sim F_3$ -- "identically distributed". I know it sounds weird. But if I could model the dataset in this way, it would greatly faciliate my future analysis. Unfortunately, I could not find any reference regarding this method. The closest related reference I could find is about how a standard Wishart random matrix is generated -- by sampling $d$ independent $\chi^2$ variables and $\frac{d(d-1)}{2}$ independent standard normal variables. However, the off-diagonal elements of the covariance are no longer "identically distributed". I was wondering whether my proposal plausible or is there a better way to make the off-diagonal elements "identically distributed"? Thank you guys for your help!
