Return @@RowCount in LINQ to SQL INSERT

I am in the process of migrating some legacy code to LINQ to SQL and I am having some difficulty with the following Stored Procedure. BEGIN INSERT INTO tblCMOEncounterHeader ( submitter_organization_id, submission_date, begin_posting_date, end_posting_date, number_of_records_transmitted) VALUES ( @submitter_organization_id, @submission_date, @begin_posting_date, @end_posting_date, @number_of_records_transmitted) RETURN @@ROWCOUNT END Specifically, what does @@ROWCOUNT return when partnered with an INSERT ? How would I accomplish the same thing in LINQ?
