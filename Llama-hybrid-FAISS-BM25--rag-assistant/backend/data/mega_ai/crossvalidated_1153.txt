Here is a simple R function that will find time series outliers (and optionally show them in a plot). It will handle seasonal and non-seasonal time series. The basic idea is to find robust estimates of the trend and seasonal components and subtract them. Then find outliers in the residuals. The test for residual outliers is the same as for the standard boxplot -- points greater than 1.5IQR above or below the upper and lower quartiles are assumed outliers. The number of IQRs above/below these thresholds is returned as an outlier "score". So the score can be any positive number, and will be zero for non-outliers. I realise you are not implementing this in R, but I often find an R function a good place to start. Then the task is to translate this into whatever language is required. tsoutliers 1) resid 0] 0] tsp(x2)
