How to load apk on device file system and start

I need to know how to load an application into a tablet where all I can do is a file transfer into the file storage area. I am using a tablet that does not have good eclipse usb integration, but I can put the file somewhere on the device, can someone please indicate where I need to place the apk and steps to load it after that. It is android 2.1 tablet Thanks
