Difference-in-Differences Estimator for Logistic Regressions

I have a pre-post intervention study with four groups: 1) Pre-Intervention Control, 2) Pre-Intervention Treatment, 3) Post-Intervention Control, and 4) Post-Intervention Treatment. The outcome is a binary variable. There four other predictor variables. I am reanalyzing a previous study. In the previous study, they used a difference-in-differences estimator in a logistic regression, while controlling for the four predictors. With the indicators for Treatment and Time, the model is: $$\mbox{logit}(Pr(y=1 | \mbox{Time}, \mbox{Treat}))=\alpha_0\mbox{Time}+\alpha_1\mbox{Treat}+\alpha_2\mbox{Time}\cdot\mbox{Treat}+\beta x$$ However, reviewing the literature surrounding DiD estimators, it appears that using the DiD estimators in a logit regression (any regression with a nonlinear link function), results in the common trend assumption be violated. You can think of how there can't possibly be a common trend on the predicted outcome because it has support between 0 and 1. In addition, depending on where baseline was, differences on the index value (the stuff inside the logit function), can result in different margins on the probability of y. If baseline was somewhere in the middle, small difference on the index value would drastically change predicted probability, while if baseline started high, the differences would be minimal. So what is the practical solution here? How should I go about reanalyzing this data? What can I do, practically, to still be able to draw a causal conclusion based on the DiD estimator and the already established study design? Any ideas?
