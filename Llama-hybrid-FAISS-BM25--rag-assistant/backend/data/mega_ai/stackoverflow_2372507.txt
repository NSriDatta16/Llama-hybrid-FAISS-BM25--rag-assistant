Project compiles and links cleanly after the following troubleshooting: I defined BOOST_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC - to see what diagnostic output I could get from the auto linker. Not too informative: 1>Linking to lib file: libboost_date_time-vc80-mt-1_42.lib 1>LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'libboost_date_time-vc80-mt-1_42.lib' I then defined BOOST_ALL_NO_LIB=1 - disables all auto linking. Project now compiles and links cleanly. Boost headers use pragma to signal compilers when to look for a lib file. While the date_time library does not do this, other headers within boost it depends on do.
