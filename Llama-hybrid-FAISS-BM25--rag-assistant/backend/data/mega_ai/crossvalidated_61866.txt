Testing a relationship between a continuous predictor and binomial outcome

I am testing a relationship between a continuous predictor and a binomial 0-1 outcome variable. My hypothesis is that the smaller the value of the predictor the more likely it is to fall into group 0 of the outcome variable. My question is - How can I measure this specific relationship? I ONLY want to see if smaller numbers are more likely to fall into 0 category, and disregard the cases where higher numbers may fall into 0 category as well. So far I was using the Binomial Logistic Regression in SPSS, but that tests the relationship between the value of the predictor and falling into 0 or 1 categories of the outcome. But I want to test the relationship only between smaller values of the predictor and falling into [0,1]. I don't want the cases of high predictors that fall into 0 to worsen my results. Also, deleting those cases is not an option because I need them for other hypotheses.
