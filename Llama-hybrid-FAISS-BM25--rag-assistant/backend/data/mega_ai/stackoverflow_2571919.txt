Well, you're correct that your database structure is the problem. You could create an SQL query, which contains subqueries, each one passing over the same table and pulling out information about each tag field. However, I'd suggest two alternatives: Just make 5 different queries. Unless you specifically need this information in one SQL query (which seems unlikely), it's going to be much simpler to just make 5 requests to the DB and then organise the information programatically Fix your DB structure to use join tables. I'd hazard a guess that this is just the first of any number of problems that you're going to come across because of this DB structure. By join tables, you're looking at 2 extra tables: CREATE TABLE code_tags { code_id INT, tag_id INT } CREATE TABLE tags { id INT, other fields } Instead of having tagX fields in your code tables, you use the join table to add tags
