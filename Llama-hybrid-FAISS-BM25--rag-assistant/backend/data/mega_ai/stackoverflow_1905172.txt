SSRS - Unable to determine if the owner of job has server access [SQLSTATE 42000] (Error 15404))

SQL Server Reporting Services, in SSRS it seems like Schedules never fire, however a look at the SQL Agent reveals a permission issue related to not being able to resolve a user account. Seems SQL Agent does not rely on caching or whatever voodoo Windows magically works. link text Fix is listed here... edit -- Above is the fix I used to workaround this issue, has any one found any other work arounds or resolutions to this issue? It seems that by default the SSRS Generated Schedules are run as this phantom user account. How do I change this default? Is SSRS creating the jobs as the user the service runs as? Thanks Remus
