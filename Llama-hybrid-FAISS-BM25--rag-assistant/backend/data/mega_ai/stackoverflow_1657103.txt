Regular expression Unix shell script

I need to filter all lines with words starting with a letter followed by zero or more letters or numbers, but no special characters (basically names which could be used for c++ variable). egrep '^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*' This works fine for words such as "a", "ab10", but it also includes words like "b.b". I understand that * at the end of expression is problem. If I replace * with + (one or more) it skips the words which contain one letter only, so it doesn't help. EDIT: I should be more precise. I want to find lines with any number of possible words as described above. Here is an example: int = 5; cout In that case it should print all of the lines above as they all include at least one word which fits the described conditions, and line does not have to began with letter.
