Comparing sets of noisy discontinuous curves / histograms

I have a dataset composed of measurements of signal intensity along a line; visually they look roughly like the right half of this: Each sample is a discontinuous "curve" composed of roughly 600 binned values (pixels), and they are fairly noisy, with lots of little jaggies. I want to compare a set of samples from a control group with a set from an experimental group, and see if, on average, the distribution maintains the same shape or has a fatter tail (the peak is expected to stay in the same place). By eye they look slightly different, but I would like a formal statistical test of this. Unfortunately, I have a limited statistics background and I have no idea how to do this. Someone in my group suggested a Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test, but first of all I'm not sure if that's appropriate for this type of data (discontinuous) and second of all I can't figure out how to apply it to sets of replicates. Numerically the data sort-of resembles a histogram, and discussions of comparing histograms often mention the chi-square test, but I don't know how well that would deal with hundreds of bins (and I don't want to change the binning unless it's absolutely necessary), and again I can't figure out how to handle replicates. (Simply averaging them seems like a bad idea; I'd prefer not to lose the sample-to-sample variability.)
