How you do it depends on the operating system and browser and what you are testing. If you are testing non-HTML content that runs in the browser (eg flash), then with IE, you must change your machine's location as IE picks it up from there. With Firefox, browse to about:config, accept the "Here be dragons" warning and edit the general.useragent.locale value. If you are testing what version of a page is returned based on local, then you need to specify the lanuge (in Firefox, tools -> options menu -> content tab -> choose button in languages section and add the correct country code)
