Disable GCC "may be used uninitialized" on a particular variable

I'm getting this warning on a stack variable: warning: object.member may be used uninitialized in this function In this case I do not wish to force initialization to just to get rid of the warning as it consumes CPU cycles. The variable is a POD structure so a memset on it is not zero cost. I can verify that the variable is never used uninitialized, so I'd just like to suppress the warning for it. In general I do want the warning, just not on this particular variable in this particular scenario. How can I suppress the warning? Looks like the pragma diagnostics are the correct way to go but they require quite a recent version of GCC (4.6) No acceptable solution prior that version is known.
