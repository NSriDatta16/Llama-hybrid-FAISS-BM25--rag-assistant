There's a good number of 'Big Ticket' items here, but we'll start from the core functionality. DB Tasks: Enumerating the Tables For each table- enumerate relationships. Abstract above functionality for each DB type you wish to deal with. UI Tasks: Lay out tables (simple same size boxes) draw lines for each relationship Implement Drag & Drop - redraw relationship lines on drop. Now, this doesn't deal with nice curved lines, and routing those lines nicely It also doesn't deal with the table columns, so all the table 'boxes' in the UI are the same size, which simplifies layout. But this level of functionality is a good goal as a proof of concept. If this is for a client, in a professional capacity, dont waste your time on it. However if it is for the learning experience then go for it! There's lots of nice nuggets to be gained from a project like this that you will use again and again in your programming career. hope this helps!
