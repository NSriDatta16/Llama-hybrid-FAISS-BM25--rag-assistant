How can you stop a Winforms Panel from scrolling?

If you put a DataGridView that is 400 pixels high on a panel that's 300 pixels high, so that there's a scroll bar on the panel, then scroll down so that the lower half of the grid is shown, then click on a control outside the panel, then click on a line in the grid, the panel scrolls up to the top and the wrong row in the grid is selected. It's not just a DataGridView; it happens with any control that's higher than the panel, eg Infragistics UltraWinGrid, Rich Text Box. I raised it as a bug with Infragistics, but they say it's a Microsoft issue. I've tried using all the relevant events for the controls, but the Panel scroll happens before the events fire. Any suggestions?
