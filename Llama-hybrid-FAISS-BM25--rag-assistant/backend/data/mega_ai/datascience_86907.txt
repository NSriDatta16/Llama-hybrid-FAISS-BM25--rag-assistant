If I understood correctly, you will eventually have, after some time, those user ratings right? So, assuming that you will have some labeled data (i.e. user ratings together with the features you say) to train with, you can build a multivariate regression model (you can have a first look at linear models to begin with). This approach is similar to what you have said in your option 3 , where you would like to find ideal weights for each of your "attributes" (the features you said like shares, interaction time, comments...), and that is what you get by building that multivariate regression model : where the predicted value is the user rating you want, each of the x1, x2... are your features and the w1, w2... the weights you want to find. This is a quick model type to train and easy to follow; later on, you can go on with a neural network or something el se more sophisticated in case you need it.
