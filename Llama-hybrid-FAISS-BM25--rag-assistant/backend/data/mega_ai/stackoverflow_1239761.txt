Strategy for Crowd Sourcing and Iterative Development

I've recently gotten involved with a web-based crowd sourcing project. I have two main issues, both with several subquestions. Any insight into any of these questions would be greatly appreciated. 1) Do you guys recommend going through a closed beta testing period? Or encourage as many people as you can to use the site? If the site is completely user content generated, then a private beta is probably better. -- How many people so I pick for this beta? Do I pick one use case, multiple use cases, or all the use cases I can think of? What are ways of online advertising to get the word out there? For sites such as TechCrunch and Digg, is it better to have a more established user base, or should I go through from the getgo? 2) Once you have your product launched, how often do you guys iterate on the public site? I know that I should keep my current version separate from the version that is currently being used by the users -- what tools do people use to do this kind of development?
