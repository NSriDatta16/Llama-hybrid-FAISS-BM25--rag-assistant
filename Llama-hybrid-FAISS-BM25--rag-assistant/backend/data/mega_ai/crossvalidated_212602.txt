The trend $c(n)$ does not have to be a linear trend, or monotonic. The trend, in this case, can be seen as a slowly-varying component in comparison to $r(n)$ that carries information about global changes in the time series $y(n)$. The time series with trend and fluctuation superimposed would like this: Where the trend $c(n)$ is a part of a sine function, and the fluctuation $r(n)$ is zero-mean white Gaussian noise (See Matlab code below). As you can see in the matlab script below, if I run 1000 realizations of $y(n)$ and estimate stat = cov(c,r)/var(r), the following histogram of "stat" is obtained: We have evidences the expected value of cov(c,r)/var(r) is zero, and it does not fluctuates to far from zero either. Why? Perhaps due to the fact $c(n)$ can be considered to be approximately constant in comparison to $r(n)$ in short intervals, and due to this property of covariance $cov(\sum_i X_i, \sum_j Y_j) = \sum_i \sum_j cov(X_i , Y_j )$ it should be, in this case, approximately zero? (as the covariance with a constant is zero). number_of_samples = 1000; % number of time instants to consider initial_time = 1; final_time = 100; n = linspace(initial_time,final_time,number_of_samples); % Amplitude of r(n) and c(n) set to be the same amplitude_term = 3; % Run 1000 realizations of the process for i = 1:1000 r = amplitude_term*normrnd(0,1,1,length(n)); % trend c(n) doesn't have to be monotonic c = amplitude_term*sin((0.0085)*2*pi*n + rand(1)); % time series: superposition of r and c y = c + r; % estimating cov(c,y)/var(r) stat_to_estimate(i) = mean((c - mean(c)).*(r - mean(r)))/var(r); end hist(stat_to_estimate)
