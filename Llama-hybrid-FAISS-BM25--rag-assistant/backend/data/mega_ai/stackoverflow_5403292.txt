I often combine SELECT/CASE with IF/END IF. The first one to catch a range, then second one to do similar things with the range, but maybe with small differences. Dim Result As Integer = 1 Select Case Result Case 0 To 3 SaveOrder() '0 to 3 is success If Result <> 0 AndAlso Result <> 3 Then '1 and 2 = Everything ok SendCustomerMesage(0) Else '0 and 3 = Order OK, but no stock in storage SendCustomerMesage(1) End If Case 4 To 8 '4 to 8 is error InformCustomer(value) Case Else HandleError(value) End Select
