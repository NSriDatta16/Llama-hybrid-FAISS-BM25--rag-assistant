As a closed form solution has already been proposed, here is a relatively simple numerical algorithm to arrive at an answer as well. Generate a random uniform deviate between 0 and 1. Use this value in a software supplied Normal random deviate inversion algorithm to create a Normal deviate, say $Y_i$ , for a Normal distribution with associated mean = $μ_y$ and sigma = $σ_y$ . If $Y_i$ ≥ t, keep the sample point, otherwise return to Step 1. Compute $E[X|Y = Y_i ]$ per the well known formula $\mathbb E[X | Y_i ] = \mu_x + ρ\frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}(Y_i -\mu_y) $ . Source see, for example, this education reference . Repeat starting at Step 1 for a large number of iterations. Finally, calculate the average of all values obtained in Step 4. Note, one can easily adjust Step 3 in this Monte Carlo simulation approach to handle more complex cases (like a range).
