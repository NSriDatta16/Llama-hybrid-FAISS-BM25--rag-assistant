Policy iteration: Cost-to-go function and Q-factor difference?

I am currently reading the "Neural Networks and learning Machines" by Simon Haykins book. In chapter 12 on policy iteration I don't really see the two differences between the cost-to-go function and the Q-factor: $J^{\mu_n}(i)= c(i,\mu_n(i)) + \gamma \sum_{j=1}^N p_{ij}(\mu_n(i))J^{\mu_n}(j)$ $Q^{\mu_n}(i,a)= c(i,a) + \gamma \sum_{j=1}^N p_{ij}(a)J^{\mu_n}(j)$ Where $a = \mu_n(i)$ all according to the book. To me both functions are really saying and doing the exact same thing. I understand that $a$ is an additional variable of $Q$ but in essence since there is an individual J/Q for each $\mu_n$ both functions just do the same thing.Can someone help me out on what I am missing here
