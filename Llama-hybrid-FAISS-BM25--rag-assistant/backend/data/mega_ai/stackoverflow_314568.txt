Deprecated features features that are superseded and should be avoided. Although they remain in the JDK, they are discouraged as there are better methods available. The methods are left in the API to support backward compatibility, but should generally be avoided as they could be removed in future versions of the API. It is technically ok to use deprecated methods, but generally the reason it was deprecated in the first place was that a better/faster/cleaner API has been developed.
