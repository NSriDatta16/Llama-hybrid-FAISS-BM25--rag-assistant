Unfortunately, there is no way to list all available embedded fonts in ActionScript 2, as there is with Font.enumerateFonts() in ActionScript 3. You can only get a list of the fonts that are installed on a user's computer via TextField.getFontList(). You could, however, manually supply a list of available font names (perhaps in xml) and load it into the main SWF. Then you could compare font names to this list every time you use an embedded font, and substitute a default font or even use a substitution map, if the desired one is not available. It's not quite as elegant as automatically getting a complete list from the content, but it should do the trick without having to recompile your main app.
