Optimization program to allocate time series in 2 groups

I am trying to dispatch $m$ time series into 2 groups. Then I want to sum the value for each time steps, to obtain a sum per group. My goal is to minimize the standard deviation of the difference between the 2 groups. In other word, there can be an offset between the 2 groups but they need to vary simultaneously. More mathematically assume that one has $m$ time series of length $n$ points. $$x_i^g, i \epsilon [0,n], g \epsilon [0,m]$$ I want to find $y_g \epsilon \{-1,1\}$ such that $ Var(z_i) $ is minimized with $$ z_i = \sum_{g} y_g*x_i^g = \sum_{y_g=1} x_i^g - \sum_{y_g=-1} x_i^g$$ Is there any algorithms that I could use? I am working with python, my current option is to use scipy and implement this custom objective. Thanks
