Every exception let the test fail. So you can use your own exceptions to break your Unit test. If you read the source code, a assertXXX will throw an Exception to the TestRunner. So Unit tests are build upon exceptions. Mocking is definitely nothing to avoid. It's good, because it may encourage isolation of your tests.
