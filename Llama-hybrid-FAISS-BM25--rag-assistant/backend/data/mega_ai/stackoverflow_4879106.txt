Cannot create correct ad hoc build of app

I am trying to distribute my application to a beta tester. I believe that I have followed the ad hoc distribution process to a T but I my tester is having issues when trying to install. The error being "Could not install, invalid entitlements" or something to that effect. I have generated a distribution certificate. I have generated a ad hoc provisioning certificate referencing my distribution certificate, my app id, it's marked as an ad hoc distribution and the devices are selected (I regenerated just to be sure). I downloaded the certificate and profile and installed in Xcode and the keychain as needed. My app id in the info.plist is the same as the one in the profile (with the exception of the 10 character Apple generated prefix). I went to Xcode and created a dist.plist and unchecked the get task allowed value. I created an Ad hoc distribution configuration and set the code signing identity to the one I just down loaded. Build clean. Build and archive. Shared it using Organizer. Emailed the .IPA and the mobileprovision file to the beta tester. It is probably a forest for the trees type of thing. And that's where my tragic story ends. I've read everything I can find and I appear to be following the steps. Obviously I am missing something.
