@Jenko if what you're looking for something similar to an IDE debugger, in that case Internet Explorer 8 and 9 have a built-in Developer Tools (press F12) and Chrome has Developer Tools as well. Both IE and Chrome allow you to set breakpoints in your code and step through it while it's running. Firefox has Firebug, which others have mentioned, and it too allows to set breakpoints and examine the execution of your code. Opera has Dragonfly (built-in) and has the same features as the other browsers.
