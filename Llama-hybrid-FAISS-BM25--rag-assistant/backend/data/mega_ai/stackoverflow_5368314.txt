Android: Canvas.drawText() text size on different screen resolutions

For my Android game I have some calls to Canvas.drawText() . For testing, I use the standard font size which seems to be working fine. However, when I bump up the resolution to a higher density, the larger images are automatically loaded but the text is now incredibly small. Is there an easy way to calculate what size the text should be drawn at or am I bound to do this manually? edit: What was the point of editing my post @Suragch ?
