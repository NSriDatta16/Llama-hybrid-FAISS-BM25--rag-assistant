What you want to do is put Dragon in A, and if you want to select ALL records from A regardless of if they have a matching record in AtoB, do a LEFT OUTER JOIN. Something like this: SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN AtoB ON A.id = AtoB.A_ID Edit: This would only work if you could add your new records to A. I missed the fact that you are not able to. I think Arthur Thomas's solution is what you want.
