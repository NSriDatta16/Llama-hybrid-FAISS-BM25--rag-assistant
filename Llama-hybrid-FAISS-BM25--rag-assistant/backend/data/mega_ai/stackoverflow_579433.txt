This is a 2 fold process, first the upload itself and then the manipulation on the server. The first validation would be to make sure the file was even uploaded. For that you can use after the line $fileName = $_FILES['userfile']['name']; Use: if(is_uploaded_file($fileName)) { // Here goes all the file manipulation/storage/etc } else { echo 'Error: File could not be uploaded.'; } Try to use that and maybe re-post if the file was actually uploaded. Just because $_FILES has content it does not necessarily mean that the file was uploaded to the server.
