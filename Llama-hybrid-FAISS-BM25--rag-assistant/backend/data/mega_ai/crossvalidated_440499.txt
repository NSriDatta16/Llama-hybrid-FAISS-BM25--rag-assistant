The reason to include polynomial terms of a variable (e.g., time) into your model is when the relationship between the (transformed) mean of your outcome and this variable in nonlinear. In your particular case, and because you fit a mixed-effects logistic regression, you postulate that the log odds of your dichotomous/binomial outcome are related nonlinearly with the time variable. The question of whether it is required to include such a term into your model depends on the dataset. I.e., for some outcomes, a simple linear relationship between the log odds and time may be adequate, whereas, in other datasets, the relationship may be nonlinear. Including the interaction with treatment in the model means that the log odds for the different treatment groups have different nonlinear profiles over time. Finally, to model nonlinear relationships splines are better than polynomials.
