Resampling methods that attempt to produce balanced data sets are popular. Concretely SMOTE , which creates new samples that follow the distribution of present samples. Resampling methods may also be used together with ensemble methods (like bootstrapping) in order to increase accuracy. Since it is hard to fit many models under that setting properly, one option is to do novelty detection: learn about the distribution of 1's and find a threshold that provides good accuracy on the test set. For example, you may use SVM's for novelty detection .
