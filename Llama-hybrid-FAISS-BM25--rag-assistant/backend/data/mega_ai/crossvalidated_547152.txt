BLACK-BOX MODEL That is the closest that I can think to what you describe. However, a "black-box model" is not necessarily useless. While many applications want to know how the model works, there are some situations where just getting the right answer is the crucial aspect. The name comes from the idea of throwing data into a black box, so that seeing in is impossible, and it pops out an answer; the inability to see inside the black box to see how it makes its predictions is critical. One popular example of a black-box model is a neural network, which can give extremely accurate predictions (look at MNIST performance) but is hard to interpret.
