Testing for unit roots

I am an absolute beginner and I need help on testing for unit-roots in Stata. As the data is unbalanced (no missing values, but some time series begin later than others) it seems to me that I could only use either the Fisher-type unit-root test or the Im-Pesaran-Shin unit-root test. I have 41 panels and data for 10 years. I am wondering which test to use and would greatly appreciate any help!
