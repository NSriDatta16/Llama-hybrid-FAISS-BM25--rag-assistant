To remove the sub query in the SELECT statement I suggest the following: SELECT list_name, app_name, map.fname + ' ' + map.lname as agent_login, input, convert(varchar,dateadd(ss, TAC_BEG_tstamp, '01/01/1970)) FROM dbo.maps_report_list inner join (dbo.report_tac_agent as tac inner join dbo.d_agent_define as map ON (tac.agent_id=map.agent_id)) ON list.list_id = tac.list_id WHERE input = 'SYS_ERR' and app_name = 'CHARLOTT' and convert(varchar,dateadd(ss,day_tstamp,'01/01/1970'),101) = '09/10/2008' and list_name LIKE 'NRBAD%' order by agent_login,convert(varchar,dateadd(ss,TAC_BEG_tstamp,'01/01/1970')) I used parentheses to create the inner join between dbo.report_tac_agent and dbo.d_agent_define first. This is now a set of join data. The combination of those tables are then joined to your list table, which I am assuming is the driving table here. If I am understand what you are trying to do with your sub select, this should work for you. As stated by the other poster you should use table names on your columns (e.g. map.fname), it just makes things easy to understand. I didn't in my example because I am note 100% sure which columns go with which tables. Please let me know if this doesn't do it for you and how the data it returns is wrong. That will make it easier to solve in needed.
