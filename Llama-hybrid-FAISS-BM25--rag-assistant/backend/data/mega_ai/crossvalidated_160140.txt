Calculating a "grand" mean and standard error can mean several different things, depending on the exact assumptions on your data and what you want the final "error" to represent. This is a complicated problem in general. For example, if some measurement have much larger errors than others, the "grand mean" should by driven more by the measurements with high certainty, so we don't want to just average the means. Here is a decent set of notes that goes through this issues in great detail: http://www.nist.gov/itl/sed/training/upload/combine-1.pdf Discussion of how to combine means and errors starts around page 26.
