What type of analysis for multivariate regression of high-dimensional longitudinal data?

I have a longitudinal dataset with few time points (N=10) and few subjects (N=10). Both independent/predictor and dependent/response variables are high-dimensional (N ~ 100 for both types of variable). Both independent and dependent variables are time series (N=10). I'm interested in determining which independent variables predict (are associated with) which dependent variables. I wonder what type of analysis I should run both at the group level and individual level (i.e. a separate analysis for each subject). Can you recommend specific statistical approaches for the 2 types of analyses along with R packages that implement them?
