One solution would be to use a profile (that could be indeed activated by an environment variable) and to exclude GUI tests from the Maven Surefire Plugin configuration using excludes in this profile, based on a naming convention. Something like this: headless env.FOO foo ... org.apache.maven.plugins maven-surefire-plugin 2.5 **/*$* **/gui/** ... Another option would be to use TestNG and to leverage the excludeGroups parameter.
