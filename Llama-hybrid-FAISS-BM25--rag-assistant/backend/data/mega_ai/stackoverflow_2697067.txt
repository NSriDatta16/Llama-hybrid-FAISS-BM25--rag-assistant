Symbolicate adhoc iphone app crashes

I can't manage to make my code symbolicated ... I read the part "below" : Given a crash report, the matching binary, and its .dSYM file, symbolication is relatively easy. The Xcode Organizer window has a tab for crash reports of the currently selected device. You can view externally received crash reports in this tab - just place them in the appropriate directory. This is the same as the Mac OS X directory described in the first section. It doesn't matter which device you have tethered, but the directory in which you place the crash report must be the directory for the tethered and selected device. It is not necessary to place the binary and .dSYM file in any particular location. Xcode uses Spotlight and the UUID to locate the correct files. It is necessary, though, that both files be in the same directory and that this directory is one that is indexed by Spotlight. Anywhere in your home directory should be fine. But it doesn't work for me ... here is what I did : I opened xcode organizer and I had my iphone device with crash logs App and dsym files are in my xcode project which is on my desktop All the rest should be automatic, right ? but crash logs aren't symbolicated yet ... Any comments welcome. Cheers. Gotye.
