What exactly is meant with "data parameters" in Bayesian hierarchical models?

Please excuse me if the question in unclear, but I am seeing much nomenclature for the first time and am somewhat confused. I am reading "Statistics for Spatio-temporal data" by Noel Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle, and I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly is intended as "data parameters" in this book. In the text, if $A$ is a random quantity, then $[A]$ is its probability distribution. On page 21, one reads: Consider three generic quantities of interest, $Z$ , $Y$ , and $\theta$ , in the HM [Hierarchical Model]; for expository purposes we often consider these simply to be random variables. Think of $Z$ as the data, $Y$ as a (hidden) process that we wish to predict, and $\theta$ as unknown parameters. [...] Based on $Z$ , we wish to make inference on $Y$ and $\theta$ . This seems logic. The next section, $2.1.1$ , starts with The basic representation of a BHM [Bayesian Hierarchical Model] is obtained by splitting up the model into three levels (Berliner, 1996): Data model: $[Z\mid Y,\theta]$ Process model: $[Y\mid \theta]$ Parameter model: $[\theta]$ The part that is confusing to me comes next. [...] sometimes we write $[Z\mid Y, \theta_D]$ and $[Y \mid \theta_P]$ to emphasize the data-model parameters $\theta_D$ and the process-model parameters $\theta_P$ . Then $\theta = \{\theta_D, \theta_P\}$ and the parameter model is $[\theta_D, \theta_P]$ . This is confusing because I would have expected $Y$ to represent exactly the "data parameters", i.e. that random variable that governs the generation of $Z$ . What would be an example of BHM (possibly in a spatial setting) where the "data-model parameters" are different from the process itself? Could these for example be nuisance parameters? But then do we really "wish to make inference" on them?
