If I understand correctly your dataset, you have 484 observations (rows). These observations are structured in a way such that there is: at least one categorical variable such as ID_doer which is a name of someone doing something at least a factor (ordinal) variable as exposure , which is the feature that some doers have and others have not (or, they have it on different levels of exposure). an outcome variable which is your dependent variable If this is the case, given the formula outcome ~ exposure + ID_doer you can look at the relationship between the exposure feature and your outcome feature, de-biasing the estimate of the concept express in exposure from the hidden, circumstantial, features fixed in the identity of who is doing stuff in your dataset. This formula would work for regressions in the stats package but not for other packages like plm or lme4 . Anyway, those are still quite intuitive; I think they require proper panel data to work, too. Basically you only have a hierarchical categorical variable, so you could be interested to further investigate hierarchical/multilevel models depends by the structure of your database. I would discourage to adopt fixed effects ("within estimation") if the average of observations per ID_doer is not sufficiently high, i.e. if there are more than 150 unique ID_doer in your dataset of 484 observations.
