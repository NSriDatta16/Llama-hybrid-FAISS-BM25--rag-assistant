Why not processing contours? you could take advantage of Poly (Ten-Chin) approximation and analyze only the few vectors resulting from the chain reconstruction. If you want to do more, then use a mixed pyramid/contour scheme, in order to get vectors approximations with different Level of Detail, starting from rough resolution up to finest. Stop the refinement when you get a "reasonable" number of unique segments, apply normalization (see Moments - Hu's Moments) to make a fingerprint of your sample, and finally adopt a strong classification system. I suggest you to look at ML (Machine Learning) part of OpenCV suite, for better reference on this latter part. For raster data, Haar's wavelets + Hidden Markovian Models work well, for vectors maybe you could use something less hard to setup (SOM, KNN, KMeans).
