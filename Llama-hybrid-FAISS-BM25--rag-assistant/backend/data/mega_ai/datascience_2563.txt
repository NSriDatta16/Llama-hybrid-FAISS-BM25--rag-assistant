Visualization of three-dimensional report

I have a visualization problem. Creating a comparison report of PR event efficiency. Say, show or exhibition. There are two dimensions of comparison: compare vs the same event performance in the past years compare vs another type of analogical/competitive events There is also a number of comparison aspects: Audience Media Coverage Social Buzz ROI .... etc Each aspect is a set of some final KPI-s (just numbers, which can be compared vs another "dimensions"), plus maybe some descriptive text and pictures (which couldn't be a metric but should be attached to the report). So finaly it looks like a three-dimensional coube: Years Another Events Aspects If I put it in plain Word or PPT it will look like a document with dozen of slides/papers and linear structure. Any ideas how to compile an elegant user-friendly report?
