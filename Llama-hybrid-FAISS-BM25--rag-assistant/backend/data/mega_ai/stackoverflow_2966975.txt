How to use Event notification in Solaris 10 when a directory changes?

I read Robert Benson's article " The Event Completion Framework for the Solaris Operating System " on ECF. I also read the Solaris man pages but they are not very clear of how to use event notifications for directories. For example, if I add a new file into a directory, I would like to get some notification of that event. I found " File Events Notification " which has what I need but it is for Solaris 11, which is not in the market yet. Based on " Event ports and performance ", I don't want to use poll because I want to get the performance advantage of events. Any suggestion is highly appreciated!
