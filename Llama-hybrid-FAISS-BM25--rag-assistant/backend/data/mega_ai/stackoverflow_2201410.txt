It looks like its a compiler warning and not an error, so it should still work. The compiler is just letting you know that you are doing something that makes it easy for you to screw up. It should be perfectly acceptable to do this as long as both DLLs and the core program agree on the definition of the base class. You should be able to use a pragma to supress the warning: http://forums.devx.com/archive/index.php/t-84785.html
