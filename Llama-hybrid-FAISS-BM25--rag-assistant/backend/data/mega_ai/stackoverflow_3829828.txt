By only sending the links to the javascript to the client a seperate HTTP request will have to be created in order to go and get each file. If you embed only the required javascript directly into the page when needed this prevents this. Look at jQuery, thats got a load of javascript available to the client that isn't being used. Less HTTP requests generally results in a faster website so I would go with embedding the code directly. Edit: I disagree with the caching answers above. If you ensure only the smallest amount of javascript that is required is embedded then my answer should be faster. This page will be cached too!
