You're looking for a named entity recognition system, or short NER. There are several good toolkits available to help you out. LingPipe in particular has a very decent tutorial . CAGEclass seems to be oriented around NER on geographical place names, but I haven't used it yet. If you're going with Java, I'd recommend using the LingPipe NER classes. OpenNLP also has some, but the former has a better documentation. If you're looking for some theoretical background, Chavez et al. (2005) have constructed an interesting system and documented it.
