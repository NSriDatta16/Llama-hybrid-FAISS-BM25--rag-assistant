You should consider creating a full blown EAR instead, if you want this to be web container independent. As different web applications have different classloaders you cannot just create an object in one web app which is immediately usable by another. Hence you need to have a common classloader which knows about the classes in common, and - to be 100% compliant - these classes may not be in either web apps WEB-INF/lib. This is hard to get right, and the result is fragile. Therefore consider migrating to a web container which can deploy EAR's instead as they may contain several web applications sharing objects. I believe a good choice for starting would be JBoss.
