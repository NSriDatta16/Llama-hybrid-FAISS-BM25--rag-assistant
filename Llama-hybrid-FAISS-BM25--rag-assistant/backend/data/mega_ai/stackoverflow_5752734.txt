You don't need to do anything special in the definition of MyObject . Just go straight ahead and type New MyObject(id:=10,buffer:=True) , assuming that the constructor has parameters called id and buffer . This means you can type the parameters in any order, you don't have to use the order in the declaration. See the VB manual . Personally I think this named parameter style is a bit old-fashioned, and it will make it hard for other developers to read your code, unless they're old like me and remember VB6. The style was common in VB6 with optional parameters, but IMHO (and according to Microsoft) in VB.Net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters.
