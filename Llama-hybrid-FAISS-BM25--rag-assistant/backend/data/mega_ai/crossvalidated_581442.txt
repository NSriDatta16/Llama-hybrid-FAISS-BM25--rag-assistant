Assuming you are referring to obtaining a visual representation of samples' variability/similarity, I think it really depends on the scope, but I'd probably favor t-SNE over PCA given that the data is perceptual and thus likely to contain non-linear patterns. Have you considered plotting embeddings of your images instead of the raw data? If you are applying auto-encoders or VAEs the latent representation could be a nice input for visualization. Also, if you go down the t-SNE path, you might want to check UMAP as well (this nice post could be a good starting point). Good luck with your thesis!
