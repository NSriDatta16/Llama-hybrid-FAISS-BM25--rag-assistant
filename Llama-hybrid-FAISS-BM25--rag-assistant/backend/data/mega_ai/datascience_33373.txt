LSTM -RNN : How to get continuous range output instead of categorical?

I am trying to solve a problem predicting a value between a range for a sentence: The dataset looks like this: Index_no text_sentence value 01 yes I like riding a bike. I was 4 when I learned 4.2311 to ride a bike. the colors of my bike is yellow and black. 02 i like riding my bike, i learnt riding a bike when i was 8 or -2.11 9 years old ,my bike is sparkling pink with white marks Range of values is -7 to 7. Now, I am thinking about using a LSTM for text, but I am confused about the continuous output. I was thinking about two methods: Converting (normalizing the data between 0 and 1) and then after getting the output from network, denormalize the data, will this work? Second approach, using a custom activation function? Or how can I get output between a range?
