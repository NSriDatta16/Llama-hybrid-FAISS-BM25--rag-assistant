Why does my logistic regression model fit probabilities numerically 0 or 1?

When I fit a logistic regression model with my data set, I get the warning "glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred", and the result for one of my dummy coefficients $x$ is nonsensical (extremely high estimate and variance). I'm aware that this warning usually indicates a perfect prediction problem, where the independent variable $x$ is perfectly separated by the dependent variable $y$ . In my case, the reason seems to be that $y$ has the same value for all cases where $x=1$ . However, in cases where $x=0$ , the values of $y$ vary and it sometimes takes on the same value as when $x=0$ . So $y$ doesn't perfectly separate $x$ , but still this is what causes the problem. When I change just one of the $y$ values for $x=1$ , the model estimation works fine. Why does this error occur in my case, if the perfect prediction problem isn't the cause? I'm not looking for a solution, I just want to understand the problem.
