Dude, you have an organizational problem, not a java problem. If the higer-ups don't want programmers hacking on the regular boxes, then you really shouldn't be trying to bypass the protection. Way to get in serious trouble. Do it the right way - speak to someone with the authority to get the jdk & eclipse (or netbeans, if you insist) installed. As a last resort - anyone who wants to learn java will have a home PC or a laptop. Just remember, if you have to use your home PC to learn java, then you owe your employer nothing by way of loyalty or obligation to use your new skills working for them.
