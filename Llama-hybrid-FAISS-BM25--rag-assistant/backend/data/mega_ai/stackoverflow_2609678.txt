The jQuery-UI Draggable works just fine for me and dead simple to set up. http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ It works with your scenario, I just tested it. Once you include jQuery and jQuery-UI do the following to turn your container DIV into a draggable DIV: //This makes sure that the code only runs once the whole //HTML document has been loaded into the Browser. $(document).ready(function(){ $("#container").draggable(); //Intialize the Draggable ability });
