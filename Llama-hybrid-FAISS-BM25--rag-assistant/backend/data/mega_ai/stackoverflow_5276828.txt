consultation about ANN libraries

Firstly, I am a beginner in artificial neural networks and I need a special library for training the artificial neural networks, but I very confused in the selection of the library, and since I didn't have the experience I wanted to consult you. I have read about three libraries: FANN, Flood, and Neuro Fusion libraries. So, what are you think about the easiest and Least problems library for using it with VC++.6?
