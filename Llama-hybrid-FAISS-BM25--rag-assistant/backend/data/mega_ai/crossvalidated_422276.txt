You could fit the logistic regression model with the IV of interest and the covariate that you want to control for. The coefficient for the IV of interest is the 'adjusted' log odds ratio (let's call this $\mbox{lnor}$ ), which you could convert to a d-value, either using $$y = \sqrt{3} / \pi \times \mbox{lnor}$$ or $$y = \mbox{lnor} / 1.65.$$ The former assumes that the dichotomous outcome is a dichotomized version of a continuous variable that follows a logistic distribution, while the latter assumes a normal distribution. The corresponding sampling variance of $y$ is $$\mbox{Var}[y] = 3 / \pi^2 \times \mbox{SE}[\mbox{lnor}]^2$$ or $$\mbox{Var}[y] = \mbox{SE}[\mbox{lnor}]^2 / 1.65^2,$$ where $\mbox{SE}[\mbox{lnor}]$ is the standard error of $\mbox{lnor}$ (which you can extract from the logistic regression model).
