I would take the advice of the code given in codeburger's post but to add to that you have other options (as it sounds like his code is not anything new in regards to a solution). Possible options include: indexing on both the sender_id (INT) and recipient_id (INT) to increase search time creating a separate table for each sender_id (that way when you know who the conversation is between - assuming it is only a 1 on 1 conversation - you can just pull from two tables where the ids are common) 3, my favorite idea, create an additional column that references a transaction database and keep a history of each transaction, indexed off the conversation number... it's probably the "worst" in some ways, but it's more my organizational style. if you have any questions, i can elaborate, in fact, i'll probably update this later once i get home
