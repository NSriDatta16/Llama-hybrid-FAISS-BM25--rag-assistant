The silhouette is computed for each observation $i$ as $s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max(a(i), b(i))}$ where $a(i)$ is the average dissimilarity with members of the cluster to which $i$ belongs, and $b(i)$ the minimum average dissimilarity to members of another cluster. The silhouette values of members of a cluster $k$ are at the same position as the values $k$ in the cluster membership vector cluster.object . So you do not have anything to do. Your seqIplot command will automatically produce one index plot for each cluster with the sequences sorted by their silhouette values in each cluster. Sequences will be sorted bottom up from the lower to the highest silhouette value, meaning that the sequences with the best silhouette values for each cluster are at the top of the plots. Hope this helps.
