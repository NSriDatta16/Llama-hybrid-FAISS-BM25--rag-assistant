Classic ASP: Page text translated from SQL table, a faster way?

Using classic ASP VBScript, coupled to MS SQL Server, we have a function that takes 3 integers, page_id , heading_id , language_id it looks up the page heading in a translation table... This table contains roughly 10,000 rows... The heading column is nvarchar(1000) plus the 3 int columns meaning it's around 2KiB per row max... so my question is, is it worth copying this table into memory (Application object for example) using ADO's GetRows or through another method, or is it not worth it due to the "large" data size. There are approximately 1 to 250 headings per page, 462 pages, with average of 34 headings/page. So to save ~34 database calls a page, I use a large chunk of memory, and calls to application, and possibly it's slower anyway? Thoughts?
