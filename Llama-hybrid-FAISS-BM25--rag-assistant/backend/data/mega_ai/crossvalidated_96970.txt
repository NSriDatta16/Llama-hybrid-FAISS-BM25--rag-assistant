Feature selection for classifier

I'm using a supervised machine learning algorithm on some big data. There is much more features than observations. To reduce the number of features, I would like to do some feature selection. However, there is one thing I'm confused about. May I do the feature selection first , using data from all observations, and then do the training and testing of the classifier?
