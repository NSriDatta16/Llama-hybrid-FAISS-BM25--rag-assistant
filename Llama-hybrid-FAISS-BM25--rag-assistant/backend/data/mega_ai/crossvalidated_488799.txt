I have found the answer on my question which can be explained geometrically very well. We know that the complementary condition of the KKT-conditions says: $$\alpha\geq0, \alpha(y_i(w^Tx_i + b) - 1) = 0$$ Therefore, in a KKT-Point at least one of the following cases happens: Case 1: $\alpha_i=0$ Case 2: $y_i(w^Tx_i +b) - 1 =0$ Furthermore, we know that the hyperplanes of the margins of the SVM have the following equations: $H_1 = \{x: w^Tx + b = 1\}$ $H_{-1} = \{x:w^Tx + b = -1\}$ using the margins the following halfspaces are created: $H_1^+ = \{x: w^Tx + b > 1\}$ $H_{-1}^- = \{x:w^Tx + b Thus for any $x_i:y_i=1$ and $x_i:y_i=-1$ that is correctly classified and does lie in the inner part of the correct halfspace we have: $$y_i(w^Tx_i +b) -1 > 0$$ Therefore, for these points "Case 2" is violated and therefore "Case 1" i.e., $\alpha_i = 0$ must be true, which means that $\alpha_i = 0$ for all points that are correctly classified and lie in the inner part of their halfspace. Hence, $\alpha_i$ can only be unequal to $0$ , if "Case 2" is true i.e. $y_i(w^Tx_i+b) - 1 = 0$ . And this is just true for $x \in H_1$ or $x \in H_{-1}$ which are the points that lie on on the hyperplanes of the margins. And this points are limited. Therefore, for the most points $\alpha_i = 0$ , except the points that lie in the margin which are limited.
