Android file copy

I am finding that reading one line at a time from a text file on the SD card is rather slow. I imagine that it might be quicker if the file is in internal memory, so I want to copy files from the SD card to internal storage. The file copy examples I can find on the web seem to involve copying one byte at a time from an InputStream to an OutputStream or from a FileReader to a FileWriter. Is this really the quickest and most efficient method?
