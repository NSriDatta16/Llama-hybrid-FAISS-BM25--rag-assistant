PCA's central output is the rotation matrix $\mathbf{W}$. This is a $p\times p$ matrix, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N\times p$ matrix of data. $\mathbf{W}$ contrains information on how to map the original data to their equivalent coordinates on the rotated space. If the new coordinates are $\mathbf{Z}$, then the transformation is $$ \mathbf{Z = XW} $$ Say you've got a new dataset $\mathbf{\tilde{X}}$ and you want to make it comparable to $\mathbf{Z}$. You'd do $$ \mathbf{\tilde{Z} = \tilde{X}W} $$ That is what predict.prcomp is doing.
