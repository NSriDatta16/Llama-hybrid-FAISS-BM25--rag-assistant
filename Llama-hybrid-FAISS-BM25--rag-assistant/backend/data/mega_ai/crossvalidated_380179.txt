How to test for constant mean over time with time series data

I have a data set that looks like it may not be stationary. As a test, I ran a linear regression of the data against an x variable that was an index of time, 1:400 periods. I saw that the slope coefficient was significant, so I decided the mean was not constant over time. Is this a legitimate procedure for time series data?
