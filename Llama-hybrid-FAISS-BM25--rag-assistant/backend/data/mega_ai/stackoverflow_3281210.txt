Moving projects files in a .NET project

It's not code-related but IDE related. I'm working on a .NET solution with about 35 different projects. These projects need to be re-organized into a new folder structure. Why? Because about 10 of those will be removed and the rest will be divided in more logical units. One way to do this is by creating a new solution, Drag&Drop the projects into a new folder tree within the Windows explorer and then just add them to the new solution. To be honest, that sounds dumb! Is there a way to just move projects into different folders from within the IDE? I've tried to "save as" the projects but the IDE won't accept a different folder. It's irritating but because there have been a few wrong choices in folder names, I'm now stuck with those names. Example: Right now I have a project main folder which contains child folders named "Client", "Server", "Business", "Database" and whatever more. Within those child folders, there are more child folders, each a three-digit number. Within each numbered folder there's a project which is named in some logical way, like Company.Business.Customers with additional logic within this project. The problem is that not all projects now follow this naming convention and I consider it obsolete. A project like Company.Business.Customers should just be in a folder named Company.Business.Customers in the project root so it's easier to recognize. The name already makes it clear that it's a business class for this project. The clear division within client classes, business classes and whatever more just needs to be arranged within the solution, but I want to flatten the file structure. (And remove some obsolete projects.) Basically, I'm not refactoring, I'm just cleaning up. VS2008 doesn't seem to have such an option, though...
