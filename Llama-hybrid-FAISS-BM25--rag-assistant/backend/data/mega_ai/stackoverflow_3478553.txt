Hey, it just so happens that not long ago, I wrote a c++ tic tac toe 'game' for a blog post. http://alongbutsimplenameformyblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/tic-tac-toe.html Here, I tried my best to write code compact, yet readable, and kept performance in mind. I got the program to be 32 lines of code. The only thing I'm not doing, is letting the game be 'playable'. If you look over my code, you'll be able to see a way to organize your game into a multi-dimensional array. The way you read it (assuming you're un-aware, sorry if I'm telling you things you know) is: arrayName[rowNumber][columnNumber]; So, in order to change the upper right box of tic tac toe to 'x' you would say: arrayName[0][2] = 'x'; Keeping in mind, when you use arrays, that it starts at element 0, not element 1. That's something I forgot when starting off, at the very least. So, hopefully reading my code, you'll be able to see how to check for a win condition fairly easily, in a function. If you have questions about how my code works, or anything further with how to implement this, feel free. I'll be back periodically. Also, as the school year starts in fall, I should be blogging more about stuff like this, when I'm helping first and second year students in my program. So feel free to bookmark or subscribe. #include const char grid[3][3] = {'x', ' ', 'o', 'o','x', 'o', 'x', 'x', 'o'}; inline const bool checkLine(char x, char y, char z) { return (x == y && y == z && x != ' '); } inline const bool checkWin(){ bool a = 0, b = 0; for(unsigned char i = 0; i
