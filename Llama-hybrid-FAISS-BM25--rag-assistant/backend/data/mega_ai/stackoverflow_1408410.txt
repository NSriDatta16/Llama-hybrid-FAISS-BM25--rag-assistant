Do you want to do word chaining or letter chaining? The PHP implementation you have above does letter chaning, which will tend towards gibberish, not just words seemingly out of place, at low order values. It looks like the rbot does word chaining, which implicitly generates more 'readable' text. Markov chaining is pretty simple to implement. I don't think it would be too hard to adapt the PHP source to split and chain by word instead of letter. I've been thinking of making a pure sql stored procedure which can take a table and generate a string.
