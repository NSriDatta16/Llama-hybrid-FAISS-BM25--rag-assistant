Finding the value of $k$ for an Uniform Distribution defined on $(-k,k)$

If $X$ be an uniform distribution defined on $(-k,k)$ , then the value of $k$ for so that : $$P(|X| 2)$$ I began by defining the $p.d.f$ of the Uniform function namely: $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2k}$$ Then we can re-write the LHS of the probability as : $$ P(|X| And the RHS : $$ P(|X|>2) = 1-P(|X| Now solving the probability by $integration$ we get: $$\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{2k} dx \ = 1 - \int_{-2}^{2}\frac{1}{2k}dx$$ $$\frac{1}{k} = 1 - \frac{2}{k}$$ And therefore $$k=3$$ Is my method and answer correct?
