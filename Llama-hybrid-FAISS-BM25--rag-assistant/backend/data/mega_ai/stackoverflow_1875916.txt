Unfortunately there is no way to achieve what you are looking for. Robert's suggestion of opening the file for writing solves a subset of the problem but does not solve the bigger issue which is The file system is best viewed as a multi-threaded object over which you have no synchronization capabilities No matter what synchronization construct you try to use to put the file system into a "known state", there is a way for the user to beat it. The best way to approach this problem is to process the files as normal and catch the exceptions that result from using files that are "in flight". This is the only sane way to deal with the file system.
