Why is my random effect down-weighing certain ORs?

I'm running a mixed-effect logistic regression using data from 21 different sites. One of my key variables of interest is a six-level factor variable. I've included a random effect of site into the model, as well to account for the clustering of respondents in each site. I noticed when I remove the random effect, certain ORs for the six-level factor become inflated. When I include the random effect, these same ORs shrink. I'm wondering if someone can offer a simple explanation for this. Many thanks. EDIT: Including partial model output below.
