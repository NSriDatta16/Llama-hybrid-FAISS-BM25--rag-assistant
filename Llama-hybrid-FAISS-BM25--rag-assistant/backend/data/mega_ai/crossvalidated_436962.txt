Creating a feedback RNN

I will propose a trivial example to explain my question. So yes, there are many techniques I could use in post processing etc. but I would like the model to have the following ability. Say I have the input: today i went to the shop that is fed in letter by letter to an RNN type model. The output is the probability that a letter belongs to the word went . But here's the thing, I want the output to be: today i went to the shop 000000001111000000000000 At index 8 ( w ), a regular RNN would say the probability that character belongs to the word went is say, 0.2 . However, after the RNN has been fed the letter e , which would be given a probability of say, 0.3 , the probability of w belonging to went would actually increase since the subsequent letter also has a likelhiood of belonging to went . Essentially, I would like the model to "feedback" new information to previous characters/outputs to update previous outputs.
