Thanks for the reply. Yes, I forgot to include the map parameter in the thread above - I had it in the code. The problem actually had to do with associating icons to markers: new google.maps.MarkerImage('http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/black01.png') followed by 02, 03 etc. I didn't write the array accordingly, thus the code never actually made it to the marker section (which was OK). The content of the for function looks like this: var marker = new MarkerWithLabel({ position: locations[i], draggable: true, map: map, icon: icons[i], labelContent: labels[i], labelAnchor: new google.maps.Point(22,0), labelClass: "labels", labelStyle: {opacity: 0.85}});
