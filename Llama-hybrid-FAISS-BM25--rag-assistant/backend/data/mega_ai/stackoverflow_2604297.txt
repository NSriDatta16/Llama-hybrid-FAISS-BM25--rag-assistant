You probably know this or suspect it, but there's no statistical basis for guessing or supplying the missing values by averaging over the range of possible values, etc. For NN in particular, there are quite a few techniques avaialble. The technique i use--that i've coded--is one of the simpler techniques, but it has a solid statistical basis and it's still used today. The academic paper that describes it here . The theory that underlies this technique is weighted integration over the incomlete data. In practice, no integrals are evaluated, instead they are approximated by closed-form solutions of Gaussian Basis Function networks. As you'll see in the paper (which is a step-by-step explanation, it's simple to implement in your backprop algorithm.
