According to Foundation ActionScript 3.0 Image Effects by Todd Yard (page 155) "...the smooth parameter determines whether a scaled up image is smoothed upon scaling. Basically, a value of false, which is the default, will perform a nearest-neighbor algorithm on a pixel, which can result in visible pixelation. A value of true will result in a bilinear algorithm being applied, which calculates new pixel values based on the average value of multiple surrounding pixels."
