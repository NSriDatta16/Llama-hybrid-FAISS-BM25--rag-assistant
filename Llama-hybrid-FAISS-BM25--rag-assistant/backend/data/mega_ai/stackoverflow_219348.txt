Organization All of my scripts are maintained in a directory structure that I follow whenever I work on a site. The directory structure normally goes something like this: +--root |--javascript |--lib |--prototype.js |--scriptaculous |--scriptaculous.js |--effects.js |--.. |--myOwnScript.js |--myOwnScript2.js If, on the off chance, that I'm working on a team uses an inordinate amount of scripts, then I'll normally create a custom directory in which we'll organize scripts by relationship. This doesn't happen terribly often, though. Compression Though there are a lot of different compressors and obfuscators out there, I always come back to YUI Compressor. Inclusion Unless a site is using some form of a master page, CMS, or something that dictates what can be included on a page beyond my control, I only included the scripts necessarily for the given page just for the small performance sake. If a page doesn't require any script, there will be no script inclusions on that page.
