Can I Get Notified When Some Process Starts?

I need to know (preferably with the least latency) when foo.exe is launched. Right now, I have a thread that sits in a light loop (~10 Hz) and walks the process tree looking foo.exe . This is less than elegant and I was wondering whether I could register with some part of the Windows API to get a callback when any process starts. If no such facility is available, I am, of course, open to other methods of accomplishing this task more elegantly.
