The main benefit you get out of using an O/RM tool like NHibernate is essentially productivity. Vendors have been working on such tools for years and the level of sophistication of an average o/RM tool is currently far beyond the capabilities of a single man or a small team. Using an O/RM tool will not necessarily give you extra days off. And an O/RM tool is not exactly a wizard or rapid application development instrument. It is still a programming tool, however, and a sophisticated one too. Using an O/RM tool can enhance your productivity as long as you know the tool and supply a well-built domain model. I am not familiar with Subsonic but NHibernate is a mature product that is currently being used successfully in a large number of enterprise applications around the globe. If the product had significant bugs like leaks or a negative impact on uptime this would certainly have been examined and fixed.
