Isolation forest is a variation on random forest used to identify anomalies. It does so by estimation how easy it is to isolate each data point on the basis of random recursive partitions of the data. Then an anomaly score can be estimated for each data point, based on how often it is isolated. See: " Isolation Forest " by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting and Zhi-Hua Zhou.
