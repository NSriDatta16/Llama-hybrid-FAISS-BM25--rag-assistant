Find the confidence level used based on multiple intervals

I am given the following table of confidence levels for a $\mu$ of a $X\cap N(0,1)$ . and I'm asked to find the level of confidence used. Initially I thought when I chose, for exemple, a 90% confidence level, 10% of my samples would't contain the parameter, but some excel simulation proved me wrong. Given the table can we be sure of the confidence level used ? And similarly, when testing hypothesis can we find the significance level used given the the number of false positives (knowing what the real parameter is). Edit: The exercise is the following: We got 20 samples (dimension not known) from a population with $N(0,1)$ distribution. Next we built a confidence interval (always using the same confidence level) for the average value of the population given the data we collected (the intervals displayed in the table). The questions is: can we say what confidence level is used ? (one of the opinions is "we can't tell") Excel simultation: Using norm.inv(rand();0;1) I built 40 samples, each with dimension 56. Next I build the appropriate confidence interval ( $\bar{X}-\frac{S \space t_{n-1}^{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}{\sqrt{n-1}}$ , $\bar{X}+\frac{S \space t_{n-1}^{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}}{\sqrt{n-1}}$ ). For a 90% confidence level I get simulations where 9 of the 40 intervals don't contain 1. So it seems that the above problem can't have an definitive answer. Using the above samples I tested $H_0: \mu = 1 \space vs \space H_1: \mu >1$ , using the T statistics and a significant level of 0,1 (so out of the 40 I would only get 4 type I erros). I got on some simulations 8 type I errors. Edit2: I think that I know get it. In my simulation of confidence interval which one has a 10% probability of not containing the real parameter (in this case 1), but I in reality I can get the case where I get 8/40 intervals don't contain the real parameter since this has a $40 \choose 8$$0.1^{8} \space 0.9^{40-8}$ probability of occurrence.
