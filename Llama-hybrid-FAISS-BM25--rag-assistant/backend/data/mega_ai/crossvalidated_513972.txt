Probability of acceptance for Rejection Sampling

I wondered if someone could confirm if this is correct. The probability of accepting a sample from the proposal distribution $q(z)$ is given by the ratio $\frac{\tilde {p}(z)}{kq(z)}$ where $\tilde {p}(z)$ is the unnormalised true posterior and $k$ the scaling factor. This itself is not the acceptance probability (although I thought it was). It seems the acceptance probability is $\frac{1}{k}$ which is rationalised as follows: $\int \frac{\tilde {p}(z)}{kq(z)} q(z) dz = \frac{1}{k}$ which seems that we take an expectation over this acceptance probability to get an average over all terms? Is this correct?
