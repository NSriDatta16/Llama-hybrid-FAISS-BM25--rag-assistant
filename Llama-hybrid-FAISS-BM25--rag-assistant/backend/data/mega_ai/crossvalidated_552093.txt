It looks like both A and K are binary factors so, I don't believe logistic regression is the best statistical test here. I would recommend Chisq or Fisher's Exact test. With that said, from your small data sample it looks like A & K are highly correlated, resulting in the high OR. See the results from: table(df $A, df$ K) No Yes No event 138 3 event 2 7 Fisher's test: fisher.test(table(df $A, df$ K)) Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data data: table(df $A, df$ K) p-value = 1.415e-08 alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1 95 percent confidence interval: 17.76889 1904.27431 sample estimates: odds ratio 135.9924
