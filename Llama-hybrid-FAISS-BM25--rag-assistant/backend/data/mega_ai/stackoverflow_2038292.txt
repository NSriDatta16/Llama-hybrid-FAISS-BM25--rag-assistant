Django: Why does my CharField not get given the class vTextField?

I have a form like this: class DiaryEventForm(forms.Form): title = forms.CharField(max_length = 200) Which generates this HTML: This shows up as really narrow in the admin (where I've got a custom view using this form). If I have a model defined like this: class DiaryEvent(BaseModel): title = models.CharField(max_length = 200) I get this HTML: What's the most elegant way of getting the class vTextField added to my form? That class seems to be the way normal text inputs are styled, so I'd like to use that, rather than styling it myself.
