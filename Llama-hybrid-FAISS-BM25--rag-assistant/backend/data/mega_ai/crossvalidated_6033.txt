Detect changes in time series

I came across a picture of an application prototype that finds significant changes ("trends" - not spikes/outliers) in traffic data: I want to write a program (Java, optionally R) that is able to do the same - but because my statistic skills are a little rusty, I need to dig into this topic again. What approach/algorithm should I use/research therefore?
