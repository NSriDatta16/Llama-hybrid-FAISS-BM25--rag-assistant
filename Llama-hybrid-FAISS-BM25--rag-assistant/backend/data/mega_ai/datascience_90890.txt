This could be modeled as multi-label classification . The features are nominal values, and the targets are the presence or absence of nominal values. There are wide variety of algorithms that can learn multi-label classification. The "best" one is empirical question that depends on the specific dataset. One popular option is random forest classifier. There is also a "strict" version of problem where each combination is considered a unique label. Then it would be multi-class classification. But the targets might be too sparse to learn.
