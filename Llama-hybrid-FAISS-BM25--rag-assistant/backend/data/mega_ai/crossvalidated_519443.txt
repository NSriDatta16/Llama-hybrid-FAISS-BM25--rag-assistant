Non-probabilistic machine learning models do not handle uncertainty about the parameters. They simply return point estimates for the parameters. You may use additional techniques (e.g. bootstrap) to learn something about the uncertainty. Many of the available solutions (e.g. using dropout also at the prediction time) are thought of as approximations of the Bayesian (probabilistic) solutions to the problem. Probabilistic models give you estimates of the distributions for the parameters. They tell you what are the probabilities of observing different values of the parameters. This is used to quantify the uncertainty, by calculating things like highest density regions, or quantiles of the distributions.
