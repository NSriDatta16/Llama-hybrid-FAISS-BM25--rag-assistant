Since this question has been asked, interesting progress has been made. For instance, consider this paper Chichignoud, M., Lederer, J., & Wainwright, M. (2016). A Practical Scheme and Fast Algorithm to Tune the Lasso With Optimality Guarantees. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17, 1â€“17. They propose a method to select the LASSO tuning parameter with provable finite sample guarantees for model selection. As they say in the paper, "For standard calibration schemes, among them Cross-Validation, no comparable guarantees are available in the literature. In fact, we are not aware of any finite sample guarantees for standard calibration schemes".
