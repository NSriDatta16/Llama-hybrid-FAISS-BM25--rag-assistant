Normalize with mean and std of training data or validation data when validating model

I am training a model to classify the traffic signs with CNN. 1. Training data: 32x32 photo of traffic signs 2. preprocess: Calculate the train_mean and train_std with all the training data. Then nor_x = (x - train_mean)/train_std 3. Training CNN model with nor_x. 4. Validating the model. Here is a strange thing I found. I preprocess the validation data with train_mean and train_std, but the result is slightly worse than using validation data's valid_mean and valid_std. I believe I should get a better result with train_mean and train_std since it is used to train a model. Or it is a normal phenomenon and there are more other factors effecting this experiment. Any comment or resource is welcomed. Thanks. This question is probably duplicated of this question . But what I concerned is the result is not consistent with the correct way(the result of using training data's mean and std is worse than using validation data's mean and std).
