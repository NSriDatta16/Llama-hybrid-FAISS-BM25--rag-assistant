I'm not certain of the details, but I expect Subversion might store the current copy of the file uncompressed, while compressing previous revisions to save space. Subversion also uses techniques like "skip deltas" to reduce the amount of storage required for past revisions while still offering good performance. In any case, the format of the repository database is subject to change, and does regularly. I've never been concerned about exactly how files are stored in Subversion. They just are, and that's pretty much all that matters.
