Short answer: A thread is a scheduling concept, it's what the CPU actually 'runs' (you don't run a process). A process needs at least one thread that the CPU/OS executes. A process is data organizational concept. Resources (e.g. memory for holding state, allowed address space, etc) are allocated for a process.
