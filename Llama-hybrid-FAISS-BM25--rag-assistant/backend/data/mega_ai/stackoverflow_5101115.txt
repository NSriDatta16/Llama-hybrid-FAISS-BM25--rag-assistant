Flex Drag/Drop to exact coordinates of the Drag Proxy

I added custom dragging and dropping in a flex (web) application and it all works fine except for a teeny weeny problem. The image been dropped drops a bit off the actual drag proxy. I want the image dragged and dropped to be in the exact place as the drag proxy. I dragging from a VBox to a Panel. I just cant seem to make the connection between the actual proxy coordinates and the dropped coordinates. Thanx a lot :)
