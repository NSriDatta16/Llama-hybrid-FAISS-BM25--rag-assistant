You can arrange your files however you like; you'll just need to adjust your build tools' include paths and source paths to match. Giving each directory it's own namespace is overkill and probably a bad idea, as it will make for confusing code. I'd recommend one namespace per project at most, or even just one namespace per company (since presumably within your company you have the power to rename things if necessary to resolve name collisions. Namespaces' main purpose is to handle the case where two codebases under the control of two different organizations both use the same name, and you as a third party want to use them both in the same project, but don't have the ability to modify either codebase).
