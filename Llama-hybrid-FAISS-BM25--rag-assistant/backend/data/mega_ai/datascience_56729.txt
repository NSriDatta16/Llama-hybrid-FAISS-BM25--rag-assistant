Probability vs recall for time series classification task

I am working on the time series classification task that focuses on predicting a fault. I framed the problem as a multi-step forecasting problem, where my goal is to predict to the class at y(t+1 hour) = f(X_lagged) . My target y is either 1, or 0, and the problem is essentially a binary classification problem. In the papers I have read, recall/precision/f1 metrics are used as a model evaluation metric. However, if I want to state the problem as "What is the probability that the fault will happen in 1 hour?", what metric do I need to use?
