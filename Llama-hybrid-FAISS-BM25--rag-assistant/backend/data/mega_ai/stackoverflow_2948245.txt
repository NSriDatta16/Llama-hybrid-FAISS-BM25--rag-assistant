VB.NET generates properties in the release build

I have a form and i drag and drop a control in VB.NET. I have a line say, private WithEvents radioButton RadioButton Also, I have a handler like, private void click(.....) Handles radioButton.Click { ... } Now, When I build this is .NET 3.5 in release mode, and see the generated code in reflector tool, the code is something like, Private Overridable Property radioButton As RadioButton . . . _ Private _radioButton As RadioButton Can someone tell me what is going on here? And how do I avoid the generation of new properties and fields? -datte
