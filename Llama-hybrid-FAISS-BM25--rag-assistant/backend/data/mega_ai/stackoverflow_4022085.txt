Split XML in PHP

I have a merged xml with a root element and multiple item child elements. Something like this test1 test2 What I want is an easy way to parse the xml and create an array of xml strings from the items. $arrXml[0] = ' test1 '; $arrXml[1] = ' test2 '; I'm looking for an elegant solution not any solution.
