I guess this is not a circular dependency, but rather a "multiple cascade path" problem (don't remember the exact error message). The solution I'd prefer is to remove the OrganizerId CASCADE DELETE, since deleting an organizing member should not automatically remove the member's events, and implement this part as an SP. You can still implement child record deletion in an INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger, or in an SP.
