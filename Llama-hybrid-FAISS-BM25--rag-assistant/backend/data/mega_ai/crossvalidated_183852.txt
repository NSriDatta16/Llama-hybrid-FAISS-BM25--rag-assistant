Can I see the contribution way of an input variable in random forest model?

I have a randomforest model with 10 inputs to predict 1 output in R. Let's say I ran the following code (from http://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-the-caret-r-package ) # ensure results are repeatable set.seed(7) # load the library library(mlbench) library(caret) # load the dataset data(PimaIndiansDiabetes) # prepare training scheme control Now I can see the importance of each variable in to the performance of the model, but can I know the influence way? More precisely, for instance, for variable 'insulin', does it mean more insulin will lead to more chance of diabetes, or vice versa? How can I know it from randomForest model? Thank you,
