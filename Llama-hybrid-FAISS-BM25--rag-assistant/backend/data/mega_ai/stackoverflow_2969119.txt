Ask them to make a couple of substantial (but simple) changes to an existing MVC site. This will allow you to watch how familiar they are with the organization of an MVC site. If you ask them to make an HTML change, do they go straight to the Views folder? If your change is in business logic, do they go straight to the controller action? Sounds a bit obvious, I realize. But if they hesitate with these things, it means they haven't actually spent much time in MVC. You're testing for speed, really.
