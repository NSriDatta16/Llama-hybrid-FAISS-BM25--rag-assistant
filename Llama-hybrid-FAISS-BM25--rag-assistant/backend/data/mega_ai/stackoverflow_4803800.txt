EBS root instances seem to not have any instance storage

EBS root instances seem to not have any instance storage - is this correct or some odd bug? I'm expecting to have /dev/sda to be the EBS backed volume, and then have the other instance storage devices there as /dev/sdb etc... Is this an incorrect assumption?
