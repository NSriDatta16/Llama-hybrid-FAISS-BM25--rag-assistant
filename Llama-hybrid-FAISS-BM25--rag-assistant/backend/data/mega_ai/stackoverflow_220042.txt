The key is "show me all possible combinations". I've used these in conjunction with other calculated fields an then sorted/filtered those. For example, say you are building an arbitrage (trading) application. You have sellers offering products at a price and buyers asking for products at a cost. You do a cross join on the product key (to match up the potential buyers and sellers), calculate the spread between cost and price, then sort desc. on this to give you (the middleman) the most profitable trades to execute. Almost always you'll have other bounding filter criteria of course.
