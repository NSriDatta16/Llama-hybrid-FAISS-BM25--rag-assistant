The :hover pseudo-class is not necessarily known for its reliability. Also, there's no way (that I know of) to control its behaviour via Javascript. According to the W3C's spec , the :hover pseudo-class should only be applied when the user initiates the action. Quote: The :hover pseudo-class applies while the user designates an element (with some pointing device), but does not activate it. For example, a visual user agent could apply this pseudo-class when the cursor (mouse pointer) hovers over a box generated by the element. User agents not supporting interactive media do not have to support this pseudo-class. So, your best best, in this situation, would be to apply a concrete class (let's say .hover ) via a function bound to the mouseover and mouseout events of the desired target elements. As an aside, you could probably save yourself a lot of hassle if you were to re-structure your markup into a hierarchical/nested form, then the DOM would automatically bubble these events for you. That said, see this SO question and answer on how to manually propagate mouse events through absolutely positioned elements .
