The augmented Dickey-Fuller test assesses whether the time series under inspection has a unit root or not. The test is designed specifically for that purpose. It either rejects the null of unit root or fails to reject it. Rejection of the unit root should not be interpreted as presence of stationarity, though. Presence of a unit root is one form of nonstationarity, but absence of a unit root does not imply stationarity. For example, presence of a deterministic time trend or certain forms of conditional heteroskedasticity are also forms of nonstationarity and they may be characteristic to a time series regardless of whether it has a unit root or not. The takeaway message is, stationarity is never confirmed ; we may just reject (or fail to reject) some forms of nonstationarity based on particular tests (but there will be other possible forms of nonstationarity that we have not tested for yet).
