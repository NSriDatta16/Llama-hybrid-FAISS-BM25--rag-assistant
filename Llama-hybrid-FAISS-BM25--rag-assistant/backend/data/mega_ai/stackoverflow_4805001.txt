You'll need to extend the Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List block to provide your own functionality for the getProductCollection() method. Probably something along the lines of: class ... extends Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List { function getProductCollection() { parent::getProductCollection()->addAttributeToSort('display_order', 'ASC') } } Then, of course, you'll have to update you layout xml file on your, presumably, custom controller (unless you want all of the product listing screens to act like this) to use your new block instead of the Magento default of catalog/product_list .
