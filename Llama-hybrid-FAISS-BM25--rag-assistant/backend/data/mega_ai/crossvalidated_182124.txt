How can I remove autocorrelation from this data?

I have 1000 data points and can see there is quite a high level of autocorrelation. If I look at the lag 1 data pairs (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., then the correlation is r = .62. I put the raw data here . I'd like to transform the data to remove or reduce the autocorrelation. The context for all this is that the data points are guesses made by individuals about some quantity. I know the true value of the quantity and want to see whether the average guess is better if I just leave the data autocorrelated, or if I remove the autocorrelation. One idea I had for an approach was to get rid of the lag 1 autocorrelation first, and then to see if average accuracy improves, and then try to get rid of the lag 2 autocorrelation. I thought maybe I could just throw out every second data point, and then naturally autocorrelation would reduce. However, ideally I'd like to find a way to remove autocorrelation without throwing away data.
