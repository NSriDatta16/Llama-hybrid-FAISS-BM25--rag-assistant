Everything I have read said I should be injecting my ISession into my repositories. That's correct. You need to inject the session into the repository constructor because this is where the data access is made. This means I could not be injecting ISession into my services, so then how do I do Database access from my Services? You don't do database access in your services. The service relies on one or more repositories injected into its constructor and uses their respective methods. The service never directly queries the database. So to recap: The repository contains the simple CRUD operations on your model. This is where the data access is performed. This data access doesn't necessary mean database. It will depend on the underlying storage you are using. For example you could be calling some remote services on the cloud to perform the data access. The service relies on one or more repositories to implement a business operation. This business operation might depend on one or more CRUD operations on the repositories. A service shouldn't even know about the existence of a database. The controller uses the service to invoke the business operation. In order to decrease the coupling between the different layers, interfaces are used to abstract the operations.
