Preventing google maps Markers to "fly" up when dragged

I'm using the Google Maps Flash API and I have a bullseye Marker that the user should drag to the correct position, but whenever you drag something it flies up a bit and this stupid target cross appears below, which is what I would like to prevent, because it doesn't look nice and I'd even say it's confusing. The only idea I have so far is to set an offset to the icon to compensate for the "flying" height whenever the user clicks the marker, but I figured maybe there is a hidden option somewhere to do that, or just one that I didn't get from the documentation, but I think I tried it all by now. Cheers
