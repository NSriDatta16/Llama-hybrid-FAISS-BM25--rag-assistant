Let $\{X_n\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ be a time series where $X_n$ is a discrete random variable taking on values $\cos(n), \sin(n), -\cos(n), -\sin(n)$ with equal probability $\frac 14$ . It is easily verified that $E[X_n] = 0$ and \begin{align}E[X_mX_{m+n}] &= \frac 14\bigg[\cos(m)\cos(m+n)+\sin(m)\sin(m+n)\\ &= ~~~~~ + (-\cos(m))(-\cos(m+n))+(-\sin(m))(-\sin(m+n))\bigg]\\ &= \frac 12\bigg[\cos(m)\cos(m+n)+\sin(m)\sin(m+n)\bigg]\\ &= \frac 12\,\cos(n)\end{align} and so the process is weakly stationary. It is also obviously not strictly stationary since $X_0$ and $X_n$ , $n\neq 0$ take on different values and so the distributions of $X_n$ and $X_m$ are different instead of being the same as is needed (along with many other requirements) for strict stationarity. For the weakly stationary process described above, the process $\{|X_n|\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ is not weakly stationary because $E[|X_n|] = \left.\left.\frac 12\right[\cos(n) + \sin(n)\right]$ is not a constant as is needed for weak stationarity (though it is true that the autocorrelation function $E[|X_m|\cdot|X_{m+n}|]$ is a function of $n$ alone). On the other hand, as noted by @bananach in a comment on the main question, if stationarity is interpreted as strict stationarity, then strict stationarity of $\{X_n\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ implies that $\{|X_n|\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ is also a strictly stationary process. Strictly stationary processes with finite variance are also weakly stationary processes, and thus for this subclass, it is true that weak stationarity of $\{X_n\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ implies weak stationarity of $\{|X_n|\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ . But, as described in the first part of this answer, one cannot always conclude that weak stationarity of $\{X_n\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ implies weak stationarity of $\{|X_n|\colon n \in \mathbb Z\}$ .
