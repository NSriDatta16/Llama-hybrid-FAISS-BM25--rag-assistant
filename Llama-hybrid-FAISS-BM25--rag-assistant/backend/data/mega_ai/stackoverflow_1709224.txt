I'm inclined to agree that a web interface is optimal for something like this, however WPF is a great alternative as well with many of the advantages of a web interface along with the power of a desktop application. Both web and WPF would give you considerable amount of control over how the application looks and feels, leveraged with all the power of the .NET framework. One drawback of a web app is that you have less ability to interact with the phone system directly, but I'm sure that's a problem that can be mitigated fairly easily with some AJAX. A big plus for the web platform option is that you'll have access to tons of client-side interactivity libraries like jQuery, which will allow you to polish the application with greater ease; with WPF you would likely find yourself paying for a lot of the fancy UI controls.
