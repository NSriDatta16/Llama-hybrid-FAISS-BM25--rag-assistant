Where to find the statement "time series discord is the best overall technique among all techniques" in Chandola et al.(2009)?

Senin et al. (2015) "Time series anomaly discovery with grammar-based compression" claim exactly the following (copied and pasted): in a recent extensive empirical study by Chandola et al., where they concluded ”..on 19 different publicly available data sets, comparing 9 different techniques time series discord is the best overall technique among all techniques” [3] where [3] Chandola, V., Cheboli, D., and Kumar, V., Detecting Anomalies in a Time Series Database, CS TR 09–004 (2009) Then, if we go to the Technical Report of Chandola et al. (2009) , we can just find the following snippet: on 19 different publicly available data sets but not the rest of what quoted by Senin et al. (2015). Also, we can find an apparently "different" type of conclusion (copied and pasted) in the Technical Report of Chandola et al. (2009) : At a high level, our results indicate that none of the techniques are superior to others across all data sets, but have certain characteristics that make them effective for certain types of data sets, and ineffective for certain others Could you please tell me where I can find the quote made by Senin et al. (2015) in Chandola et al. (2009)?
