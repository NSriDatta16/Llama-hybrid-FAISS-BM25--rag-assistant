You receive an email from a friend that says, "let's have lunch next Tuesday" and your email program detects it and asks if you want to save a new calendar entry for "lunch on Tuesday". What you describe is called Information extraction and is a big field of NLP (Natural Language Processing). You are looking for temporal expression identification . You can have a look at the Stanford Temporal Tagger: SUTime to get a "live" demo. From what I see here it is a regex-based rule system. To give you an impression how powerful rule-based systems can be: Weizenbaum’s own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation. Weizenbaum was surprised by this, later writing, “I had not realized… that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.” Source: Wikipedia: Eliza See also Apple Data Detectors TimeML: Robust specification of event and temporal expressions in text
