I'm in agreement with Adam. A very clear analytic power calculation likely isn't going to suit you, and simulation is probably the way to go. I'd then run a series of simulated studies, drawing different sample sizes each time. For example, 10,000 studies each with 100 subjects, 10,000 studies with 150 subjects...etc. etc. For each, you then run both a normal logistic regression and your bayesian analysis with the specified priors, and measure what % of the studies correctly identify that there is an effect, and low and behold, you have your power. You should then be able to graph two curves, showing the rise in power as sample size goes up for both the bayesian and frequentist analysis, and show (hopefully) that the curve for the bayesian analysis arrives a the desired value for beta at a smaller sample size.
