Microsoft outlook notification

I am using .NET 2.0/3.5 Brief: I am planing to develop an application which will send a SMS to the user mobile if he get any mail to his outlook. Description: I am working for a organization which has one dedicated system for an employee and they have outlook configured in their system. What I want that whenever a mail comes to their outlook they will receive a SMS on their mobile. Now, I have SMS service with me and I need to know how can I get the notification that email is arrived to user mailbox. Is it possible to get such type of notification from Outlook to .NET?
