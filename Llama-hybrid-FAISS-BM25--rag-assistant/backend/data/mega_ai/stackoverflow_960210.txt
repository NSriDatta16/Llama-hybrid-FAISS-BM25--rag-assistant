Coming from the other perspective, I would encourage you to think about it in their shoes. I will describe a "hypothetical" experience. Some things to keep in mind: The guy was trying to do something good. Programmers are terrible at mind reading. They tend to only know what they read. He may have not been given complete guidance as what needs to be done(or what doesn't need to be done) He is likely doing the best he knows how to. Just keep that in mind and talk to them. Teach them. No need for yelling or pissing contests. Just remember that they are not intentionally trying to make your life difficult.
