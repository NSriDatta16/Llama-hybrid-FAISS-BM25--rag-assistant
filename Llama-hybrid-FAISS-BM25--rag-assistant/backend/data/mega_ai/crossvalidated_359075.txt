If your LSTM uses "future" data in training, then this is not necessarily overfitting, but it is a textbook example of "data leakage" in a time series context. This is of course invalid, and if at all possible, you should try to avoid this. Whether this degrades your LSTM's performance compared to a clean training setup we can't tell. Try both and see whether it does. I would be more concerned that it might make you believe your predictions would be more accurate than they truly will be. Also, have you included the fact that in production, you will need temperature forecasts ? This adds a source of uncertainty and error that will propagate to your power demand predictions. (It's often surprisingly hard and expensive to get historical forecasts - historical actuals are easier to get. Also, you would need to use the correct "vintage" of temperature forecasts, e.g., three-day-ahead temperature forecasts for forecasting load three days ahead, and five days for five days etc.)
