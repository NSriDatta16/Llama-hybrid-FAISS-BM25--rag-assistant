As far as I know, MPEG4-ES stream fragments in RTP payload usually start with MPEG4 startcode, which can be one of these: 0x000001b0 : visual_object_sequence_start_code (probably keyframe) 0x000001b6 : vop_start_code (keyframe, if the next two bits are zero) 0x000001b3 : group_of_vop_start_code, which contains three bytes and then hopefully a vop_start_code that may or may not belong to a keyframe (see above) 0x00000120 : video_object_layer_start_code (probably keyframe) 0x00000100 - 0x0000011f : video_object_start_code (those look like keyframes as well) something else (probably not a keyframe) I'm afraid that you'll need to parse the stream to be sure :-/
