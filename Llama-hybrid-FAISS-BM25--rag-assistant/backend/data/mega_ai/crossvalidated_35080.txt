If I understand this aright, you plan to do some modelling. You have a prior belief, based on the published mean, cov, sd, and histograms from 80 samples You have your own data. So, you can calculate whatever you want to calculate, assuming no knowledge at all of anything. But you have an alternative, that is a Bayesian analysis starts with the prior beliefs, and goes via the likelihood of the data, to whatever it is you plan to calculate. As you have only a little more data than the prior, you'll have to take it seriously. To do this, you need to use something like jags or BUGS.
