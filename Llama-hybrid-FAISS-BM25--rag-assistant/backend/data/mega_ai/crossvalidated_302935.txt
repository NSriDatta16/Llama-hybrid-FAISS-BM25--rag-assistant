Not sure if this is what you want, but if you want the mean of three numbers, you can do mean(c(1, 2)) In this case, to also get the numbers, you can select them with corrs This selects the three correlations between 1, 2 and 5 and then computes their mean. Averaging correlations seems a bit weird to me (for example, a negative correlation and a positive correlation will cancel out), what do you want with this?
