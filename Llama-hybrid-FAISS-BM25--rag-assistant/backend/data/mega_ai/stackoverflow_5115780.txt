How do I get the exception that caused a Persist action to fail?

I have a standard WCF service workflow with several Persist actions (all created via UI drag and drop). Most of the persist actions succeed, but one fails. Wrapping the failing Persist action in a Try/Catch block does not help - it just steps over the catch and terminates the workflow. How do I find the specific reason why the persist failed? Is any exception logged anywhere? I'm developing on Windows XP.
