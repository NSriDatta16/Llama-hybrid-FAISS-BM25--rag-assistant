Previous States - bayesian networks

I have data in the following format for transition of people between various places A to B : 100 A to C : 50 B to C : 10 B to A : 2 C to D : 60 and so on I dont have frequencies of complete journeys but only frequencies between 2 places. Now I understand that in Bayes Nets the assumption is that the next step depends only on the current step and not previous steps. So I can in fact use the above data even though I dont have complete journeys for every person. Is my understanding correct? If so please could you point out some packages in R where this can be implemented.
