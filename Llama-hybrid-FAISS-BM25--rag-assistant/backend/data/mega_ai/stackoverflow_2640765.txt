Most likely the error message is telling the truth. Either the storage mentioned refers to hard disk space? Are you sure your disks aren't running full. Otherwise you have probably run out of memory of some sort like mentioned in one of the other answers. I'm not sure about weblogic or jrockit but Sun Oracle's jdk has a nice tool called jconsole that allows you to see what's going on with your running application. It should be able to tell you about the memory consumption etc. (The tool uses jms so might even work on the other jdk's)
