Without a clearer description of what you mean by "doesn't work", and probably what's going on where you have //code here , it's hard to say. Basically, you can pass a CGPoint to and from a function or method with the syntax as you have it. It'll be passed by value , so that any changes to position inside the function will not be reflected in the variable passed as argument ( b ), but should be copied back in the return value (to a ). In the code fragment shown, you don't initialise a or b , so they may contain garbage. And obviously the method body isn't doing much. But otherwise it looks kosher, so the problem is probably elsewhere.
