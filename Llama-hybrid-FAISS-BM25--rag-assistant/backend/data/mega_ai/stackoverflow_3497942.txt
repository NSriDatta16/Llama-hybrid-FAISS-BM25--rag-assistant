Browser detect contenteditable features

I realise browser detection is not generally a good idea, however as each browser has a different implementation of contenteditable, I need a way to separate out my fixes for each. Specifically: gecko and webkit require a to be inserted at the end of empty paragraphs, otherwise they are automatically deleted. ie and opera treat this as an ordinary and insert a newline. I need a way to tell which browser or at least which of the implementations to use. Please could you help me to find a method? Thanks, Nico
