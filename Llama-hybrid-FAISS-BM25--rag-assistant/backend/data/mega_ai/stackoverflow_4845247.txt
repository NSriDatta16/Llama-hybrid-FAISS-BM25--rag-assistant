How to Call "Add to Home" Activity in Android?

On Android devices when you click or long press on an empty area of a home screen, the Add to Home Activity/dialog opens up allowing you to choose from different options to put on the home screen. I have a notification that goes off at the status bar, what I want to do is when that notification is clicked I want to open the Add to Home Activity. The notification is working fine. Is there an activity name.class that I could set as the target of the notification when clicked? I checked Android Launcher source code . I found this: if (mWorkspace.allowLongPress()) { 1747 if (cellInfo.cell == null) { 1748 if (cellInfo.valid) { 1749 // User long pressed on empty space 1750 mWorkspace.setAllowLongPress(false); 1751 showAddDialog(cellInfo); 1752 } 1753 } else { 1754 if (!(cellInfo.cell instanceof Folder)) { 1755 // User long pressed on an item 1756 mWorkspace.startDrag(cellInfo); 1757 } 1758 } 1759 } 1760 return true; Most certainly showAddDialog(cellInfo) brings up the Add to Home screen. Any ideas on how do I go about implementing this for my requirement above.
