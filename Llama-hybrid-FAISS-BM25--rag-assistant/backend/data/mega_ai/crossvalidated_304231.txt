To expand on what Ellie said, the "inverse" part of the weighting means that if a subject has a low probability of receiving the treatment given the other covariates, they receive more representation in the IPTW "population." If your propensity model is correct (spoiler: it isn't), then the IPTW estimator is the naive treatment effect estimate (just the average difference between the treatment and control group) where the samples have been weighted to be representative of the population. As a sanity check, if the treatment is truly randomly assigned, then the modeled propensity to be treated will be roughly the proportion of treated units in the sample (regardless of the covariates, which are independent of the treatment by hypothesis). Then the treatment variables and propensities will cancel out, leaving the simple mean difference in the outcome.
