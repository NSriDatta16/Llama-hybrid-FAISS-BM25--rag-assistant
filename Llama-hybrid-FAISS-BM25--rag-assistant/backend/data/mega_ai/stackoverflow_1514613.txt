PHP Force Download of Remote File

I have a bunch of videos stored on my Amazon S3 storage. I'm working on creating a PHP script, very similar to the one here , where users can download the videos to their hard drive. I'd like to use something like this: However, I am under the impression that this increases the bandwidth because the video will be coming through my server. Any ideas on how I might be able to force the download of these videos, while avoiding reading it first through my own server? Many thanks!
