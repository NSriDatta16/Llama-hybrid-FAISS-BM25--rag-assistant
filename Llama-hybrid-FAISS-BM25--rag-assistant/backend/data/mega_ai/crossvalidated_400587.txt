No, direction of correlation does not matter for the purpose at hand. In the simplest IV-estimation case, the estimator emerges from the assumption of no correlation, $$E(Z'u) = 0 \implies E[Z'(y-Xb)] = 0 \implies E(Z'y) = E(Z'X)b$$ Using sample averages instead of expected values as we do with method of moments estimation, and ignoring the scaling $1/n$ we arrive at $$\hat b_{IV} = (Z'X)^{-1}Z'y = (Z'X)^{-1}Z'(Xb+u) = b + (Z'X)^{-1}Z'u$$ For this estimator to be feasible we want $E(Z'X) \neq 0 $ so that we can invert the matrix. The sign of the relation does not matter.
