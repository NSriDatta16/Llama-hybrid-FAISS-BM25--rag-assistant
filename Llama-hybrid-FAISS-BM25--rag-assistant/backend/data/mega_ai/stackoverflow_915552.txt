There is no method to "upload to EC2" as it is an instance of a virtual server and not a storage service. You would need to put your own service on EC2 in order to upload to it. You can, however, download from S3 to EC2. Simply run wget or similar on the EC2 instance to pull down the file from S3 bucket URL (with authentication if necessary).
