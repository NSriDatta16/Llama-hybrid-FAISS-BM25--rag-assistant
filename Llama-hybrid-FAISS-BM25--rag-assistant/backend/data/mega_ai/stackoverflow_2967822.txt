Excel 2007 MedianIfs()

I want to calculate some statistics. In order to calculate the average of certain values of a column, I use AverageIfs(). Now I want to calculate the median for the same values. But there is no MedianIfs() function. Is there a simple solution to calculate the median for values that hold certain conditions (2 conditions)?
