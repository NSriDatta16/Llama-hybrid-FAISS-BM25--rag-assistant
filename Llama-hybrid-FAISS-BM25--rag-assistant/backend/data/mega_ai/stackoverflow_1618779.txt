What happens when a user installs an ad hoc distribution of an existing app? I don't have an answer for this; I would guess it overwrites. And what happens if this app (or a newer one) hits the App Store officially? Nothing happens when the app hits the app store per-se (e.g. no 'update' notice via App Store.app); however if the user installs the App Store distrib. the previously Ad Hoc install goes away. I did this with an app without local storage so I'm not sure if any local files would be retained (e.g. if the app saves content to its sandbox dir). My disclaimer: I did this prior to SDK3.0. I had ad-hoc beta testers that I would e-mail test builds. Several testers were then given the official release via promo codes. Hope this helps. -Scott H
