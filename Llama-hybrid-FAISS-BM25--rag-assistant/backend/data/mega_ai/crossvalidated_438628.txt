Bias is defined as the difference between the expected value of an estimator and its true value. In simulation studies, we estimate this expected value by taking the average of the parameter of interest across simulation replications, which is what you have described with option 2, and which is the standard practice in simulation studies. The result of option 1 estimates the ratio of the multiplicative biases of the numerator and denominator of the risk ratio, not the bias of the risk ratio. A problem with this approach is that if the numerator and denominator are both biased by the same factor, that will not show up in your estimate of the bias. I have never seen anyone use this approach, and I do not recommend it.
