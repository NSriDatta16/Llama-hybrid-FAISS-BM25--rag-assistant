IMHO if you follow the purist approach too much then you end up in a mess like Java where it uses all the right design patterns but no-one can remember the eight lines of code you need just to open a file and read its contents. Rails' ActiveRecord framework is an implementation of Martin Fowler's Active Record design pattern . Active Records in Rails are certainly not just dumb data structures or DTOs because they have behaviour: they perform validation, they can tell you if their attributes have changed etc. and you're free and indeed encouraged , to add your own business logic in there. Rails in general encourages good practice e.g. MVC and syntactic vinegar to make doing bad things difficult and/or ugly.
