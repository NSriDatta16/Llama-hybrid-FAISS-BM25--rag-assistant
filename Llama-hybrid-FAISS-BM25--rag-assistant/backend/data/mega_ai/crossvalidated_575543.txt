What is the difference between regression and state-space models?

I would like to know the differences between a regression model with autocorrelated errors and state space models (time series). When should each be used? According to this lecture , regression (linear or non-linear) with correlated errors takes into account the correlated random effects to model (deterministic) fixed effects, whereas state-space model allows you to actually model the autoregressive effect (hidden random walk). However, it is still not very clear to me.
