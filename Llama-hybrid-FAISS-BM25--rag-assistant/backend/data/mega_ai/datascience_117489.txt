DisableProfiler error on XGBoost fit

Suddenly, code that was working (before the Christmas break) now does not. I would like to know why. The documentation seems incomplete and the error message is cryptic in context. On trying to fit a sagemaker estimator, I get an error Parameter validation failed: Missing required parameter in ProfilerConfig: "S3OutputPath" Unknown parameter in ProfilerConfig: "DisableProfiler", must be one of: S3OutputPath, ProfilingIntervalInMilliseconds, ProfilingParameters The only thing that happened between was that one of the cloud engineers changed settings to allow a github repository to be copied locally (I was previously uploading a zip file). After that, it stopped working. The specific code involved is as follows. xgb_estimator = Estimator( container, role, instance_count=1, instance_type="ml.m5.xlarge", disable_profiler=True, sagemaker_session=session, ) xgb_estimator.set_hyperparameters( max_depth=5, eta=0.2, gamma=4, min_child_weight=6, subsample=0.8, disable_profiler=True, output_path = folder, num_round=800, ) xgb_estimator.fit({"train": train_input, }, logs=False,)
