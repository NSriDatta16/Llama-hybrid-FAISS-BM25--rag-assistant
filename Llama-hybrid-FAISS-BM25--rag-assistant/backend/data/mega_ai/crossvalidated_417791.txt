How to select the best dataset after multiple imputation in MICE to build other models

I carried out multiple imputation using MICE with m=10. The R code is shown below: RainfallData My question is how shall I select the best complete dataset out of 10 datasets (m=10) that provides the best estimated values for missing values? I need to use this dataset for further analysis. Should I take the averages of the values from 10 completed dataset and build one complete dataset? Or shall I just randomly select any out of 10? In my case, only 2.8% of the data are missing for each variable. I can consider Complete Case Analysis but I would like to study time series model and would like to fill the missing values. Both dependent and independent variables have missing data. The missing data is MCAR.
