Undo history broken in Eclipse?

Is Eclipse's undo history broken ? I have been using 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and now 3.4 versions for the last few years and was always able to undo only about 20-25 changes back in history. This nonsense has cost me some lost modifications countless times when trying to revert some recent changes (if you reply with "you should commit to svn every 25 changes", I'm going to unleash dragons on you). There's a setting in Preferences->Editors->Text Editors->Undo history size and I set it to 1000 but it didn't help anything. I'm mostly using Eclipse with the Perl E.P.I.C. in the Perl Perspective , if it matters. So guys, what's the problem and how do I fix it?
