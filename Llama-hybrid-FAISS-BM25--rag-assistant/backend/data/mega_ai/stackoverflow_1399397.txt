Java Webstart with Tibco Native Libs

I am trying to deploy an application that uses the native implementation of Tibrv through the TibrvJ library using Java Webstart . I have packaged up all of the Windows dlls from inside c:\tibco\tibrv\bin into a Jar file and have added these to the nativelib element in the JNLP file. I was hoping that webstart would take the dll files from the tibco-7.5.1-nativelibs.jar file and allow them to be loaded via System.loadLibrary which is called from Tibrv.open() . However it doesn't seem to want to work properly. My JNLP file looks like this: My GUI Technology Dashboard Dashboard classpath:/live/client.xml /live/live.properties The application launches but as soon as a call is made to open tib then it falls apart with an error along the lines of: [Root exception is TibrvException[error=22,message=Version mismatch: libtibrv version 7.4 does not match version of tibrvj shared library 7.5]] TibrvException[error=901,message=Library not found: tibrvj]] The users have a variety of Tib installations already on their PCs from Tib 7.2 through to 7.5. The Webstart Application only works correctly on a machine with 7.5 installed which matches the Jar file inside the package. So it doesn't appear to do anything with the nativelib jar. I would like to avoid having to deploy 3 versions of the web start application for the different versions of Tib that the users have installed. Has anyone else managed to get this combination of TibrvJ and Webstart working?
