There are on average, roughly 365.2425 days in a year at the moment (the Earth is slowing down but let's ignore that for now). The reason we have leap years every 4 years is because that gets us to 365.25 on average [(365+365+365+366) / 4 = 365.25, 1461 days in 4 years] . The reason we don't have leap years on the 100-multiples is to get us to 365.24 `[(1461 x 25 - 1) / 100 = 365.24, 36,524 days in 100 years. Then the reason we once again have a leap year on 400-multiples is to get us to 365.2425 [(36,524 x 4 + 1) / 400 = 365.2425, 146,097 days in 400 years] . I believe there may be another rule at 3600-multiples but I've never coded for it (Y2K was one thing but planning for one and a half thousand years into the future is not necessary in my opinion - keep in mind I've been wrong before). So, the rules are, in decreasing priority: multiple of 400 is a leap year. multiple of 100 is not a leap year. multiple of 4 is a leap year. anything else is not a leap year.
