Wordpress development - local and remote paths

I'm trying to set up wordpress so that relative paths work on both my localhost development and my live site. I was hoping it was just a matter of changing the "site" URL and "home" URL to http://localhost/ and www.example.com , and then links would be relative. However this is not the case, and I think .htaccess complicates the issue. Eg, if I want to access a file in www.example.com/wp-content/mydirectory I can do this: $url = '/wp-content/mydirectory/myfile.php' but on my local site I have to do this: $url= '/www.example.com/wp-content/mydirectory/myfile.php' I have a solution by conditionally echoing a var at the start of the path, but it's not always possible to use PHP to accomplish this, for example, in a post or page where the link is in the content. Does anyone have an elegant solution?
