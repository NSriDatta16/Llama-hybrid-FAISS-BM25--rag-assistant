Calculating correlation between embedding features

I am looking for a technique to calculate correlation for embedding features (array of floats). I'm interested in the correlation between features (embedding-embedding) as well as between feature and prediction target (embedding-float). Ideally I'd like to get a single value representing the correlation. I'm having trouble finding resources on the topic. Pearson does not apply to a vector case. Any suggestions are appreciated.
