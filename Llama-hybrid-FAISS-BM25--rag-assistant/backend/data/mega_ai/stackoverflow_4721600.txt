In your document's .h file, add the following: @interface MyDocument : NSDocument { IBOutlet NSView *myView; } @end (If you actually have a custom subclass of an NSView , or the view you intend on printing is a more particular kind of view (for example, NSTableView ), you would probably change the type to be that type instead of the generic NSView ). Then, in Interface Builder, in the nib file, you will most likely Control-drag from the "File's owner" object to the view you intend to print. When you see the view highlighted, and let go, you should get a popup menu where you can choose myView . Now you've hooked up the wires, so to speak, so you can have a reference to that particular view in the rest of your code.
