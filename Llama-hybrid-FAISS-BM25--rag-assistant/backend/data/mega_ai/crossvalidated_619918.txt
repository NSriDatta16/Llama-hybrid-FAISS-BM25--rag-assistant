Time series split (expanding window) vs k-fold cross validation in time series forecasting

I do time series forecasting (q-o-q GDP) using ml models. For hyper-parameter tunning I use grid search with cross-validation. Cross-validation is specifically Time series split (using expanding window approach). After getting model with best hyper-parameter combination I retrain the model once again on the whole train set and do prediction of one period ahead on one observation from test set, thus for testing the model I use expanding window as well. I have 2 questions: is this correct approach for time series forecasting? I also during hyper-parameter tunning used instead of time series split (expanding window) k-fold cross validation. I know that in theory this is wrong as model can train on future values and validate on past values, but when I test the final model on unseen test set using expanding window I get better results, than If I would for hyperparameter tunning use timeseries split (expanding window). So my question is, if this approach is still valid since I test the model correctly on unseen data while keeping time dependency. Thank You.
