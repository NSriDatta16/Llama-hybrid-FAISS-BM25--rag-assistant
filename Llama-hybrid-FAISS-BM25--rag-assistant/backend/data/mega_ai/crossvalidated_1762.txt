I doubt that you can get an analytical solution to this problem. About the only step that is doable is the probability that the average of the first three velocities is under some cutoff and it is not (probability the one velocity is under the cutoff)^3 as you stated. If $V_i \sim N (m, s^2)$, then $\bar{V}_3 \sim N (m, s^2/3)$, so the probability that $\bar{V}_3$ is less than $k$ standard deviations above the mean is $P(\bar{V}_3 The calculation involving the next three rounds is complicated by two things: it should somehow be conditional on the fact that the average was too low already, and then should only use the three highest values. While it might work out to be some triple integral, I don't think you want to use such a formula. After that the fact that you have a choice whether the bullet should be weighed or fired also probably depends on the previous values, and things get even more complicated depending on your strategy. Even the simple multiplication of a random bullet weight and one random velocity is not as innocuous as it seems: the product will not be normal (or any other "regular" distribution). Its standard deviation can be approximated via standard error propagation , but calculating probabilities of falling below/above some cutoff is not straightforward. In summary, I think you should write a little simulation program - you will get better answers faster. Note that for the chronometer you will have to define more exactly what does +/-4% mean.
