Have a look at this for ideas. It uses a generic repository and the unit of work pattern. http://elegantcode.com/2009/12/15/entity-framework-ef4-generic-repository-and-unit-of-work-prototype/ Also here. Advantage of creating a generic repository vs. specific repository for each object? I've implemented something based on these ideas. You may also want to look at using a service layer more interfaces etc than the nerd dinner example shows. As good as the tutorial is, it isn't IMO really fit for use in an enterprise application as it is still quite tightly coupled. Hope this helps.
