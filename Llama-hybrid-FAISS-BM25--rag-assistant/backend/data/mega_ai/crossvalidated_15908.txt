In a bayesian approach, you could use a Dirichlet Process (DP) to estimate the PDF and then integrate it. What you are trying to do is to estimate the function based on samples at certain values. The DP approach allows you to incorporate a smoothness assumption, which is useful because you will often prefer a solution that is differentiable than one that looks like a staircase. The outcome of your analysis is then a distribution over functions, which in particular gives you a mean function, and some error bars on it. The following book has a nice chapter on Dirichlet processes: O'Hagan, A. and Forster, J. J. (2004). Bayesian Inference, 2nd edition, volume 2B of "Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics". Arnold, London.
