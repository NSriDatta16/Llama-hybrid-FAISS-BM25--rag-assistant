R paired t-test vs. Bayes analysis?

I have a study with one within-subject factor. The data in the two groups are normally distributed. When running a paired t-test, I get a significant effect, t(19)=6.24, p When running the equivalent Bayesian analyses, I get a Bayes Factor = .001 which strongly supports H0. I struggle to reconcile the two conflicting findings. Any help?
