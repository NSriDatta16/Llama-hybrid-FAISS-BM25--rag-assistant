Partially Full Factorial Logistic Regression - Bias?

I have an "partially" full factorial designed experiment (3 factors) that looks like this (both VAR1 and VAR2 are numeric factors): As you can see, Population A and B share all of VAR2 levels and the "0" middle level of VAR1. Is there a name for this type of design? The model would be Model: Y = B0+ B1*VAR1 + B2*VAR2 + B3*POP + B4*POPxVAR1 + B5*POPxVAR2 Where Y is the logit and VAR 1 is numeric and VAR 2 is numeric (POP is binary) I want to estimate the effect of each main effect (VAR 1 and Var 2) for population A and B (i.e. through an interaction) without extrapolating outside of the limits of what factors Population A and B were exposed to. Questions: Is this possible (I dont want to just subset the data for separate regressions)? 2. Will the coefficients be biased from this model? EDIT #1: I was actually quite surprised by what happens when you fit a full model to the above data, versus a subset. I think this suggests my concern for bias in the coefficients is not a true concern? I created some fake data for this, but the large sample sizes are roughly close. NOTE : Regardless of my coding above, the actual levels are not equally spaced! Here is the full model: population Which results in these coeff: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -7.728e+00 2.655e-01 -29.111 If we subset to only Population =0 the coefficients for Var1 and Var2 are the same, as are the SE X_sub We get the following: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -7.728e+00 2.655e-01 -29.111
