A couple of simple rules to start: Put those declarations that you want to make "public" into the header file for the C implementation file you are creating. Only #include header files in the C file that are needed to implement the C file. include header files in a header file only if required for the declarations within that header file. Use the include guard method described by Andrew OR use #pragma once if the compiler supports it (which does the same thing -- sometimes more efficiently)
