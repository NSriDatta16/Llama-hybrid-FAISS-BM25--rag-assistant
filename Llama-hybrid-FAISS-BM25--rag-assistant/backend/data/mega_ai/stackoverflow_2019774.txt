Linkage to/from non C++ code

I did used snippet found from Internet for this kind of linking, and it works. Now I would like to gain more understanding on this topic, i.e. what should I pay attention to if my C++ code is going to be export/linked by non-C++ code. Could somebody points me to any resources useful for this? Thanks.
