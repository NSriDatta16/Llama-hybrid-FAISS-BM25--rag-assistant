Formatting a list of text into columns

I'm trying to output a list of string values into a 2 column format. The standard way of making a list of strings into "normal text" is by using the string.join method. However, it only takes 2 arguments so I can only make a single column using "\n". I thought trying to make a loop that would simply add a tab between columns would do it but the logic didn't work correctly. I found an ActiveState page that has a fairly complicated way of doing it but it's from 4 years ago. Is there an easy way to do it nowadays? Edit Here is the list that I want to use. skills_defs = ["ACM:Aircraft Mechanic", "BC:Body Combat", "BIO:Biology", "CBE:Combat Engineer", "CHM:Chemistry", "CMP:Computers", "CRM:Combat Rifeman", "CVE:Civil Engineer", "DIS:Disguise", "ELC:Electronics","EQ:Equestrian", "FO:Forward Observer", "FOR:Forage", "FRG:Forgery", "FRM:Farming", "FSH:Fishing", "GEO:Geology", "GS:Gunsmith", "HW:Heavy Weapons", "IF:Indirect Fire", "INS:Instruction", "INT:Interrogation", "JP:Jet Pilot", "LB:Longbow", "LAP:Light Aircraft Pilot", "LCG:Large Caliber Gun", "LNG:Language", "LP:Lockpick", "MC:Melee Combat", "MCY:Motorcycle", "MEC:Mechanic", "MED:Medical", "MET:Meterology", "MNE:Mining Engineer", "MTL:Metallurgy", "MTN:Mountaineering", "NWH:Nuclear Warhead", "PAR:Parachute", "PST:Pistol", "RCN:Recon", "RWP:Rotary Wing Pilot", "SBH:Small Boat Handling","SCD:Scuba Diving", "SCR:Scrounging", "SWM:Swimming", "TW:Thrown Weapon", "TVD:Tracked Vehicle Driver", "WVD:Wheeled Vehicle Driver"] I just want to output this list into a simple, 2 column format to reduce space. Ideally there should be a standard amount of space between the columns but I can work with it.
