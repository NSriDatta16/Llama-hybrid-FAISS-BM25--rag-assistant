Can I use a custom class for holding data of an attribute in Core Data?

Apple is giving the example , that I could make a MyColor class for holding color data, and use this with an NSAttributeDescription object by calling the -setAttributeValueClassName: method. But what's missing there is this: How's MyColor persistet? And what do I have to provide in -setAttributeType: when I do that? There's no type like "custom class" or something this way. Would Core Data just serialize MyColor and store that in an String data type somehow? How does that work? Edit: Does this have to do anything with value transformers?
