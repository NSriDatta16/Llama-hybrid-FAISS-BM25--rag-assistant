Measure of central tendency in ARIMA

I know very little about the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) but I am interested in what type of central tendency is represented by "average". Is it simply the mean? If so, is it possible to use other measures such as the mode, median or even another type?
