There are whole books written about this. Harrell's resources on Regression Modeling Strategies are a good source. His course notes are particularly helpful. Chapter 4 of the course notes, on Multivariable Modeling Strategies, deals with ways to handle multiple predictors that go beyond simply including or removing them; sometimes combining related predictors is a better way to go. Chapter 5 covers validation of regression models in general, including use of bootstrap validation to estimate the optimism introduced by overfitting. Other chapters cover logistic regression specifically. Unless you are wedded to SPSS, Harrell's rms package in R provides validate() and calibrate() functions useful for evaluation of a pre-specified model. If you do data-driven predictor selection of the type you are engaged in, to evaluate overfitting you need to do something like optimism-bootstrap evaluation that covers all of your modeling steps , starting from the original data.
