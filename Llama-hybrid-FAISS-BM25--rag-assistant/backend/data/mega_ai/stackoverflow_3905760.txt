Save the file in C#

I have a tree view and a button and a toolbox. I will create the tree by dragging and dropping items from toolbox. At the end, i will store the tree structure as an xml file. For this, when I click on the button, it prompts for save dialog and once the user select the path to store, I am able to save the xml file successfully. Now, if I want to save the structure without opening the save dialog every time(whenever I make changes to tree structure) when I make changes(except first time) like in MS word, how can I achieve it?
