JSON VS simple string manipulation to parse HttpRequest in Android

I face the common case of having to extract some information in a remote server via an HttpPost request. Imagine we are in the case of a weather app retrieving some weather info. The server send a long inputstream and we are interested in extracting some information from this stream. Keep in mind we are in a memory-cpu bound environment. We have two options: 1) We use a JSON or XML parser to extract the informations. This is the recommended method, but it has some disadvantages: It is painfully verbose, especially if we want little information from a big stream. It should be faster and more garbage collection-friendly, but I'm not sure this is the case for the aforementioned case (little information from a big stream). 2) We use simple string manipulation (SSM): We reduce the dimension of the inputstream by grossly trimming off useless infos, and then we extract the informations from a compact string. For this purpose, we can build filters using static methods, to reduce the work of the garbage collector. Also this method has some disadvantages: I think this method is strongly discouraged The more informations we extract, the slower this method is. I think there is a critical point in the performance curve where SSM becomes slower. It might be less flexible than JSON or other stock parser. But also some important advantages: Concise, human-readable code. It might be difficult to modify an existing filter, but it is much easier to create a new one. To sum up, the question is: 1) Is simple string manipulation a big no-no approach, or it is reasonable to consider its use? 2) If you answered yes (big no-no approach) to the previous question, could you explain your reason? cheers :)
