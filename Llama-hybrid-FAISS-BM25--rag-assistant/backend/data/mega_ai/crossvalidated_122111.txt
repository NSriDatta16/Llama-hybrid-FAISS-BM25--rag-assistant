only certain samples should be in the held-out set The held-out set inside of random forest? I don't think you can do that. trainControl can let you specify what gets held out when you use cross-validation or bootstrapping (but the bootstrapping outside of random forests). You are using method = "oob" so you aren't intending on doing any external resampling but since you use index it probably is doing 100 iterations (which is why it is taking so long). You would need to interact directly with the randomForest function but I don't think it give you that level of control. Max
