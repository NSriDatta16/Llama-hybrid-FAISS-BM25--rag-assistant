mousePressed should fire when someone clicks (i.e. when they push down the button on the mouse - not release). mouseDragged should fire after the person pushes the mouse button, and subsequently moves the mouse. So, you might consider storing the x,y coordinates of the mouse on mousePressed, and then drawing a line between that x,y position and the current mouse x,y position when mouseDragged has fired.
