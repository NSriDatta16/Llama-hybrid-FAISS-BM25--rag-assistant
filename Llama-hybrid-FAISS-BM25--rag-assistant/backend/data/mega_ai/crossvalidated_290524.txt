Great Question! Both adaptive boosting and deep learning can be classified as probabilistic learning networks. The difference is that "deep learning" specifically involves one or more "neural networks", whereas "boosting" is a "meta-learning algorithm" that requires one or more learning networks, called weak learners, which can be "anything" (i.e. neural network, decision tree, etc). The boosting algorithm takes one or more of its weak learner networks to form what's called a "strong learner", which can significantly "boost" the overall learning networks results (i.e. Microsoft's Viola and Jones Face Detector, OpenCV).
