Well, no, light shouldn't be averaged. Think about it. If you have just one powerful light source, and you add another, very faint light, would the color of the object be diminished? For example say the powerful light has intensity 10, the color (presuming the direction is perpendicular to the normal, and no ambient light, for simplicity sake) would be 10. Then after you add the second faint light, with say intensity 0.1 the color would be (10 + 0.1) / 2 which is 5.05. So adding more light would make the object seem darker. That doesn't make sense.
