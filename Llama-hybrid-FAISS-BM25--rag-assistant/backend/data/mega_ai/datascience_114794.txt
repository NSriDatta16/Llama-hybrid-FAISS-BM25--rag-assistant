I believe "embedding" is simply a subtype of "vectorization" where you use neural networks to learn the vectorization. As stated by Peter above, you can vectorize a text without deep learning, but I don't think I've seen the word 'embedding' used in a non-deep learning context. So vectorization refers to the general process of converting text or characters to a vector representation while embedding refers to learning the vectorization through deep learning (often through an embedding layer).
