Criteria for deleting variables in factor analysis

Does it have importance in conventional PCA/factor analysis which of the criteria: communality and loading problems is taken into consideration for deleting variables in the conventional PCA/factor analysis? (should I first delete the variables that have a low communality or the variables that have cross-loadings?)
