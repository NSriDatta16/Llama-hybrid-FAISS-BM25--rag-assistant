JQuery Sortable that scrolls

I have two jquery sortables that connect to each other (code below). $('#da_favourites_sortable').sortable({ connectWith: '#da_available_sortable', handle: 'img.da_icon_handle', revert: true }); $('#da_available_sortable').sortable({ connectWith: '#da_favourites_sortable', handle: 'img.da_icon_handle', revert: true }); What I would like to do is make one of them a scrolling panel (#da_available_sortable) so that I can have multiple "pages" of sortable element that I can move between the panels. I can't seem to find away to do this that doesn't cause me to have to split the "available" panel into multiple li's. This is obviously not going to work when I want to drag elements into the "multiple page" sortable as each li would end up having to be a separate sortable. I would like the #da_available_sortable sortable to show 10 elements at a time as two rows of five. Has anybody done this before that can show me the way forward? Thanks
