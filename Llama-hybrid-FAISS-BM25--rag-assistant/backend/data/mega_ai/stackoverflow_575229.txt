I like the Stream hierarchy. The idea is that anything can use a stream without usually caring what kind of stream it is, and individual subclasses handle the storage differently (e.g. NetworkStream , MemoryStream and FileStream in .NET). If you're interested in interfaces, then IEnumerable in .NET is a great one - you can iterate over any collection without caring what the underlying data structure is.
