is there neural network architecture for unsupervised learning for topic modelling?

Let say i have a bunch of document and I want to analyse the topic of the corpus. The only way i know is to use unsupervised learning with gensim which use model like Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA),Latent Semantic Indexing(LSi) or Hierarchical Dirichlet process(HDP). So i have a confusion Is there any neural network architecture for topic analysis like this? How to visualize result of LDA or LSI ? The only I know is use pyLDAvis , is there any alternative module for visualize? Thanks
