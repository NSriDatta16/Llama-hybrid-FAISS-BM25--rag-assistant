I make extensive use of the following function, which I borrowed from Luca da Alfaro : (defun fill-sentence () (interactive) (save-excursion (or (eq (point) (point-max)) (forward-char)) (forward-sentence -1) (indent-relative) (let ((beg (point))) (forward-sentence) (if (equal "LaTeX" (substring mode-name (string-match "LaTeX" mode-name))) (LaTeX-fill-region-as-paragraph beg (point)) (fill-region-as-paragraph beg (point)))))) This works outside AUCTeX too. I bind it to M-j using: (global-set-key "\ej" 'fill-sentence)
