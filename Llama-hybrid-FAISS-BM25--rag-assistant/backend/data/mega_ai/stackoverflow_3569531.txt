Mark, When you say perform the post, I assume you mean that you want the fancybox closed as soon as the request is sent (or as close to that time as possible)? I am assuming that you are serializing pieces of the fancyBox as part of the POST and don't want to close it too early. In that case I'd leverage the jQuery.ajax beforeSend callback to close the box just before the request is sent out: $.ajax({ beforeSend: function() { //close fancybox here } }); The XMLHttpRequest is created at that point, so there shouldn't be any effect on the request. --Andrew
