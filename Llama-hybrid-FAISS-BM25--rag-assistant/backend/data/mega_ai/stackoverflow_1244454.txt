We're saving credentials to isolated storage and using the System.Security.Cryptography.AesManaged class to encrypt them. This is hackable - if someone got on your users computer and had already compromised the user's network/Windows login they could read the isolated storage file & pull the keys from your .xap to decrypt the data. For our purposes that's an acceptable risk.
