Design patterns NOT in the Gang of Four?

We all know the great book about design patterns known as Gang of Four, and the Patterns for Enterprise by Fowler. I would like to propose this wikified question to collect unusual software patterns for obscure and nice situations, spanning procedural programming, functional programming, OO and AO programming. Give your imagination and experience full freedom. Somewhat Related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37337/beyond-gof-design-patterns
