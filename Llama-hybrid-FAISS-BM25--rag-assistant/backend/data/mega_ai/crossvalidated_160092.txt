A comprehension question to conditional heteroscedasticity/GARCH

I have a time series with strong seasonality. At specific time periods/seasons there is also a stronger Variance than in other time periods/seasons. Is that an example of conditional Heteroscedasticity which can be modeled by GARCH? (i want to apply a seasonal ARIMA-GARCH Model on this data)
