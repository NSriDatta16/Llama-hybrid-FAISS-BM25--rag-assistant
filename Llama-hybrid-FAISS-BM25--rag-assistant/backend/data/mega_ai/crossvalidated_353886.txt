Inconsistency between coefficient of variation (CV) and geometric CV

Geometric CV seems to be an appropriate measure for log-normalized data. Also, according to the discussions mentioned in theorems 1 and 2 of here , it seems to me that CV and geometric CV are both calculating the same quantity $\frac{\sqrt{Var(X)}}{E(x)}$, but since one performs the calculations on the raw data and the other performs them on the log-transformed data, CV is computed by $\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$ but geometric CV is simplified to $\sqrt{e^{\sigma^2}-1}$ (and $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are on raw data in the first formula but $\sigma$ is on the log-transformed data in the second). Thus, if the assumption of log-normality is almost true, I expect to obtain roughly similar quantities by them. The problem is that in the 2000 values that I have, it seems that the log-normality holds (See the image below), but CV is obtained as 22.209 (calculated with "=STDEV(B:B)/AVERAGE(B:B)" in LibreOffice) while geometric CV is obtained as 435821.347 (STDEV=5.096; calculated with "=SQRT(EXP(STDEVP(F:F)^2)-1)" on the log-transformed data), which tremendously differ (Data are available here ). What's the problem? Is any of my explanations wrong?
