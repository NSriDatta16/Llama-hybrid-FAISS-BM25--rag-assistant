This class has method with 20 arguments this method creates an instance of object using this 20 arguments. How to refactor this code, because this is a problem when the created objects is changed and it is need to change the arguments in method. This service class is used in the controller class and in unit test. Help me with refactor this code Thanks in advance. EDIT Additional information: I can show the signature of the method public Qualification CreateQualification(string achievableCode, string achievableTitle, string accreditationRef, bool brandingPrefix, long brand, float guidedLearningHours, int creditValue, long level, long type, long gradingType, long area, int subArea, DateTime accreditationStartDate, DateTime accreditationEndDate, DateTime lastCertDate, string nameOnCert, long organisationId) I think it is need to apply Kely and Chevex aproach for example I can extract some classes one will be from parameters: long area, int subArea other bool brandingPrefix, long brand, And after extract sub classes I can use Introduce Parameter Object I correct understood?
