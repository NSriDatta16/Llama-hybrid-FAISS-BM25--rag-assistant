No, you are not getting an overflow on the second line (multiplication). The problem is your compiler is using signed char by default and 255 overflows and will mean -1. Basically, you are initializing variable x with the value of -1. Casting -1 to int will result in -1 ( signed operands will get sign-extended in upcasts whereas unsigned operands will get zero-extended). You can force the char to be unsigned by adding the unsigned prefix: unsigned char x = 255;
