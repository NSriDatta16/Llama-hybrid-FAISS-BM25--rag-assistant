A neural network is the wrong approach for a problem with a small training set. Even if you only have 2 features that are very representative of your function then 16 feature are not sufficient. As a very general rule of thumb I use 100 examples for each feature in my dataset. This then increases exponentially with every single different class you expect. 16 instances is not enough to train a neural network. You will always have huge error margins when applying your model on a testing set. Even more problematic is the fact that you are using a very deep neural network. This will require even more training instances to properly learn the function. I suggest you use a general machine learning technique such as SVM . This will likely result in better result. Try these techniques instead and see what results you get: k-NN, kernel SVM, k-means clustering. But, be warned 16 training instances is still very little.
