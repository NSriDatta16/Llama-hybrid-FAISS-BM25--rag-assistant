How can I create a fluent interface for defining Dialog Boxes?

I am looking for examples and experience of using fluent interface to define simple Dialog Boxes (and other UI elements). (I may need to add support for custom Dialog Boxes to an in-house programming language and I think a fluent interface may be the best way of doing it) The UI system will be build on Winforms OR WPF if that effects your answers. What if the interface is not fluent and I changed the question to just a “a simple to use (and read) API..” that does not depend on the use of a “drag and drop” UI designer. I think the result will be fluent to some extend, e.g Textbox(“name”). Labelled(“Person Name”). Column(1) Textbox(“notes”). Labelled(“Notes”). Multiline(4). Column(1).ToColumn(3) However the interface does not have to be a single line This " How to make Databinding type safe and support refactoring " gives a good starting point for a fluent interface for databinding.
