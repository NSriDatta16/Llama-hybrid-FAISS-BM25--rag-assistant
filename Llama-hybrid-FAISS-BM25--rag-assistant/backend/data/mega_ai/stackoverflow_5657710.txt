Tools for creating interactive chart

I am creating a project which involves the visualisation of signals and timeline, so I am looking for a charting program which allows me to zoom in and zoom out and with additional functionality e.g. drag and drop or highlight the area. I have no preference whether it should be WinForms or Web apps, and I am fine to program in either Flash or Silverlight. So I would like to see if you guys can recommend some tools for use. Thank you in advance Regards, Andy.
