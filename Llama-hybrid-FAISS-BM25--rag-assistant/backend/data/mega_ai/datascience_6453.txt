Find correlation in observed data

I have a method that calculates a certain variable. This variable is biased by an error which should be related to the observables that were used to calculated the variable. I don't have an exact formula of the calculation and also no errors of the observables, therefore I can't just do error propagation. I do have training data (the true error). Now I want to use machine learning to find the correlations between the input observables and the error of the calculated output. For now I tried to gather as many observables and used their statistics (mean, variance etc.) as "feature vectors" for machine learning. So far I tried approaches like SVR, linear Regression, SGD Regression etc. but all showed the same bad result. I'm quite new in this field. So some things are still a little bit unclear to me. Do you have any ideas how to find the relations? Or do you think there is no relation at all? What if there are observables that are totally random; do they destroy the learning? Thanks in advance!
