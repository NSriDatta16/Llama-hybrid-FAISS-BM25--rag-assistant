To amplify on Nick's answer, it will be very easy to demonstrate with the bootstrap that your sample size is not within a factor of 20 of being adequate for making correct decisions on which predictors are important. See this for more information. To fully expose the difficulty of the task, use the bootstrap or Bayesian modeling to compute uncertainty intervals for variable importance. These confidence intervals for your situation will tell you that the data contain no information about the relative importance of variables, even if there were no collinearities. With collinearities it is far worse. For an example using the bootstrap see this .
