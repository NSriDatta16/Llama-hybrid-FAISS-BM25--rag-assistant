1) Branches are entirely under your control, the SC system won't surprise you with them (except for multiple heads in distributed sytems, but your example should not cause this.) Now, if you are doing a major reorganization, you might choose to create a new branch so you can easily keep them separate, but it's your choice. 2) If you choose to use branches, you could continue to develop whichever one you like. So long as yout changes are committed, you have your checkpoint and can move between them freely. In some cases you can even share changes between them, but I wouldn't get into this right off. 3&4) Most systems will save differences as a matter of space economy, but it is an implementation detail. You can retrieve any version at any time, exactly as it was committed. 5) Commit is setting a checkpoint which you can return to later. Push and pull refer to sharing of changes between you and another server or repository; push is you sending changes somewhere, pull is downloading someone else's work. Centralized systems like Subversion imply push with commit, and require you to be up to date with 'pulls'. Distributed systems allow (and require) you to do each part separately.
