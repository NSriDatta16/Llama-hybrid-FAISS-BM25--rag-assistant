 involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences (Articles 9 and Article 10) a data protection officer (DPO)—a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices—must be designated to assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation. A designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor, or the role can be outsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract. In any case, the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (for example, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority. The DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes, data security (including dealing with cyberattacks) and other critical business continuity issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations. The DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored on behalf of the organization. More details on the function and the role of data protection officer were given on 13 December 2016 (revised 5 April 2017) in a guideline document. Organisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU-based person as a representative and point of contact for their GDPR obligations. This is a distinct role from a DPO, although there is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designated DPO. GDPR Certification Article 42 and 43 of the GDPR set the legal basis for formal GDPR certifications. They set the basis for two categories of certifications: National certification schemes, whose application is limited to a single EU/EEA country; European Data Protection Seals, which are recognized by all EU and EEA jurisdictions. According to Art. 42 GDPR, the purpose of this certification is to demonstrate “compliance with the GDPR of processing operations by controllers and processors”. There are over 70 references to certification in the GDPR, encompassing various obligations such as: Adequacy of the technical and organizational measures; Data sharing with data processors; Data protection by design and by default; International data transfers. The GDPR certification also contributes to reduce the legal and financial risks of applicants, as well as of data controllers using certified data processing services. The adoption of the European Data Protection Seals is under the responsibility of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and is recognized across all EU and EEA Member States. In October 2022, the Europrivacy certification criteria were officially recognized by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to serve as European Data Protection Seal. Europrivacy was developed by the European research programme and is managed by the European Centre for Certification and Privacy (ECCP) in Luxembourg. Remedies, liability and penalties Besides the definitions as a criminal offence according to national law following Article 83 GDPR the following sanctions can be imposed: a warning in writing in cases of first and non-intentional noncompliance regular periodic data protection audits a fine up to €10 million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater, if there has been an infringement of the following provisions (Article 83, Paragraph 4): the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, and 42 and 43 the obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles 42 and 43 the oblig
