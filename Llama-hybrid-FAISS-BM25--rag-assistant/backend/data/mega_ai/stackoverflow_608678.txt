If you can type XAML, then you understand XAML :) (imho) The point of knowing how to type it is to know how to debug it, refactor it, and reorganize it. All of these can't be done currently in Expression blend, and for large projects you need all of them. The other issue raised here is that manually writing XAML gives your more control, is not such a strong point as it is in the case of html. XAML is allot more structured than html and editors like expression blend or others, pretty much give the same XAML you'd write by hand, with few minor exceptions.
