I think I've seen "non-learned" or "not learning-based" used at least a few times. "Hand-crafted" or "hand-engineered" or "hard-coded" are also in use. In some contexts, talking about a "naive" agent or algorithm might also make sense. Classical is fine, but it's not always clear from the context that classical methods don't involve learning.
