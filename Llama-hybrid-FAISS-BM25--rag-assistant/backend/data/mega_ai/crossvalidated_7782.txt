What to do following poor fit statistics for a confirmatory factor analysis?

Context I have got some problems with my doctoral dissertation. My thesis is Investigating Secondary Primary School Teachers' Organizational citizenship behaviours through their perceptions about organizational culture and their organizational trust levels. I have a sample of 871 teachers. I have three instruments but they were developed by other researchers and they were used in some other studies. I have been trying to analyse my data using structural equation modelling. However while trying to do confirmatory factor analysis, only one instrument (organizational citizenship) was ok. The other two intruments did not give the first order confirmatory analysis. The RMSEA values were around 0.100. Chi-square was too high, and chi-square divided by degrees of freedom was also too high. Question What should I do with my instruments and CFAs? Would item parcelling or removing items from these instruments be a good idea? Or should I skip structural equation modelling and go on with regression?
