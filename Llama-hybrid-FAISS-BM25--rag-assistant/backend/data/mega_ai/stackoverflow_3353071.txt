Fivestar stopped working

My fivestar rating has stopped working. I'm using views to display both average user rating and user rating. Strange thing is my old views which have ratings do work and user rating areinteractive. I've created new views and the user rating isn't interactive. This happened a while ago when I updated core to 6.16 and some other modules. I am now on 6.17. Has anybody had this issue?
