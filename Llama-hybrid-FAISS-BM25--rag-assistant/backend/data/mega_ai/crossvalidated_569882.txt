Why is the hazard rate (from an Aalen model) subject to the number of levels of a factor / parameter?

As a follow up on How to understand Aalen additive regression model? I've conducted this method on my own data (which is, unfortunately, confidential). Hence, I cannot reveal what these data represent but I believe it doesn't matter, anyway. You can see here the hazard rate(?) separated by country. I realized that the one country in the center in the lowest row (UK) has a quite high hazard rate. So I removed this country from the data just to check what happens. I figured out, that another country provided even larger rates then. So I removed this, too. And then two other countries had even higher values, than ever before. What is going on? This doesn't seem robust to me? I realized that edit : Before I forget: For United Kingdom, there is only one subject. Other very "fragile" countries are Macedonia (with two subjects) or Czech Republic (with four subjects). In total, there are about 305 subjects. The syntax of the fit is: fit $country != "?" & df$ country != "", ])
