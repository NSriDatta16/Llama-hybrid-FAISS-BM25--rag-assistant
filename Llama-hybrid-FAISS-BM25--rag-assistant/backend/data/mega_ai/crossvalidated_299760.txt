Your intuition is correct: the z-score of a cluster's mean with respect to the means of the other clusters cannot be used to determine its homogeneity. The reason for this is twofold. A cluster's homogeneity does not depend on other clusters. A cluster's homogeneity does not change depending on the location of the other clusters in the clustering; and A cluster's mean does not capture the "spread" of the instances assigned to it. The clusters $(3, 3, 3, 3, 3)$ and $(-1, 0, 2, 5, 9)$ both have a mean value of 3 but have ranges, for example, of $0$ and $10$. Thinking specifically about a cluster's homogeneity I would suggest that you consider internal measures of cluster quality . These measure how well a given clustering groups similar instances together while keeping different instances apart. Internal measures such as the Davies-Bouldin index, Dunn index and Silhouette coefficient all explicitly consider the "spread" of instances assigned to a cluster. Davies-Bouldin index: $DB = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \max{j \neq i} \text{ } (\frac{\sigma_i+\sigma_j}{d(c_i,_j)})$ With $n$ the number of clusters, $c_x$ the centroid of cluster $x$, $\sigma_{x}$ is the average distance of all elements in cluster $x$ to centroid $c_{x}$, and $d(c_{i},c_{j})$ is the distance between centroids $c_i$ and $c_j$. Dunn Index: $D =\frac{\min{i,j} d(i,j)}{\max{k} d'{k}}$ With $d(i,j)$ the distance between clusters $i$ and $j$, and $d'(k)$ the intra-cluster distance of cluster $k$. Silhouette coefficient for instance $i$: $s(i) = \frac{b(i)-a(i)}{\max{(a(i),b(i))}}$ With $a(i)$ the average dissimilarity of $i$ with all other data within the same cluster, and $b(i)$ the lowest average dissimilarity of $i$ to any other cluster, of which $i$ is not a member. The silhouette coefficient of the clustering is the sum of $s(i)$ for all $n$ instances clustered.
