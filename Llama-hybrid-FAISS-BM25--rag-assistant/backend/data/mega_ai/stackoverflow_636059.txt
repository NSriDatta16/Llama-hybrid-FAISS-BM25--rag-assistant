FileInputStream takes a file name as parameter, not a URL string. The usual way to get at the contents that a URL points to is with openStream . You can open a stream to a resource without touching a URL yourself with Class / ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream (it opens the URL within the implementation). Alternatively, you can open file URLs with: InputStream in = FileInputStream(new File(url.toURI())); For a resource this would require that you have raw class files outside of a jar on your filesystem. JNLP (Java WebStart) has an API for opening files is a safe manner. In general: When converting to a String use toString or String.valueOf to be clear about what you are doing. Also note that String is somewhat weakly typed, in that the type gives no indication as to the format of the data it contains, so favour the likes of URI or File .
