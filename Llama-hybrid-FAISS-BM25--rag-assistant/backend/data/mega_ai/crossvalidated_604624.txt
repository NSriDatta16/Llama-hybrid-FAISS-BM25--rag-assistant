What does marginalizing a model mean?

I'm reading the following chapter on Partial Dependence plots, from the book Interpretable Machine Learning. In this chapter the author states that you calculate the partial dependence of a model on a feature set $S$ by separating the total feature set into two sets $x_S$ and $X_C$ , then summing over the $x_S$ feature set. He follows this with: Partial dependence works by marginalizing the machine learning model output over the distribution of the features in set C, so that the function shows the relationship between the features in set S we are interested in and the predicted outcome. I don't understand what marginalizing a model means. What's the intuitive meaning of this sentence?
