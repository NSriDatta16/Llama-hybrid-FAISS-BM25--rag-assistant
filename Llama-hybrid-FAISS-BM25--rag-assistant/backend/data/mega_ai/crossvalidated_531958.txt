How could i get $f(x|\theta)$ at bayes approach?

Bayesian statistics approach shows $\theta$ posterior density easily can be get by bayes theorem that is: $p(\theta|x)=f(x|\theta)p(\theta)/f(x)$ My trouble is about getting $f(x|\theta)$ and $f(x)$ in a given dataset, prior distribution $p(\theta)$ is easy to do i'd assume it as constant density. Should i use kernel density to go through that?
