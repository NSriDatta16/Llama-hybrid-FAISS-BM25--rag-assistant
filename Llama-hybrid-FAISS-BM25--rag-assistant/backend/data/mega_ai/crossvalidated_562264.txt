ROC AUC for average and geometric mean of two models

Suppose I have two binary classification models built on the same dataset. One has ROC AUC of 0.86, another one has ROC AUC of 0.92. What will be the ROC AUC for the average of two models and their geometric mean? I'm lost with this question cause when I try to unfold the ROC curve with number of true positives and false positives of each model and what their combination will result in and account for thresholds it makes just too many variables.
