Use the php strip_tags function ( https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php ), it will remove all html tags from a string, so: $text = ' Test paragraph. Other text '; echo strip_tags($text); Would output "Test paragraph. Other text", and the example you gave would return blank. Note that you can also specify some tags you want to allow, if there are some you still want to use.
