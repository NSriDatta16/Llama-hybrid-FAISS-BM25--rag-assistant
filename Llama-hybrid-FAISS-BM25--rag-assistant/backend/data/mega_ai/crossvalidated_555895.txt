OptimalCutPoints for GLM (Logistic Regression) in R | Find the Threshold

I want to find a threshold value so I can classify which observation is classified to be sucess or not. But I am a confused about how to use the package for logistic regression. For example my glm model is library(vcd) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(MLmetrics) library(pROC) d=read.delim("http://dnett.github.io/S510/Disease.txt") d $disease=factor(d$ disease) d $ses=factor(d$ ses) d $sector=factor(d$ sector) model=glm(disease~age+sector, family=binomial(link=logit), data=d) Where success is defined as disease = 1. Here we have sector as a categorical variable. When we want to produce a confusion matrix then we have to find the threshold value. pred = factor(ifelse(model $fitted.values disease) So my question is, how can we find the threshold value with OptimalCutPoints package in R for my GLM model. In that package, I want to use Sensitivity Equal to Specitifity method. But I don't get how it works for GLM model. Thank you
