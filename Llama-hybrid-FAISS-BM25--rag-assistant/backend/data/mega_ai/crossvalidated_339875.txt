Determining Seasonality nature of a time series i.e additive or multiplicative

I have 4 years of data starting from 2014-Jan to 2017-Dec, I am trying to extract seasonality component from that series, to do this I am using decompose function in R, one of the parameters to decompose function is type of time series, but I am not able to visually tell if it si additive or multiplicative What happens if I don't pass any parameter to decompose function, in the help function there is no default parameter mentioned I decomposed the ts by trying both additive and multiplicative seasonality type, but don't see much variation
