I dealt with a problem for my thesis where I had to do clustering on a data set for which I only had a similarity (= inverse distance) matrix. Although I 100% agree that a Bayesian technique would be best, what I went with was a discriminative model called Symmetric Convex Coding ( link ). I remember it working quite nicely. On the Bayesian front, perhaps you could consider something similar to clustering, but not? I'm thinking along the lines of Latent Dirichlet Allocation -- a really marvelous algorithm. Fully generative, developed in the context of modeling topic contents in text document corpora. But it finds plenty of applications in other types of unsupervised machine learning problems. Of course, the distance function isn't even relevant there...
