How to replace existing Swing UI module with Griffon based one in a legacy Java application?

The application that I would like to revamp is pretty well organized. UI is separated into a module. UI controllers implement the interface PropertyChangeListener . When other modules want to have something happened in the UI they just fire PropertyChangeEvents on UI controllers not being aware what is behind them. Current implementations of injected PropertyChangeListener s could be easily replaced with Griffon controllers implementing the same interface. Calling Java methods from Groovy is not a big deal so the communication from UI to the rest of the application shouldn't be a big deal. Are there any tutorials or written down experiences with porting UI modules written in Swing to Griffon framework?
