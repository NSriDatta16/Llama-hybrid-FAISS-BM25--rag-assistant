Can't log in to Magento Admin

I'm having troubles logging into Magento's admin panel on one of our staging sites (it works 100% on our webdev servers and was working just fine not too long ago on the staging server as well). I've done some research, and most people suggest that it's got to do with running Magento on a localhost and browsers not saving cookies for domains with no dots in the domain name. The problem with that, however is that we're running it from http://staging.sitename ... etc. Another few things that were suggested are where someone changed the default name for accessing the admin in the config, but we haven't changed it. Does anyone have any ideas that might help? Thanks for taking the time to help me out! Kind Regards, RÃ©my
