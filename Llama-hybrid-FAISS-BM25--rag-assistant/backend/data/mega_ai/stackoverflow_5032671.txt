How do I best organize my development folder?

I work on several development projects for multiple clients using various development tools and languages. Over the years I've lost my ability to organize my development folder. When I look at my development folder, it's just a big mess. I've searched the .NET for best practices, but they are mostly about creating build scripts and the few discuss how to organize source trees, and those that do usually only concern themselves with one language. Are there any ideas on how best to organize source trees using different tools, languages, and clients. Please bear in mind that some of the projects I work on are hybrids combining multiple languages.
