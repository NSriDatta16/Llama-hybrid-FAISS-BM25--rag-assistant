Searching from comma separated value

This is one of those 'oh my god' moments. The previous programmer in our company has left behind a badly-coded application using PHP and MySQL. One example is that he has stored options for each customer as a comma separated value in MySQL. The entire application is NOT OOP based and so there are repeated references and queries in almost every page of the 500+ pages of PHP. So it's not an easy job now to change the schema and data storage logics. To adjust the system for a matter of six months, I am looking for a way to perform a search on those comma-separates values. Has someone got any idea about searching such CSV without much performance impact? I know it's not going to be the best, but at least I could push the application to go for another six months before the new application is ready. Thank you for any help
