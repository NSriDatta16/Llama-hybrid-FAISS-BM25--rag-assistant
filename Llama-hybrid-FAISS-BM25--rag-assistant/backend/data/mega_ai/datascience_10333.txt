ML packages in R: caret v e1071

I've looked and surprisingly have not found too much discussion on the relative strengths of the caret and e1071 package. From my understanding, these packages perform many of the same ML algorithms. With that in mind, I'm interested in what those practitioners who have experience with both think these packages relative strengths and weaknesses are. What do you think about readability of code, ease of coding, methods, speed, etc... In particular I'm interested in multi-class SVM
