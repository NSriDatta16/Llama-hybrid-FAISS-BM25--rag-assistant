A contrast compares two groups by comparing their difference with zero. In a contrast matrix the rows are the contrasts and must add to zero, the columns are the groups. For example: Let's say you have 4 groups A,B,C,D that you want to compare, then the contrast matrix would be: Group: A B C D A vs B: 1 -1 0 0 C vs D: 0 0 -1 1 A,B vs D,C: 1 1 -1 -1 Paraphrasing from Understanding Industrial Experimentation : If there's a group of k objects to be compared, with k subgroups averages, a contrast is defined on this set of k objects by any set of k coefficients, [c1, c2, c3, ... cj, ..., ck] that sum to zero. Let C be a contrast then, $$ C = c_{1}\mu_{1} + c_{2}\mu_{2} + ... c_{j}\mu_{j} + ... c_{k}\mu_{k} $$ $$ C = \sum_{j=1}^{k} c_{j}\mu{j} $$ with the constraint $$ \sum_{j=1}^{k} c_{j} = 0 $$ Those subgroups that are assigned a coefficient of zero will be excluded from the comparison.(*) It is the signs of the coefficients that actually define the comparison, not the values chosen. The absolute values of the coefficients can be anything as long as the sum of the coefficients is zero. (*)Each statistical software has a different way of indicating which subgroups will be excluded/included.
