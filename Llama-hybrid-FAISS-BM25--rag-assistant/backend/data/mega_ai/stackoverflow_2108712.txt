WPF : Reorder WrapPanel content via drag and drop?

I am looking for a way to reorder the content (items) of a WPF WrapPanel via drag and drop. I just want to click on an item and drag it to a new position. To my understanding this is a very common task and I wonder I someone already did this or has any idea how to implement this functionality. I did a google search already but found nothing. Maybe it is more difficult than I expected.
