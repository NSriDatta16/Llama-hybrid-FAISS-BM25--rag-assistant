Estimation of variance of mean of Bernoulli distribution, if sample is degenerated

If $X_1,X_2,…,X_n∼Bernoulli(p)$ Variance of the average of $X$ is $Var[S_x/n]=\frac{p(1−p)}{n}$ But if we have sample, where all $X$ are equal, $\hat{p}=1$ (or zero), and estimation of var of mean became equal to 0. Is it correct?
