You are on the right track, however, there are still more things you need to add to detect shaking: You can test this by adding an NSLog to the motionBegan or motionEnded methods, and in the Simulator, press CONTROL + COMMAND + Z #pragma mark - Shake Functions -(BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder { return YES; } -(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated { [super viewDidAppear:NO]; [self becomeFirstResponder]; } -(void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated { [super viewWillDisappear:NO]; } -(void)viewDidDisappear:(BOOL)animated { [self resignFirstResponder]; [super viewDidDisappear:NO]; } -(void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake ) { // shaking has began. } } -(void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake ) { // shaking has ended } }
