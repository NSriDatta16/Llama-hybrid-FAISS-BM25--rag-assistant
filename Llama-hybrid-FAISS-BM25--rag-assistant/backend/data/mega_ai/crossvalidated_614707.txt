A population model for PCA

We know that in econometrics it is common to work with population models and relationships. Thus, when we are faced with the data, we appeal to the analogy technique to emulate the population condition. This is the principle of analogy (see, for example this ). Well, I'm reading a little about Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and one motivation is when we have more regressors ( $n$ ) than the number or sample size ( $T$ ). But first, the population model is: $$y= x'\beta + u_t, \quad x= (x_1,..., x_n)$$ Denote the covariance matrix of $x$ as $\Sigma= [cov(x_i,x_j)]_{n\times n}$ . If we have a sample $(x_{t}= (x_{1t},.., x_{nt}))_{t = 1}^T$ with $n>>T$ , tipically the problem of PCA begins first to find $\gamma$ such that \begin{equation} \max_{\gamma \in \mathbb R^n} \gamma' \hat{\Sigma} \gamma, \quad \hbox{ s.t. } |\gamma|^2 = \gamma' \gamma = 1 \end{equation} where $\gamma' \hat{\Sigma} \gamma$ is nothing more that the covariance matrix of $X\gamma$ with $X$ being the matrix sample of the $x_t$ . Moreover, $\hat \Sigma = \frac{1}{T} X'X$ . As you can see, this is a problem that uses the available samples given by $X$ . But I would like to know if there is behind this a maximization problem with population objects only.
