How to import data with SSIS for sequential guids?

Is there anyway to import data into SSIS where I expect the PKs to be sequential guids? The only method I've been able to come up with so far is to create a temporary table with the column defaulting to newsequentialid() loading the data in there then copying it to the correct table. This isn't very elegant and is somewhat time consuming of having to add a bunch of extra layers in my packages to accommodate this.
