Reduce total number of model development for multiple time series

I need to generate 24 hour forecast for 600 different time series. All these time series are basically hourly electricity prices for different pricing nodes. I wanted to understand if there is a way through which my number of models to be built for these 600 time series can be reduced? or Is their a method through which a single model or 10-20 models would suffice for all the 600 time series? Any direction in this regard would be very helpful.
