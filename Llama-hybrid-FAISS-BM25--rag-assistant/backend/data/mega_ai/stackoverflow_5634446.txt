How do plugins identify what type of server a website is running on?

I have tested a few plugins for Firefox and Chrome which can identify IP number of a given website ofcause. But some of them can also show what server-side technology the website runs on. How do they do this? I know about client-user-agent, is there something similar in the HTTP protocol where the server sendes a "server-host-agent" kinda string? And if so, how would the code for retreiving this look. I guess its something with WebClient? Anyone?
