You can put any flowable in a table element. It is probably good practice to have all table elements as flowables, so they can be styled the same. For your case you will most likely need a Paragraph flowable. eg. styles = getSampleStyleSheet() text = Paragraph("long line", styles['Normal']) You can put `text' into the data you feed to a table and it will automatically wrap.
