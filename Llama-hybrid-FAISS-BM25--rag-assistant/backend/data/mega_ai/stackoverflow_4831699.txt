There is no standard, because it's your HTML that decides which CSS file to reference rather than web server configuration. With that said, it is a good idea to have a convention, so that your files are better organized. For example, if you tie a CSS file with each file you might re-use the HTML file's name, but with the CSS extension. (e.g. index.html has index.css or index.html.css.) You could apply the same concept to directories or URL paths if your code is organized that way. (e.g. /MyApp/MyFeature/MyFeature.css). It's really up to you to decide, but it is important to be consistent, so others can understand your code more easily. Hope this helps.
