I've not tried this. But, it seems a special neural network might be amenable to this. Some LSTM or convolutional neurons could learn to extract time-series information per column like "a jump in the mean values in some columns", while fully-connected neurons can extract "a special correlation between several columns". The former should handle different input table sizes, while the latter might need some additional work (maybe those are also convolutional, which large filter sizes?).
