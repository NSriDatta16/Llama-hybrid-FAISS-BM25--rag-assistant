I use it and I'm happy with it, as I have to type much less to make a new header. It worked fine for me in three platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux. I don't have any performance information but I believe that the difference between #pragma and the include guard will be nothing comparing to the slowness of parsing the C++ grammar. That's the real problem. Try to compile the same number of files and lines with a C# compiler for example, to see the difference. In the end, using the guard or the pragma, won't matter at all.
