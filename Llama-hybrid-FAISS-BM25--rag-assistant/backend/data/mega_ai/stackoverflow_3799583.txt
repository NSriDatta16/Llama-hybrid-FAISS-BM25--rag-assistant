How to use MPI to organize asynchronous communication?

I plan to use MPI to build a solver that supports asynchronous communication. The basic idea is as follows. Assume there are two parallel processes. Process 1 wants to send good solutions it finds periodically to process 2, and ask for good solutions from process 2 when it needs diversification. At some point, process 1 uses MPI_send to send a solution to process 2. How to guarantee there is an MPI_Rev matching this MPI_Send , since this send is triggered dynamically? When process 1 needs a solution, how can it send a request to process 2, and process 2 will notice its request in time?
