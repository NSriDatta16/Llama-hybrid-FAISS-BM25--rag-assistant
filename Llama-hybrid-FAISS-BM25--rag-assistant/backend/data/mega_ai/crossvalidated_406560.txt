Using Machine Learning to Estimate Causal Effects from Observational Data

I would like to use machine learning to predict a categorical (ordinal, multi-class) outcome variable from a cross-sectional dataset with about 20,000 observations and 300 features. Importantly, I need to be able to make inferences about the causal effect of specific features. I have come across the EconML package but am unsure whether I can use it for the type of data I have (observational, not experimental). Could someone please point me to an appropriate estimation method that is either available in EconML or in some other package?
