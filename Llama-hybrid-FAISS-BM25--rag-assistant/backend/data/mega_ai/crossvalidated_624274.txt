How to transform ratio input features in deep learning

I am a recommender system study which predict how likely a user browsing a product A will but another product B. One of the features is the price ratio of A and B, i.e., PriceB/PriceA. The assumption is that if the price difference of A and B is huge, probably A and B are not relevant or replaceable. I'd like to equally penalize too much pricer and too much cheaper products. However, the range of PriceB/PriceA is [0, +inf) and the value can be very large. So I change the feature to log(PriceB/PriceA). If PriceA= $60, PriceB=$ 30, then log(PriceB/PriceA)=-0.69. If PriceA= $60, PriceB=$ 60, then log(PriceB/PriceA)=0. If PriceA= $60, PriceB=$ 90, then log(PriceB/PriceA)=0.4. It seems that this ratio feature penalizes more when PriceB
