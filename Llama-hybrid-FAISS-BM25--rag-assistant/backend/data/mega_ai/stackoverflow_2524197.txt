TestDriven.net NCover problem

I cannot run NCover. I get the error: NCover couldn't create a coverage report I'm running it via TestDriven.net. I am using MSTest and also have resharper 4.2 installed. There isnt a problem with the tests, as it works on collegues machines. Any ideas what the problem is?
