Does WPF not contain the slide animations you need? APIs like AnimateWindow are ... not given a lot of attention at Microsoft - usually in favor of a 'better' .NET / WPF method. Using native / not managed APIs to animate windows quickly lands you in a world of hurt :- Microsoft do not support flicker control animations - or alpha effects - in native controls and windows. The native AnimateWindow tends to fall over if the target window has aero glass. any non-client elements at all. Any child controls. any transparency (window regions, layered windows with alpha or masking). It really just doesn't work that well at all. The only way to work around it would be to do what AnimateWindow does. AnimateWindow is not so much an API call, but a convenience wrapper around functionality that can "easilly" be implemented by the user. All that AnimateWindow does it, well, reposition the animated window on a timer. Depending on the animation it will use clip regions, or add the WS_EX_LAYERED style (to do the alpha blends) for the duration of the animation. This is why AnimateWindow fails so spectacularly when given windows already using those effects. Performing the animation yourself, you can try to tweak the parameters to do it in a way more compatible with the rich edits painting requirements.
