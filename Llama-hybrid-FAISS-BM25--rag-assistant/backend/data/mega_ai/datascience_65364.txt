Load test data to pass into predict_classes()

I am using the Sequential model to train a CNN. The test data are in the submission_data_path as .png images. Is it possible to use ImageDataGenerator 's flow_from_directory to load test data to pass into predict_classes() ? Since flow_from_directory expects images to be inside folders named by classes is there a way to achieve that? Or else what is the most preferred way? Thanks. This is what I am trying to do, test_data_gen = ImageDataGenerator() test_it = dataGen.flow_from_directory(submission_data_path, target_size=(64, 64), class_mode='categorical') predictions = classifier.predict_classes(test_it)
