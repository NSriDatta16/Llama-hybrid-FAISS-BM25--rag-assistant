The method setVertexFillPaintTransformer takes in a transformer that converts a vertice into a colour. So to have different colours for different vertices, you need to make it inspect the vertex. The parameter, i in the method public Paint transform(Integer i) is the vertex, so you can provide a colour that is based on the vertices (or i ). For example, if I had a graph where the vertices were an Integer , I could cycle assign three different colours to the vertices by supplying the following transformer to setVertexFillPaintTransformer : Transformer vertexPaint = new Transformer () { private final Color[] palette = {Color.GREEN, Color.BLUE, Color.RED}; public Paint transform(Integer i) { return palette[i.intValue() % palette.length]; } };
