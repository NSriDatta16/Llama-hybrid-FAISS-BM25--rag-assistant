According to Stroustrup, because the alternative of a new-function "had been a source of confusion". See The Design & Evolution of C++, section 3.11.2, although that is the full justification I quoted. Edit: As people have pointed out, there are a number of alternative solutions. Smalltalk for example, does this: myclass new sending a "new" message to the myclass class object. Obviously, a C++ solution here would be a bit silly: myclass myclass is not obviously sensible. Delphi, OTOH, allows any named function to be a constructor by tagging it as such: constructor Create; constructor FooBar; would both be OK constructor names for any class. As with Smalltalk, you need to call them on the class object: myclass.Create; Of all of these solutions, I think the C++ one the most elegant, and I can see why it has been almost universally adopted by successor languages.
