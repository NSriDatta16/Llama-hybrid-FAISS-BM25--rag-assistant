Trying to read XML file but he is always the same

I have a xml file that changed when i update some values, and i'm trying to read it from javascript in asp.net. But once i run the project, every time i try to read the xml file, the file is the same from the begining... this is my javascript code that i have in server side script = "function OnClientDragEnd(dock, args)" + "{" + " req = false; " + " var isIE = false;" + // branch for native XMLHttpRequest object " if(window.XMLHttpRequest && !(window.ActiveXObject)) {" + " try {" + " req = new XMLHttpRequest();" + " } catch(e) {" + " req = false;" + " }" + // branch for IE/Windows ActiveX version " } else if(window.ActiveXObject) {" + " try {" + " req = new ActiveXObject('Msxml2.XMLHTTP');" + " } catch(e) {" + " try {" + " req = new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');" + " } catch(e) {" + " req = false;" + " }" + " }" + " }" + " if(req) {" + " req.onreadystatechange = function(){processReqChange(dock,args)};" + " req.open('GET', 'Config.xml', false);" + " req.send('');" + " }" + "}" + "function processReqChange(dock,args) {" + // only if req shows "loaded" " if (req.readyState == 4) {" + // only if "OK" " if (req.status == 200) {" + // ...processing statements go here... " var iiii = req.responseXML.getElementsByTagName('Object');alert(iiii.length);" +//Value stays the same after xml have changed " } else {" + " alert('There was a problem retrieving the XML data: ' + req.statusText);" + " }" + " }" + "}"; ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(this.Page, this.Page.GetType(), "PositionChanged", script, true); This code is in http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html What do i need to do for get always the xml file updated
