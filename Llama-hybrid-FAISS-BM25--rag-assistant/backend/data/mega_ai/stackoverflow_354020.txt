Large MySQL tables

For a web application I'm developing, I need to store a large number of records. Each record will consist of a primary key and a single (short-ish) string value. I expect to have about 100GB storage available and would like to be able to use it all. The records will be inserted, deleted and read frequently and I must use a MySQL database. Data integrity is not crucial, but performance is. What issues and pitfalls am I likely to encounter and which storage engine would be best suited to the task? Many thanks, J
