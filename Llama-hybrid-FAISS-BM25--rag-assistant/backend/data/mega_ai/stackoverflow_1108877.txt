I also had the same problem. There seems to be a bug in BIDS. My OLE DB task was previously set to have a price as an int. Realising my mistake I changed it to money but BIDS/SSIS kept rounding it and treating it as an INT. I tried everything and in the end the only thing to solve this was to delete the OLE DB task and drag a new one on. I used the same query, but with money and it worked fine. It's like BIDS/SSIS has a strange 'memory' and the only way round it is to start again!
