Boosting (as mentioned in the linked discussion) is a method that combines a set of algorithms to get a result that is better than what you can get from any single algorithm. For example random forests is a method for combining various classification trees for a classification algorithm. This approach is formally called ensemble averaging (although the algoithm usually applies majority rule). Blending seems to be a word some people use to describe a boosting approach to classification.
