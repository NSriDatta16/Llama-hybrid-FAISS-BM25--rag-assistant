SD File Systems for access with SPI

I found this site: http://www.pjrc.com/tech/8051/ide/fat32.html Basically it's a great overview of the FAT32 filesystem. It so far has proven to be very easy to understand, I was wondering if anyone out there knew of any similar documents/how-to's for different Linux Filesystems, I am interested in how they store data on drives! I did a few searches from google on etx3 specifications and whatnot but am not finding much more then, it's basically etx2 with journaling...etc, not descriptions of how the data is organized and how to access Thank you for any and all help.
