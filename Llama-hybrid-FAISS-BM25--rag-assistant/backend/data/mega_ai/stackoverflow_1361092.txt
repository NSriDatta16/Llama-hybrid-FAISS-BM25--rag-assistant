ASP.NET MVC ViewModel Pattern

EDIT: I made something much better to fill and read data from a view using ViewModels , called it ValueInjecter . http://valueinjecter.codeplex.com/ it is used by http://prodinner.codeplex.com - an ASP.net MVC sample application you can see the best way of using ViewModels in prodinner using the ViewModel to store the mapping logic was not such a good idea because there was repetition and SRP violation, but now with the ValueInjecter I have clean ViewModels and dry mapping code That's the old stuff, don't use it: I made a ViewModel pattern for editing stuff in asp.net mvc this pattern is useful when you have to make a form for editing an entity and you have to put on the form some drop-downs for the user to choose some values public class OrganisationBadViewModel { //paramterless constructor required, cuz we are gonna get an OrganisationViewModel object from the form in the post save method public OrganisationViewModel() : this(new Organisation()) {} public OrganisationViewModel(Organisation o) { Organisation = o; Country = new SelectList(LookupFacade.Country.GetAll(), "ID", "Description", CountryKey); } //that's the Type for whom i create the viewmodel public Organisation Organisation { get; set; } ... }
