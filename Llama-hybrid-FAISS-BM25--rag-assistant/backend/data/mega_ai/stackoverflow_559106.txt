The number one essential is a book on compiler writing. A lot of people will tell you to read the "Dragon Book" by Aho et al, but the best book I've read on compilers is "Brinch Hansen on Pascal Compilers". I suspect it's out of print (Amazon is your friend), but it takes you through all the steps of designing and writing a compiler using recursive descent, which is the easiest method for compiler newbies to understand. Although the book uses Pascal as the implementation and target languages, the lessons and techniques presented apply equally to all other languages.
