jQuery Accordion Plugin: removeClass('selected')

I am using the Accordion menu to filter a data table. The menu contains two filters, with multiple options under each. You can only have ONE filter selected at a time. If you click between the two options under the first filter, the style class, 'selected' is added and removed without a problem. If you click an option under the second filter though, it DOESN'T remove the 'selected' class from the first filter. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you. // h3, h4 {font-weight: normal} h3.selected, h4.selected {font-weight:bold;} Filter by Organization Association Business Filter by Type Basic Advanced
