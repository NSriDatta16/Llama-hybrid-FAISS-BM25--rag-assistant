How to draw a custom button with background having an alpha value but foreground being normal

I am trying to create a custom button with a semi-transparent background and a non-transparent foreground. I am using the following code to create a background image for the custom button: UIImage *buttonBg = [UIImage imageNamed:@"ButtonBG_35"]; buttonBg = [buttonBg stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:14.0 topCapHeight:0]; CGSize size = self.button1.bounds.size; UIGraphicsBeginImageContext( size ); [buttonBg drawInRect:CGRectMake( 0, 0, size.width, size.height ) blendMode:kCGBlendModeNormal alpha:0.33]; UIImage *button1BgImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext(); UIGraphicsEndImageContext(); [self.button1 setBackgroundImage:button1BgImage forState:UIControlStateNormal]; This works as I expect when placing text in the button. However, if I place an image in the button foreground then that image is also semi-transparent. How do I stop the foreground image from being transparent. I tried to draw the image into the button using an alpha:1.0 but that didn't do anything. Thanks for any help.
