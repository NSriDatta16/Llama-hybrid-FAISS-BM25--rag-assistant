As Aniko suggested this is classic time series problem. The objective will be to identify the Polynomial Distributed Lag function between an input (the number of downloads) and the output (number of purchases). This classically is called a Transfer Function and needs to be identified ( i.e. what lags are needed and what are the coefficients for each lag ) while controlling for level shifts and local time trends which may have been present in the past and may or may not have expired. Additionally there may be a day-of-the-week effect which needs to be incorporated so that our coefficients for the lags are correctly estimated. Furthermore there may be exceptional activity around holidays which need to be incorporated. If you wished to post your data I could take my comments down to ground zero and actually show you what your coefficients are . To close you might also have changed your price thus that could be another factor/variable to include in the predictive equation. Bye the way I saw this problem many years ago in the setting of where jobs come into an office and some are finished on day 1 , some on day 2 , etc. The statistical task was to predict the active number of jobs in the office for each day in the future given the history of arrivals.
