Prob_1: Unless there is a lock-in approach to editing the data (the data is locked when you read it and untill you're done no-one can edit, in that case the other admins wouldn't have been able to edit while our guy was on his coffee-break) when the guy comes back and updates the values (assuming that all the values currently on screen will be overridden when click update on this app) there's no reason why the value you're talking about should not be 2.
