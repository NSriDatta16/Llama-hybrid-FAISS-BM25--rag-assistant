Well, /dev/console is the console , a (almost certainly) physical terminal connected to the box itself. It's not a storage device that you can get the information back from. As to which file you need to look at, it's usually controlled by that file you showed us and individual messages can be sent to different places based on the facility and priority. However, since all those lines you see are commented out, they'll go to the default, which is probably the console.
