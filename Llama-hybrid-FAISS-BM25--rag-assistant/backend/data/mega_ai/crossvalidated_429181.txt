What is an example of a sample space in machine learning?

Let $X$ denote a random variable. Then from a rigorous mathematical perspective (books such as Durrett, Feller, Kolmogorov, etc.), $X$ is a function. $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$ . Domain of the function is the sample space, $\Omega$ Range is a value in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . In supervised learning, let $X, Y$ denote the random variable corresponding to the data $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and target $y_n \in \mathbb{R}$ respectively. Then $X$ maps from a sample space into a piece of data $x_n$ . And $Y$ maps from a sample space into a piece of target, $y_n$ . With this, the notation, such as $p_{X|Y}(x_n|y_n) = \Pr[X = x_n| Y = y_n]$ is completely well defined. Then we can start talking about things like logistic regression, i.e., $p_{X|Y}(x_n|y_n) = \Pr[X = x_n| Y = y_n] = \text{logit}(y_nw^Tx_n) \in (0,1)$ etc. But what is the sample space $\Omega$ ? Any example would be much appreciated!
