what does the number mean in the middle of the http header and content

I'm writing a program that is similar to a browser but much more simple. The user types a link and the program saves it to a file in local. I sent an http header like this: GET /index.php HTTP/1.1\r\n Host: www.highradio.tw\r\n \r\n then I received: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 16 Apr 2011 14:16:29 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.17 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.2.17 OpenSSL/0.9.8q mod_wsgi/3.3 Python/2.7.1 PHP/5.2.5 (x64) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.5 (x64) Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=d0ug0im94rg7lrjp40h38vo784; path=/ Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Vary: Accept-Encoding Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html 204a .... What does the number (in HEX?) 204a mean? When I use Chrome or wget in terminal, the 204a doesn't show up.
