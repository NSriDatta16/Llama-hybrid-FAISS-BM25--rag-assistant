A few thoughts: Data: Are certain replacement parts more expensive? Would it make more sense to sum the cost of the replacement parts rather than the quantity? Are certain products more popular? That is, would it make more sense to consider the total parts replaced or maybe the number of parts replaced divided by how many parts that product has sold? Are certain products similar? Is there a useful category that certain products can be bucketed into? Analysis Assuming that the bottom line is the total number of parts replaced, initially the data on which type of replacement part can be disregarded (and perhaps looked into after a problem is identified). This problem can be set up as a regression problem where y = sum of parts replaced per week per product x1 = week x2 = product Aad the regression formula is y = x1 + x2 + x1 * x2 From this, we can infer whether a product has a higher than average number of replacement parts by looking at the coefficient for x2. If it is positive and large, that means something may be up. The overall trend of replacement parts is represented by the coefficient for x1. If this is positive and large, then all products have an increasing trend in replacement parts. The specific trend for each product--apart from the overall trend--would be the coefficient for x1 * x2. If this is positive, then the product identified by x2 is increasing in replacement parts.
