identifying code that compiles in both Java and C# but runs differently

I am having to port code from Java to C# (and soon the other way round) by copying and pasting and then editing compiler errors. (Please accept that this is necessary; I can explain if required). Are there cases where the same code fragment runs differently in the two languages? I would include cases where order or operation or operator precedence was defined in one languge but undefined in the other but exclude cases where it was undefined in both. I would be particulary interested in any development tools which could identify such fragments. @Thomas. Thanks. J# is not an option - the code is mandated to be in C#. What does "this" refer to in your comment?
