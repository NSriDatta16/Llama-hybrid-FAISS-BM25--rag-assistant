The variable @EmpToUpdateTo is not declared. You'll need to make that a valid variable before this will work. Also, the following line: IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM [dbo].[tblA] WHERE @EmpFrom = @EmpTo) Is essentially saying IF (@EmpFrom <> $EmpTo) . I encourage you to use the latter--it's faster. What's the intent of this, though? It looks like you're trying to insert all of the rows that aren't in tblB but are in tblA into tblB . This query actually has no bearing on what @EmpFrom or @EmpTo are, just so long as they aren't equal.
