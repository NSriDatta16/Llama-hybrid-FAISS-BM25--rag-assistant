Change embedded image type in APIC ID3 tag via Mutagen

I have a large music library which I have just spent around 30 hours organizing. For some of the MP3 files, I embedded the cover art image as type 0 (Other) and I'd like to change it to type 3 (Front Cover). Is there a way to do this in Python, specifically in Mutagen?
