How can I open multiple files using "with open" in Python?

I want to change a couple of files at one time, iff I can write to all of them. I'm wondering if I somehow can combine the multiple open calls with the with statement: try: with open('a', 'w') as a and open('b', 'w') as b: do_something() except IOError as e: print 'Operation failed: %s' % e.strerror If that's not possible, what would an elegant solution to this problem look like?
