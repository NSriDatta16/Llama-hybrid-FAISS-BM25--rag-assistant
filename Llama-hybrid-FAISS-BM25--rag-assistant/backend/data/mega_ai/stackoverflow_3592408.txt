Changing to manually allocating a couple of std::vector s isn't going to make much difference. A vector is really a pretty small data structure (typically two size_t s plus one pointer) -- the storage for the actual data is allocated dynamically already. Therefore, allocating an std::vector dynamically is only likely to save you something like two size_t s per stack frame. If you're right on the ragged edge of something working or not, that might make a real difference, but I'd guess it's pretty rare (and if you are that close, you should probably be looking at other possibilities first).
