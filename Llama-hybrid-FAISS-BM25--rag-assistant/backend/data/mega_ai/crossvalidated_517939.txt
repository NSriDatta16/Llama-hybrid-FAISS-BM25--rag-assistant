Given a dataset (with no other information), you can never prove or know that a set of measurements include "noise" where noise is defined as a random process governed by a probability distribution. What is perceived as noise could possibly be a signal of an unknown cause. However, you can check assumptions about a signal that you perceive as noise to determine if it is effectively noise for your analysis. In simple linear regression, $Y = \beta X + \epsilon$ . $\epsilon$ can be assumed to be noise if it follows a normal distribution $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ and if the distribution of $\epsilon$ is statistically independent of the regressors. In cryptography, there are also multiple tests of randomness that get applied to potential random number streams to determine if they are sufficiently random. I don't normally see this type of thing in statistics / data science though. See this from NIST.
