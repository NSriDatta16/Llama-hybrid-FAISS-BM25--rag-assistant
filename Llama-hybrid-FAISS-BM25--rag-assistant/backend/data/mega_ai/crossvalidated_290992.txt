Use 3 dimensional points say $(x;y;t$) with $x$ and $y$ being latitude and longitude and $t$ is time. For example, if you use the Haversine distance $h$ on Earth, then you can combine it with time by a formula such as $$d((x,y,t),(x',y',t'))=\sqrt{\left(\frac{h((x;y),(y,y')}{h_0}\right)^2+\left(\frac{t-t'}{t_0}\right)^2}$$ $h_0$ and $t_0$ are the scaling coefficients. You must choose them carefully. Assume 1 day is the average duration for a stay, and 10 kilometres is the average geographical range of a stay (and $h$ is expressed in kilometres). Then it makes sense using $t_0=1$ day and $h_0=10$ km. A note about the choice of the clustering algorithms : You want to use DBSCAN which is ok. KMeans wouldn't be a great choice since you don't know the number of clusters $K$. I would recommend a density based algorithm (DBSCAN is one of them). Generally density based algorithms work as long as the dimensionality is small (3 is small) and the clusters look like "grapes". My favourite is the mean shift : the complexity is a bit more than KMeans : $\log(N)N^2$ instead of $\log(N)KN$ but still reasonable. There are variants that will make it more or less clever, more or less fast... (I know DENCLUE is an advanced mean shift for example).
