These data sets appear to have two fundamentally different types of data. Data Set 1 contains a distribution of fuel consumptions for vehicles in each year. This distribution has a mean and standard deviation. Data Set 2 contains one number for each year - the sales-weighted average fuel consumption. This number is not a distribution. It exists only as an aggregate measure of the data in Data Set 1. The distribution you would have from Data Set 2 is the distribution of sales-weighted average fuel consumption in different years.
