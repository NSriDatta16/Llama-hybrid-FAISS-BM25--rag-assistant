How to speed up c++ linking time

Is there any way, to optimalize linking time in MS Visual studio C++ (2005) ? We're using Xoreax Incredibuild for compilation speed up, but nothing for link. Currently every linking takes about 30seconds. When I turn on incremental linking, takes abou 35-40 seconds. ( No matter if i compile project with or without incredibuild ) Is there any way, how to profile linker and watch how long what takes ? Or any tool for paralel linking ? Or any tips for code optimalization to speed up linker ? Thanks for reply Ludek Vodicka Edit: Thanks for first replies, and additional info: Whole Program Optimization and link-time code generation is already off. PIMPL idiom is already used when possible other static libraries are already included via #pragma comment(lib, "pathToLib").
