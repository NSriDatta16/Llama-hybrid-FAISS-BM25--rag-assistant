some algorithms to identify of a pattern in text data

I have few sentences like below in my project(around 25000), sentence1 = 'Must be able to multi-task in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment' sentence2 = 'Strong organisational skills and proactive approach' sentence3 = 'in this role you will design develop and revise application simulations in alignment with product implementation timelines' sentence4= 'ensures appropriate cross-referencing between documents within and across qms chapters/topics' From these sentences, I am trying to determine what functionality is being expected from the person or like what person has to do. I need to identify those keywords. I can use any ML techniques or any other method to determine the keywords, for example in sentence1 = [multi-task, fast paced, deadline-driven environment] senetence3 = [design develop and revise application simulations] I tried to identify those words with help of POS but that wasn't very useful. Are there any algorithms or ideas or methods that can detect such keywords ?
