Do Random Forest overfit?

I have been reading around about Random Forests but I cannot really find a definitive answer about the problem of overfitting. According to the original paper of Breiman, they should not overfit when increasing the number of trees in the forest, but it seems that there is not consensus about this. This is creating me quite some confusion about the issue. Maybe someone more expert than me can give me a more concrete answer or point me in the right direction to better understand the problem.
