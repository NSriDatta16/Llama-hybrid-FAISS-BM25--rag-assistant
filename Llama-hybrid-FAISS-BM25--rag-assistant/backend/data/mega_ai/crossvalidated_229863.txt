Chi-square test alternatives when cell expecteds condition violated: Bayesian method

Say I have data collected from an independent multinomial sampling scheme that violates Cochran's cell expecteds condition. Instead of Pearson's $\chi^2$ test of independence, can I use the Bayesian method? If so, I would like to make sure that I am making the right interpretations. The raceDolls example in the BayesFactor package was useful, but I want to extend this to an nx5 table and make sure I understand the output. Here's an example: set.seed(21) #Create fake data. Yes, I could just create a table with those probabilities, but this was more fun. df The output shows $BF_{01}^I = 0.07$, so it 14 times more likely under the null hypothesis of independence than the alternative hypothesis.
