Visualizing predicted probabilities from logistic regression with a weighted sample in Stata

I was using the predxcon command to graph the predicted probabilities for logistic regression. Basically I want to see the pattern for predicted probabilities of the outcome by each age group. Using predxcon command, it provided the graph, as well as corresponding values. However, I realized that the sample is weighted and I need to use svy to adjust for the weights. I am wondering if there is any program like predxcon when using svy ? I am planning to calculate the predicted probabilities based on coefficients provided by the regression result with adjustment by the weights. Is there anything I should be aware of, since this is svy ? Do I need to consider weights or I can just use the coefficients for each predictor?
