Unfortunately, they truly seem to be independent hypotheses and so should be tested with separate tests. This speculation has to do with accepting data at its face value with just the two values headache and condition . Note that specifying method="bonferroni" in each test will not intelligently look between either test. What you will need to do is extract the $p$ -value from each analysis, create a vector, and input that vector to the p.adjust function in R to obtain Bonferroni adjusted $p$ -values. Was that your question? There are also other methods of handling multiple testing. Again, this consideration is not a matter of elegance as you put it. And questions about code are off-topic.
