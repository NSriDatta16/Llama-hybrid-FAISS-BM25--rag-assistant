The thing that is called a "time series" in normal statistical parlance always has regular values. There are techniques for filling in missing values (e.g. you want to analyze a daily temperature record with time series techniques, but there are some days the guy recording them was out sick). But this looks like an inherently stochastic problem: the time at which entry appears is inherently random. If I understand your problem correctly, you can transform this into a time series by counting the number of entries per day (or week, or whatever). This count is then a time series, in the usual understanding of the term, and can be analyzed as such. And since what you want to predict is itself a number of entries in some future time period, this is probably the right approach.
