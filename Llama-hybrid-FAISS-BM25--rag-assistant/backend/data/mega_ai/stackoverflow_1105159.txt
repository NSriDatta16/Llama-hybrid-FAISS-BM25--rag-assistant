Error when embedding regular expression (phone numb validate) on xml schema (xsd)

I don't understand why this regular expression for validation international phone number gives an error when embedded on xml-schema: What's wrong with it? Does support group matching? Why is not supported by Xml Schema ? Thank you very much. Indrit
