What to do when rejecting a proposed point in MCMC?

I'm writing a simple Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. Every time a move gets accepted , the point is added to a list of accepted points. I wonder what exactly I should do when a proposed move has been rejected . Should the last accepted point be added to the list again , thus making the list one entry longer, or should I not add anything to the list, continuing until finally some new point gets accepted?
