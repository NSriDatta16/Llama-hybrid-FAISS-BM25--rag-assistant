The whole point of neural networks is to be able to generalize. In other words, neural networks would be useless if they could only ever be used on your training data and will completely fail on test (real world) data. The training of a neural network is supervised training so presumably you already know all the answers for your training data. Hence, to your general question of "can a neural network work with (support) data which was not there while training" the answer is of course yes - depending on what you mean by "support" data. The million dollar question is not can neural networks generalize (they certainly can), but will my neural network generalize to the extent that I want it to ? There is no general answer to this question, it depends on the neural network and how you train it. There's a lot of issues that arise with this question including issues of overfitting and covariate shift . You would have to experiment to see if you can get a neural network to make predictions up to your standards.
