Regular expression simplification - too many groups

I'm writing a simple text grabber for C-Style pre-processor. The input text (sample): #if 1 > 0 blah #if defined MACRO1 blah blah blah #if !defined MACRO2 blaaaah #if ! defined MACRO3 blah? I want to capture the text which comes after every #if [!] defined statement. The output that I would need from the above text is: MACRO1 MACRO2 MACRO3 The line numbers required to be captured here are 3, 5 and 7. Note that line 7 has got spaces mixed with tabs. I tried to create expressions which can give me this result, but none so brilliant. My expression which gives the desired result is- (? Options used are: Multiline + IgnoreCase But I am sure this is not elegant, and concise. Can anyone suggest better expression please? PS - I am using Expresso to test the expression.
