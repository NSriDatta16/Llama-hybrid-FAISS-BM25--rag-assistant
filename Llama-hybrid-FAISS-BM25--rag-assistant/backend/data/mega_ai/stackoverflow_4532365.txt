From question 14.090 of the OpenGL FAQ : 14.090 How do I obtain exact pixelization of lines? The OpenGL specification allows for a wide range of line rendering hardware, so exact pixelization may not be possible at all. You might want to read the OpenGL specification and become familiar yourself with the diamond exit rule. Being familiar with this rule will give you the best chance to obtain exact pixelization. Briefly, the diamond exit rule specifies that a diamond-shaped area exists within each pixel. A pixel is rasterized by a line only if the mathematical definition of that line exits the diamond inscribed within that pixel. Then from section 3.5 of the OpenGL Core Profile specification : Because the initial and final conditions of the diamond-exit rule may be difficult to implement, other line segment rasterization algorithms are allowed, subject to the following rules: The coordinates of a fragment produced by the algorithm may not deviate by more than one unit in either x or y window coordinates from a corresponding fragment produced by the diamond-exit rule. The total number of fragments produced by the algorithm may differ from that produced by the diamond-exit rule by no more than one. For an x-major line, no two fragments may be produced that lie in the same window-coordinate column (for a y-major line, no two fragments may appear in the same row). If two line segments share a common endpoint, and both segments are either x-major (both left-to-right or both right-to-left) or y-major (both bottom-to- top or both top-to-bottom), then rasterizing both segments may not produce duplicate fragments, nor may any fragments be omitted so as to interrupt continuity of the connected segments. So, the answer is the the specification does not require lines to be joined as you might expect. If your lines were all x-major or all y-major, then rule #4 above would give you the expected output, but in your rectangle, you're alternating between x-major and y-major lines. If you want to guarantee connected lines with no gaps or overlaps, you should render with GL_LINE_LOOP (or GL_LINE_STRIP for a connected series that does not end where it starts) instead of GL_LINES .
