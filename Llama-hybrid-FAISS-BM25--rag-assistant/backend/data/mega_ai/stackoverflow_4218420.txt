How could you give a computer a "natural need"?

So the idea is that a computer agent would be programmed in two layers, the conscious and unconscious. The unconscious part is essentially a set of input and output devices, which I typically think of as sensors (keyboard, temperature, etc. to the limit of your imagination) and output methods (screen and speakers notably in the case of a home PC, but again to the limit of your imagination). Sensors can be added or removed at anytime, and this layer provides two main channels to the conscious layer, an single input and a single output. Defining what kind of information travels between these two layers is sort of difficult, but the basic idea is that the conscious part is constantly receiving signals (of various levels of abstraction) from the output of the unconscious part, and the conscious part can send whatever it wants down to the unconscious layer through the input channel. The conscious layer initially knows little to nothing, it is just being completely blasted by inputs from the unconscious layer, and it knows how to send signals back, though it knows nothing about how any particular signal will affect the unconscious part. The conscious part has a large amount of storage space and processing power, however, it is all volatile memory. Now for the question. I would like for the conscious part of the system to "grow" in that it has no idea what it can do, it just knows it can send signals, and so it starts out by sending signals down the pipe and seeing how that affects the sensor data it receives back. The dead end is that the computer is not initially trying to satisfy a goal. It is just sending signals around. To think of it like a baby being born, they need food, or sleep or to be moved out of the sun, etc. The sensory inputs of the baby are fed to its brain, which then decides to try making use of its outputs in order to get what it needs. What kind of natural need can a computer have? What have I tried? Thinking specifically about how a baby becomes hungry, I certainly haven't read any research on cat scans perform on crying hungry children or anything, but I thought perhaps a particular signal comes from the unconscious with growing speed constantly which is only satiated when the signals sent back cause the baby to eat. The conscious brain's job would be to minimize the rate at which each type of signal comes in at. In other words, the "instinct" of the computer is to limit the rate of each signal coming in. What other "instincts" could there be? The problem with this analogy of course is, computers don't need to eat. Or at least I haven't been able to translate eating to something a computer needs. Outside of the scope of this question The end goal of this is to teach a computer who knows nothing except how it interacts with the world to play tic-tac-toe. So another idea I had was to supply a button you could press to manually stimulate the rate of a particular signal entering the conscious when it does something bad or manually soothe the rate of a particular signal when it does good.
