Is stationarity a requirement when using neural networks for time series forecasting?

I'm getting conflicting information on whether stationarity is a requirement when using neural networks for time series forecasting: In this lecture , the speaker says it isn't a requirement. In this lecture , the speaker say it is. (These aren't the only two sources where I've seen this conflicting information). Can someone help me figure which is correct? Or if the answer is ambiguous (i.e. still an open question), can someone point me to a good resource (review paper, book chapter, etc...) on the topic?
