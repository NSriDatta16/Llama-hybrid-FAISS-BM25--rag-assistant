In a regression model with a binary independent variable, the coefficient is just the difference between the means of the two levels. In fact: If you have a linear regression model with only a binary categorical variable, this is equivalent to a two-sample t -test assuming equal variances. Switching the reference level therefore just switches the sign of the coefficient but not its value. By changing the reference level, you basically just change the vantage point from which you calculate the difference. Here is an example using a linear regression model with a binary predictor (I'm using R but the software doesn't matter): library(visreg) data("mtcars") # Convert transmission to factor with "automatic" as reference level mtcars $am am, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("automatic", "manual")) mod1 $am am, ref = "manual") mod2 We can visualize the coefficient for the first (left) and second (right) model: You see that the difference between the two levels stays the same. When "automatic" is the reference, the coefficient tells you how much larger/smaller the mean of the other level is. In this case, cars with a "manual" transmission have on average 2.16 more mpg (mileage per gallons) compared to cars with an "automatic" transmission. When we change the reference level to "manual", the coefficient tells you how much larger/smaller the mean of the category "automatic" is. From the point of "manual", cars with an "automatic" transmission have a 2.16 lower mpg, hence the minus sign of the coefficient.
