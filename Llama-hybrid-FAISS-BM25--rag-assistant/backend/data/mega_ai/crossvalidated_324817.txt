Let's assume, the incidence rate of A1, A2 and A3 are constant values (not increading or decreasing in time), then this could probably be modelled as $Poisson$-distributed. (Though you would need to check for overdispersion and then consider negative-binomial distribution or sth. similar. Let's stick to Poisson for the time being, just to show the approach). A Poisson distribution is defined by the incidence rate $\lambda$ (the incidence per interval): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution You should now computer plausible values for the three lamdas $\lambda_{A_1}$, $\lambda_{A_2}$ and $\lambda_{A_3}$ to check, how much they overlap. One out of endless possibilities to do that practically in R would be an Baysian regression using MCMCpack to illustrate: library(MCMCpack) counts If you are not into Baysian analysis, you could certainly find a function for a 95% confidence interval for $\lambda$ in your favourite statistcs program. In R something similar to: summary(glm(counts ~ treatment -1, family = "poisson"))
