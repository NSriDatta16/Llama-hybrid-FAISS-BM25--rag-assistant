You should look at the Fisher-Yates shuffle. From the article: Properly implemented, the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle is unbiased, so that every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is also rather efficient, requiring only time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and no additional storage space. So it meets your requirements. It's pretty easy to implement too.
