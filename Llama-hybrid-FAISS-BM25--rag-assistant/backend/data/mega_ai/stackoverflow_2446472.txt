There are many ways you can name your log files, you have to consider several factors: Is your file generated by a special server or application in a group? Then you should add the name of the server to know where it does come from. Example: Server1.log In the log file there could be many levels of logging, if you want you can configure different files for different levels. Example Server1.info.log Server1.err.log You should add a date if your application runs for many days or if you want to keep track of errors for future reference, add it at the start of the name in yyyyMMdd format on windows or linux so they will be sorted by date automatically in command line commands or add it at the end if you want them more organized: Server1.info.log.20100315 (Linux) Server1.info.20100315.log (Win) You can try with different combinations, it all depends on what sorting style and archiving style you want to achieve.
