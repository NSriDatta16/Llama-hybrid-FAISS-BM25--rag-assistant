In general, evaluation of pre-post effects in time-series analysis is called interrupted time series. This is a very general modeling approach that tests the strong hypothesis: $\mathcal{H}_0: \mu_{ijt} = f_i(t)$ versus $\mathcal{H}_1 : \mu_{ijt} = f_i(t) + \beta(t)X_{ijt} $ Where $X_{ijt}$ is the the treatment assignment for individual $i$ at time $t$. The easiest example is treating $\beta$ as a constant function and $X_{ijt}$ as a 0,1 indicator for 0: pre-intervention 1: peri-or post-intervention. Even if the actual "effect" of the intervention is different than this, this test is powered to detect differences in many types of scenarios, for instance, if $\beta(t)$ is any non-zero function, then a working constant parameter $\beta$ will estimate a time-averaged positive response to intervention and is non-zero. A challenge in time-series analysis of pre-post interventions is using a parametric modeling approach for the auto-correlation. With many replicates of time and function, one can decompose the trend into lagged effects, seasonal effects etc. This would obviate the need for autocorrelation in the error term. Therefore it is not necessary to use forecast, but the model itself directly predicts what would have been observed in the post-intervention time period. Consider the famous Air Passengers data in the datasets package in R. ## construct an analytic dataset to predict time trend using auto-regressive and seasonal components AirPassengers It's obvious this provides an excellent prediction of the time based trends. If, though, you were interested in a test of hypothesis as to whether "flying increased" post, say, 1955, you can update the dataset to include a 0/1 indicator for whether or not the time period is post that point and test its significance in a linear model. For example: library(lmtest) library(sandwich) AirPassengers$post = 1955 fit Gives me: > coeftest(fit, vcov. = vcovHC)['postTRUE', ] Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) 0.03720327 0.01783242 2.08627126 0.03890842 Which is a nice example of a spurious finding, and a statistically significant effect that isn't practically significant. A more general test could be had by allowing heterogeneity between the month specific effects. nullmodel Both of these are examples of the general approach to "interrupted time series" for segmented regression. It is a loosely defined term and I'm a little disappointed with how little detail the authors use in describing their exact approach in most cases.
