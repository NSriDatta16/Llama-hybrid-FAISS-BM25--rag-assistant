Is it a big problem to have such small cell sizes? Yes, it is. It can lead to overfitting. If one level of your dependent variable has only 5 people (or even fewer) in it, then even a model with just one independent variable can be problematic. This is true for ordinal or binomial logistic regression. For the ordinal model, it may be possible to combine two levels of the dependent variable. But, if you have a lot of independent variables, you will need more data. For 1 and 2, yes, those are consequences of small cell sizes (at least, that's one possible cause, and a likely one in your case).
