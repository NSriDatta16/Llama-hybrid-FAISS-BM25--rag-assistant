Building a Java EE app on Mac OS X Snow Leopard for Glassfish 3

I'm having a bit of a problem building a Java Enterprise Edition web application on Mac OS X 10.6.2 using Ant 1.7.1, Glassfish v3 and Java EE 6. The problem is that the build process does not find the Java EE libraries which fair enough as I don't think Apple supply them with the default Java installation but I know they exist in the Glassfish distribution. Which jars are the correct ones to build against (I'm assuming javaee.jar is a general jar which references all the other needed jars) and what should I be putting in my ant build.xml file? Any help is very much appreciated.
