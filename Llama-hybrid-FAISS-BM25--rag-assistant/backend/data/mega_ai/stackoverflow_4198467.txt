embeddable javascript brainstorming tools

I'm trying to develop a website to do some collaborative brainstorming with my friends. While there are plenty of websites offering mind-mapping services online, I would like to create my own so that we can share files/data while we brainstorm. So, I am looking for a plugin which I can embed in my HTML page to give us the functionality of a mindmap, which can be tied back to a database on our server. Does such a plugin/or a similar brainstorming/mindmapping plugin exist? From my research, only promising lead, webofweb.net, does not have a functioning website. If I cannot find a plugin, I will build the functionality myself. Here are my ideas. I'd appreciate your feedback and suggestions, as I am still an amateur html/javascript programmer. Use a javascript tree generator to dynamically organize enteries, display them in a FLARE visualization display them in a Jit visualization (thejit.org using the force-directed graph) use jqueryui draggables on a grid I'd lose the ability to link ideas, but at least similar items could be clustered together Are there any alternatives I have not considered?
