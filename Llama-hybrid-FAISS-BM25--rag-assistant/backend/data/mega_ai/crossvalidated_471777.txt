Regularisation with SVM

I am working on a dataset in which I have thousands of binary features and a binary response. From the interpretation side of things I would like to fit a SVM model combined with some sort of regularisation to reduce the number of variables while keeping a good AUC. Is there such thing on Python? It would really help me understand what features are better able to predict response since these are drugs that are classified as active (1) or inactive (0) against a protein target in cancer. Any other suggestion will be welcome. Kind regards,
