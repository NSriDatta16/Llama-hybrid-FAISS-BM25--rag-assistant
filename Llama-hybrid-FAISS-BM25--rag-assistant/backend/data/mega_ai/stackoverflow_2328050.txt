JMS will provide persistent storage, load balancing, and guaranteed delivery out of the box. A RESTful API would have to implement these core services from scratch. Of course you can use the RESTful API and in the REST Servlet use a JMS client to publish the mail data to a queue. This would remove JMS API dependencies from the calling sites. But either way, wrapping the complete mail instance in a REST and/or JMS message needs to be implemented.
