Is there any benefit for using 1x1 convolution over FC?

I see several authors describe their deep learning models with fully connected layer, but when they implement it, they use 1 by 1 convolution with stride 1 instead, I understand that, mathematically they are the same. My question is, is there any benefit for using 1x1 convolution over FC? From what I can see, it doesn't reduce memory usage, nor need less operations to compute: Suppose that v is a vector of size C (channels), and we want to produce M channels, without counting bias: for conv net, for each output channel, it requires C multiplications, C-1 additions, thus the number of operations is M * C_mul + M * (C-1)_add for FC, since it is a matrix multiplied by a vector, it also requires this much operations Memory wise, they both use C * M floats
