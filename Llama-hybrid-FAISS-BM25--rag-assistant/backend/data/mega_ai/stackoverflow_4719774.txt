Check out the binary serializer that is a part of sharpSerializer: http://www.sharpserializer.com/en/index.html It's very easy and works quite well. Here's a blog that talks about using it in WP7: http://www.eugenedotnet.com/2010/12/windows-phone-7-serialization-sharpserializer/ I am using it like (consider this psuedocode, and using the functions listed on eugenedotnet) in App.xaml.cs: Application_Dectivated() { IsolatedStorageFileStream stream = store.OpenFile(fileName, FileMode.OpenOrCreate); Serialize(stream,(obj)MyHugeList ); } Application_Activated() { IsolatedStorageFileStream stream = store.OpenFile(fileName, FileMode.Open); Deserialize(stream,(obj)MyHugeList ); }
