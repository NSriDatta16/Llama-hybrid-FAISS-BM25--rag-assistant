As to your main question, my answer is No. If you've seen such a distinction between the way the terms are used in time series contexts vs. cross-sectional contexts, it must be due to one or two idiosyncratic authors you've read. Rigorous authors would never be correct in using "correlation" to mean "causation." You've gotten ahold of a spurious terminology distinction there. Interesting question, though.
