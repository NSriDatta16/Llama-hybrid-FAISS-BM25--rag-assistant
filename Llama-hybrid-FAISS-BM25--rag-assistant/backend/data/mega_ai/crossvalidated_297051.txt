This is a common design method called repeated measures. In organismal studies (or human studies), this is usually done by testing the same individual, but in this case you would treat each cell line source as the 'individual'. In most cases, this is considered a strength, and is quite easily handled by linear mixed-effects models (LMM; or, depending on your stats program/statistical training, repeated-measures ANOVA). You're also correct about your sample size being fairly worrisome - in the case of a LMM, where Individual or Cell Source would be treated as a random variable, it's generally suggested that you need at least 4-5+ levels to treat it as random (rather than fixed, like Treatment - A vs B). Edit: To state it explicitly, repeated measures is almost always a strength, for reasons beyond statistical power (e.g., maximize sample sizes). Yes, if you would run this with a simple one-way ANOVA you would violate assumptions of indepence, but it's usually a trivial matter to use other 'flavours' of linear model that do not have this limitation.
