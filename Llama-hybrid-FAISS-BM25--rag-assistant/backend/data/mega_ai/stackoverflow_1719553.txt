The Entity Framework allows you to claim that columns are keys and that FK constraints exist where none actually exist in the database. That is because the SSDL (StorageModel part of the EDMX) can if necessary be manipulated by you and lie about the database. The EF will then interact with the database as if the keys and foreign keys really do exist. This should work, but all the normal caveats about referential integrity apply. See my Entity Framework Tips Hope this helps.
