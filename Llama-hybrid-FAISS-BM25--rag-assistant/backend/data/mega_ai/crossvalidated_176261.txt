I've implemented this here in a way that performs comparably to other implementations at least in my testing. At each step you have a residual R calculated across the entire data set (before any base learners are fit its the residual from predicting the average). You subsample without replacement and fit the learner to the values of R for the points in that subsample. Then you apply that learner to get a prediction across the entire data set and update R using that prediction. So you're still updating the residual across the entire data set, you're just randomizing the process of fitting each base learner a bit.
