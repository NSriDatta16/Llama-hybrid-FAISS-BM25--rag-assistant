I would serve these from an in memory database 15ksize * 15000 = 225Mb of raw data, even with significant overhead it will easily fit in a medium hosting plan. The disk based caches might be elegant here, e.g. memcachedb, ehcache or similar then you only have one API and some configuration. You should warm up the cache though on startup. The metadata can be in a mysql or similar. You might keep a mastercopy there too for easier management and as a backend for the cache.
