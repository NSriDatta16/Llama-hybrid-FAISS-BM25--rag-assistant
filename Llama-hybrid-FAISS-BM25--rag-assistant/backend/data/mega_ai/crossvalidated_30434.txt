Depending on your needs, you might find that recursive partioning provides an easy to interpret method for predicting an outcome variable. For an R introduction to these methods, see Quick-R's Tree-based model page. I generally favour ctree() implementation in R's `party package as one does not have to worry about pruning, and it produces pretty graphics by default. This would fall into the category of feature selection algorithms suggested in a previous answer, and generally gives as good if not better predictions as logistic regression.
