How do I pass the value of the previous form element into an "onchange" javascript function?

I want to make some UI improvements to a page I am developing. Specifically, I need to add another drop down menu to allow the user to filter results. This is my current code: HTML file: Select a test--> Test 1 Test 2 Test 3 This is pseudo code for what I want to happen: Select a test--> Test 1 Test 2 Test 3 Select a data display --> Show averages by student Show averages by homeroom Show averages by school How do I access the previous field's name and value? Any help much appreciated. Also, JS function for reference: function showGrid(name, value, phpfile) { xmlhttp=GetXmlHttpObject(); if (xmlhttp==null) { alert ("Browser does not support HTTP Request"); return; } var url=phpfile+".php"; url=url+"?"+name+"="+value; url=url+"&sid="+Math.random(); xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=stateChanged; xmlhttp.open("GET",url,true); xmlhttp.send(null); }
