I have set of x coordinates x={0,32,64,...256} and y={2,6,4....},i ll plot the graph along x_y axis,then i drag the point 128 to 64 along x axis,now i want left side of the point to be compressed and right side to be enlarged.How can i recalculate the coordinates of the graph in C. Any help is appreciated. here is my code... int arr_x[]={32,64,96,128,160,192,224,256}; int arr_y[]={7,12,8,6,14,22,18,24}; int x1=64,x2=128; //drag x2 to x1 int min_val=abs(arr_x[0]-x2); int idx=0; for (int i = 1; i x1) { arr_x[idx]=x2; r=(float)x2/x1; for(int i=0;i
