Efficient dataset size for a feed-foward neural network training

I'm using a feed-foward neural network in python using the pybrain implementation. For the training, i'll be using the back-propagation algorithm. I know that with the neural-networks, we need to have just the right amount of data in order not to under/over-train the network. I could get about 1200 different templates of training data for the datasets. So here's the question: How do I calculate the optimal amount of data for my training? Since I've tried with 500 items in the dataset and it took many hours to converge, I would prefer not to have to try too much sizes. The results we're quite good with this last size but I would like to find the optimal amount. The neural network has about 7 inputs, 3 hidden nodes and one output.
