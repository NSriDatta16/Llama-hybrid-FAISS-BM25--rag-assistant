Why is the size of my Visio file increasing?

This one is for a coworker: We are having a problem with one of our wireframe sets (a Visio file). Basically, the file continues to increase in size and is currently at 43 MB (yes, forty three!), when the average of our other sets are at about 5-10 MB each. When I saved a copy to my desktop and deleted all of the pages so it was basically a blank file, the size was still at 2 MB. This file is causing problems: it takes 3-4 minutes to save [another coworker] was trying to save and it basically decided to delete all of her updates we are very afraid that the file will become corrupt to the point where we will need to recreate it from scratch (a very costly possibility). Any ideas?
