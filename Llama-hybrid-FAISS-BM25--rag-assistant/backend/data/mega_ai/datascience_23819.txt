Data Science is the new "sexy" job. I got dozens of colleagues who ask me how to become one. Some, come to me and tell me that Andrew Ng's coursera course is hard, and what can they learn instead so they can put it on their CV. What all this means is that there are a lot of not well prepared people that think they can become a data scientist, and advertise themselves as such, but are really not. Many companies are starting to learn to vet better their candidates because of that. That said, I am going to answer your question: you have some real skills, you actually understand statistics, which most data scientist I work with don't. Many financial institutions will want people like you, they can find plenty of people who can write Java and set up a cluster and set up a machine learning algorithm without understanding what it does. They are technicians, but do not understand what the data implies. If you can show that you actually can "think" and provide insights, you can be appreciated much more. In fact, you can command a higher salary. What you need is to learn most used machine learning algorithms, maybe learn some python (easy if you already know R) and tailor your resume for those jobs who require actual thinking. You have real skills.
