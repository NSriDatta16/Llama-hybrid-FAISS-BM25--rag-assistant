Identifying outliers in sets of three measurements

I have a number of individuals with three measurements for each individual. In a normal individual I expect all three measurements to be roughly the same, but between individuals they can vary a lot. I'm looking for points that are outliers within individuals, not between them. I'm not sure how to do this though. I considered making radar plots or perhaps taking the average of two scores for each individual and plotting them against the third score, but neither of these seems ideal. Radar plots could get messy with the number of individuals I'm looking at, and the latter method forces me to combine data from multiple plots (i.e. the average of A and B vs C, the average of A and C vs B, and the average of B and C vs A) to identify which of the three measurements is the outlier, or go back to the data to check it. Do you guys have any suggestions? I'm open to graphical methods or statistical tests. Thanks!
