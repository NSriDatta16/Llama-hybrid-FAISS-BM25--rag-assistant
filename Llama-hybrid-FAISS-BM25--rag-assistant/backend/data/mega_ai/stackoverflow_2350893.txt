appSettings vs applicationSettings. appSettings outdated?

I've got some questions about two ways to save settings in the web.config. Appsettings : Look in web.config Usage in code-behind : ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["key1"]; ApplicationSettings/ Properties (autogenerated by using the 'properties'-tab in the project) Look in web.config True Usage in code-behind : Properties.Settings.Default.TestEnvironment So, what's the difference between these two storage possibilities of settings in the web.config? As far as I can see, a downside of the appSettings is that you have modify the web.config yourself and the appSettings are not strong typed, where as the applicationSettings are. Both are replaceable within a web deployment project. As far as I am concerned, there is no use for appSettings . Am I missing something here? Which is the historically seen older one?
