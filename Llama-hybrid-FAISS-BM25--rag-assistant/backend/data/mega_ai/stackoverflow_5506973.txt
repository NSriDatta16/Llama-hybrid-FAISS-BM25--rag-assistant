CSS, Salesforce, ExtJS, and the blues

I've been asked to demo some ExtJS UI enhancements to our current apps inside Salesforce. This is just a proof of concept that ExtJS will work as a good UI replacement for the default UI that most of our VisualForce pages use. Everything works great, that is, except a few odds and ends of the CSS. There are lots of styles inside "...visual.force.com/sCSS/21.0/sprites/13013.../Theme3/default" that are messing with the ExtJS elements. Specifically commmon.css and extended.css. Here's an example: Extended.css body .x-date-middle, .x-date-left, .x-date-right { background: none repeat scroll 0 0 transparent; } Is there an elegant way around this, or is ExtJS just not going to play well inside of Salesforce? For example: Is there a way that I can tell my VisualForce page to ignore commmon.css and extended.css?
