selecting iterations in random and grid search

I am trying to optimizing a random forest for binary classification. I am tuning cutoff, ntrees, mtyr and maxnodes using MLR library in R. For searching these parameters i have to define a tuning method and one evaluation method. For example defining tuning method. ## ex: random search with 100 iterations ctrl = makeTuneControlRandom(maxit = 100L) My question, is there any thumb rule to define number of iterations for random or grid search or 100 is a standard value to be use.
