include image files in Django templates shows broken link?

All, I've tried the tips found on the forum . Unfortunately i'm still stuck. The image doesn't appear in the template. As far as i've traced the errors now they are twofold: 1) one where the picture should appear there is still a broke link and an error message: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (NOT FOUND), **http://127.0.0.1:8000/Point3D/grafiek/laptop.jpg** So it does go in the right path, but can't find the image.. Which is in my MEDIA_ROOT or I receive: Resource interpreted as image but transferred with MIME type text/html with: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/Point3D/grafiek/** 2) The other error is that if i go to : http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/ i get: Permission denied: /media/ maybe this has something to do with it. For the rest i've followed roberts solution for now but without any luck.. Any help would be very much appreciated!
