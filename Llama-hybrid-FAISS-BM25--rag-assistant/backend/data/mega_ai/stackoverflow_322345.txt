Is there a way to programmatically delete all local shared objects from within flash?

I'm using local shared objects within flash both to store significant amounts of user data, as well as for caching data fetched from the server. However, I'm very concerned about hitting the 100kb default limit. Because the 100kb limit is for the whole domain, I'm concerned that the sum of multiple local shared objecs would sum to more than 100kb, but that each individual shared object would be less than 100kb. In addition, I can't for the life of me find a way to list or clear all the local shared objects for a given domain. Let's say you've created shared objects with random names, adding random data to each, such that you hit the 100kb limit. Is there any way to delete these shared objects if you don't know the name of each object? Or are you doomed to get the popup asking the user to increase the amount of storage space for shared objects? If the latter is true, this seems like a major flaw in Flash's design of local shared objects.
