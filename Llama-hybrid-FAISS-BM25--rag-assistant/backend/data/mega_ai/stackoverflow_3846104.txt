The fact that you haven't received the memory warning doesn't mean that it wasn't sent: Memory warnings are delivered to the main run loop; they will not be delivered while your function is still running. Instead, consider looking at the phone console (Xcode->Organizer->Your phone->Console, or the equivalent in iPCU). If it says something like "memory level is critical" and mentions killing your app, then you've run out of memory. Additionally, when you run out of memory, the crash reporter writes a "low memory" crash log with "jettisoned" beside the processes that were killed; you should see these in the Organizer. (Since iOS 4's "multitasking", jettisoning also happens to background tasks.) If it's due solely to the large pile of autoreleased objects, you can mitigate it to some extent with explicit autorelease pools: for (int i = 0; i Your code also leaks ret and rv .
