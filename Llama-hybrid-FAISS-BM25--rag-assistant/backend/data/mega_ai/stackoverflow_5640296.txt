what kind of replication should I use?

I can't understand the difference between transactional replication and merge replication. This is my scenario: In an organization I have a SQL server which need to collect information from different sql servers which are located in different parts of organization or around the city and some report will create according to gathered information. Data in different SQL servers update every 5 or 6 minutes. I don't know should I use transactional or merge replication?
