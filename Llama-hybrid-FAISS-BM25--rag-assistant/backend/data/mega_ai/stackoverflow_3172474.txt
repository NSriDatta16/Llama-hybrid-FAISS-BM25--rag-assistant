Biggest question besides some critique is, how should I bring in this file? I do not know of any good library for file IO, but the reading is pretty straightforward. Instantiate a StreamReader class using a 64kB buffer to limit disk IO operations (my estimations is 1500 transactions average per file per the end of the month). Now you can stream over the file: 1) Using the Read at the beggining of each line to determine the type of the record. 2) Using the ReadLine method with the String.Split method to get column values. 3) Create the object using the column values. or You could just buffer the data from a Stream manually and IndexOf + SubString for more performance (if done right). Also if the lines weren't columns but primitive datatypes in binary format, you could use the BinaryReader class for a very easy and performant way to read the objects.
