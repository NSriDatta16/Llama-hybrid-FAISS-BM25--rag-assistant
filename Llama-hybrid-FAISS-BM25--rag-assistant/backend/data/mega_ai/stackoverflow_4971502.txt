I fought through dragons^Wnonexistent documentations and it seems to be plausible:-) Having some time to hack some stuff together, I think it may worth a quick check. Extended purple-remote script: http://koshinae.pastebin.com/t7UTReWt Stuff using libpurple: http://koshinae.pastebin.com/HBQiwpDX - Callback script is run if someone sends an IM, stdout is written back, call this script purple-answering-machine. Important and good to know, that to use the internal DBus services, run this in e.g. screen for a long time :), the purple-remote should be run in the same dbus session. I made a script that starts a session at boot and exports DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS in all user's bashrc. Feels hacky?:) Anyone with better skills with libpurple, please halp us out! :-)
