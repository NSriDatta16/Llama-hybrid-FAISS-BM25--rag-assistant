Java doing a For loop but also using an iterator for Linked List ( "For, While") Loop?

I apologize for the basic question but my newness to Java is causing me some frustration and I am unable to find an elegant way to do this from my searches. I want to iterate through a linked list using a For construct but also have an numerical iterator so that I can break the loop after a certain number of iterations. I have this LL that I am iterating through: LinkedList docSearch; I tried doing it like this but then only the iterator part worked (the result was always stuck on the first entry for each iteration) for (SearchResult result : docSearch) while (iter2 Any advice is appreciated
