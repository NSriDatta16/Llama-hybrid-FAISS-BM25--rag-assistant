Generative Adversarial Network: How to find the most similar image to the output within the training samples?

How can one find the most similar image in the input data training set to the output of a tensorflow implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks ? If I use DCGAN , faces will be learned and I want to find the most similar image to the output from the within the training set. Edit: Question to the practical: DCGAN: How to nearest neighbor on the training set in sense of compressed sensing?
