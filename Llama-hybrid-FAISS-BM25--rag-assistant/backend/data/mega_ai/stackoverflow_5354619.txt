Builds are always in "Queue" Status in Visual Studio 2010 (TFS 2010)

I'm new to TFS and have a big problem when I want to make builds in VS2010. The builds don't run, they are always in Queue status (no error message). It's as if nothing happened. I searched all around the Internet and didn't find a solution to this problem. The TFS Server is already configured (the Build agent and controller are successfully tested, MsDeploy full installed) and I have a public Drop folder (\MyServer\Drops ==> C://Drops) on my server (configured with a domain account with full rights on the directory). My goal is to build and deploy my .net MVC project via TFS on the server (win server 2008 r2). I initially started with this article : http://vishaljoshi.blogspot.com/2010/11/team-build-web-deployment-web-deploy-vs.html Could someone tell where the problem could come ?
