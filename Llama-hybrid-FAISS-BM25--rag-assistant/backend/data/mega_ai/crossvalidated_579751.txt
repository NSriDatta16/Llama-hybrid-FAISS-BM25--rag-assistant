A common misconception about regression is that there are (normal) distribution assumptions about the features, which there are not. I might be concerned about a nonlinear relationship with the outcome or interactions with other features, but these are always possibilities. Methods to remedy these issues range from domain knowledge to flexible models with splines to neural networks that figure out the nonlinear relationships and interactions.
