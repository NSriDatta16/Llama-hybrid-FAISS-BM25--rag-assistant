It has to be slow, there's no other way. The CPU core is either running at full bore or it is turned off by a HALT instruction. From which it is woken up again by an interrupt. The effective CPU load is an average calculated over a period, typically one second. The amount of time it was running divided by the period. If you make the period shorter then the calculated value gets less accurate. Make it too short and the number will just jump between 0 and 100. You cannot change the sample rate in the WMI query afaik. You can get quicker (and noisier) updates by reading the performance counter directly. You'll find sample code in my answer in this thread .
