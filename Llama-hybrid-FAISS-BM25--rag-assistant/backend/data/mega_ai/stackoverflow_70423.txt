Quicksort is the fastest sorting algorithm in practice but has a number of pathological cases that can make it perform as badly as O(n2). Heapsort is guaranteed to run in O(n*ln(n)) and requires only finite additional storage. But there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average.
