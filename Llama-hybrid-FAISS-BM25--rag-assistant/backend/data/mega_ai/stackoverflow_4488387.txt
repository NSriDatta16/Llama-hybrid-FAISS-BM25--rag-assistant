thanks for the answer, i was able to figure it our after some time, it really doesn't matter if i use an image or swfloader to load the embedded swf, the problem is i cannot really directly call a function of the embedded SWF from the embedding SWF, what i had to do was dispatch events so that flex can communicate with flash and vice versa,,, this page was very useful for me http://flash.fincanon.com/archives/152
