We can compute this as zero: $F^{-1}(0)$ is the 0-quantile of the $N(0,1)$-distribution, hence $-\infty$ (which value is such that 0% of the probability mass is to the left of it?). Taking the average of this with some finite number like the median $F^{-1}(0.5)=0$ as in $(F^{-1}(0)+F^{-1}(0.5))/2$ still produces $-\infty$, and the probability that a standard normal r.v. (in fact, any r.v.) takes values less than $-\infty$ is 0: $$ P(X R seems to agree with my logic: pnorm((qnorm(0)+qnorm(.5))/2) [1] 0
