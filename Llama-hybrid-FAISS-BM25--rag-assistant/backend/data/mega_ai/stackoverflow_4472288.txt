Could it be the Low-Fragmentation Heap ? It seems to me that I read somewhere that LFH is enabled by default on Windows 7. However, quick search didn't reveal the confirmation, so I may be wrong here. There is an easy way to check, though. Call HeapQueryInformation on a handle obtained from GetProcessHeap and compare the results on different systems.
