We (A colleague and I) finally wrote a paper on that one. To summarized things we proposed two solution to quantify and give a statistical summary of the (spatio-temporal) propagation of errors along Denmark and along look ahead times. In the first one we compute the correlation between all pairs of wind farms and for all pairs of look ahead times (this is a function of 4 variables). When a pair is fixed, we showed that the correlation function has a local maxima along look ahead times, we said this is propagation! The temporal scale associated to a given pair of wind farms is given by the temporal lag for wich this local maximum is obtained. Plotting, for all pairs of wind farm the local maxima of correlation, the temporal lag that allows to obtain that and the spatial vector that joins the wind farms gives the right side of Figure 1. This can be used to compute a global propagation vector i.e. some sort of spatial average of the propagation speeds between pairs. Part of this is shown in left side of Figure 1, and guess what propagation of errors is West East in Denamrk (ok that was not a big surprise :)). We also analysed this conditionally to different meteorological situations in order to show the relationship between propagation and wind (speed,direction). The second one is orthogonal (in a sence :)) to the first one. For each time $t$ we fitted a spatio-temporal (along space and look ahead times) plannar wave model with constant propagation speed. This gives one propagation speed per forecast time $t$ (and $R^2$ measuring the quality of the fit obtained by the planar wave model). Then you can compute statistics on those speeds, eventually limiting to the cases when the planar wave fit is good. Results are seen in Figure 2. In the second case, we observed that the temporal average propagation speed has a similar magnitute as that obtained with the spatial average in the first case. If you want to look at this work more seriously, the paper is here .
