Open-sourced pairwise learning models

I am solving a classification problem using pairwise-learning training set. We have 2 classes: bad and good . We also have pairs of objects $(a_i,b_i)_{i=1}^n$, meaning that object $a_i$ is better than $b_i$. Each object is described through its real coordinates: $a_i = x_i^1, x_i^2, \dots x_i^k$. My aim is to build such an algorithm, that says for test object which is bad and which is good. The question is what open-sourced algorithms/programs/packages can you suggest for solving that kind of pairwise-learning problem. I have found only svm-rank algorithm from svm-light project that handles such pairwise training data. I wonder, didn't find anything similar in matlab/R/rapidminer.
