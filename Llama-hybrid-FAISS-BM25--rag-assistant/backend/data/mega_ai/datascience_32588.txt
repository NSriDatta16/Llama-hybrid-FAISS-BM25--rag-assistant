Tidy data in panda dataframe

There is a quite famous article by H. Wickham, Tidy data, where he defines a certain type of cleaned data and calls it (dataframe-)tidy, and illustrates in on several example using R. At the end, he compares his own definition of dataframe-tidy to other possible ways of achieving tidiness and mentions array-tidy in the following paragraph (but does not give any further explanations or examples): Fortunately, because there are many efficient tools for working with high-dimensional arrays, even sparse ones, such an array-tidy format is not only likely to be quite compact and efficient, it should also be able to easily connect with the mathematical basis of statistics. This, in fact, is the approach taken by the pandas Python data analysis library (McKinney 2010). What does array-tidy data mean and why does he imply that this is somehow the default for the pandas library in Python?
