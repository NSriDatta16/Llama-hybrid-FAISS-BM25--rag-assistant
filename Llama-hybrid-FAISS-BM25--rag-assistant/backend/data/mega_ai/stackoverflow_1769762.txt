Use Flash, because it is supported equally by all browsers. SVG is a standard, but only three user-agent vendors support it above 40% of the specification. Opera supports it above 90%, Adobe was supporting it above 80% but may be supported it better now than last year, and Safari is supporting it above 40% but not supporting in a comparable manner compared to the prior two mentioned groups. The specification is too long and so it is costly to implement correctly, which is the same reason HTML5 is expected to take 10 years to implement. Canvas is a part of HTML5, which is not yet a standard and is subject to change without warning. Aside from support I expect Flash to be the most efficient of these technologies for a rich programmatic experience. If SVG were supported more widely I would recommend it for all vector based interactive media that is not heavily dependent on rich programming, because it is least costly to maintain and expand.
