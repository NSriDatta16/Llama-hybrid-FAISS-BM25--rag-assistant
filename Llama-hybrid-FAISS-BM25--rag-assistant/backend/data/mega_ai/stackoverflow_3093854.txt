Both are compiled into 1 namespace, Contacts . It's rather normal you have multiple files and a single namespace. A namespace is just some kind of a wrapper around your classes.

This way you'll have 2 representations of 1 class name, Jail.Sentence and Linguistics.Sentence . Both also have a different body. I use my namespaces to 'organize' the code a bit. All of my interfaces exist in Projectname.Contracts and my normal code in Projectname This Wikipedia page is usefull also: Wiki
