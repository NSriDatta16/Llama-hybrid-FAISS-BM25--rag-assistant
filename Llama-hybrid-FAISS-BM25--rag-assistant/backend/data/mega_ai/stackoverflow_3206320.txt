Do you have fixed number of columns ie elements horizontally arranged side by side ? If yes one thing i can think of is having those many floated unordered lists and each element will be an li When an element is dragged and dropped inside the same ul, its index in the ul is changed. When its dragged across uls,its removed from this list and appended to the other and arranged as in case 1. Just have an idea right now... will have to try it
