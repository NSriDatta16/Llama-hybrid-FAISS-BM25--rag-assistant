Using mercurial in eclipse with linked source

I have an android project in my eclipse workspace. However, it uses source imported from another location - I dragged the folder onto the project and selected "Link to files and folders". The sources itself exists in a mercurial repo but the project does not. How can I get eclipse to give me a team menu for mercurial sources, is it possible? (I have installed MercurialEclipse plugin) The only thing I can see it offers me is when I right click the project to create a new mercurial repo which is not what I want. Thanks in advance Stephen
