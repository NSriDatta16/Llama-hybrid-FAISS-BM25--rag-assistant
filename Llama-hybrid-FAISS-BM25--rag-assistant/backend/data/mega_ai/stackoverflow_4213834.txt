It is likely the stylesheet has set spans to display:block which causes them to take their own line, such as the default styling for a div . To fix this you can add a style attribute: text1 text 2 However, this may still be overridden by the stylesheet if it is using the !important flag. For future debugging I recommend you look at tools like Web Inspector (Safari and Chrome), Firebug (Firefox) and Dragonfly (Opera). One final note, you can't have an id attribute that begins with a number, it must start with a letter.
