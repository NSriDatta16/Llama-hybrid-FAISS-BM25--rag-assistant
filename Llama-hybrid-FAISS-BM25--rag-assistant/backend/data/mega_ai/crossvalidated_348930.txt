After researching a few articles online and Keras documentation it is suggested that the RMSProp optimizer is recommended for recurrent neural networks.https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/optimizers.py#L209 Stochastic Gradient Descent seems to take advantage of its learning rate and momentum between each batch to optimize the modelâ€™s weights based on the information of the loss function in my case is 'categorical_crossentropy'. I suggest https://www.ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/ for additional information about optimization algorithms.
