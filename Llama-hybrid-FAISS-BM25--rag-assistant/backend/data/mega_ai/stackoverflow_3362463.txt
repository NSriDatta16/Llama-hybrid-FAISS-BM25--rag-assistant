If you mean "how to insert multiple nodes at once in one method call" , the answer is: it is impossible. The approach with DOM is always the same: create a node and append it somewhere. One by one. In your example above, you could leave out the TextNode creation and add the string content as the second argument to createNode . This would not use the automatic escaping and entity encoding though. The only method of mass creation is DOMDocumentFragment::appendXML . This would take an arbitrary XML string for input. This is non-standard though.
