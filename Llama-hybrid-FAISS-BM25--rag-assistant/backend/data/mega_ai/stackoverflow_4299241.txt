JQuery sortable lists and fixed/locked items

Is it possible to lock list items in JQuery sortable list in a way that those items will stay in that particular place in the list. For example, consider this pseudo list with locked items... item A item B(locked) item C(locked) item D item E item F item G(locked) So, I'd like to have the items B,C and G to be fixed in a way that if user drag and drop item D at the start of the list, the item A "jumps" over fixed/locked items B and C with following results... item D item B(locked) item C(locked) item A item E item F item G(locked) I've been searching for something like this without luck. Is it possible..?
