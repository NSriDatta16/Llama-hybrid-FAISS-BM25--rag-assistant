You have several options: Java ActiveX (only on windows) Silverlight Flash Flex Google Gears (the most recent version is capable of resizing and drag and drop from your desktop) I've done a lot of research looking for a similar solution to what you have described and there a lot of solutions out there that vary a lot in quality and flexibility. My suggestion is find a solution which will do 80% of what you need and customize it to suit your needs.
