As far as I know, there is no builtin way for achieving this. There are, however, two solutions that I can see: Use a Custom XML StyleSheet If you right-clik on the map and look carefully in the generated xsl stylesheet, you'll see a XML namespace declaration like this: ... ... This is the default behaviour of the BizTalk mapper and you cannot do anything about it. However, if you proceed to extract the generated XSLT and use this as the backend for your map, you can change this declaration to match the expected outcome. First, copy the stylesheet to the location of your project. Include this stylesheet as a file in your BizTalk project Update the stylesheet, so that the namespace declaration and the matching attribute prefix are correct. The resulting xsl stylesheet looks like this: ... ... Now you can use this custom stylesheet as a backend for the map. In Visual Studio, open the map. Click anywhere on a blank space in the BizTalk designer surface. In the map properties, locate the Custom XSL Path and specify the location of your custom stylesheet. Use a Custom Pipeline Component What you're after is that the message is correct for your target recipient. So the idea is to change the offending namespace prefix as part of sending the message outside BizTalk. The transformation happens during the processing of the send pipeline. Nic Barden has blogged and provided some source code about this here . You can use his sample as the basis for performing replacement of namespace prefixes, rather than replacing namespaces themselves. I strongly encourage you to check out the whole series of posts he's done about Developing Streaming Pipeline Components. Nic has made an extensive and thorough job of describing all that's needed to author robust and enterprise-class pipeline components. Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5
