This is used to override a previously set custom style, or undo a customisation. To clarify: p { color: #666; } p a { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; } p a.inactive { color: inherit; text-decoration: none; } All links ( a ) inside a paragraph will be blue, but this will set those with inactive to inherit from parent (the p ), which will make them gray in this case.
