Relationship between Intrinsic Dimension and Principal Components - PCA

I have a data space with 144 features 12x12 grid : and I know that I can fully describe it in M = 6 features with the help of PCA. My data space has intrinsic dimensionality = 3 (three grades of freedom : rotation , vertical and horizontal translation). The question is : Is M going to be equal to the number of intrinsic dimensions? Is there a relationship between my subspace of M and his intrinsic dimension ?
