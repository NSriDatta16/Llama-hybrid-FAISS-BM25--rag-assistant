Train-Test split is used to avoid overfitting in machine learning. In unsupervised clustering, you cannot evaluate, and thus you cannot overfit in this way. You can however overfit in different ways, by choosing e.g. an unsupervised evaluation criterion that measures a quantity that your clustering procedue also uses. You don't get the best result, but prefer the algorithm that is most related to your evaluation procedure. Don't use these measures to compare different algorithms.
