Simulation variance is brought about by the fact that estimating expectations (integrals that are part of likelihood functions) by averaging a bunch of realizations of the respective random variables is not precise for a finite bunch. It gets smaller with the number of simulations and not related to the sample size, N. Economic models may not have less simulation variance, they assume integrals to be computed exactly, so it is a separate issue.
