Elegant solution for managing .properties files in glassfish/tomcat/etc

Does anybody have a good solution for managing .properties files in a web application? Currently I have to pull apart my .war file before deploying, change the entries in my .properties file, and then redeploy to change settings. Alternatively I can ssh into the server, change the .properties file in the deploy directory and restart the application. A coworker has a rather elegant solution of using the GUI for setting JNDI properties in your Tomcat/Glassfish instance and reading those instead of a .properties file. The problem here is that when handing off the application to our operations teams they need to know which properties to add to JNDI. Has anybody found a great way to deal with this issue?
