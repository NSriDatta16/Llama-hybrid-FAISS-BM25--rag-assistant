Can I calculate a confidence interval for each of my predictions from my regression model?

I'm using random forest for generating a predictions on the regression. I've seen confidence interval constructed from evaluation metric of models instead of directly from the model prediction. Is it possible for me to bound each of my predictions in my test set with a confidence interval? My additional questions are: i) If it's possible, can you please put in detail the step-by-step, while being conscious about train/test splitting in model building? ii) if no, how to quantify the uncertainty in regression results?
