In terms of presentation you seem to be on a pretty good track. If you don't already have it, get a copy of the freely available Introduction to Statistical Learning , which has examples of how to present results of these types of models. Your presentation suggestions at first glance seem similar to examples in that book. It's not clear that over-sampling your minority (binge-drinking) class would do much good. See, for example, this Cross Validated page . As your re-sampling results indicate, there may be variability in your estimates of logistic regression coefficients from sample to sample with a 23/77 class breakdown, but that might well represent the true population value of the class ratio and the variability may be an inherent issue with this sample size. I understand that you would have more of a problem if the unbalanced classes in the sample do not represent the actual population class ratios, as for example the intercept in logistic regression for the sample would not be the value for the population. With 220 cases in the least prevalent class your 29 variables might lead to some over-fitting; in unpenalized logistic regression you typically want 10-20 such cases per predictor variable, limiting you to 11 to 22 predictor variables. (For a multi-level categorical variable, each level beyond the first counts as a predictor variable.) You thus might also consider penalized approaches. LASSO-based logistic regression will identify a subset of predictors, although the subset chosen might vary from sample to sample. A logistic ridge regression model that penalizes regression coefficients might be best for predictions from new data, as it uses information from all the predictors in a way that minimizes overfitting. Finally, if your binge/non-binge definition was based directly on some of your predictor variables, then those should be removed as predictors in your model as otherwise you will just be re-inventing your initial definition of binge drinking.
