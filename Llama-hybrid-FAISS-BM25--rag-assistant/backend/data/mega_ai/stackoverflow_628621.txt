sp _ start _ job I'm doing a similar thing at the moment, and the only way I've found to avoid using SSIS or some external shell is to split my load routine into 'threads' manually, and then fire a single master sqlagent job which in turn executes as many sp _ start _ job's as I have threads. From that point, they all run autonomously. It's not exactly what we're looking for, but the result is the same. If you test the job status for the sub jobs, you can implement your conditional start of sproc 3 as well. What's the point in 8 cores if we can't use them all at once?
