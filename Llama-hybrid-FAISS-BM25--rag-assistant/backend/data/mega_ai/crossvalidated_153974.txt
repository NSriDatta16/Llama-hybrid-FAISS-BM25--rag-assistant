Its been a while since this was asked, but the answer to the question is that this is the 2D distribution named the Rayleigh distribution. Here the assumption is that the Rayleigh shape factor is equal to both the standard deviations of the X and Y coordinates. In practice the value of the shape factor would be calculated from the pooled average of the standard deviation of X and Y. starting with $$ X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_x,\sigma_x^2)$$, and $$Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_y,\sigma_y^2)$$ use bivariant normal distribution. $$ f(x,y) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma_x \sigma_y \sqrt{1-\rho^2}} \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^2)}\left[ \frac{(x-\mu_x)^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-\mu_y)^2}{\sigma_y^2} - \frac{2\rho(x-\mu_x)(y-\mu_y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} \right] \right)$$ translate to point $$(\mu_x, \mu_y)$$ and assume $$\rho = 0$$. Also assume that $$\sigma_x^2 = \sigma_y^2$$ so replace both with $$\sigma^2$$ then the 2-D distribution is expressed as the radius around point $$(\mu_x, \mu_y)$$ which is known as the Rayleigh distribution . $$PDF(r; \sigma) = \frac{r}{\sigma^2 } \exp\left( - \frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) $$ where $$\sigma = \sigma_x = \sigma_y$$ and $$r_i = \sqrt{(x_i - \mu_x)^2 + (y_i - \mu_y)^2}$$ $$ CDF(r; \sigma) = 1 - \exp\left( - \frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)$$ Of course this is for the continuous distribution. For a sample of just 40 balls there is no exact solution. You'd need to do a Monte Carlo Analysis with a sample of 40 balls. Taylor, M. S. & Grubbs, Frank E. (1975). "Approximate Probability Distributions for the Extreme Spread" found estimates for the Chi distribution and the log-normal for that would fit the distribution of a sample. Edit - Despite Wuber's doubt, the theoretical proportions he calculated are: 0.3935 0.6321 0.7769 0.8647 0.9179 0.9502 0.9698 0.9817 0.9889 0.9933 From the CDF function the cumulative Sigma values for r (in sigmas) equal to range from: 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, ... , 0-10 are: 0.3935, 0.6321, 0.7769, 0.8647, 0.9179, 0.9502, 0.9698, 0.9817, 0.9889, 0.9933
