How to find a wrong predictor value based on other correlated predictors

I have five correlated predictors, ref the following pairs plot: Now I suspect that sometimes a predictor is wrong, as these come from different sources. In other words, four of the predictors of an observation can be right, but the fifth predictor can still be wrong. How can I detect this? As a start, I used only two predictors, being the "perc_opp" and "l_perc_opp". I thought to use the hat value, the diagonal of $h_{i}=diag\big(X_i'(X'X)^{-1}X_i\big)$ But then I am just selecting values with a high leverage, being also values whose both predictors seems fine (selected points with high leverage in red): How can I select just the points that are of the diagonal? And how do I do this in five dimension feature space?
