PictureBox to Bitmap or Image?

I am trying to change the code http://sites.google.com/site/webcamlibrarydotnet/winfrom-and-csharp-sample-code-and-download from picture box to image or bitmap as I dont want to display any image or plan to display, all I want is that it will output the image to file. I have tried changing the webcam.cs from PictureBox _FrameImage to Bitmap _FrameImage and PictureBox ImageControl to Bitmap ImageControl and casting (Bitmap) at e.WebCamImage As well as changing it on the main form: private void bWebcam_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { WebCam webcam = new WebCam(); Bitmap image = null; webcam.InitializeWebCam(ref image); webcam.Start(); webcam.Stop(); FileStream fstream = new FileStream("testWebcam.jpg", FileMode.Create); image.Save(fstream, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg); fstream.Close(); } Unhappyly it doesnt seem to work so how could I change it from picture box to Bitmap or Image or similar storage before saving it to a file or save it to file directly ? The source code I am using is: http://sites.google.com/site/webcamlibrarydotnet/winfrom-and-csharp-sample-code-and-download
