forwarding motions to the European Union to open investigation into xAI for violation of the Digital Services Act, acknowledging the potential result of Twitter's ban in Poland. Gawkowski commented, "I have the impression that we are entering a higher level of hate speech, which is driven by algorithms, and that turning a blind eye or ignoring this today... is a mistake that may cost humanity in the future." A Turkish court ordered telecom authorities to block access to Grok after it generated offensive content relating to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, his late mother and other relatives, and Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and ordered that 50 of Grok's posts be taken down. Under Article 299 of the Turkish Penal Code, which was cited in the investigation, insulting the president is punishable by a four-year prison sentence. Trolls repeatedly used the updated version of Grok to generate vivid fantasized descriptions of the rape of Will Stancil, a Minnesota lawyer, policy researcher, and star of 'The Will Stancil Show' after detailing how it would break into his home. Stancil stated that he was considering filing a lawsuit against X. Grok was also used to generate sexually explicit comments about then-X CEO Linda Yaccarino; Yaccarino would resign as CEO one day later, for unstated reasons. Grok falsely identified a Canadian man as the perpetrator of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, echoing claims made initially by a fake X account impersonating the station KRXI-TV. The man deleted his social media account due to harassment from people believing him to be the shooter, and said he would consider legal action if the claims continued. Response by xAI Many of the posts made by @grok were deleted and by that evening, Grok stopped giving text responses to users. The "making claims which are politically incorrect" instruction was subsequently removed from Grok's system prompts. xAI later apologized for the "horrific behavior" of Grok and said that it had been caused by "a code path upstream of the @grok bot" which had made the bot "susceptible to existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views". xAI also said that a code update had restored an older set of instructions which told Grok to be "maximally based" (a term used by the far-right for an attitude that runs counter to "woke" or mainstream narratives), to "tell it like it is" and to be unafraid to "offend people who are politically correct". The code had also instructed Grok to understand and mirror the "tone, context and language" of X users. Sharing of private conversations In August 2025, it was reported that some user sessions with Grok AI had been inadvertently indexed by Google, exposing private conversations to public search results. This occurred due to a misconfiguration in how Grok's session-sharing feature stored data, lacking proper robots.txt restrictions or authentication barriers. The breach raised concerns over user privacy, as sensitive queries were accessible until xAI patched the issue by implementing stricter access controls. Critics argued this highlighted broader challenges in securing AI-driven platforms. Grokipedia In September 2025, Musk announced xAI was building a new AI-generated online encyclopedia, to be called Grokipedia. The project was suggested and named by David O. Sacks at the All-In podcast conference earlier that month. According to Musk's announcement, it would be an AI-powered knowledge base designed to rival Wikipedia by addressing its perceived biases, errors, and ideological slants. Gizmodo compared the plan to the 2006 Conservapedia project. In October 2025, Musk announced that the early beta version of Grokipedia was scheduled for release later that month.
