Month level models You should capture the month level variations in the propensity to terminate (say signups during Christmas holidays are more likely to terminate than signups during April). Let's say your usual time series model is: $$terminations_{t}=\beta_{1} signups_{t-1}+ \beta_{2} signups_{t-2} +..$$ . Now if you believe that the parameters $\beta_{1}$ etc. are month specific you can interact the month indicator flag with the remaining predictors. Thus your new functional form will be $$terminations_{t}=\beta'_{1} signups_{t-1} MonthFlag_{t-1}+ \beta'_{2} signups_{t-2} MonthFlag_{t-1}+..$$ This is akin to building month-level models allowing greater flexibility in capturing month specific variations in tendency to terminate
