For me by far is , attributing cause without any proper causal analysis or when there is improper causal inference. I also hate it when zero attention is given to how missing data was handled. I see so many papers too where the authors simply perform complete case analysis and make no mention of whether or not the results are generalizable to the population with missing values or how the population with missing values might be systematically different from the population with complete data.
