What is zero mean and unit variance in terms of image data?

I am new to deep learning. I am trying to understand some concepts. I know "mean" is an average value and "variance" is deviation from mean.I have read some research papers, all say that we pre-process our data first. But how these concepts are related to image pre-processing? Why these concepts are used as pre-processing of image data? Actually i am unable to understand that how these techniques contribute towards classification.I searched it on google but may be i searched with less descriptive keywords Please bear my very basic question,
