Standard forecasting papers unfortunately usually only show the averages of errors, so you would show the averages of your MAPEs. The authors often then start to discuss differences in the third significant digit. Without a notion of the variation in errors, this makes no sense. Therefore, I very much recommend that you do indicate the variation in your errors, e.g., by giving standard deviations. In addition, it is common practice in (load and other) forecasting papers to present results on multiple error measures, e.g., the rmse or the mae in addition to the mape . I suggest you skim though a couple of load forecasting papers and be inspired by what you find there. For your specific data, a nice and useful visualization could be a dotchart like this (note how I jittered the dots horizontally to reduce overplotting): mapes
