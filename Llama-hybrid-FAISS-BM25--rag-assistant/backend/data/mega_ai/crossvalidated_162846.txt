Appropriate predictive model for two random time series with serial correlation

Say I have annual observations of the temperatures at the North Pole and South Pole for many years. I want to build a model that given the South Pole temperature for the current year and all prior history can predict the North Pole temperature for the current year: $$\widehat{T^{(North)}_i} = f \left(\left\{T^{(South)}_j\right\}_{j=1..i}, \left\{T^{(North)}_j\right\}_{j=1..i-1}\right)$$ What's an appropriate model here given that there will be significant serial correlation in the data? (from global and local climate/weather trends)
