How to solve a well fitted model - Model Misspecification

I am currently writing a paper, analysing the impact of goldprice movements on the capital structure of gold mining firms. My basic model is a simple OLS model with (y=leverage and x=ln(goldprice)). After testing for unit root in x I decided to use the first difference of ln(goldprice) which is the growth rate. Testing this model I find that i) y and x do not really have a linear relationship (exhibit 1); ii) I reject H0 of Ramsey Reset test, checking for omitted variables while linktest tells me that the model is correctly specified. But testing with plots I find strong evidence for misspecification (exhibit 2 & 3). Does anyone has an idea on what I did wrong - would be much appreciated.
