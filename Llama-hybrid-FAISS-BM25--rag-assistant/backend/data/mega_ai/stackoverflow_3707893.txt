ASP.NET in Chrome getting a strange focus_change nikkomsgchannel error

Very recently I started to get some strange focus_change errors show up in the console window in Chrome when navigating through my ASP.NET web application (details below). I can't find anything on the internet that references a "nikkomsgchannel" and have no idea why my application is making a request to this external resource (it never used to!?). Does anyone have any ideas? Request URL: http://nikkomsgchannel/focus_change?focused=true&name=nikkonill&type=nikkonill&form=nikkonill Request Headers: Origin: http://localhost:50349 Referer: http://localhost:50349/ResearchEnquiry.aspx?EnquiryId=63 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.472.55 Safari/534.3
