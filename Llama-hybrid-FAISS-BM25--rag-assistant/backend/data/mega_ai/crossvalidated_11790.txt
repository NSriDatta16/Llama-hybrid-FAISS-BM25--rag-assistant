Neural networks are sometimes called "differentiable function approximators". So what you can do is to differentiate any unit with respect to any other unit to see what their relationshsip is. You can check how sensitive the error of the network is wrt to a specific input as well with this. Then, there is something called "receptive fields", which is just the visualization of the connections going into a hidden unit. This makes it easy to understand what particular units do for image data, for example. This can be done for higher levels as well. See Visualizing Higher-Level Features of a Deep Network .
