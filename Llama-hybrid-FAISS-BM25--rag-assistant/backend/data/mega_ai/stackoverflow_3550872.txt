StickNotes data file is a Compound File (a filesystem within a file, an OLE storage container). Although the contents of a compound file are viewable through a compound file reader ( http://www.coco.co.uk/developers/CFX.html ), I can't find a port of the underlying CF/streams protocol. Related question: How to extract the contents of an OLE container?
