Testing whether the correlation between two time series is constant through time

The Problem: Given two time series, I want to determine if the (Pearson) correlation between the two time series is constant throughout time. Example: For example, I have the following two time series: Clearly, there is correlation between them. If I calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient I get $\rho = 0.960$ . However, I want to test whether this correlation coefficient remains the same throughout time. In principle, the correlation of two time series could change through time right? My current 'solution': I partition the two time series into sub-time series of equal length. In this case the total length of the time series is $n \approx 2600$ , so I split each time series into 52 time series of length 50. Then I calculate the Pearson coefficient for each of the 52 pairs. I then plot the coefficients: Apart from the three earlier points, the correlation looks to be fairly constant. However, this method isn't very mathematical. Is there a more rigorous test that I can do to determine if the correlation remains constant?
