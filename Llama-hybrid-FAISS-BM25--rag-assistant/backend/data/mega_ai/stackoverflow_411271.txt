A lot depends on the people working on the project, the integration points, etc. Even a single coder should have a code management tool and needs to interact with clients or the 'boss'. From experience, I've seen a change once there are more then 2 people and then probably any increase of 50%. If teams are organized by project teams, focused on decoupled parts of the product, the overhead increase will not exponentially increase as the team size increases (project vs. matrix organizations).
