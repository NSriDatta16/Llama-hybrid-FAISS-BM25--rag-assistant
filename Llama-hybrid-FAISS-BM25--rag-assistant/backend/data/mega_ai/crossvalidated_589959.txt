I believe quite sophisticated statistical engineering is required to adequately model this dependence. Your data is so called panel data (a combination of a time series and cross-sectional data). What is certain is that logit/probit is definitely a bad choice here, because one cannot allocate different years for the same company in one sample as if they are as independent as different years for different companies from you dataset. The huge problem with the OLS will be that the relationship between the number of breaches and the regressors is almost certainly not linear.
