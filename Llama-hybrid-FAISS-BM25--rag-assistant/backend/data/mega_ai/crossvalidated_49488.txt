Flipping random coins from a bag - equivalent to a single coin?

My first and I think naive question here. I am trying to model a certain business, and the simplest model I am willing to test is: 1. there is a bag of differently biased coins. 2. every step, a single coin is chosen with equal probability. 3. the chosen coin is flipped and returned to the bag. The business goal is to predict the rate of heads in future trials (probably using Bayesian inference). This got me thinking - am I not over-complicating things? Isn't this process (observationally) equivalent to a single biased coin? Thanks in advance!
