SVM/Linear Regression after PCA and making up numbers

I recently saw an answer on Stackoverflow where a person tried to run a linear regression after doing PCA but the answerer suggested making up the dependent variable. Is this something that's acceptable? Are there other ways of applying SVM/Linear Regression after PCA. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1805149/how-to-fit-a-linear-regression-model-with-two-principal-components-in-r
