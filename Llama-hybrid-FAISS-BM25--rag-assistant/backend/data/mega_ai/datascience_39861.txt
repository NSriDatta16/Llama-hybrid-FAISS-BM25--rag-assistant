objective in policy gradient equation?

I don't understand how this was deduced from first equation to second expectation. Is it from conditional probability theory? I checked but still can't understand. From wikipedia, the expectation of a continuous variable X is: But how could that be correlated? I mean I can take $r(s,a)$ as variable $x$ , but why that $\pi_{\theta}(s,a)$ could be taken as $f(x)$ ? Thanks a lot for any hint or link or book for reference.
