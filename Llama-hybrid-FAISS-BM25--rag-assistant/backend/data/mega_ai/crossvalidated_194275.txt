This is just one of the many exploratory data analyses (EDA's) that one could do for logistic regression that may shed some insights to the problem (and hopefully this clarifies my comment above @FrankHarrell). For clarity sake, let's give an understandable example. Imagine you have data for some people and of interest is trying to predict the individual's gender (male or female, so binary) based on their height (a continuous covariate). So, in my opinion, a good EDA to conduct would be to create box plots for the continuous covariate, height, based on the binary output, gender. Using some made up data, it would look like the following: And from this EDA plot I would think it would be reasonable to assume that including height as a covariate in a logistic regression would be a good idea since, visually, it appears that the two genders only take on certain height values with little overlap. I.e., when there is little to no overlap of the box plots then perhaps we should conclude that the covariate in question would be good for predicting (or in this case classifying) the binary outcome. When the box plots overlap considerably then this may not be case. In case anyone is interested in the R code: height = c(sample(40:62,100,replace=TRUE),sample(60:80,100,replace=TRUE)) gender = c(rep("Female",100),rep("Male",100)) boxplot(height~gender,xlab="Gender",ylab="Height",col=c("pink","lightblue"), main="Exploratory Data Analysis Plot\n of Gender Versus Height")
