It simply means you have one less VCS to manage in your development chain (svn). In term of administration: you are left with distributed repositories managed by Git, each one autonomous with their complete history you do not have to maintain a connection to a central SVN repo. you can organize your backups differently (pushing your data to a remote backup bare repo, or exporting your Git repo through git bundle ) And of course you can manage all the advantages of Git over SVN .
