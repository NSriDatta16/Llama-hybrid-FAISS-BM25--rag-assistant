Historical aggregate Twitter data

I want to graph the number of tweets and the number of followers over the last three months, but I haven't been able to find a way to do that either through the API or any ready-made tool. I tried TwitterCounter, but the data they provided was basically the result of some sort of interpolation function, not based on actual historical data. Is there a way to get historical aggregate data from Twitter (not the actual tweets, but the sums, averages, etc.)?
