You can use a parent controller to stay DRY. PHP doesn't support any kind of mixins or multiple inheritance, though, so being able to add generic functionality to one or more of your controllers isn't quite as easy. As far as authentication goes, allegedly this is one of the things that EllisLabs et al are working on for CodeIgniter 2.0 right now. They've mentioned that it's a pretty difficult task, and I think that is testament more to the fact that PHP sucks as a dynamic language than it does that CodeIgniter isn't suited to this sort of thing. If you're not married to PHP/CI yet, thumbing through what Ruby on Rails offers might be of benefit. All this authentication is handled with mixins and metaprogramming in a really elegant and flexible way.
