Product of a Laplace and Gaussian distribution

I have to derive some statistical distribution for a precision parameter combining one Laplace and one Gaussian distribution. However, from the absolute value arising in the Laplace density I am bit struggle to obtain some known distribution. Indeed, I am in a Bayesian framework trying to compute some optimal variational distribution $q^*(s)$ for a covariance parameter $s$ . A general result is that $q^*(s) = \log(E_{-s}P(.))$ , where $E_{-s}$ is the expectation over all parameters except $s$ and $P(.)$ is the joint. Assuming that my data likelihood for $X \sim N(\mu, s)$ with $s = 1/\sigma^2$ and $s \sim Laplace(0, \frac{1}{\lambda})$ . I am interested in computing $E_{-s}(\log(P(X | \mu, s)P(s| \lambda)))$ . Formally $P(X | \mu, s)P(s| \lambda)$ can be written as: $$ \prod_i \frac{s}{\sqrt(2\pi)}\exp\{-\frac{s}{2} x_i^2\} *\frac{\lambda}{2}\exp\{-\lambda|s|\} $$ IMPORTANT: Here $s$ refers to the inverse covariance parameter, with $s = [-\inf, \inf]$ . For this specific variational inference problem I am looking for a factorization into $s$ , expecting a form where we can identify either a Laplace or an exponential distribution. Indeed, it's a general result since the prior over $s$ is from an exponential family distribution. My attempts so far were: (1) Distinguish the cases where $s > 0$ and $s , leading to $ \exp\{s(-\sum_i \frac{x_i^2}{2} - \lambda)\}$ in the former case, while $ \exp\{s(\sum_i \frac{x_i^2}{2} - \lambda)\}$ in the latter. However I am not sure whether this distinction is correct. (2) Trying to re-express the Laplace as a mixture of a Gaussian and an exponential distribution (I read that it's a well-known result). (3) Trying to express the Laplace as a special case of some exponential distribution. But without success. Is there some way to conciliate these two densities ? Do I have to necessarily separate cases for negative and positive $s$ ? Did I miss something ? Any insights are welcome.
