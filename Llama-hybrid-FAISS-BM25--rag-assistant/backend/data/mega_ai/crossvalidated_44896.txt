How to interpret the output of predict.coxph?

After fitting a coxmodel it is possible to make predictions and retrieve the relative risk of new data. What I don't understand is how the relative risk is computed for an individual and what is it relative to (i.e. the average of the population)? Any recommendations for resources to help understand (I not very advanced in survival analysis so the simpler the better)?
