This is a common problem. I haven't found an elegant solution; the best I've been able to find is to manually escape the URL on the way in (e.g. by Base64-encoding it), and then manually unescape it inside your initWithURL: function. (Actually, you'd probably want to have a function called initWithBase64EncodedURL: or something like that, for clarity.)
