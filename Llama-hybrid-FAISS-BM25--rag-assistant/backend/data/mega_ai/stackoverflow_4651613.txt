Magento Bundle Selection Option Pricing Problem

I have a single store running several different languages/currencies and pricing is being manually set to 'pretty' prices, rather than just letting the currency conversion do it's thing. The problem is, when I create a bundle product and add options under 'Bundle Items', if I set a specific, 'fixed' price for an item it is retained globally -- I am unable to change the price for the bundle item option on a per-store basis. Is this a bug in the bundle module or is there something I'm missing?
