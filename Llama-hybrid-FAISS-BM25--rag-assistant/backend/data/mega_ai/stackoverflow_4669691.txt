sql - variable storage

What is the simplest way to store a string into variable. For example How do I store something into @bleh variable. SqlCommand stej = new SqlCommand("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test3 WHERE PostID = @bleh", con); @bleh variable has to be set somehow. I tried replacing @bleh with a 100,abc,da, etc. And it works. But my bleh variable will change with the loop. Thanks
