Does mixing different vitamins change the sugar content? If not, then solution is trivial: measure the sugar content of each of the juice, and pick the highest one. Any other combinations will dilute the sugar concentration. ============================= Edit ============================= One common mistake in any domain is to focus on the tools instead of the problem. Define the target clearly. By "the sweetest juice to me" , is it a subjective (you taste and tell; others may disagree) or an objective (e.g. can be defined by measurement of certain chemical(s)) goal? Assume the goal is objective, is there a fruit which is always measured to be the sweetest? If yes, pick this fruit. If not, do we know anything which casually affect the sweetness level? Can we measure them? Otherwise, do we know anything which correlates with the target? Do not put measures in just because they are available. In your case, can you logically speculate that vitamins are related to sweetness? If not, drop them. I can easily measure my height, weigh and heartbeat, but they don't help predict my commute time. These are the type of starting questions you should think about before all buzzwords e.g. machine learning, deep neural network, genetic algorithm and what not. Ask the right question, and you will see the right solution.
