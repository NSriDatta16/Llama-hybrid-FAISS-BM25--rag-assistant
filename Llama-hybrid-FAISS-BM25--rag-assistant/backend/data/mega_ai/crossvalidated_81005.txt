How to design experiments for Market Research (with a twist)?

Consider a kind of auction where you are presented with, say, 1000 prospective clients. Based on information about these prospectives--age, sex, race, income, educational achievement and the like--you may 'bid' to pitch your product to some fraction of them, say 250. (Ignore the cost of bidding.) To maximize your chances of selecting the right subset, I would probably use a model of our product's 'likability' built using logistic regression. I can fumble my way through this part well enough. However, to build the model of product likability, I have to do some market research, testing the product pitch on subjects that we may recruit from the population at large. This is actually fairly costly. Moreover, it should probably be tuned to the demographics of the population from which the prospectives are drawn. For example, a factorial design, say, might ask us to recruit test subjects in equal proportion across the levels of the race factor, when in reality we are likely to encounter very few Native Americans, say, in the 1000 prospectives, and can simply choose not to pitch to them at all as a rule. (Sad, but true.) How should such an experiment be designed? To be concrete, the design variables are all categorical and ordinal factors, the bidding fraction is an input parameter (1/4 in the example quoted above), as is the maximum number of subjects that can be recruited. It seems like maybe some mix of experimental design and random sampling might be appropriate, but I am open to all reasonable suggestions and pointers. I should also note that given the likely small effect sizes and the small sample recruitment pools that we can afford, it is unlikely that the market research will yield statistically significant regression coefficients. And so overoptimizing the experimental design is probably silly, and any reasonably non-insane procedure will suffice.
