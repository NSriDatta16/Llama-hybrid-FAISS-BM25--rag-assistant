Talking about money is usually the best way to get management attention, so here are a few suggestions: Estimate how long it takes you to do your current manual testing. Get a list of critical bugs that were found by customers - ideally with an idea of the impact cost (fixing a bug after release is always much more expensive than before), but it's usually good enough just to describe one or two particularly bad bugs. Your manual testing didn't catch these customer bugs, so this is a good way to demonstrate that your manual testing is inadequate. Come up with a pilot project where you automate testing a certain area of the product where bugs were found in production. Estimate the cost of the pilot project - doing a restricted pilot has the advantages of being easier to scope and estimate. Then compare the ongoing cost of repeatedly running the automation versus testing every release manually; after a few release you should break even on the cost of the automation tool plus the test development. Be careful picking the automation area - try to avoid areas like a complex UI that might change significantly between releases and thus require a lot of time to be spent on updating the automated tests.
