How to derive probability distributions for event count time series using R?

I need direction for a robust approach in R for deriving probability distributions for selected time points in event count time series. In the below illustration: "Period_1" shows elapsed number of months, "1stStateX" shows the number of times elements in the population reach a state of X (it's binary, either an element reaches X or not and it's a "dead state" in that an element can only hit X once), "cumStateX" runs a running cumulative total of 1stStateX, "totalUnits" is the number of units in the population, "rateCumX" is the mean (or cumStateX/totalUnits), and then variance, standard deviation, and standard error; I show my calculation for these at the bottom. For example, I highlight below period 18 where the cumulative mean rate of reaching X is 47.89%. I would like to derive a probability distribution around that 47.89% in period 18. Perhaps a Poisson Autoregressive Model or Autoregressive Conditional Poisson Model is the way to go for forecasting (I've been fiddling around with R packages ACP and tscount for forecasting), but at this point I'm more interested in simply drawing probability distributions around selected periods. Could someone please advise on how to proceed for deriving point-in-time probability distributions, R packages that may help, etc.? In the above, I calculate as follows using data.table (calculations are obvious even if you don't know data.table ): [rateCumX:= cumStateX/totalUnits] [, var:=totalUnits * rateCumX * (1-rateCumX)] [, sdv:=sqrt(var)] [, serr:=sdv/sqrt(totalUnits)] Revised standard error of the mean for binomial distribution ("serr")(1st 18 rows only of same data from original post), using data.table R package: ,rateCumX:= cumStateX/totalUnits][ ,var:=totalUnits * rateCumX * (1-rateCumX)][ ,sdv:=sqrt(var)][ ,serr:=sdv/totalUnits]
