"Panel" granger test with shared model coefficients

My question concerns ways to implement a Granger causality model for panel data. The standard panel granger test (Dumitrescu/Hurlin (2012)) for N units and T time steps essentially carries out N separate individual granger tests, and computes a test statistic that is the average of the individual test statistics. My concern is that the model coefficients can be different between each unit. I'm interested in coming up with a general model of the effect of X on Y. The effect should be fairly similar across all units. The standard panel Granger methodology does not seem to handle this. Is there a known solution to this problem? I am using time-series data, so the idea of using time-lags of X to predict Y is the appeal of the Granger test. If not, I am thinking of just putting all my panel data into one model. Then the coefficients will be the same across all units, and we can Wald-test whether the coefficients of X are significantly different from 0 as normal. Does this idea make sense?
