Approach for Question Answer from thousand of text documents

Recently I was working on natural language processing project, where task was to fetch the top-K paragraphs from thousands of text pages against user Queries. I decided to go with following approach: Vectorize each paragraph of thousands of text pages. Store vectorized paragraphs in a Vector store. Vectorize user query Fetch top-k paragraphs based on cosine similarity against step-3 query vector. is this approach ok, not ok, good, excellent? Please let me know your views on this approach.
