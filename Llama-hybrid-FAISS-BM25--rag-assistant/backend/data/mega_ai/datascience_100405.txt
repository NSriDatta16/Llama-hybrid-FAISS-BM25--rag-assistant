The best way to improve is doing error analysis, which means going through the errors the model makes in validation trials and seeing how we can improve, either by adding terms interactions, polynomials (to model nonlinear relationships), or simply using other models your data might be non-linear too. Also, try doing more feature engineering, cleaning, and preprocessing to best optimize model performance.
