It sounds like you want to use one-way, cryptographic hashing rather than two-way encryption. Here is a good example of best-practice password storage and validation: To save it: $userPasswordInput = $_POST['password']; $salt = // ideally, generate one randomly and save it to the db, otherwise, use a constant saved to the php file $password = sha1($userPasswordInput . $salt); Save $password (and preferably $salt) to the db. When comparing, concatenate the salt and the user input, sha1 it (or whichever encryption), then compare it to the saved (encrypted + salted) password.
