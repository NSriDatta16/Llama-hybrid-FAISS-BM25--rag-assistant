How to open a project page in silverlight 4?

There are two pages in my silverlight project: MainPage-default page and SecondViewPage an added Silverlight page. To navigate from one to another, I've overridden the Application_Startup(...) { this.RootVisual = mainUI; mainUI.Children.Add(new MainPage()); } created a public static void GotoPage(UserControl nextPage) { App app = (App)Application.Current; app.mainUI.Children.Clear(); //show next page app.mainUI.Children.Add(nextPage); } Then openning the SecondViewPage is simple like: App.GotoPage(new SecondViewPage()); But what I realy want is to open the second view page in a separage browser window because the removing childer and adding new makes navigation totally outside of the browser (the "back" button is not keeping the prvious page link). Thanks for suggestions. V
