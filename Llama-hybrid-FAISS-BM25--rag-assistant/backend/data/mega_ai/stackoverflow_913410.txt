This answer is probably overkill for this application, but I like using tcpdump / libpcap , winpcap , and raw sockets for generating traffic. You not only have great control over the volume going to and from your application, you learn a lot about what you can expect firewall/traffic filter settings to do for you and what kinds of traffic is being blocked that you didn't expect (or that you don't want blocked).
