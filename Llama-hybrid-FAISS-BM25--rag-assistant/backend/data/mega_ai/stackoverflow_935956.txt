jquery changing innerhtml of a P isn't working

I have what I thought was a simple select with jQuery to change some text on a paragraph. It works perfect the traditional way i.e. document.getElementById('message_text').innerHTML = "hello"; But with jQuery it doesn't. I have checked the values of $('#message_text') and sure enough I see the items. $('#message_text').innerHTML = "hello"; Am I doing something wrong? Anyone have any ideas?
