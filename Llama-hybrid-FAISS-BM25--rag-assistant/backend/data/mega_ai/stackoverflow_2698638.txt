Well, you may want to ask yourself why your code organization scheme leads to that setup, and whether it causes maintenance or understandability problems, but I don't think it's strictly "bad". Now if your tags are actually fetching separate files from the server, then it's a good idea to cut back on them. The browser parses and interprets script tags in such a way that other work stops, so blocks of Javascript up at the top of your page can slow things down if they do a lot of work. That's true whether you've got a big block of code or several smaller blocks, however. An advantage of moving to separate script files is that you can re-use code on multiple pages. When you do that, it may be easier at build time to compress your scripts with YUICompressor or some other similar tool.
