How are neural nets combined to form intelligent systems?

Self-driving cars, arms that can learn ow to pick up objects, machines that can have conversations, etc. I understand how neural nets work. But I really don't know much about how neural nets are combined to form intelligent systems. Is it all rule-based above a few base nets for tasks like e.g. image recognition? Or are there meta-nets that do deep learning on the outputs from base nets? Things to read/references would be super-helpful!
