You might want to look at Transforming data as it is very relevant to your problem and also https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/249005/what-are-the-assumptions-for-the-residuals-of-arima-model/249106#249106 . The fundamental problem is your identified model is flawed for a number of possible reasons as it incorrectly converts statistical symptoms to incorrect (in this case) statistical cures. The data is nonstationary (that is a symptom) , the cause is a shift in the mean (correct cure) at period 21 which is visually obvious from here whereas your model decided to unfortunately apply regular differencing (wrong cure) . There is no need for logs or any other power transform when you adjust for the clear anomalies. Box-Cox transform determination easily misreads untreated positive outliers (high values) as causing high variance (symptom) whereas once they are adjusted (correct cure) no evidence is found suggesting the need for a power transform. Following is the ACF of the original series showing no significant seasonal structure whereas your model had a seasonal difference. Intervention Detection procedures suggested a day 5 effect which might have been the reason for the unwarranted seasonal differencing in your model. The plot of the Actual/Fit and Forecast from the model suggested by AUTOBOX (which I have helped to develop) visually tells an interesting story. . Since values can never go below zero for your data simply truncate the lower confidence interval estimate to 0.0. The ACF of the original series is here and ACF of the model's residuals are here with residual plot here . The equation is here notice that the level shift variable was not the dominant player as it was obfuscated by the anomalies (just as my eyes were) . The details of the model are here in 3 parts . . Finally we show the plot of the forecasts . It is interesting to see the actual and the cleansed data together as it shows what might have been Hope this helps you and others to better understand time series methodology and practice.
