There is no tool for this AFAIK, and I'd be surprised if there were. Document management and version control are just conceptually really different. Document management focuses on the storage of content (files) along with its meta-data. It doesn't care much about what's inside those files. And with version control systems it's all about this. I guess you could write a program that uses DFC/DFS to fetch the whole version tree of a document and check it into Subversion, oldest version first. I don't know where you would store your Documentum meta-data though. Also, I wouldn't know what to do if the Documentum document has a branched version tree.
