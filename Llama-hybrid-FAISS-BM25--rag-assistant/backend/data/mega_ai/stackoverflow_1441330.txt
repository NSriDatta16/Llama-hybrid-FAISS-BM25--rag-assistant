I can only offer you a pointer. Years ago, I used a Bayesian spam filter with Outlook. It was written in Python, and provided an Outlook plug-in that would filter incoming mail. The name of the software was SpamBayes , and the project is still online. As it is open source, you will probably find all necessary information how to plug a mail filter into Outlook. This should give you enough background to add code that will actually be able to transform mail content. My understanding was it was written in vanilla Python (CPython), but if you are more comfortable with IronPython, it shouldn't be hard to translate. Give it a go.
