I think you misunderstand the storage classes and one of them is the external. " Objects and variables declared as extern declare an object that is defined in another translation unit or in an enclosing scope as having external linkage." So marking extern is for variables not classes defination/declaration So if you can not include the .h, I recommend you to build the .h and .cpp to be static lib or dll and use in your code
