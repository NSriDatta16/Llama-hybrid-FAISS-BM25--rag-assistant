For selecting parameters (such as the C parameter) I have no great advice. I have found I just need to try different values and using bootstrap or cross-validation to select the best ones. One useful nugget I picked up along the way though is the concept of calibrating the predictions from the SVM output for regression. If for example you are trying to find the probability of a binary outcome occurring (Bernoulli trial) using SVM, then the quantity returned from the algorithm will not be the probability, but will be monotonically related to it. In order to calibrate the response, you can use e.g. logistic regression $p = \frac{1}{1+e^{(-g(f))}}$ where $g(f)$ is some function of the SVM predictions $f$. I've found that a simple linear function $g(f) = a + bf$ usually does the job.
