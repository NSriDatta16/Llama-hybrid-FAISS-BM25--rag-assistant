Using original centroid as cluster identifier after applying PCA

Take a look at my original data. (masked with purely random alphabetic here) : a b c d e f g h i j A = k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y I'm running kMeans (3 cluster) on the data, resulting final centroid like this : aa aa aa aa aa B = bb bb bb bb bb cc cc cc cc cc Now, before run kMean again, I applied PCA on data and took only first three principal component : xa yb zc xd ye zf C = xg yh zi xj yk zl xm yn zo After that, I ran kMeans for 3 centroid and, of course, resulting 3 centroid : xaa yaa zcc D = xbb ybb zbb xcc ycc zcc The cluster result with PCA are exactly same with the first test (without PCA). My question : After finishing kMeans with PCA, can I say that this cluster (say cluster 1) has centroid aa aa aa aa aa, rather than saying that cluster 1 has centroid xaa yaa zcc?
