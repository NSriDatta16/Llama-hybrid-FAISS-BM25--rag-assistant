'www' CNAME is not resolving properly, root A records working fine though (for Heroku)

I'm having trouble using WHM/Cpanel to set up CNAME records for my heroku app. I've set up the records as follows - see link to image . dapcards.com is resolving to the heroku app with no problems. However, www.dapcards.com fails: > host dapcards.com dapcards.com has address 75.101.145.87 dapcards.com has address 75.101.163.44 dapcards.com has address 174.129.212.2 dapcards.com mail is handled by 0 dapcards.com. > host www.dapcards.com Host www.dapcards.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN) Host www.dapcards.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN) When I use the dnsstuff.com tool, it seems to get to proxy.heroku.com fine, but produces an error: [BOGUS ANSWER: This server is not authoritative for proxy.heroku.com.: it refers back to the root servers] http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/legacy/?formaction=DNSLOOKUP&ToolFormName=customlookup&name=www.dapcards.com&r=235660&detail=0&type=CNAME I'm obviously missing something here. Has anyone got any ideas? Would really appreciate some advice! Cheers, Rob
