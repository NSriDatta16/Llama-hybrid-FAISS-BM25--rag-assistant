Yes, that's generally how you do it - make arrays of your objects. Or some other kind of collections, depending on your language and/or framework. When creating a new object, you first create it in a temporary variable, and then insert it into your collection. Sometimes, when you have a LOT of objects, you don't load them all at once from your persisted storage (like a DB or a file). You just load the one (or few) that you need to work with. If you load just one, it might get a special variable. Several will get a collection again.
