Thanks Mirko, I had the exact same problem but reached via a different implementation. Here are the facts: The problem was the same on the simulator and on a physical device. The wrong user agent is a red herring. Before displaying the dialog (either directly via FBLoginDialog or using the FBLoginButton), you must have established your session (either via "[[FBSession sessionForApplication:kApiKey secret:kApiSecret delegate:self] retain];" or the proxy method). Or calling [session resume] on an already existing session. The state of the session object before displaying the dialog has no effect. As long as I have called the above methods to establish my session, I can do "session = nil" or "[session logout]", and I still get the correct dialog. If I do not establish my session first, I get the wrong full homepage effect.
