Applying PCA on only the continuous variables is the simples approach if you have mixed data. If you do not care about a seperate set of categorical variables that this is the approach for you. However, there are a few cases when this approach is not sufficient: The majority of the dataset is categorical and only reducing the dimension of the continuous variables is not enough. You want to have an similar scale for all of the variables, including the categorical ones. Subsequent steps require continuous data and you want to use dimension reduction to achieve this The categorical variables contain a lot of duplicate information, excluding them from the dimension reduction might hurt modelling performance.
