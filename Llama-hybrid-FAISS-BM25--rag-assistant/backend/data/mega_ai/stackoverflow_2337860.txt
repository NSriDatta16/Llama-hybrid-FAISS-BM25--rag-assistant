As long as is turned off, you should be able to allow objects. You might even be able to to define the actual acceptable parameters of object tags, so that you only allow a whitelist, and abitrary objects cannot be included. However, it may be better to provide some UI support for embedding. For example, I prompt the user for a YouTube URL and then derive the embed code for the video from that. Several benefits: - the default YouTube code is not standards compliant so I can construct my own Object code - I have complete control over the way embedded elements are included in the output page
