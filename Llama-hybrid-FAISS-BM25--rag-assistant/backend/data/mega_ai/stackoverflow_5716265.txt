This seems to be discusses in the FOP FAQ : This exception is usually a follow-up error after another exception. Sometimes the original exception gets swallowed by Xalan's default ErrorListener (should be fixed in the latest Xalan release). The work-around is to set an explicit ErrorListener on the Transformer . More details can be found in the link above.
