I tried to make an elbow plot to see the optimal number of changes, but somehow it does not work. The following code works for me: mcpt plot(mcpt,diagnostic=T) I would then say that there were 3 changepoints based on this graph and a plot of the original time series. plot(mcpt,ncpts=3) You can then debate whether the final changepoint is "relevant" to the application at hand or not. The inflated penalty is required because there is dependence in the data. The core assumption of the default "Normal" cost function for cpt.meanvar() is that the data are independent.
