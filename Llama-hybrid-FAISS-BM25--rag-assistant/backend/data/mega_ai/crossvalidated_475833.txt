How can I shift the average probability keeping constraint (0.0:1.0)?

I have a large datasets of values that range from 0 to n. I am interpreting the values as probabilities for a later pseudo-random selection process. To make the values serve as probabilities, I normalize the entire dataset to the range (0.0:1.0) by dividing every number by n. Values are essentially random, and could be like {0.0156, 0.259, 0.0844, 0.904, ...} After this, the dataset mean is not what I need it to be. (The end user will be specifying the desired mean). I need to transform (or dilate) all values so that the mean of the transformed dataset equals the desired mean, but the range constraint is unchanged. How can I do this? Note, my question here is similar to How to simulate data that satisfy specific constraints such as having specific mean and standard deviation? , but the answers to that question do not constrain the range. Edit I have come up with a brute force iterative guessing approach to get the transformed mean to be within a tolerance of the target mean, but it will be slow. So now my question really is: Is there a closed form solution to get this exact?
