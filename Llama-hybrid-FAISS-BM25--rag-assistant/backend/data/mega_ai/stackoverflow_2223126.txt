Checking MySQL Logs for Possibility of Performance Issues/DOS attack

We write a most of our websites in PHP and use MySQL database connections routinely. We are currently encountering a major performance issue on our dedicated server. When accessing our server it loads webpages very slowly and SSH'ing into the machine takes forever. We have restarted it a few times and after a few minutes that problem appears again. Our web host (MidPhase) says that it could be related to a DOS attack and that they are going to place our dedicated server on CiscoGuard for 24hrs and check our server logs to verify if that is the case. I'm concerned that we may have some poorly coded PHP scripts that are being exploited. How would one check server wide for problems that could be caused by possibly PHP/MySQL injection exploits? Thank you, Tegan
