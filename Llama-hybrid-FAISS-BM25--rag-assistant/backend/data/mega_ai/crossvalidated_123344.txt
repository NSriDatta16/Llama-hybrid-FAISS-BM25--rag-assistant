I'd model the total number of calls over a survey duration as a Poisson GLM with an offset. What is an offset? Let $y_i$ be the observed number of calls and $\lambda_i$ be the expected number of calls, and $t_i$ be the duration (in minutes) of the $i$th survey. Let $X$ be a matrix of regressors and $\beta$ be the associated vector of regression coefficients. A model which does not include duration would look like this: \begin{aligned} y_i \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i) \\ \log(\lambda_i) = x_i^T\beta \end{aligned} The above equation expresses the total calling rate as a function of covariates. However, if the survey duration differs among samples, this model will be incorrect. Instead, we'd want: \begin{aligned} y_i \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i/t_i) \\ \log(\lambda_i/t_i) = x_i^T\beta \end{aligned} Which would instead model the per-minute calling rate as a function of covariates (essentially standardizing the expected number of calls by the amount of sampling effort). Rearranging: \begin{aligned} \log(\lambda_i/t_i) = \log(\lambda_i) - \log(t_i) = x_i^T\beta \\ \Rightarrow \log(\lambda_i) = x_i^T\beta + \log(t_i) \end{aligned} $\log(t_i)$ is referred to as an 'offset' or as 'exposure'. The offset won't really matter for inference if every survey has the same duration, but I'll consider an example where this isn't the case, to provide a more general answer. Using your sample size, let's say there is an average calling rate of 6 calls per minute in the control and 4 calls per minute in the experimental units. Further, let's pretend that surveys are split among seven sites. As an example environmental covariate, we'll also suppose that vegetation cover influences calling rate such that a 1% increase in vegetation cover causes a multiplicative increase of 0.001 in calling rate per minute. Some R code to provide an example: ## simulated data set.seed(101) treatment The function offset() forces the regression coefficient to 1. You may also want to consider overdispersion (I typically include overdispersion as a matter of course). One way to do so is to include an individual-level random effect (essentially, a multiplicative residual) in the call to glmer() : id The variance for the individual-level random effect is small in this example because we do not include overdispersion in the simulated response. However, it is very very often the case that actual count data will be overdispersed--in other words, there will be additional variation in the response which is attributable to unobserved factors (ie. in your case, unmeasured factors may include additional environmental variables, biotic factors, population density, observer effects, etc.)
