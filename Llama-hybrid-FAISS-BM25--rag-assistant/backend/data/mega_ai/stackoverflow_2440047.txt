Symbol info in .app file

i've recently released an app to the App store, i went to have a look at some crash logs in Organiser of my app downloaded from the app store and noticed that there is symbol info in my crash log - Shock Horror I definitely remember setting some strip symbols flags when i built the distribution build (which was copied from release) so can't for the life of me work out how there is this symbol info there. I never shipped a .SYM file to apple just the .app. So whats going on. Surely apple would have warned me about this wouldn't they??
