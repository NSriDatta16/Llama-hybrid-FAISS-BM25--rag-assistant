If you want access to the URL parameters as a string you can use this: $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] But, I'm not sure how that would be any more useful than $_GET . You said: I wont be sure of the variable names You can iterate through the $_GET array with a foreach loop: foreach ($_GET as $key => $val) { echo $key . ": " . $val; } However... if you're talking about an arbitrary URL (not necessarily the one which was requested), then the above methods won't work since they obviously won't be in $_GET . Instead you can use parse_url $url = 'http://username:password@hostname/path?arg=value#anchor'; print_r(parse_url($url)); echo parse_url($url, PHP_URL_QUERY); Output: Array ( [scheme] => http [host] => hostname [user] => username [pass] => password [path] => /path [query] => arg=value [fragment] => anchor ) arg=value
