But what I'm looking for are some practical suggestions that will make the effort of learning Assembly to be worth it. Learn what assembly is. Really learn how to read (and understand) small fragments of it: how to walk/step through it in your mind. Perhaps too, step through some of it with a debugger (including seeing memory and registers being changed). Ideally, find some annotated assembly. But, don't bother to learn how to write assembly: instead, learning to write C or C++ is probably 'low' enough for most practical purposes.
