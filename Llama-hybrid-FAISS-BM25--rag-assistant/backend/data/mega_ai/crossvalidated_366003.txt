Consequences of adding transformed features columns for random forests and lasso?

When adjusting a Random Forest or LASSO model to some data, let's say y ~ x1 + x2 , do I lose anything by considering transformation of the features to my model? For example: y ~ x1 + x2 + log(x1) + log(x2) + sqrt(x1^2 - x2^2) + x1^2 . While it adds computational costs, I feel like it's saying: "I'm not sure the relation between the response and this feature is linear, so let the model choose whether it's linear, or logarithm, or polynomial, etc. I can see positive points of including the transformed features, but are there negative consequences other than computational costs?
