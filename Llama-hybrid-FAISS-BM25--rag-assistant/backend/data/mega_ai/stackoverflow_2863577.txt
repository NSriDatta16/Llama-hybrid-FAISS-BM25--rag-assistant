There are two major Python packages for automating web interactions: Mechanize Twill Twill has apparently not been updated for a couple years and seems to have been at version 0.9 since Dec. 2007. Mechanize shows changelog and releases from just a few days ago: 2010-05-16 with the release of version 0.2.1. Of course you'll find examples listed in their respective web pages. Twill essentially provides a simple shell like interpreter while Mechanize provides a class and API in which you set form values using Python dictionary-like ( __setattr__() method) statements, for example. Both use BeautifulSoup for parsing "real world" (sloppy tag soup) HTML. (This is highly recommended for dealing with HTML that you encounter in the wild, and strongly discouraged for your own HTML which should be written to pass standards conforming, validating, parsers).
