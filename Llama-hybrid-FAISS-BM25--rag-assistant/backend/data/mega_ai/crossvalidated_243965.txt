I can recommend the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. It is available at http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ It covers all aspects of ANNs and also the fairly new techniques. Here's the table of contents: Part I: Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics Linear Algebra Probability and Information Theory Numerical Computation Machine Learning Basics Part II: Modern Practical Deep Networks Deep Feedforward Networks Regularization for Deep Learning Optimization for Training Deep Models Convolutional Networks Sequence Modeling: Recurrent and Recursive Nets Practical Methodology Applications Part III: Deep Learning Research Linear Factor Models Autoencoders Representation Learning Structured Probabilistic Models for Deep Learning Monte Carlo Methods Confronting the Partition Function Approximate Inference Deep Generative Models
