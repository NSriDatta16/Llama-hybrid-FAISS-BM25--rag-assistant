I'd recommend that you calculate and plot a moving average , also known as a running mean. You will need to supply a bandwidth parameter (i.e., how many adjacent data points to average over), which you should pick based on what works best in your data set - for your sample data, it seems like $k=5$ or $k=9$ works well. In R: library(caTools) # for runmean() foo You can easily implement a moving average in MS Excel. Alternatively, you could use any other smoother. For instance, here is a loess smoother : plot(foo,type="o",pch=19,ylab="") lines(lowess(foo),col="blue",lwd=2)
