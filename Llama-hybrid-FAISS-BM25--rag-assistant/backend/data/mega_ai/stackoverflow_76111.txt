The idea of exception is elegant and makes the error handling process so smooth. but this only applies when you have appropriate exception classes and in team development, one more important thing is "standard" exceptions. so if you plan to use exceptions, you'd better first standardize your exception types, or the better choice is to use exceptions from some popular framework. one other thing that applies to PHP (where you can write your code object orienter combined with structural code), is that if you are writing your whole application using classes. If you are writing object oriented, then exceptions are better for sure. after all I think your error handling process will be much smoother with exception than trigger_error and stuff.
