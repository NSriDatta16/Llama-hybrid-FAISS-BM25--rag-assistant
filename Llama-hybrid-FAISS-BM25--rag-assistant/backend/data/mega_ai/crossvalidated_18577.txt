Computational intelligence-based methods for time series forecasting?

I know that ARIMA is one approach widely used in forecasting of univariate time series. What are some computational intelligence based methods that are reported to be successfully used in the same area? If possible, please recommend some articles/reports presenting such approaches. Thanks in advance.
