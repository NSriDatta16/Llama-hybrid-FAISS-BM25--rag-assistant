I don't know much about Air, But Silverlight has IsolatedStorage for saving data on client-end and it has its own constrains. But if you want to have an application that can access local database why don't you try WPF(XBAP)? This link can be helpful regarding SQLLite and Silverlight using IsolatedStorage. http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/118411/267135.aspx Regards.
