I get "undefined variable" PHP notice

I'm curious as to why I'm getting an error on something I've done a million times before but am all of a sudden on a certain script getting an error 'Undefined variable: row' Yet row seems defined to me... $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE id="1" LIMIT 1 '; $res = mysql_query($sql); if(mysql_num_rows($res) != FALSE) { $row = mysql_fetch_array($res); } The above is pseudo sql... but I've checked that sql statement and I know its bringing out a result. I also know that $row is storing the data because if I go echo $row[0]; I get the right data. So to my knowledge, the $row variable is defined. Yet still - an error. Am I losing my mind or what am I missing here? Shouldn't this error/notice only occur if $row didn't exist? edit Sorry guys its all happening INSIDE the if statement: $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE uID="' . $ID . '" LIMIT 1 '; $res = mysql_query($sql); if(mysql_num_rows($res) != FALSE) { $row = mysql_fetch_array($res); $firstName = $row[0]; $lastName = $row[1]; $email = $row[2]; } edit 2 if i do a print_r($row) I get the following: Array ( [0] => Robert [firstName] => Robert [1] => Nibbles [lastName] => Nibbles [2] => robert@nibbles.com [email] => robert@nibbles.com ) Undefined variable: row
