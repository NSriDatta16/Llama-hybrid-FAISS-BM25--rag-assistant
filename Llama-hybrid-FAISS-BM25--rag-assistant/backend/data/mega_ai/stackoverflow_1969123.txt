IMO cookie is one of the best choice for some situations. For instance, storing the user's selected language. Also you can cache some sensitive information in the cookie as users' roles as ASP.NET Roles manager. But you should encrypt it without doubt and also you should set HttpCookie.HttpOnly = true to prevent javascript from accessing to cookie. Don't worry about supporting cookie in different browsers, size is premier (Browsers support only 4096bytes per cookie). Cookie is bandwidth killer, cause sends and receives within each request and response. Thus, you should use it in avarage. You can check if the client browser supports cookie as follows. if (Request.Browser.Cookies) { // The browser supports cookie } To learn more information about cookies, visit here .
