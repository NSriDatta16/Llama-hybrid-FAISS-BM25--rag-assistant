CDN for pixel tracking?

I use a CDN to deliver static files, but I'm wondering if it's possible to use one for pixel tracking. What I'm looking for is a normal CDN, except it has access logs with full HTTP headers. I'm guessing the storage costs, etc. would make this infeasible, but maybe there is something I'm not familiar with.
