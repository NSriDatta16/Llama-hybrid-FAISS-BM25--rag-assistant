To start with check out http://www.nltk.org/ if you plan working with python although as far as I know the code isn't "industrial strength" but it will get you started. Check out section 7.5 from http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch07.html but to understand the algorithms you probably will have to read through a lot of the book. Also check this out http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml . It's done with java, NER isn't an easy subject and probably nobody will tell you "this is the best algorithm", most of them have their pro/cons. My 0.05 of a dollar. Cheers,
