The older I get, the less code I write before running/testing. In part, that's a consequence of technical advances: I started out writing code on COBOL coding sheets to be transformed into punched cards twice a week when the punch girl came in. I generally wouldn't even attempt a compile of a new program until it was largely complete and desk-checked, which was usually a couple of thousand lines and a few weeks. These days, when I'm on my game, I don't write any code before testing, I write a test before coding. I'm weak and not always sure how to write the test, though, so sometimes I tell myself I'm being pragmatic by just doing it. It's surprising how often that turns out to have been a bad idea, though: code that I wrote as a consequence of TDD tends to be easier to test, easier to modify and mostly just better than code that got tests later. But that's just me, YMMV.
