Well, the Inkscape website says it can import PostScript. take that with a grain of salt, though- I haven't tried it myself. Alternately, if you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, PostScript is a fairly human-readable stack based programming language- I highly recommend A First Guide To PostScript . If you can figure out what chunk of the documents contains the plot you want, you ought to be able to copy and paste those together. This all depends heavily upon the quality and organization of code generated by GMT. Your best bet is probably a vector graphics application like Inkscape (above) or Adobe Illustrator.
