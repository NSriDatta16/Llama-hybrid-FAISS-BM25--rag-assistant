Categorization is always highly subjective. If you wish to use mainstream appproaches, try Wordnet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/). It's used by most workers in Natural Language Processing. Here's an example dog, domestic dog, Canis familiaris => canine, canid => carnivore => placental, placental mammal, eutherian, eutherian mammal => mammal => vertebrate, craniate => chordate => animal, animate being, beast, brute, creature, fauna Here's what you get for "joke" # S: (n) joke, gag, laugh, jest, jape (a humorous anecdote or remark intended to provoke laughter) "he told a very funny joke"; "he knows a million gags"; "thanks for the laugh"; "he laughed unpleasantly at his own jest"; "even a schoolboy's jape is supposed to have some ascertainable point" * direct hyponym / full hyponym * part meronym * direct hypernym / inherited hypernym / sister term o S: (n) wit, humor, humour, witticism, wittiness (a message whose ingenuity or verbal skill or incongruity has the power to evoke laughter) Note that "hypernym" is a broader term and can be used as a category. For people you can try Wikipedia and scrape the infobox (not much fun - I have spent a lot of time doing it). Better to try DBPedia. Here is the Wikipedia infobox for Jay Leno: JayLenoJul08.jpg Leno in July 2008 Birth name James Douglas Muir Leno Born April 28, 1950 (1950-04-28) (age 60)[1] New Rochelle, New York, U.S.[1] Medium Television Nationality American Years active 1973–present Genres Observational comedy Subject(s) Everyday life, American culture Influences Johnny Carson, Robert Klein, Alan King, George Carlin, Don Rickles, Bob Newhart, Rodney Dangerfield Influenced Dennis Miller[2] Spouse Mavis Leno (1980–present) Notable works and roles The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (host, 1992–2009) The Jay Leno Show (host, 2009–2010) The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (host, 2010– ) Signature Jay Leno Autograph.svg Website The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Emmy Awards Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series 1995 The Tonight Show with Jay Leno I don't know whether that has been captured for DBPedia. If so you will get some good categorization
