By the explanation the missing data is not completely random and independent of the process, therefore they can add information to the model. You can apply some transformations to the data to identify the missing values as a numeric value, using either the average value of the variable or, for example, $-1$ for positive variables. You can also create an additional variable that counts how many missing values exist for each sample or just a flag indicating the existence or not of missing values. Nonlinear models tend to deal well with the empty information encoded in a label, but some linear models can behave poorly, this will depend on analysis of the technique used.
