GBM is an inherently sequential algorithm. Each iteration depends on the results of the previous iteration. Contrast this with Random Forest where the algorithm is embarrassingly parallel -- every tree is independent of each other. This allows RF to be parallelized in ways GBM cannot. The combine function you are using is from the randomForest package and it is crafted to specifically work on randomForest objects, as the error message says. In summary you are trying to parallelize an inherently sequential algorithm and then combine the results using a function meant to concatenate independent randomForests. If you're looking for performance gains for GBM models, check out the xgboost package. Parts of GBM can be parallel, such as the construction of the decision trees. This is the approach xgboost takes.
