How to extract confidence interval from mgcv GAM model?

I have a basic GAM model setup, with one predictor: fit I noticed I can easily pull out the fitted values with the fit$fitted.values accessor. The documentation says the confidence intervals are computed in a bayesian manner, but I wasn't able to find them in the returned object. It seems to somehow be related to fit$hat. I could feed the model back into predict but that just produces another regression model, does it not? I'd like to use the confidence bans from the mgcv package GAM model itself.
