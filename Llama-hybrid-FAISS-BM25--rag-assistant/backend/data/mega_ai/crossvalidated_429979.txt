Model evaluation for feature selection

I have a dataset of gene expression data and I'm trying to find genes related to particular diseases. My labels are dichotomous (sick - not sick) and I used a Logistic regression with LASSO regularization in order to extract meaningful features (basically taking all the genes with coefficient different from zero). Hyperparameter lambda has been found using leave-one-out cross-validation . In order to find my coefficient should I train a new model using my best lambda on all the data? I think there are some drawbacks in my approach but since I'm relatively new to feature reduction I cannot formulate a query on google that tells me if or where I am wrong. Can you help me?
