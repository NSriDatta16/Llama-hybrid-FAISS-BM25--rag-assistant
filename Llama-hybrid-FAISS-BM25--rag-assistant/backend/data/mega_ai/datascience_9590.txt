What tool to find expected and hidden patterns in data?

I have no background AT ALL in data science/stats/mathematics. However, I've always been interested in what data shows. I have a huge dataset right now - daily attendance figures for a factory of ~300 for the past 10 years. I'm interested in finding out answers to questions like is there a pattern of leaves correlated with public holidays? For example, around which holiday (+/- 2 days) are workers most likely to take a leave? This is an expected pattern. Or, was there a significant increase (+10%) in on-time reporting after bonuses were issued. Maybe there are hidden patterns which an algorithm can find. Is there a tool I can plug this data in which can help me find these patterns? Google tells me there's a tool http://www.i-programmer.info/news/84-database/3501-mine-finding-patterns-in-big-data.html but I'm not sure if this is the right direction for me. I'd appreciate any advice!
