Listbox events firing strangely

I'm confused. I am basically trying to tell when the user has clicked something in the listbox, held the button, and left the listbox. Here is a somewhat dumbed down version of what I am doing: private bool itemHeld; private void listOriginal_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { itemHeld = true; } private void listOriginal_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { itemHeld = false; } private void listOriginal_MouseLeave(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (itemHeld) MessageBox.Show("OHH YEAH"); } To me that seems like it should turn itemHeld true when you press the mousebutton, turn it false only if you lift it, and display ohh yeah if the value is true. If I break on the mouse down event to check the value, it is true and if I continue from there it displays the message. If I do not break, it does nothing. Is there something else at work here? Edit: Brief description: It would be difficult to explain what I am really trying to accomplish but imagine something almost like dragging a file off of a window. I need to simply be able to recognize when the user clicks inside of the listbox and then drags out of the listbox if that makes sense
