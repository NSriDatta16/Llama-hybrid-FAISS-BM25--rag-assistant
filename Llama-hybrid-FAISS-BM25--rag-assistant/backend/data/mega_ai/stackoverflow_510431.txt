You say you're receiving "Callbacks" - you've not made clear what they are. What is the protocol? Is it over a network. If it were HTTP, then I would say the best way is that if your application is unable to write the data into permanent storage, it should return an error ("Try again later" if that exists in the protocol) to the caller, who should try again later. An asynchronous process like a callback should always be able to cope with failures downstream and queue its requests. I've worked with a payment provider where this has been the case (Paypal). If you're unable to completely process the request, just send an error back to the caller.
