REST API unauthenticated requests exception based on the User-Agent

I am developing a REST API that supports two kinds of authentication protocols: login form authentication - for browser based clients. Simple Basic authentication - for non-browser clients. I developed a flow in which unauthenticated requests redirected to the "login form", the problem is that this is an undesired behavior for non-borwser clients! I thought to solve it by decide according to the "User-Agent" what to do: browsers will be redirected to the "login form" and non-browser clients will get the standard 401:Basic Authentication. A. What do you think about this solution? B. Is there a standard way in Java to check if the request came from browser, or do i need to develop this kind of mechanism by my own? Thanks in advance!
