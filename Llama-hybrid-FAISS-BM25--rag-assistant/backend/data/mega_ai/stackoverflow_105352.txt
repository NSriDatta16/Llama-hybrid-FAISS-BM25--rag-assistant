I'm using maven in anger at work. It's a harsh mistress. It makes things easy as long as you're doing things many other people have and, this is important, as long as you're doing them the way maven thinks you should be doing them. Step off that narrow path and it will fight you every step of the way. I've been impressed by BuildR from using it on the side. It's flexable like ANT while leveraging maven's dependency system. Also, it's in incubation, so it's a little rough around the edges.
