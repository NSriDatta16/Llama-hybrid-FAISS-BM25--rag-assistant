Can I use a violin plot to visualize logistic regression results (predicted probabilities)?

I have a simple study in which I predicted the likelihood of an outcome as a function of a two-level grouping variable. Now I'd like to display these results in a graph. Initially I was thinking of using a bar plot of the predicted probabilities with confidence intervals, but because bar plots don't show the distribution of the data points, I'm leaning towards other options, like a violin plot. However, I'm not sure if this is possible or even desirable.
