Unable to create manifest file in Xcode for iOS4 wireless distribution

I followed the steps provided in apple developer documentation for wireless distribution, as written below: In Xcode, you create an app archive using the “Build > Build and Archive” menu item. Then, in the Archived Applications source in Xcode's Organizer, select the app and click the “Share Application…” button. Then click the “Distribute for Enterprise…” button. You’ll be asked to provide information for the manifest file, which Xcode creates. See below, for information about the manifest file. When I click on “Distribute for Enterprise…” button, nothing happens. I mean, it does not ask anything. I have used an Adhoc distribution profile and have selected Device 4.0.
