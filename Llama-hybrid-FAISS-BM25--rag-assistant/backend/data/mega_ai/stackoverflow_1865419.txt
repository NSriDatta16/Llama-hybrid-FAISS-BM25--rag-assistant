You can have a look at one of these approaches to pass the user ID as context in the business layer: How To Pass Context Between Layers With ThreadLocal And EJB 3 How To Pass Context In Standard Way - Without ThreadLocal (The posts may still be relevant even if you're not using EJB. The second post make sense however only if you use Spring with JTA) I personally discourage these approach, as I perceive two problem with it: Testability: contextual data will need to be set up in the test Contract: contextual data participate in the contract to use the entity but is not clearly visible in the interface. Passing userID "all over the place" may seem like a big job, but I think it's cleaner. To set the date and user ID automatically when entity is created or update, you can use an EntityListener or lifecycle callbacks (maybe you're already doing that). Hope it helps...
