Well (and this is completely simplified) Classes (i.e. Reference Types) are stored on the heap, with a pointer to that reference type stored on that stack. Structs/Simple Types (i.e. Value Types) are stored directly on the stack. But with regards caching, the idea is that the value you are storing is stored in Application Memory full stop. The benefit would be that if you have some value that you regulary use, that's stored in the Database, then you could retrieve it once, place it in cache memory, and retrieve it directly from memory on each subsequent use, instead of having to go back to your Database (or FileSystem or other relatively slow-retrieval storage medium)
