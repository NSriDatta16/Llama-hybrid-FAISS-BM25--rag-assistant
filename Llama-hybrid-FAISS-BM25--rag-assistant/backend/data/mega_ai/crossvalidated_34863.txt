Handle leap seconds in time series data

I am trying to figure out how to handle time series data. Initially, I thought it was self-evident (for my purposes) to only allow non-overlapping data blocks. (I.e., non-overlapping, time wise.) Then it occurred to me, what about leap seconds? There could be a leap second in there, making one of the hours 3601 seconds long instead of 3600, and throw the whole thing off. How do people handle things like these? Shaving off the last second? Have a "fuzz" factor and allow a second up or down? Am I over-thinking this?
