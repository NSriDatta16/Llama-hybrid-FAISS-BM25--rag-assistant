Now for the next part i need to start to create a list of the first n squares. Any suggestions on how? Thank You for your time and advice. This is something you can be helped with. For the other part, post your algorithm. Use range to generate a list: >>> range(10) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Use list comprehension to get list of x^2 >>> [x**2 for x in range(10)] [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81] >>> A more elegant answer is provided by Novikov
