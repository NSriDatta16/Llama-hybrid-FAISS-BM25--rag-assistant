How do I fit a cumulative Gaussian distribution in R?

I am trying to fit a cumulative Gaussian distribution function to my data, but I'm not sure how to do this. From what I understand, the fitting process tries to find the mean and standard deviation of the cumulative Gaussian that makes the function best fit my data, right? So I need a way of fitting the CDF while providing initial parameters for the fitting process. My data looks like this x p 1 0.6 0.431 2 0.7 0.479 3 0.8 0.515 4 0.9 0.494 5 1 0.535 6 1.1 0.545 7 1.2 0.538 8 1.3 0.587 9 1.4 0.629 Where p is the average confidence of participants for that $x_i$ I tried using glm() but I don't fully understand glm() or its output, so I don't know if I accomplished what I wanted. fit One example of something in glm() I don't understand is the fitted values: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.4470200681 0.4672569250 0.4875787887 0.5079329624 0.5282664971 0.5485266046 0.5686610686 0.5886186480 0.6083494673 And another thing, how can I get the mean and standard deviation of my fitted function from the output of glm() ? Any help would be much appreciated, I'm very new to R and statistics.
