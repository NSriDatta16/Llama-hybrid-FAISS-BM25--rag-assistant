Not really. Are you using WMI to get system parameters, or to query processes, or to change configuration, or monitor for system events, or what? The kernel exposes a lot of information and tunable knobs via the /proc and /sys filesystems. No query language, just a organized hierarchy of directories and files. Some of these files are read-only, read-write, or write-only; some of them are poll able. Some services may have custom clients to query and update configuration on the fly -- chrony 's chronyc comes to mind, but even the very most basic init has initctl . Newer services like HAL can be introspected and manipulated over D-Bus .
