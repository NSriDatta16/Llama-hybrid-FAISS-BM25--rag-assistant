Answering your edited question. Take the simplest regression possible: $\text{Netflow} \sim\alpha + \epsilon$ Intercept only. The $\alpha$ will be your average daily netflow. Now, let's say that you want to know when will the data storage fill up? Simulate. Data storage will follow this formula: $Y_{t+1} \sim Y_t + \alpha + \epsilon_t$ You can simulate a path that your data storage will follow by sampling a bunch of $\epsilon$ (either assuming they are normal or resampling bootstrap-like from the residuals). Simulate a 1000 paths. Each of them will have a simulated day of when the storage is full. Use this distribution of days to manage the overfilling risk. You can also update this distibution daily by redoing regression and simulation as more data comes up.
