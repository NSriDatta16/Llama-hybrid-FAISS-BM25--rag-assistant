I would start with analyzing trend. For example, you may try to estimate the regression equation $Y_t = b_0 + b_1 t + b_2 X_t + e_t$ After estimating the residuals $e_t$ try to see if they are autocorrelated and if yes, you can build something like an ARMA model for the residuals. It would help if you post the time series plots of X, Y, and the scatterplot of Y against X.
