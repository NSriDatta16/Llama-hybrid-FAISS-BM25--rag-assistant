Linear regression fits a line to data: Linear regression as estimating a conditional expectation function: This is immediately useful for simple forecasting. Tell me x, and I can say something about y. For example, forecast plant growth based upon sunlight exposure. Linear regression as estimating causal effects: In some situations (eg. when variation in x is exogenously introduced by the researcher), linear regression can estimate causal effects. If sunlight exposure is randomly assigned by researchers, the regression line would estimate the causal effect of sun exposure on plant growth (i.e. the local average treatment effect). Linear, ordinary least squares regression is the starting place for all sorts of more advanced estimation techniques. Linear regression is to data analysis as salt is to cooking. You don't have to add it, but it's everywhere.
