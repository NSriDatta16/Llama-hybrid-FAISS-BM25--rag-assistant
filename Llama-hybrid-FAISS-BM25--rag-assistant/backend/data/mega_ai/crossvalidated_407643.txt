How to make sure if the residuals are normally distributed?

Hello, I have a fairly big dataset containing 11000 data points. I am doing a ANOVA for my traits. But before that I have to make sure if the residuals are normally distributed or not. So, I did a linear modelling and plotted the residuals. What is your opinion on the residuals? Can I proceed with the ANOVA? I cannot perform the shapiro test as I have more than 5000 data points. I did a leveneTest and Anderson-Darling test of my residuals, but they are all highly significant. Moreover, I also did a lot of transformation like Box-Cox, log, square and cube root. In each cases the p-value is highly significant for residuals. Can you please suggest something? Secondly, if I use a transformed data for ANOVA, do I need to use that transformed data for subsequent analyses like correlation, PCA etc.? or can I use non-transformed value for those analyses? I have some outliers which I must not delete. Please help. Regards Anik
