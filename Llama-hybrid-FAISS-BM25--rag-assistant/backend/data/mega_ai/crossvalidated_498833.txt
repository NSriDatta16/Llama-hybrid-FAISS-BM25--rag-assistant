In full Bayesian inference, you go from a prior distribution over parameter values, $P(\theta)$ to a posterior distribution given the data $P(\theta | x)$ . With Expectation Maximisation, you go from a prior distribution to an estimate $\hat \theta$ of the most likely posterior value of $\theta$ given the data and the priors (the Maximum a Posteriori or MAP value). Since this is a point estimate, and not a full posterior distribution, it's not a fully Bayesian method.
