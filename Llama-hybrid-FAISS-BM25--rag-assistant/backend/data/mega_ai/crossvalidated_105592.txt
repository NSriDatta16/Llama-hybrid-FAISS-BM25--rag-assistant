Not normalizing data before PCA gives better explained variance ratio

I normalized my dataset then ran 3 component PCA to get small explained variance ratios ([0.50, 0.1, 0.05]). When I didn't normalize but whitened my dataset then ran 3 component PCA, I got high explained variance ratios ([0.86, 0.06,0.01]). Since I want to retain as much data into 3 components, should I NOT normalize the data? From my understanding we should always normalize before PCA. By normalizing: setting mean to 0 and having unit variance.
