Probably not the most beautiful procedure, but this works: cmds = ''' paste your commands, followed by ''' : a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 ''' Then exec(cmds) will execute them. Or more directly, exec(''' then paste your commands, followed by ''') : a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 ''') It's just a trick, maybe there's a more official, elegant way.
