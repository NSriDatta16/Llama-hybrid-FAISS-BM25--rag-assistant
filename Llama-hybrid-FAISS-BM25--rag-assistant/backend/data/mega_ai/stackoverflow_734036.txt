No I do not. I don't feel like it adds anything to the readability or maintainability of my code base and it does not distinguish the variable for me in any way. The other downside is if you encourage articles in variable names, it's just a matter of time before someone does this in your code base. var person = new Person(); var aPerson = GetSomeOtherPerson();
