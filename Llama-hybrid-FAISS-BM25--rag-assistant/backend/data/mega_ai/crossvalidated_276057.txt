Cool question! If we generalize your framework and let $n$ represent the number of items in each set, then we can make some headway toward finding the solution. In your case $n = 1000$. But what if we let $n = 1$? There are always ${2n} \choose {n}$ total arrangements so in the simplest case where $n=1$, there are just two possibilities. Both have 2 runs. Now, consider $n=2$. There are ${2n} \choose {n}$ $= 6$ arrangements and the average number of runs is exactly 3. Going further, $n=3$ leads to 20 arrangements and an average of 4 runs. At this point, it seems unlikely that the answer will ever differ from $n+1$ as the average number of runs. This can probably be proved by induction pretty easily.
