Well it's fairly straightforward to extract the contents of a div with javascript. If you're already using jquery you can simply do something like: var contents = $('#draggedDiv').html(); or for regular javascript: var contents = document.getElementById('draggedDiv').innerHTML; Is this what you mean?
