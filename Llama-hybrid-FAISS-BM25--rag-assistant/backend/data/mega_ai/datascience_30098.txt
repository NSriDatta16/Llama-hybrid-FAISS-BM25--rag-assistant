Classification Ensemble with Random Forest as base classifier

I have created a classification ensemble with random forest as a base classifier. Each random forest has 500 trees. There are total 100 such forests in the ensemble. Majority voting is being used as the voting scheme. I was expecting the classifier to perform marginally better than a single random forest. However, its performance is drastically poorer than the random forest. Can anyone explain the reason?
