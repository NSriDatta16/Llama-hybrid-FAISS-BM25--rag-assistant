We have Enterprise Architect and we have it nicely integrated with Word. We wrote our own Wicket/Jetty WebApp that publishes links to EA diragrams as an HTTP URL that we then "Insert&Link" into our UCR (or anything else) documents. The web app displays a tree like structure of links, one for each package and then we just copy the link into the word document. It works really well. We can make as many changes as we like in EA and then in the Word document just go CTRL+A to select all and hit F9 to update all links. Unfortunately I didn't write the code so I can't tell you exactly how it's published from EA. I think there's some Java code that just polls the EA server and sucks out everything if it detects changes.
