Several people have mentioned the technicalities of what makes Rails/Grails what they are. Several people have also mentioned "convention over configuration" as being the "rails" in Rails/Grails. This is getting closer to the truth. But this is just one characteristic of the broader philisophy of Rails, which is the concept of opinionated software . Opinionated software can't be described in only technical terms; it's a philosophy; an ethos; an attitude . Like it or hate it , that is what's at the heart of Rails. Here's an exceprt from a 2005 interview with David Heinemeier Hansson , creator of Rails: Rails is opinionated software. It eschews placing the old ideals of software in a primary position. One of those ideals is flexibilityâ€”the notion that we should try to accommodate as many approaches as possible, that we shouldn't pass judgement on one form of development over another. Well, Rails does, and I believe that's why it works. With Rails, you trade flexibility at the infrastructure level to gain flexibility at the application level. If you are happy to work along the golden path that I've embedded in Rails, you gain an immense reward in terms of productivity that allows you to do more, sooner, and better at the application level. There is also a later interview that further explores the subject . So being 'on rails' is a metaphor for being 'opinionated', which is why it is named as it is. That and the fact that "Ruby on Rails" is alliteratve, which any journalist or writer will tell you, is a sure-fire way of hooking people's attention.
