As noted in my comment, this is a very interesting problem. Detecting seasonality is not a statistical exercise alone. A reasonable approach would be to consult theory and experts such as: Psychologist Psychiatrist Sociologist on this problem to understand "why" there would be seasonality to supplement data analysis. Coming to the data, I used an excellent decomposition method called unobserved components model (UCM) which is a form of state space method. See also this very accessible article by Koopman. My approach is similar to @Javlacalle. It not only provides a tool to decompose time series data but also objectively assesses the presence or absence of seasonality via significance testing. I'm not a big fan of significance testing on non-experimental data but I don't know of any other procedure that you would be able to test your hypothesis on presence/absence of seasonality on a time series data. Many ignore but a very important feature that one would want to understand is the type of seasonality: Stochastic - changes randomly and tough to predict Deterministic - does not change, perfectly predictable. You could use dummy or trigonometry (sin/cos etc.,) to model For a lengthy time series data such as yours, it is possible that seasonality might have changed over time. Again UCM is the only approach that I know that can detect these stochastic/deterministic seasonality. UCM can decompose your problem into following "components": Time Series Data = level + Slope + Seasonality + Cycle + Causal + Error(Noise). You could also test if level, slope, cycle is deterministic or stochastic. Please note that level + slope = trend . Below I present some analysis on your data using UCM. I used SAS to do the analysis. data input; format date mmddyy10.; date = intnx( 'month', '1jan1995'd, _n_-1 ); input deaths@@; datalines; 62 47 55 74 71 70 67 69 61 76 68 68 64 69 68 53 72 73 62 63 64 72 55 61 71 61 64 63 60 64 67 50 48 49 59 72 67 54 72 69 78 45 59 53 48 65 64 44 69 64 65 58 73 83 70 73 58 75 71 58 60 54 67 59 54 69 62 60 58 61 68 56 67 60 54 57 51 61 67 63 55 70 54 55 65 68 65 72 79 72 64 70 59 66 63 66 69 50 59 67 73 77 64 66 71 68 59 69 68 61 66 62 69 84 73 62 71 64 59 70 67 53 76 65 77 68 65 60 68 71 60 79 65 54 65 68 69 68 81 64 69 71 67 67 77 63 61 78 73 69 92 68 72 61 65 77 67 73 81 73 66 63 96 71 75 74 81 63 80 68 76 65 82 69 74 88 80 86 78 76 80 77 82 80 77 70 81 89 91 82 71 73 93 64 87 75 101 89 87 78 106 84 64 71 ; run; ods graphics on; proc ucm data = input plots=all; id date interval = month; model deaths ; irregular ; level checkbreak; season length = 12 type=trig var = 0 noest; * Note I have used trigonometry to model seasonality; run; ods graphics off; After several iterations considering different components and combinations, I ended with a parsimonious model of the following form: There is a stochastic level + deterministic seasonality + some outliers and the data does not have any other detectable features. Below is significance analysis of various components. Notice that I used trigonometry (that is sin/cos in the seasonality statement in PROC UCM) similar to @Elvis and @Nick Cox. You could also use dummy coding in UCM and when I tested both gave similar results. See this documentation for differences between the two ways to model seasonality in SAS. As shown above you have outliers: two pulses and one level shift in 2009 (Did economy/housing bubble play a role after 2009 ??) which could be explained by further deep dive analysis. A good feature of using Proc UCM is that it provides excellent graphical output. Below is seasonality and a combined trend and seasonality plot. Whatever is left over is noise . A more important diagnostic test if you want to use p values and significance testing is to check if your residuals are pattern-less and normally distributed which is satisfied in the above model using UCM and as shown below in the residual diagnostic plots like acf/pacf and others. Conclusion : Based on data analysis using UCM and significance testing the data appears to have seasonality and we see high number of deaths in summer months of May/June/July and lowest in winter months of December and February. Additional Considerations : Please also consider the practical significance of the magnitude of seasonal variation. To negate counterfactual arguments please consult domain experts to further complement and validate your hypothesis. I'm by no means saying that this is the only approach to solve this problem. The feature that I like about UCM is that it allows you to explicitly model all the time series features and is highly visual as well.
