If the aim is to mix together Postscript and Latex in one document, you can use Metapost. Hans Hagen's Metafun manual is the best introduction to Metapost I know of, although note that: He assumes that you will be using Tex or Context and not Latex. If you want to use Latex macros in Metapost, you will need some additional boilerplate; Metafun is a slight superset of regular Metapost; and He more or less ignores the ability of Metapost to embed raw Postscript â€” the core of the Metapost language is an extension of Knuth's Metafont, and is quite unlike Postscript. Cf. also Troy Henderson's Embedding fonts in MetaPost output , which explains how to embed Tex fonts in the Postscript files generated by Metapost.
