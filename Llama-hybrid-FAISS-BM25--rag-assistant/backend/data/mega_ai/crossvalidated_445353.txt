linearity of a measurement device

I like to evaluate the linearity of a measurement system. In order to do so I read ISO 22514-7 as well as Breyfogle's "Implementing six sigma". However, the procedure is still unclear to me. So I'm going to describe the procedure, as far as I understand it. Both references use the same data. R-Code: y = c(2.7 , 2.5 , 2.4 , 2.5 , 2.7 , 2.3 , 2.5 , 2.5 , 2.4 , 2.4 , 2.6 , 2.4 , 5.1 , 3.9 , 4.2 , 5 , 3.8 , 3.9 , 3.9 , 3.9 , 3.9 , 4 , 4.1 , 3.8 , 5.8 , 5.7 , 5.9 , 5.9 , 6 , 6.1 , 6 , 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.3 , 6 , 6.1 , 7.6 , 7.7 , 7.8 , 7.7 , 7.8 , 7.8 , 7.8 , 7.7 , 7.8 , 7.5 , 7.6 , 7.7 , 9.1 , 9.3 , 9.5 , 9.3 , 9.4 , 9.5 , 9.5 , 9.5 , 9.6 , 9.2 , 9.3 , 9.4 ) yRef = c(2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10) where $y=\{y_i\}$ is the raw measurement data and $\textrm{yRef}=\{\mu_i\}$ are the "true values". Now the data analysis goes as follows: Plot the difference $y_i - \mu_i$ as a function of $\mu_i$ . This yields the following plot: The black points are the individual differences $y_i - \mu_i$ , and the red points are the average values. The $x$ -axis displays the reference values $\mu_i$ . The blue line is a linear regression curve, see next step. Fit a linear regression curve to the difference of the average values (red dots in the upper graph). This yields Next, the ISO norm states that one has to use ANOVA to obtain the linearity. They state $linearity=0.58$ , but their formulae are unclear, see this question . In contrast, Breyfogle does not explain the evaluation at all. He states $linearity = 0.79$ , which is approx. the $y$ -intersect of the linear curve. What I would do: The plot shows that there exists a bias of the gauge and that this bias is approx. linear. Thus, I would simply take the slope as linearity. The max. bias is then calculated as $$\textrm{max bias} = slopeFit * \frac{range}{2}$$ Is this, how linearity of a measurement system is defined and statistically estimated?
