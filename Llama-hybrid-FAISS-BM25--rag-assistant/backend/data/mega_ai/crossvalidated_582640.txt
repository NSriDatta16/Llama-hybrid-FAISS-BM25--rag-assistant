Re: smoothness of a Random Walk compared to that of a cumulative sum of a Random Walk. Smoothness of these functions is determined by their uncertainties : S = Σ ht(n) ∆n, where ht(n) is a coin toss,{+ /- 1}; ∆ S = Σ∆ ht(n) ∆n == ht(n) or +/- 1; sS = Σ S(n) ∆n, ∆sS= Σ ∆ S(n) ∆n == S(n); an average S ~ sqrt(n), whereas an average sS= n*sqrt(n). Thus, ∆S/S = (+/- 1) /sqrt(n); while . ∆sS /sS = S / ~ sqrt(n) / n*sqrt(n)~ (+/-1) / n. The uncertainty in S is relatively larger than that of sS. The uncertainty of S is always (+/- 1) per S, but is (+/-1) /n for sS. The same argument would apply to the cumulative sum of sS. { if S = Σ ht(n) ∆n is called a Random Walk, Then, sS = Σ S(n) ∆n, may be called a Random Absement. }
