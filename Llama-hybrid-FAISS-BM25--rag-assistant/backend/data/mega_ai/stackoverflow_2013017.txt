Please suggest a better way to organize development databases

I'm currently working on a web project, in which we all connect to one development database. And like other centralized systems, in time this database turns out to be a single point of failure. If one of the developers carelessly dumps some dirty data into the database, all the other developers suffer from it. So I think maybe we should do something, say, every one of us makes a copy of the original database and we set up our web application to connect to the local database. In my case, core members of the team are five developers, one tester (mainly black-box testing). And the development process goes on like this: Each developer is responsible for one sub-feature and works on his own branch, and then we merge his branch on a trunk on which the tester tests the application. Please give me some suggestions.
