First off, you need to establish whether the SQL Server is Express Edition, since SQL Express has no SQL Agent functionality. In your command window, run the following command: SELECT @@version The result will include information on the edition. If you have Express, you will need to find another way to run your commands - possibly using SQLCMD and the windows scheduler, or one of the several third party replacements for the SQL Agent in SQL Express - if you Google "sql express agent", you'll find several. I've no experience with them, so I can't recommend one. If you have Standard or Enterprise editions, the steps to create SQL Agent jobs through T-SQL can be found here .
