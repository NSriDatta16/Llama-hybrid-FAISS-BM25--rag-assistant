How can I get a JavaScript VAR with ExternalInterface?

I am trying to use the ExternalInterface.call function in my ActionScript(2.0) to get a javascript var value set in the wrapping document. The following seems to work in FireFox and in Chrome but, naturally, it does not work in IE(8). Can anyone suggest another method for getting the value stored at this variable? Thanks! var linkPath = ExternalInterface.call("function(){return window.customLinkLocation;}", null); JavaScript: var customLinkLocation = "http://localhost/file.xml"; Could it be the way I am embedding my swf??
