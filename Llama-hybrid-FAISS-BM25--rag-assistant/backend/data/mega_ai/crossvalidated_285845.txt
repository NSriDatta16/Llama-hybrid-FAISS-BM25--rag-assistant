which R package is good for gibbs sampler when the likelihood function is complex

I see a lot of examples using MCMC to solve for posterior distribution when the likelihood is simply one of linear regression. What if the likelihood is an ugly, complex function. Which R package can solve a problem like that? It is a Gibbs sampler problem, because there are a number of RVs involved, and must be sampled in turn within one sweep.
