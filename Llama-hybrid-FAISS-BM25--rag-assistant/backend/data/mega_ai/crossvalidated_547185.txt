The Bayes factor formalises how the data change the prior ratio, so it measures what the data have to say about the hypotheses in a Bayesian framework, with the (hypothesis) priors "taken out" if you want. People can then use their own priors for making decisions or formalising their overall belief. One can also argue that the "evidence in the data alone" regarding the hypotheses is of interest in itself, even if ultimately posterior probabilities are used to make decisions. A more problematic explanation is that many people using Bayesian statistics are very shy to specify informative priors, and convincing justifications of priors are hard to find. The Bayes factor lets them get away without doing so (although parameter priors are still needed for composite hypotheses).
