MySQL Optimization 20 gig table

I have a 20 gig table that has a large amount of inserts and updates daily. This table is also frequently searched. I'd like to know if the MySQL indices can become fragmented and perhaps need to be rebuilt or something similar. I'm finding it difficult to figure out which of the CHECK TABLE, REPAIR TABLE or something similar? Any guidance appreciated, I'm a db newb.
