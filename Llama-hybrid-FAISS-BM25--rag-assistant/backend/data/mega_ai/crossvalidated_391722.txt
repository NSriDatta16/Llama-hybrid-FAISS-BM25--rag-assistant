I suppose it depends on what you want to do with the data. I know in insurance we used grouped data - that is we would group the data for each combination of explanatory variables then count the number of claims as response for the frequency model (poisson glm) or average the cost of claims as response for the cost model (gamma glm). Thus we aggregated the data over each group, not per policy, so the same policy might have more than one claim in a group. From your question it sounds like you are dealing with longitudinal data. I have not dealt much with such designs but this might be of some interest to you: panel data and repeated measures .
