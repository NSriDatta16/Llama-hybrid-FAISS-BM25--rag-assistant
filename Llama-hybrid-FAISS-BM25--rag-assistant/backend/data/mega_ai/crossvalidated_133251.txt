This is usually not a matter of choice. If we are interested in the estimation of $\beta$ (e.g. when $\beta$ is a model hyperparameter and $\theta$ is a latent variable) and there is not a single value for $\theta$ and instead the distribution of $\theta$ in known, we need to integrate out $\theta$. You can think of marginal likelihood as the weighted average of the likelihood for different values of $\theta_i$ weighted by their probability density $p(\theta_i)$. Now that $\theta$ has disappeared, using training samples as $data$, you can optimize the marginal likelihood w.r.t. $\beta$.
