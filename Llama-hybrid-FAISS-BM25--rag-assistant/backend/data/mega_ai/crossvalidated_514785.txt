Should I take a mean of answers given by an individual on a Likert-Style Scale?

I want to use three established scales which have a Likert Scale as a response - for instance the 10-item Need for Belonging scale (Leary et al., 2013). This scale is a 1-5 response alongside another scale and the third scale is a 1-7 response. I would like to ask that when a participant answers the scales, can I compute a mean score from their answers and thus have a per participant score like this for each scale i.e. three scores, one for each scale per participant? Some papers I read that employ these scales say "To analyze the motivational scales, mean scores were computed across the relevant items to form indices" or "We averaged the items in each scale and used the average scores in the data analyses." but I was not sure how to interpret them.
