I would agree with @rusiano. If you remove outliers before split, you are affecting test/validation data. Test data should be unspoiled. Regarding @VenkateshGandi answer: "If you remove outliers in only any one of train/test set it will create more problems.". In this case, don't remove outliers. Removing outliers is not always useful.
