What are models for storing tree structures and what are their characteristics?

So far I have encountered adjacency list, nested sets and nested intervals as models for storing tree structures in a database. I know these well enough and have migrated trees from one to another. What are other popular models? What are their characteristics? What are good resources (books, web, etc) on this topic? I'm not only looking for db storage but would like to expand my knowledge on trees in general. For example, I understand that nested sets/intervals are especially favorable for relational database storage and have asked myself, are they actually a bad choice in other contexts?
