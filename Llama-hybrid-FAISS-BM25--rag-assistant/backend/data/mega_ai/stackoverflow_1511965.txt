Custom SNMP Trap Implementation in .NET

I need to create a monitoring mechanism using SNMP (in .NET). I think we'll be using an nsoftware component to handle most of the work. It appears we must use 'traps' to communicate from the agent to the server. We'll have a number of different traps and various information detailing each trap. What is the best way to implement custom traps? That is, what is the best way to not only send a trap, but also send the information describing the trap to our 'snmp manager'? I think this is done through "variable bindings". To use "variable bindings" do we need to create our own "enterprise number" and use an "enterpriseSpecific" trap? Should we implement our own, custom MIBs or can we just send the data we need with the trap (via variable bindings)?
