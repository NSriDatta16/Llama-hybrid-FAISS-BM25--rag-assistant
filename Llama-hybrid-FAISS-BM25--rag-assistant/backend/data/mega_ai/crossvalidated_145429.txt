I'd say skip whatever occasional math that is not central to understanding GP. It is more important to understand the regression problem first without all that Bayesian framework. If you have worked on a regression problem and tuned the (hyper)parameters using cross validation then going to GP you will appreciate the Bayesian setting more and understand it more clearly. But there are some math not to skip and working with the gpml software by Rasmussen et al. on a toy problem greatly helps to figure that out. Sometimes your intuition does not match with what you are observing and you go back to the math to find out why and you realize you misunderstood. Reading the book and experimenting with gpml go hand in hand.
