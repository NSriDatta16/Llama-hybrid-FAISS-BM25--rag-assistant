Mobile phone market is very fragmented and you need to restrict yourself to a specific technology to get a useful answer. As far as I know there is no cross platform mobile framework available. However some mobile browsers are quite advanced and they will be able to handle jQuery or other libraries. I have seen jQuery run on S60 built in browser as well as Opera (not mini) at the same platform. I have also successfully run jQuery in mobile IE (Windows Mobile Professional Edition). However I wouldn't say it is safe to use jQuery on these platforms. You also want to ask the question regarding the size of the downloaded library as well as the execution speed.
