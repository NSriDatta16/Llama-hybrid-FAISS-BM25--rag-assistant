TFS 2010 - Deploy to Multiple Servers After Build

I've configured TFS 2010 to do a build and utilizing the MSBuild arguments, have it deploying to a single server without any issues. /p:DeployOnBuild=True /p:Configuration=Development /p:DeployTarget=MSDeployPublish /p:MSDeployPublishMethod=RemoteAgent /p:MsDeployServiceUrl=http:// /msdeployagentservice /p:username= /p:password= However, I am now to the point where I'd like to deploy to multiple machines after a build. I wasn't sure if there were some built in mechanisms for doing this, or should I invoke a process to launch a batch file that does this deployment followed by a sync? I was hoping to keep things neat and tidy. E.g., I could have two build definitions, one for each server, but that seems silly. I was hoping to just build to both servers in one fail swoop without too many outside customizations.
