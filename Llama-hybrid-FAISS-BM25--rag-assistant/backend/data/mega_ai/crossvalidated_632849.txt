The biomass amounts in grams* over time can be handled by standard methods. Two main predictors would be the caffeine concentrations and whether the source was pure caffeine or coffee grounds. If you think that there is something beyond an additive effect of concentration and source you could include an interaction term between concentration and source. Adding unnecessary interactions, however, can make it harder to find true differences. Tests on those coefficients address your hypotheses. You also need to include a model of how the biomass changes over time. If you just use the Day value for time in the model, software might by default enforce a linear growth. That doesn't seem consistent with your data. If instead you use all the Day values as individual levels of a categorical predictor, you will be trying to estimate too many coefficients. A regression spline is a reasonable compromise, letting the data help describe the shape without fitting more than a few coefficients. You also need to take into account the correlations of observations within individual specimens. There are a few different approaches, explained in Chapter 7 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies . A generalized least squares ("growth curve") model as explained in that chapter could work well. It allows for more types of potential correlations over time within an individual than do the "mixed models" that tend to receive more attention. If the Day 0 values can be taken to be the mass before treatment, you should include that value for an individual as a predictor in the model for all the subsequent observations on that individual. See this page for an explanation. *You usually want to work with data as close as possible to the values that were actually measured. The repeated percentage change values are taking you farther away from the original data, and would be much harder to model and interpret. Percentages and percentage changes often end up creating confusion.
