Receiving packets for different MAC address

is it possible to capture some packets in promiscuous mode (e.g. using winpcap) and than force OS (applications) to receive them as they were sent for our MAC? My observation is following. We can: capture all network traffic using promiscuous mode (winpcap) filter/modify the packets using firewall-hook/filter-hook send packets to the network with altered MAC I am not sure if firewall-hook can access all the packets which are available thanks to promiscious mode. Isn't it on the lower layer? If it can't, the only solution would be to capture desired packets and then resend them to the network with altered MAC? I am networking novice so please be easy on me :) Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
