LSTM is a statistical method. It is not alive so it cannot be dead. It can be useful though. Any statistical method is another tool in a box. If one does not work it is good to have an alternative. LSTM is good for language recognition tasks where context is important. It is also good for forecasting time series. The M4 competition was won by LSTM. If it was not useful there would not be a significant body of research dedicated to it. However as far as I know there is no proof that LSTM is inferior to any other method in some meaningful sense, i.e. the class of problems which LSTM is able to solve is smaller than logistic regression, etc.
