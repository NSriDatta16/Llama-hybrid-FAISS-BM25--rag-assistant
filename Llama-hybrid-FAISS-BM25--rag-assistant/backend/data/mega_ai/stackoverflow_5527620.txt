Okay, it's possible to do this with CSS. First of all, those styles you suggest don't work because if it starts out with display:none, there is nothing to hover on for the next style to kick in. I was able to add this to your site with Firebug: div.UpgradeI, div.UpgradeII, div.UpgradeIII { height:20px; overflow:hidden; } div.UpgradeI:hover, div.UpgradeII:hover, div.UpgradeIII:hover { height:auto; } That is the ugliest hack in history, but it achieves the desired effect without changing the HTML or adding Javascript. The paragraph below doesn't slide up because everything is positioned absolutely. If you start using float styles for everything else, though, it'll work. Obviously, you can edit the height to show more/less of the div as necessary.
