Interpretation of logistic regression results

I have a database that looks like this Firm Event Dummy_Event Dummy_Ev16 Year Info Dummy14 Dummy15 Dummy16 1 0 0 0 2014 x 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 2015 x 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 2016 x 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 2014 x 1 0 0 2 1 1 0 2015 x 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 2014 x 1 0 0 3 0 0 0 2015 x 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 2016 x 0 0 1 4 1 0 0 2014 x 1 0 0 Basically, I have analysed some firms for the years 2014-2016, eliminating them if an event happens. I have also added some year dummies at the end (equal to 1 if we are in a specific year), to implement a year fixed effects model. Dummy_Event becomes equal to 1 if we have a certain "event A" (there are two possible events), while Dummy_Ev16 becomes equal to 1 if the "event A" takes place in 2016. I want to perform the following regression Event ~ Info + Dummy_Event + Dummy_Ev16 + Dummy14 + Dummy15 + Dummy16 To check both how much "event A" and "event A" in 2016 explain the total number of events (and if it is more likely to have event A or event B, in general, and in 2016). The question is: if from the regression I obtain the following coefficients: Dummy_Event = +7 Dummmy_Ev16 = +5 How can I interpret those coefficients? Is event A more likely to happen with respect to event B?
