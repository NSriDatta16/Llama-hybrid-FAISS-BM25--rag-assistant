Edit : See Kobi's answer . If you really are using the hash part of things, just use location.hash ! (To self: Doh!) But I'll leave the below in case you're doing something more complex than your example suggests. Original answer: As the others have said, you've left out the global flag in your replacement. But I'm worried about the expression, it's really fragile. Consider: www.37signals.com#42 : Your resulting numeric string will be 3742, which probably isn't what you want. Other examples: www.blablabla.ru/user/4#3 (43), www2.blablabla.ru#3 (23), ... How 'bout: id = window.location.href.match(/\#(\d+)/)[1]; ...which gets you the contiguous set of digits immediately following the hash mark (or undefined if there aren't any).
