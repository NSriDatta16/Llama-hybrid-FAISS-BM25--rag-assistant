Testing for differences in vegetation cover

I'm working on an analysis of vegetation where the idea is to compare the percent cover of different plant types (e.g., oaks) between two ecosystems. The way I measured percent cover was to do a line transect, where I took 41 observations at regular intervals along a transect, noting what sort of plant was present at each point. The trouble I'm having is with how I should test for differences between the two ecosystems. A binomial test (e.g., oak vs. non-oak) or a contingency test (e.g., chi-square to compare the distribution of vegetation types) doesn't seem appropriate. Let's say I took 10 transects in each ecosystem. That would leave me with 41*10=410 "observations," but these are obviously not independent due to the fact that each group of 41 came from a single transect. Would a mixed-effects logistic regression model be the way to go? Here's how I would envision that: Independent variable: Categorical, Ecosystem A or B? Dependent variable: Probability of oak (e.g.) Random effects variable: Transect number If it seems like this is appropriate, I'd need a hint as to how to perform that analysis in R. I've used nlme for mixed-effects linear models before, but can it handle logistic regression? Alternatively, is this an instance where the arcsine transformation of proportions for use in a comparison-of-means test (e.g., t-test) actually makes sense? Or am I just thinking about this too hard? Thanks in advance.
