droid user interface implemenation

I would like to write an application that would run initially on a Motorola Droid. The application would retrieve row(s) from a database and display some textual data from the rows as well as an image associated with the record that will be stored on the SD card. I really think that the results would be best displayed in a fashion similar to the Calendar app that ships with the Droid - that is the data and associated image will scrollable left and right by dragging the current "page". I assume that some of you will know how this is implemented - I dont' seem to be able to ask the right question when searching. Any help would be appreciated.
