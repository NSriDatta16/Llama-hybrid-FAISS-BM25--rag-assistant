C linux pthread thread priority

My program has one background thread that fills and swaps the back buffer of a double buffer implementation. The main thread uses the front buffer to send out data. The problem is the main thread gets more processing time on average when I run the program. I want the opposite behavior since filling the back buffer is a more time consuming process then processing and sending out data to the client. How can I achieve this with C POSIX pthreads on Linux?
