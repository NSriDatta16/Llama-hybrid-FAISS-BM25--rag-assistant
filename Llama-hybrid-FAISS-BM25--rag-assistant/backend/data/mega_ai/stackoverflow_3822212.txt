Probably slightly overkill, but OpenLayers is a cross-browser JavaScript library that lets you put zoomable, draggable interactive maps on your web page. Elements can be made to highlight on hover and do something on click. You can restrict the zooming and panning if you just want a fixed map. You'd have to get your county map in a suitable vector format (GML works well).
