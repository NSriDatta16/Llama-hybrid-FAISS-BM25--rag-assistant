Reference request for Bayesian problem formulation

In Bayesian inference, there are two parts: the problem formulation, where the structure of the problem with parameters is built, and the solution of Bayesian inference, through MCMC, grid or normal approximation, etc. Most references I see spend the vast majority of their time on the solution space in Bayesian inference. Is there a good book that focuses on the first part of the problem? McElreath's Statistical Rethinking and Gelman et al. Bayesian Data Analysis do this a bit, but McElreath's examples are generally more simple than what I'm looking for, and Gelman doesn't have enough examples.
