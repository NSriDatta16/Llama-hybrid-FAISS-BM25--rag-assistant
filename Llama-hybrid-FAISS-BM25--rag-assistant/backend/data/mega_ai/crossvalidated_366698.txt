Measure variation in a time series

I have a series of values, they are a time series. I know what standard deviation is. I want to measure how much values in a series differ from one value to the next. 50,50,50,50,50,100,100,100,100,100 50,100,50,100,50,100,50,100,50,100 This two series have the same standard deviation. I want to know is there some other measure that would measure how this two series are different. The series are made for better understanding of my point, they are not real numbers.
