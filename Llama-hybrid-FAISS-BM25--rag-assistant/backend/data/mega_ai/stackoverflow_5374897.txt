I found the answer to this question in converting the class into a datatable and using that as my itemssource. In doing so, I ran across the problem that datagrids treat everything in the datatable as a datarowview, but this post solved that problem: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/8b2e94b7-3c44-4642-8acc-851de5285062 Likely not the best or most elegant solution, but the only one I was able to find.
