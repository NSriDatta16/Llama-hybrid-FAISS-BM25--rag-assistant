How to estimate the number of samples needed for NLP corpus?

What are approaches to estimate how many samples are needed for an SVM classification task in features extracted from text? If I have for example a set of 8 labels in a 100-dimensional featurespace. How many samples do I need to build a reasonable classifier?
