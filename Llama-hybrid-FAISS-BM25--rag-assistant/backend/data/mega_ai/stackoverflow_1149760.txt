Connection pooling keeps your connection alive in anticipation, if another user connects the ready connection to the db is handed over and the database does not have to open a connection all over again. This is actually a good idea because opening a connection is not just a one-go thing. There are many trips to the server (authentication, retrieval, status, etc) So if you've got a connection pool on your website, you're serving your customers faster. Unless your website is not visited by people you can't afford not to have a connection pool working for you.
