SQL Server -> 'SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS' Collation -> Varchar Column -> Languages Supported

All, We are using SQL Server 2008 with Collation Setting as 'SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS'. We are using Varchar column to store textual data. We know that we cannot store Double Byte data in Varchar column and hence cannot support languages like Japanese and Chinese without converting it to NVarchar. However, will it be safe to say that all Single Byte Characters can be stored in Varchar column without any problem? If yes then from where can I get the list of languages which needs Single Byte for storage and the list of languages which needs double byte? Any assistance in this regard is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
