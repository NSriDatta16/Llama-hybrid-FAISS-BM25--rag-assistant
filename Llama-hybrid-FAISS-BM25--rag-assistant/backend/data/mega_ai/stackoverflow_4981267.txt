Subfolders in lib

I have a module called user_searches. It performs some searches that aren't core to the user model, thus, why I'm putting the responsibility somewhere else. I want to organize all my models like this that perform non-core user functions in a lib subfolder called user. Right now to include the module's methods in the User model I have to put... require 'user/user_searches' class User ...I don't need the require if the file is directly in the lib folder, but do if it's in the subfolder. What do I have to do so I don't need the require ?
