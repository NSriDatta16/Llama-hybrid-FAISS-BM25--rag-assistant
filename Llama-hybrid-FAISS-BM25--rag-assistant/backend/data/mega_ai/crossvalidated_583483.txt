There are general solutions to the problem of more predictors than observations, including regularisation (such as LASSO), using a Bayesian prior (see Modelling with more variables than data points for more discussion of this), or random forests. But the bigger problem here is that there are just 10 data points. It's not impossible but very unlikely that there's much you can learn from such a tiny dataset. There are circumstances in which such small datasets are informative e.g. you have a strong a priori hypothesis, or are measuring a calibration curve in a lab experiment. But these are unlikely to apply in your situation, which sounds more exploratory.
