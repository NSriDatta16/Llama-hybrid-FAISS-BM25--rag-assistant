Example 1 Think of a simple example first. You have a single school from which you select a random sample of 100 students. For each student, you measure the values of an OUTCOME value and a PREDICTOR value, where: OUTCOME = whether or not the student passed a particular exam (1 = passed; 0 = did not pass) PREDICTOR = number of hours the student spent preparing for the exam, categorized into "1 day or less", "2-4 days" and "5-7 days" When you fit a binary logistic regression model of the form brms(OUTCOME ~ PREDICTOR, family = bernoulli, etc.) , what is it that you are ultimately estimating with that model? You are estimating the proportion of students in that school who passed the exam given they spent "1 day or less", "2-4 days" or "5-7 days", respectively, preparing for the exam. There is no reason to believe that the 3 proportions should add up to 1 - in fact they can add up to either less than 1 or more than 1. For example, the 3 proportions of interest could be 0.72, 0.42 and 0.14, say. What you can expect to add up to 1 would be: The proportion of students in the school who passed the exam given they studied for "1 day or less" and the proportion of students who did NOT pass the exam given they studied for "1 day or less"; The proportion of students in the school who passed the exam given they studied for "2 - 4 days" and the proportion of students who did NOT pass the exam given they studied for "2 - 4 days"; The proportion of students in the school who passed the exam given they studied for "5 - 7 days" and the proportion of students who did NOT pass the exam given they studied for "5 - 7 days". Example 2 Now, assume you expand on the first example and sample 20 schools at random and then within each school you sample 100 students at random. For each student, you measure the OUTCOME and PREDICTOR variables defined above; you then use the data collected on these variables to fit a mixed effects binary logistic regression model of the form brms(OUTCOME ~ PREDICTOR + (1|SCHOOL), family = bernoulli, etc.) . With this more complicated set up, the parameters reported in your brms model summary refer to the typical school; if you plug them into the plogis() function as you did in your post, you'll be able to estimate the proportion of students at the "typical" school who passed the exam given they studied a specified number of days (e.g., "5 - 7 days"). Again, there is no reason to believe that these 3 proportions should add up to 1! They are whatever they are - for example, these proportions could increase in as a function of the number of days spent studying and their total could be less than 1 or greater than 1. But, given a number of days spent studying, the proportion of students who passed the exam and the proportion of students who did NOT pass the exam will add up to 1. sd(Intercept) To get a handle on how big/small the SD(Intercep) value (SD for short) is, why not compute plogis(-5.49 - 1.96 * SD) and plogis(-5.49 + 1.96 * SD) and see how variable the resulting probabilities are? If very variable, then SD is "large"; if not very variable, then SD is "small".
