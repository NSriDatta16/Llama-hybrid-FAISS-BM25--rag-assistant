You are using a probability model, not a classification model. Logistic regression does not classify Y; it uses an already classified Y to predict the probability of class membership. Your sample size is just barely large enough to fit the intercept in the logistic model, i.e., to handle the case where there are zero covariates. So take all of your analyses with a grain of salt. Study the association between ANGPTL7 and sex. If they are collinear, test them with a 2 d.f. "chunk" test (e.g., a likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ test) instead of testing them individually. Let them combine forces instead of compete. The imbalanced distribution of sex is not an issue. This is really about joint distributions. Losing tremendous power by using OSA as a binary variable and not using the underlying apnea index it was derived from is a very strange way to analyze data.
