I think your last sentence hits the nail on the head here. What is happening is that for some combination of your predictor variables there is a zero count. So the software is trying to generate a coefficient which will send the intercept (which is presumably positive) to zero. But there is no multiplier which does that so it stops when it reaches a very small predicted value. If you look at the coefficients on the log scale it is about -24 which is trying to go to $-\infty$ but stopping there. For advice on what to do you could try browsing the tag separation or looking at How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? Note that most of those are about logistic regression but similar issues arise for you here.
