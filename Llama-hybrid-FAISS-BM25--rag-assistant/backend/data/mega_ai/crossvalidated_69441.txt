Are there any drawbacks to using the normal equation in AR parameter estimation?

Is it ok to try and estimate the parameters $c$ and $p$ of a standard AR(1) model of the form $$ X_t = c+ pX_{t-1} +e_t $$ solving the normal equation $$ \Theta = (X^T X)^{-1}X^TY $$ where $\Theta$ is the parameter vector, $X$ a vector containing the $X_{t-1}$ values and $Y$ the $X_t$ vector? The $Y$ vector would obviously contain $t-1$ values (the first value removed) so that it would equal $X$ in length. We'd use something like X Y NA 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and of course ignore the first row. In other words, is it wrong to apply this "linear regression with multiple variables" method to a time series method of the AR (perhaps others, ARMA, GARCH, etc) sort? Since I haven't really seen the normal equation used for this sort of problem I reckon the answer to my question is Yes. A secondary question would then be "Why?" Why isn't this method OK?
