The Z-test (and probably the other tests you were reviewing) are based on frequentist theory. Hypothesis tests do fit badly with bayesian statistics, while they might be constructed. Using bayesian statistics one is mostly focusing on other inference methods, such as uncertainty intervals (credible intervals). EDIT AS of your new question B, which is close to being to broad! And I am probably not the right person to answer it ... I think it would be wrong to view as "two essentially non-overlapping theories", in practice there is overlap, especially in the field of regression models. Have a look at http://andrewgelman.com/2015/03/29/bayesian-frequentist-regression-methods/ for one thoughtful view, and then you can search this site for "bayes frequentist", for instance Who Are The Bayesians? Why does frequentist hypothesis testing become biased towards rejecting the null hypothesis with sufficiently large samples? Is it possible to interpret the bootstrap from a Bayesian perspective? Is there any *mathematical* basis for the Bayesian vs frequentist debate?
