How to fit an ARMAX model with more than one exogenous time series?

I am trying to fit an ARMAX with two exogenous time series with the following code but it gives me an "computationally singular" error. I know it is about defining more than 2 time series for xreg because when I include only one exogenous it works! This is link for data library(forecast) data I get this Error: in solve.default(res$hessian * n.used, A) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 5.67866e-34
