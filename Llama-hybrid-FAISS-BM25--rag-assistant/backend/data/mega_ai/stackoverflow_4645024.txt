Though it's a really terrible way of organizing things, you could use nested Git repositories with .gitignore files that ignore anything which doesn't belong in a given repository: .git/ .gitignore That would effectively allow you to have 3 different 'overlapping' repositories which track different parts of the file structure. But really, it'd be better to just find a way to reorganize your files and/or version control needs.
