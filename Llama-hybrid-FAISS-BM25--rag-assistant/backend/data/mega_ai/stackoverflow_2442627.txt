Use a data-profiling tool and examine those dimensions. As a rule, there should be no nulls in dimension tables. It is also common to have "special" dimension rows like: 0=unknown, -1= none, etc. Your data-warehouse designer (probably) already took care of that. If you happen to find nulls, pass the problem to the data-warehouse team to deal with it. The warehouse is supposed to act as a reference data storage and serve multiple client applications -- if every application designer has to decide how to deal with unknown values, they will eventually generate different results (reports) based on the same data-set.
