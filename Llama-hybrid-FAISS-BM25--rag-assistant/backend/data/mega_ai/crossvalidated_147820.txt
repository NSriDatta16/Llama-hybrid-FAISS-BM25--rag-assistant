Which machine learning model is applicable to the following case

I want to build a model that recognizes the species based on multiple indicators. The problem is, neural networks (usually) receive vectors, and my indicators are not always easily expressed in numbers. For example, one of the indicators is not only whether species performs some actions (that would be, say, '0' or '1', or anything in between, if the essence of action permits that), but sometimes, in which order are those actions performed. I want the system to be able to decide and classify species based on these indicators. There are not may classes but rather many indicators. The amount of training data is not an issue, I can get as much as I want. What machine learning techniques should I consider? Maybe some special kind of neural network would do? Or maybe something completely different.
