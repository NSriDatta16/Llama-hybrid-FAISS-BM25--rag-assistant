Well kudos for going the extra mile on user experience AND trying to maintain clean program structure. Maybe if you're uploading only you could try to create an empty 'placeholder' file with the same name as the final 2GB file will have, then just overwrite it. Not perfect since you could still end up with an empty file, but pretty easy and at least a little bit more elegant that some of the alternatives.
