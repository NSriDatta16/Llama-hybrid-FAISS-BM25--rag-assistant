You can determine the status of the fulltext indexing by querying the indexing properties like this: SELECT FULLTEXTCATALOGPROPERTY('IndexingCatalog', 'PopulateStatus') AS Status Populate Status: 0 = Idle 1 = Full population in progress 2 = Paused 3 = Throttled 4 = Recovering 5 = Shutdown 6 = Incremental population in progress 7 = Building index 8 = Disk is full. Paused. 9 = Change tracking But also pay attention to this note in the article: The following properties will be removed in a future release of SQL Server: LogSize and PopulateStatus. Avoid using these properties in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use any of them. EDIT: Corrected link to a newer page and added quote from the note
