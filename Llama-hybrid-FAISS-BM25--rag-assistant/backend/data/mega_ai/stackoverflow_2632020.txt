The biggest threat is that an attacker could leverage a vulnerability such as; directory traversal, or using SQL Injection to call load_file() to read the plain text username/password in the configuration file and then Login using phpmyadmin or over tcp port 3306. As a pentester I have used this attack pattern to compromise a system. Here is a great way to lock down phpmyadmin: PhpMyAdmin lacks strong bruteforce protection, so you must use a long randomly generated password. DO NOT ALLOW REMOTE ROOT LOGINS! Instead phpmyadmin can be configured to use "Cookie Auth" to limit what user can access the system. If you need some root privileges, create a custom account that can add/drop/create but doesn't have grant or file_priv . Remove file_priv permissions from every account. file_priv is one of the most dangerous privileges in MySQL because it allows an attacker to read files or upload a backdoor. Whitelist IP address who have access to the phpmyadmin interface. Here is an example .htaccess reulset: Order deny,allow Deny from all allow from 199.166.210.1 Do not have a predictable file location like: http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin . Vulnerability scanners like Nessus/Nikto/Acunetix/w3af will scan for this. Firewall off tcp port 3306 so that it cannot be accessed by an attacker. Use HTTPS, otherwise data and passwords can be leaked to an attacker. If you don't want to fork out the $30 for a cert, then use a self-signed. You'll accept it once, and even if it was changed due to a MITM you'll be notified.
