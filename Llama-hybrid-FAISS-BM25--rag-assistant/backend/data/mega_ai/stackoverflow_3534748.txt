Extraction may be the incorrect implied word here. From what I understand, is user133611 wants to have an audio only stream from YouTube. Unfortunately, YouTube directly forbids it. Here is a quote from Kuan Yong from the YouTube API team: Your API Client will not, and You will not encourage or create functionality for Your users or other third parties to: "separate, isolate, or modify the audio or video components of any YouTube audiovisual content made available through the YouTube API" -Kuan Yong, YouTube API Team Link reference: https://groups.google.com/group/youtube-api-gdata/browse_thread/thread/7fac8e8ff913b6c4?pli=1
