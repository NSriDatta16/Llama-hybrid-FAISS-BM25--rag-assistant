Z-score and Hypothesis Testing

I have a large dataset of vehicles's speeds. My goal is to infer an upper bound on the (average) speed of the population of all vehicles $U$ The way this is to be done is like this: Given a potential speed bound $S$ we will test the hypothesis that $U . The null hypothesis then would be: $ U >= S $ I've a rather limited statistics knowledge (I'm a programmer!) and would like to know an algorithm for accepting or rejecting an $S$ . We have no knowledge of the population of all vehicles (neither distribution nor mean). I know I have to use z-score (it's a large dataset), but I'm having trouble figuring out what each variable in the z-score formula should correspond to in my case. I'm thinking maybe I should look at only the vehicles where $ \text{speed of vehicle} >= S$ for testing the null hypothesis, this would be the sample set, and the population would be all vehicles.
