(IMO) advantages: No garbage collector! generated programs are written in C which should boost performance and require less resources than other scripting languages (python) or managed code (Mono). Provide easy to use API to a huge variety of useful libraries available in Linux written mostly in C. Provide a C#-like syntax which is very popular and by doing so attract new developers to OSS programming. Bring (some level of) OOP syntactic sugar into the world of C but easier to use than C++. disadvantage: No garbage collector! Generated program should be recompiled for each architecture. It's a young language. Language specifications and API change constantly. Maintaining a big project might require extra attention. Debugging is possible but a bit tricky. No stable IDE and tools yet. Valide crashes a lot and vtg too. Language object model is based on glib/gobject which seem to be limited. Dova is being developed to explore an alternative path but will not be compatible with gobjects.
