Depends on where you work if I read the situation correctly. If you're in a large company, like a Fortune 500 firm in the US, it's unlikely that Ruby or Rails will do you much good. Less for technical reasons, more due to the fact that those organizations tend to be large, bureaucratic, conservative, lowest common denominator, and risk-averse. You'll see Java or C# entrenched there, because they're mainstream languages with large user communities and firms backing them up. If you're in a small company that's more entrepreneurial I can see where it's more likely that they're taking a chance on a technology like Ruby, Python, etc. A place that agrees with Paul Graham is more likely to use an alternative platform.
