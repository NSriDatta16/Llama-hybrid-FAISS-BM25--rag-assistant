What regression type for Normal DV and count data IV (with lots of 0s)

I'm performing regression on subjects' response to a question on a 1-5 likert scale (1=low, 5=high, etc)- This is the DV and its continuous and normally distributed. The IV is a count of how many times they were exposed to a stimuli (a count of the number of times). So the IV is count data.... It's not normally distributed and a full third of the scores are zero (the average is around 3, though the max is 20). Is there any specific type of regression I could run to look at the effect of this stimuli? If the count data was the DV I'd do a zero inflated negative binomial regression or something like that, but in this instance the count data is the IV... Would simple OLS regression be suitable?
