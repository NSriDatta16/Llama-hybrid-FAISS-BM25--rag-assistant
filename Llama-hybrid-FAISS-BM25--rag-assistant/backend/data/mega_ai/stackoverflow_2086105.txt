Why does it take so long to rename a column in mysql?

I have a 12 GB table full of pictures, I'm trying to rename the blob column that holds the data, and it is taking forever. Can someone give me a blow by blow account of why it is taking so long to rename the column? I would have thought that this operation would be pretty quick, no matter the size of the table? EDIT: The query I ran is as follows alter table `rails_production`.`pictures` change `data` `image_file_data` mediumblob NULL It appears that most of the time is spent waiting for mysql to make a temporary copy of the pictures table, which since it is very large is taking a while to do. It is on the list of things to do, to change the picture storage from the database to the filesystem. EDIT2: Mysql Server version: 5.0.51a-24+lenny2 (Debian)
