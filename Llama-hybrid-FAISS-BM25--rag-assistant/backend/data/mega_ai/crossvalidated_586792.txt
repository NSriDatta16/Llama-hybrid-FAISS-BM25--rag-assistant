The problem with clustering after dimensionality reduction is that the clustering can completely change by the projection. See e.g. this example: Here, in higher dimensions, you have five perfect clusters and after PCA projection (to the red line) you end up with just one cluster. And even though the clustering after dimensionality reduction is nowhere near the proper clustering, the silhouette score can still be good, maybe even better than for the original data. But clearly, this is not only a problem with the silhouette score, this follows from the projection which can severely alter the grouping of your data. So comparing any scores for clusterings after different dimensionality reductions is often not very informative. Clustering metrics, especially in higher dimensions, are always problematic. None of them have ever worked for me except for toy examples. In my experience, methods like t-SNE and UMAP still work best.
