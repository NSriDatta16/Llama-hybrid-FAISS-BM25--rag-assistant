Example of a k-dimensional random vector X where each component of the vector is normally distributed but X is not

From the definition of multivariate normal distribution , we know that if a k-dimensional random vector X = (X 1 , X 2 , ..., X k ) is (multi-variate) normally distributed if every linear combination of its components is normally distributed. This implies that every component of X is also normally distributed. What about the reverse? What is an example of k-dimensional random vector X where each of X 1 , X 2 , ..., X k are normally distributed but X is not? If there is a good example in 2-d, that would be even better, because I could plot the probability density in 3-D and visualize to improve my intuition. Motivation for this question: I have been studying professor Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course where we model a dataset using multi-variate normal distribution to detect anomalies / outliers. So, I am trying to understand when is it "ok" to model the data this way. For the univariate case, I can plot the data, and see if it "generally" follows a bell curve. But it's hard to get an understanding of a multi-dimensional dataset .
