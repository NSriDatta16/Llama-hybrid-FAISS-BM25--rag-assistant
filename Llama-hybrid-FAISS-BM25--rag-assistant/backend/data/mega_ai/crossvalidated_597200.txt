Are shapely values invariant under monotonic feature transformation?

I have been using shap values as a measure of feature importance for some time. But, I have never understood the justification behind comparing the shap values for features that are on different scales. Shap values represent the average change in the prediction if the feature changes by 1 unit. But, what if one of my features ranges from [0,1000000] and the other one ranges from [1,2] Another way to state this would be to ask if the shap values are invariant under the monotonic transformations of the feature would SHAP(X) be equal to SHAP(f(X))? I don't see a reason why It should be and then using them for feature importance does not make sense to me Can you please help me understand shapely values from this angle?
