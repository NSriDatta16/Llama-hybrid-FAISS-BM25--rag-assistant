Print the form using a scripting language like PHP. Use a smart naming for checkboxes, then put the logic to retrieve data in the script that receive the post form. If you use php, u can use ... ... when submitting the page, the $_POST result will be $POST = array( [paul] = array( [skill1]=> 1, [skill3]=>1) //paul has skills 1 and 3 [robert] = array( [skill1]=> 1, [skill4]=>1) //paul has skills 1 and 4 ) if you want to do it everything on the frontend, you should use JQuery, but than managing data it's more difficult. I suppose you have PHP skills, otherwise use a Spreadsheet to do this
