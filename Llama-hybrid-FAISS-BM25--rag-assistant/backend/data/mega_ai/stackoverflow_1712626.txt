One of the coolest things I learned about recently was the commands module: >>> import commands >>> commands.getoutput('uptime') '18:24 up 10:22, 7 users, load averages: 0.37 0.45 0.41' It's like os.popen or os.system but without all of the DeprecationWarnings. And let's not forget PDB (Python Debugger): % python -m pdb poop.py
