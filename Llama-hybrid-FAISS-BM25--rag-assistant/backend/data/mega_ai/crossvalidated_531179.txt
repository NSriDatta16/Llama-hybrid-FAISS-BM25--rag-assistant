From the discussion, I assume that B and C are disjoint. To the extent that B and C can be taken as samples from larger populations, it seems reasonable to do a chi-squared test on B and C. With some rearrangements of response categories, I put all of your data into contingency table TBL . a = c(3361, 28, 21, 41, 9, 67, 1448) b = c(1101, 9, 10, 12, 6, 21, 435) c = c( 84, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 29) TBL = rbind(a,b,c); TBL TBL = rbind(a,b,c); TBL [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] a 3361 28 21 41 9 67 1448 b 1101 9 10 12 6 21 435 c 84 3 1 0 1 3 29 Restricting attention to B and C, we have TABbc = TBL[c(2,3),]; TABbc [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] b 1101 9 10 12 6 21 435 c 84 3 1 0 1 3 29 A standard chi-squared test runs into difficulties because of the small counts. chisq.test(TABbc) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: TABbc X-squared = 8.9769, df = 6, p-value = 0.1749 Warning message: In chisq.test(TABbc) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect As implemented in R, it is possible to simulate a more useful P-value, which does not reject the null hypothesis that proportions in the various response categories are equal. chisq.test(TABbc, sim=T) Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 2000 replicates) data: TABbc X-squared = 8.9769, df = NA, p-value = 0.1689 A more traditional approach is to collapse the table to get fewer cells with larger counts. The reason for the warning message is that several of the expected counts (computed from row and column totals, assuming the null hypothesis to be true) are smaller than $5,$ so that the chi-sqared statistic may not have approximately a chi-squared distribution. Expected counts are as follows; it is small counts in columns 2-6 that are causing most of the trouble. hisq.test(TABbc)$exp [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] b 1101.39359 11.1533528 10.2239067 11.1533528 6.5061224 22.306706 431.26297 c 83.60641 0.8466472 0.7760933 0.8466472 0.4938776 1.693294 32.73703 Warning message: In chisq.test(TABbc) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect c1 = c( 84, 3+ 1+ 0+ 1, 3, 29) TBL1 = cbind(a1,b1,c1) TBL1 a1 b1 c1 [1,] 3361 1101 84 [2,] 99 37 5 [3,] 67 21 3 [4,] 1448 435 29 chisq.test(TBL1[c(2,3),]) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: TBL1[c(2, 3), ] X-squared = 0.32154, df = 2, p-value = 0.8515 Warning message: In chisq.test(TBL1[c(2, 3), ]) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect We still get a warning message, but this time only one of the expected counts is below $5,$ but not below $3.$ which many statisticians would find good enough. chisq.test(TBL1[c(2,3),])$exp a1 b1 c1 [1,] 100.88793 35.25 4.862069 [2,] 65.11207 22.75 3.137931 Warning message: In chisq.test(TBL1[c(2, 3), ]) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect The bottom line is that we find no significant differences between responses of groups A and B.
