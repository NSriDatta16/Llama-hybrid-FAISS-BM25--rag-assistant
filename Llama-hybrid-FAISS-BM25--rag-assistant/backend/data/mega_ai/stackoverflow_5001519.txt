Magento refuses to upgrade 1.4.2.0 ===> 1.5.0.1

This is my first time using Magento. I upgraded this site from 1.4.1.1 to 1.4.2.0 without issue. Now trying to go to 1.5.0.1 it just seems to refuse at every turn. I tried by entering this key into Magento Connect: magento-core/Mage_All_Latest And it says this: Ignoring installed package magento-core/Mage_All_Latest Nothing to install I tried to upgrade via SSH and got this: Attempting to discover channel "magento-core"... unknown channel "magento-core" in "magento-core/Mage_All_Latest" invalid package name/package file "magento-core/Mage_All_Latest" Cannot initialize 'magento-core/Mage_All_Latest', invalid or missing package file Package "magento-core/Mage_All_Latest" is not valid install failed In the downloader I noticed a the downloader had a version 1.5.0.0 upgrade available. I thought maybe I needed the newest downloader before I could update all the packages. I upgraded just the downloader to 1.5.0.0 which worked. Then I tried the full upgrade again and now it is mega retarded with this: Couldn't resolve host 'magento-core' Thatâ€™s cute isn't it? So I gave it once last whirl at the ssh console and i get this bad boy: Attempting to discover channel "magento-core"... Attempting fallback to https instead of http on channel "magento-core"... unknown channel "magento-core" in "magento-core/Mage_All_Latest" invalid package name/package file "magento-core/Mage_All_Latest" install failed I tried a forcing it via SSH but still no love. I reverted from a backup I made so I do not have downloader 1.5.0.0 any more. Now of course I am back to square one with it telling me there is nothing to install when I try to update via MC. When I check in MC if there are any updates available it lists these two: Mage_All_Latest Upgrade to 1.4.2.1 (stable) Metapackage for latest Magento 1.4 release And the Mage Downloader 1.5.0.1 but I already installed these before and it did no good so I restored my backup before the failed update. I was trying to ask this question Magento's Forums but they are a mess right now. Their captcha fails and threads close on their own so you get little to no help. I wouldn't be surprised if they did this on purpose in concert with their 1.5.0.1 release.
