It can work. Embedded urls can have an onclick attribute that writes an iframe that sources a page on your server that displays the comments for that fragment of the article along with a form to submit new comments, if so desired. I suggest iframes because of your statement "the same article can be shown in multiple sites" - and I assume you do not control all of them.
