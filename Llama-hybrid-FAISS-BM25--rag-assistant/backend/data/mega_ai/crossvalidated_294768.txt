There is a general rule of thumb: If you calculated a sample size of $n$ to test for the main effect, you'll need $4n$ for the interaction of the same magnitude and at the same power. See Leon and Heo (CSDA, 2009) . This applies to logistic regression as well. It can be worse for poorly balanced data.
