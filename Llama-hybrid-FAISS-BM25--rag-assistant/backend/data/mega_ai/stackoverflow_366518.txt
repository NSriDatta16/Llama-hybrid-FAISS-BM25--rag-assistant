The problem is not whether it's in a function or an object. The problem is that you have hundreds of lines in one blob. Whether that mass of code is in a method of an object or just a class seems more or less irrelevant to me, just being minor syntatic sugar. What are those hundreds of lines doing? That's the place to look to implement object oriented best practice. If your other developers really think using an object instead of a function makes it significantly more "object oriented" but having a several-hundred line function/method isn't seen as a code smell, then I think organisationally you have some education to do.
