using stl (seasonal decomposition with loess) for weekly data

I am trying to decompose a weekly time series using the R function 'stl'. One of the important argument of this function is the number of data per cycle. Naturally in this case one would choose 52. However, my data is published every week, on the same weekday. Hence I have sometimes 53 data per year. Not a big deal, I agree. But I would like to be precise here. Is there a commonly accepted methodology to treat these situations? I can think of several solutions: 1/ I average the last 2 data in years with 53 data? 2/ I average the last 2 or the first 2 data in years with 53 data? (depending on when we are in the year) 3/ I add an extra datapoint in years with 52 years?
