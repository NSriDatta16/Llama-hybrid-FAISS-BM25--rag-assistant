a quasi-raskinesque zoomable, mostly text interface + 3d, cross platform and open; where do i start? (opengl?)

in this browser and bitmap graphics dominated world - after decades of macintosh-ish richly decorated windows and pretty components - I'm looking for a way to render fixed size character text, draw an extremely simplified "gui" onto 3d panels that can be zoomed and interactively resized making the content tiny and not wrapped or not more readable, onto "panels" that the user could tile together, "stack" up, turn around, drag etc. the software should be portable or cross platform. it seems that a simple, basic 3d layer is a good thing to employ, e.g. opengl, the problem is: i don't know anything about these things. what's the most easy route to get the thing done without having to learn everything of a 3d toolkit? what could be the most fitting tool to achieve this? java3d? or is it outdated/slow? qt toolkit 3d widgets? thank you in advance for any hint
