Which Lisp should I learn?

Which Lisp (dialect) should I learn, and why? The fragmentation between CL and Scheme slows uptake (at least for me!). So, give me the "true answer", please! I have tried to read feature comparisons, and they seem to get bogged down in esoterica (that I don't fully understand) like whether the dialect is fully tail-recursive, and the like. I'm hoping you all (collectively) can make the opaque differences clear. Things I like Good library support, good environments, and Unicode support. Things I dislike Flamewars. Features that are useful at the beginning, but interfere with long-term learning. Updates I've been mostly using MzScheme, which I'm enjoying just fine, once I got readline support going. I don't run a GUI on Unix, so it seemed to be a fine environment option for me. I'm also very happy that Clojure has an easy to install .deb package on debian, so it's much easier to play with. This is a big win. Despite the hostility of some rather easy-to-anger below, low barrier to entry is a win. I like being spoonfed. After reading a lot more of SICP , I do understand the issues around tail recursion much better.
