How can I get Powershell TabExpansion to print all the possible completions?

The default TabExpansion in Powershell cycles through the possible completions for the fragment on the command prompt. Internally in the PowerShell host, there's a circular buffer, and the first TAB fills the buffer and puts the first potential completion on the prompt. Subsequent TABs cycle through the list of possible completions. How can I modify TabExpansion to just display the set of possible completions when I hit ? Also, can I invoke the TabExpansion function explicitly from the command prompt, and if so, how? (If you don't know what I mean by "modify TabExpansion", see this link .)
