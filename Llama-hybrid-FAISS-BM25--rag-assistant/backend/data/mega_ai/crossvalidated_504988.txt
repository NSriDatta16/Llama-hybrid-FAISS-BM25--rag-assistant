As an example, RNN with encoder-decoder archs. are used in these cases. But it does not necessarily take text input. You need to convert your text to numeric, and an embedding layer learns cont. vector representations of the converted text. So yes, several ML models can achieve this particular goal, but I believe none of them processes raw text input. Data always needs to be converted to numeric before fed to any ML model. The below article explains converting to numeric in the case of Neural Nets. with embedding layer: https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-word-embedding-layers-deep-learning-keras/#:~:text=The%20Embedding%20layer%20is%20defined,vocabulary%20would%20be%2011%20words
