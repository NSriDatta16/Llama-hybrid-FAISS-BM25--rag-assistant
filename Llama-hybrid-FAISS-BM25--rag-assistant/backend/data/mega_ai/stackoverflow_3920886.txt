Aggravating OpenGL Texture Issue

I'm having issues trying to get a texture loaded into VRAM. I'm using OpenGL on Mac OS X. I have geometry that I've successfully renderer by passing a color into my fragment shader. However, as soon as I try to load a texture, no geometry gets rendered and I can only see the background color. Here's my texture loading code: char imageData[27] = { 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, 127, }; glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0); GLuint textureID; glGenTextures(1, &textureID); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureID); glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, 3, 3, 0, GL_RGB, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, imageData); GLint uniform_location = glGetUniformLocation(bundle->GetShaderProgramID(), "texture"); std::cout And here's my fragment shader code: uniform sampler2D texture; void main() { vec2 coord = vec2(0.5, 0.5); //gl_FragColor = vec4(coord, 0.0, 1.0); gl_FragColor = vec4(texture2D(texture, coord).rgb, 1.0); } I realize some of this code probably isn't necessary, but I've been trying everything I can think of. Thanks.
