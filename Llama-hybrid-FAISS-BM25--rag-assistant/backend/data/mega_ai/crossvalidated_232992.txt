Do estimated probabilities obtained after logistic regression sum up to the total number of observed successes?

I have a sequence of observed outcomes from independent but not identically distributed Bernoulli trials, and some covariate data. I perform logistic regression, and use it to estimate the probability of each trial succeeding. If I sum these estimates up, do they always add up to the total number of observed successes? I know that in the absence of covariate data, the MLE of the constant term is the number of successes divided by the number of trials.
