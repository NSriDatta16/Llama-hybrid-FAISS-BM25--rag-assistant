The only hope on the "free eclipse plugin" department is the revival of Eclipse Visual Editor . It is to be installed on a eclipse Galileo 3.5 with p2 manager (the provisioning mechanism) (source: canoo.com ) The ULC Visual Editor product is already built upon it for its drag-and-drop GUI designer for UltraLightClient to develop rich user interfaces for Java EE applications. ( UltraLightClient being a library to build Rich Internet Applications end-to-end in Java.)
