You can normalize and discretize the feature ranges. If you have a training dataset with scores in continuous space (e.g. BM25 retrieval scores), it can be normalized and split into multiple categories such that [0.25-0.50], [0.51-075], [0.76-1.00]. Now the minimum support and confidence can be decided by the specific distribution.
