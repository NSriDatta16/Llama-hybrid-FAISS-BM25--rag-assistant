SQLite scalability will highly depend on the data used, and their format. I've had some tough experience with extra long tables (GPS records, one record per second). Experience showed that SQLite would slow down in stages, partly due to constant rebalancing of the growing binary trees holding the indexes (and with time-stamped indexes, you just know that tree is going to get rebalanced a lot, yet it is vital to your searches). So in the end at about 1GB (very ballpark, I know), queries become sluggish in my case. Your mileage will vary. One thing to remember, despite all the bragging, SQLite is NOT made for data warehousing. There are various uses not recommended for SQLite. The fine people behind SQLite say it themselves: Another way to look at SQLite is this: SQLite is not designed to replace Oracle. It is designed to replace fopen(). And this leads to the main argument (not quantitative, sorry, but qualitative), SQLite is not for all uses, whereas MySQL can cover many varied uses, even if not ideally. For example, you could have MySQL store Firefox cookies (instead of SQLite), but you'd need that service running all the time. On the other hand, you could have a transactional website running on SQLite (as many people do) instead of MySQL, but expect a lot of downtime.
