What features should Java 7 onwards have to encourage switching from C#?

C# has a good momentum at the moment. What are the features that you would need to have in order to switch (or return) to Java? It would also be quite useful if people posted workarounds for these for the current Java versions, e.g. Nullables being wrapped around custom classes, to make this a much more interesting wiki.
