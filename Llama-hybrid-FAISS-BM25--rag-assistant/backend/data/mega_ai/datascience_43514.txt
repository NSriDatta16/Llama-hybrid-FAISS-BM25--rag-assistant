Feature engineering from date, mean and standard deviation

I have a multi class classification problem where I should predict the passengers for flights (0-7 classes). The training set consists of the following features: Date of the flight Mean of the weeks that the passengers bought their tickets Standard Deviation of the above I extracted from the date, the day of the week, the month and if the flight is in a high season. What other features could I extract from the date? How could I use the mean and standard deviation to create new features?
