I ended up creating a template (Position.chtml) for a specific sub-object Position in my model like this: @model Models.Position @{ var latitude = string.Format(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "{0:G}", Model.Latitude); var longitude = string.Format(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "{0:G}", Model.Longitude); } @Html.Hidden("Latitude", latitude) @Html.Hidden("Longitude", longitude) $(function () { attachMap($('#mapCanvas'), $('#Position_Latitude'), $('#Position_Longitude'), true); }) This way, I don't need to add any attributes to the model class. I'm wondering though... is it good practice including javascript like this? I don't know of any other way to do it (except including it in the master page, which I don't want to do as I don't need it on all pages) without having to repeat myself. I'd like to keep this DRY... Also (I might better ask a new question for this): As it is now, I have this template 2 times, once as an editor template, once as a display template. The only difference is that the last parameter to attachMap has to be true for the editor template and false for the display template. Is there an easy way to make this DRY?
