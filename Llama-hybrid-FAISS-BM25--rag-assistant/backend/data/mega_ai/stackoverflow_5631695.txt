How to import a segment of html into Excel

Requirement: 1.I need to export a table as a excel file. 2.I render it in a html page at first. I have a button to export to html. My opinion: 1.I get the html from page: document.getElementById('content').value = document.getElementById('containerId').innerHTML; form1.submit(); 2.I get it from server, response.ContentType = "application/vnd.ms-excel;" // it need the client has installed Microsoft Excel. 3.I got the right Excel file "XXXX.xls". 4.BUT BUT BUT, when I open it, it's alert a waring tell me like "it's not the right format of Excel, are you confirm to open it?" I'm feel sorry to see it. So I want to import the HTML section into a Excel file, then response the right Excel file to USER-AGENT. I have use the Aspose.Cells library in my project, I don't know how to use it to finish the task, Or is any other solution to solve it ?
