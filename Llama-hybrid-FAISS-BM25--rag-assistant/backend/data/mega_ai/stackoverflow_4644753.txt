C++ dynamic_cast - polymorphic requirement and downcasting

In the following code, while constructing obj in case 1, we construct a derived class object too, but its member functions are just inaccessible to obj . So while downcasting (i.e., in case 2), using obj as source, we have the constructed derived in it already. Why would obj need to be polymorphic? If I confused you with my above description, why doesn't obj need to be polymorphic when upcasting, but while downcasting it does need to be polymorphic while using dynamic_cast ? class base { public: base() { cout (new derived); // case 1: explicitly upcasting derived *OBJ = dynamic_cast (obj); // case 2: error
