As Zhubarb said, there is no overarching agreement on this issue. So, I'll throw in one more perspective that hasn't been covered yet. For causal DAGs, the causal structure is often considered to be encoded by the absence of arrows. Under this framework, the arrows may be causal or not, but missing arrows must be strongly believed or known to be not causal. This may not be widely applicable to Bayesian Networks, but since you started your question more generally, I think it's worth noting. Also, if you want to learn a network, it won't be able to tell you the direction of arrows, because association flows both ways along arrows. You have to make some assumptions about directionality or impose some information about temporal ordering.
