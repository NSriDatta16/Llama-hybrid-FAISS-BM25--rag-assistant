One of the best tutorials you can get on Deep Learning is the class of Prof. Nando de Freitas at Oxford Uni. which is available at https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfNandoDF . It covers all the latest deep learning architectures and even dives into Torch7 implementations (state-of-the-art tool in DL). Finally, one of the beauties of DL is that the same models can apply to a wide range of input data, so, image models can be applied in many other disciplines.
