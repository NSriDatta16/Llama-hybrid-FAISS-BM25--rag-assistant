Difficulty in identifying outliers beyond limits

I have a various files, all containing data at 1-minute interval. File structure is as follows where D/T represents Date-Time, C1 and C2 are like constants in this task. D/T AB EF C1 C2 20100101W00:01:00 112 25 1100 1910 20100101W00:02:00 121 37 1100 1911 20100101W00:03:00 119 36 1101 1912 20100101W00:04:00 115 43 1102 1901 .. .. I have lower and upper limits for columns AB, EF and MN (mentioned below) applicable for 1 minute dataset. Parameter Lower limit Upper limit AB 50 3.5*C1 EF 30 2.0*C1*C2^1.2 MN 25 2.5*C2^2.0 I have averaged 1-minute dataset to compute 30-minutes, 6 hours, daily and monthly data and for time-averaged datasets, I have considered only D/T, AB, EF and MN columns. I have not considered C1 and C2 as they are like constants, so averaging them doesn't make sense as per my task. A sample of 30-minutes averaged data is as follows: D/T AB EF 20100101W00:00:00 120 30 20100101W00:30:00 125 29 20100101W01:00:00 122 38 20100101W01:30:00 121 31 .. .. I need to identify outliers in 30-minutes average using lower and upper limits but the lower and upper limits are applicable to 1 minute data. My question is that can these limits be applicable on 30-minutes calculated averaged data also? Secondly, 30-minutes data does not contain C1 and C2 columns but the calculation of limits contain C1 and C2, then how can I apply these limits on 30-minutes data? My objective is to find out that how many records of 30-minutes average data are outside these limits.
