Getting Started With Application Lifecycle Management

I'm a lead developer in a small development shop exclusively using Microsoft based solutions. We're currently implemently small to medium sized solutions using .NET 3.5 and SQL Server 2008 as a base. We also currently use Team Server simply for source control. We have a larger project on the horizon and would like to start putting more process and structure around how we start, develop, maintain, and manage projects of this size. My question is, are there ALM solutions that we can leverage that would fit well with our toolset and what are their strength's/weaknesses in general? We currently don't do much product planning or documenting of our begining development and would really like to change all that. I've found all sorts of materials but organizing and making sense of it all is a bit overwhelming. Thanks!
