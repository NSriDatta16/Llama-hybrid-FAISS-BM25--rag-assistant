For SQL-based databases: Not taking advantage of CLUSTERED INDEXES or choosing the wrong column(s) to CLUSTER. Not using a SERIAL (autonumber) datatype as a PRIMARY KEY to join to a FOREIGN KEY (INT) in a parent/child table relationship. Not UPDATING STATISTICS on a table when many records have been INSERTED or DELETED. Not reorganizing (i.e. unloading, droping, re-creating, loading and re-indexing) tables when many rows have been inserted or deleted (some engines physically keep deleted rows in a table with a delete flag.) Not taking advantage of FRAGMENT ON EXPRESSION (if supported) on large tables which have high transaction rates. Choosing the wrong datatype for a column! Not choosing a proper column name. Not adding new columns at the end of the table. Not creating proper indexes to support frequently used queries. creating indexes on columns with few possible values and creating unnecessary indexes. ...more to be added.
