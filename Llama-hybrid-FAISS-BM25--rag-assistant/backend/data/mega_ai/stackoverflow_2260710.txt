Creating a Reverse Proxy using Jpcap

I need to create a program that receives HTTP request and forwards those requests to the web servers. Diagram http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/1862/h98trsly.jpg I have successfully made this using only Java Sockets but the client needed the program to be implemented in Jpcap. I'd like to know if this is possible and what literature I should be reading for this project. This is what I have now by stitching together pieces from the Jpcap tutorial: import java.net.InetAddress; import java.io.*; import jpcap.*; import jpcap.packet.*; public class Router { public static void main(String args[]) { //Obtain the list of network interfaces NetworkInterface[] devices = JpcapCaptor.getDeviceList(); //for each network interface for (int i = 0; i Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
