Turns out the tool does not support XPath 2.0. XPath 1.0 doesn't have the fancy min() and max() functions, so to find these values we need to be a little tricky with the XPath logic, and compare the values on the siblings of the node: Maximum: /foo/bar[not(preceding-sibling::bar/@score >= @score) and not(following-sibling::bar/@score > @score)]/@score Minimum: /foo/bar[not(preceding-sibling::bar/@score If embedding these queries in XML files like XSLT or ant scripts, remember to encode and > as &lt; respecting &gt; .
