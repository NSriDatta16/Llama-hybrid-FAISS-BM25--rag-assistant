Use .insertBefore() instead, like this: function makeRotatable($clone) { $(' ').slider({ orientation: "vertical", range: "min", min: 0, max: 100, value: 60, slide: function( event, ui ) { $( "#amount" ).val( ui.value ); } }).insertBefore($clone); } .insertBefore() returns the element before it as well, but it'll be the span in this case, which is what you're after. Also note that calling it after .slider() is a bit more efficient, since the plugin will work more quickly on a document fragment as it inserts elements.
