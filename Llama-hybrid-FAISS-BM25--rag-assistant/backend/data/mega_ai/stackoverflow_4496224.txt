iPhone Best practices for large number of animations using UIImageView

Just requesting a little advice animating images on the iphone. I'm building an app that consists of a character with 5 animations. Each animation consists of roughly 50 images with an average duration of 3 seconds. I was going to create an array of images for each animation, have these as the source for an UIImageView and switch these as needed. But as you can guess this approach kills my iphone's memory and thus the app. (250 images @ 130K each!) So this got me wondering how other people get around this? Maybe change the animations to movies? Thanks for any advice.
