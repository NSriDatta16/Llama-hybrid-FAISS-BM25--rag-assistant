This has been researched for 20 years or so, and there are many papers claiming to outperform backpropagation. Xin Yao did a lot of work on this in the 1990s, and Kenneth Stanley created one of the currently most active frameworks, NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (see http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html and http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/neat/ ). There's a lot of published material on different neuroevolutionary techniques, but these references may be useful in getting a feel for progress over the years: Azzini, A., Tettamanzi, A. (2008) 'Evolving Neural Networks for Static Single-Position Automated Trading', Journal of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Evolution and Applications, Volume 2008, Article ID 184286 Hintz, K.J., Spofford, J.J.
