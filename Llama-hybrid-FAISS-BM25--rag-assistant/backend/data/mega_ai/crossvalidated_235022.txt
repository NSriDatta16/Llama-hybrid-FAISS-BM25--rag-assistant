This question is related to: Interpretation of plot(glm.model) , which it may benefit you to read. Regarding your specific questions: What constitutes a predicted value in logistic regression is a tricky subject. That's because the prediction can be made on several different scales. I think the most intuitive predicted value is the fitted probability of 'success' for the given observation. However, you could also use the fitted odds , or the fitted log odds . The fitted model equation / coefficients that is returned by statistical software will be on the scale of the linear predictor, that is, on the log odds scale. As a result, the fitted log odds of 'success' is typically used as the default. In R , for example, ?predict.glm will default to type="link" (the log odds); since your predicted values extend below $0$, it is clear that the log odds of success is what is being plotted. Here are some additional resources that might help you: Interpretation of simple predictions to odds ratios in logistic regression Likewise, what constitutes a residual in logistic regression is even more tricky. There are lots of ways to compute residuals for a generalized linear model. In my opinion, the most intuitive residual would be the raw residual ($r_i = y_i - \hat y_i$), but they are actually hard to use, so you may well never see them. By default, ?residuals.glm defaults to type="deviance" . Deviance residuals reflect a datum's contribution to the model's total deviance. Deviance residuals (and some other common types) are briefly discussed in the lecture notes for Germán Rodríguez's GLM class. Suggested reading: What do the residuals in a logistic regression mean? I have argued, in my answer to the thread linked at the top, that it is best not to use these to examine a fitted logistic regression model. Further reading: Diagnostics for logistic regression?
