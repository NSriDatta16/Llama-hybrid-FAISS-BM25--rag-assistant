Thread.Interrupt() just sends an interrupt (signal / exception) to the target thread; it doesn't kill it immediately. Also, there can be a delay between when you send the interrupt and when it is received and processed by the target thread; context switches are not guaranteed to be immediate. You can encourage (but not force) the JVM to context switch more quickly by either doing some form of blocking operation (such as I/O or a sleep), or by calling Thread.yield().
