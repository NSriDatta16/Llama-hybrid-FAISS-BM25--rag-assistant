What does symmetry mean when plotting Real vs Imaginary Components of FFT of a Periodic Time Series

As the subject says, What does the symmetry mean when graphing real vs imaginary components of a FFT? And does the clustering imply periodicity in the data? I ask this because I did a project with predicting sunspot count with a neural network and had to find the periodicity of the data (and used FFT which worked). Someone recommended I look at graphing the real vs imaginary components, but I don't understand what I am looking at.
