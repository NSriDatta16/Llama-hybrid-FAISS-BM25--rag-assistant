machine learning models for identifying the functional transformations between two numerical sequences

In the practice, there is a problem where the input can be a continuous line, like waveform, the output is also a continuous line, i.e., another waveform. In the sampling space, I can get 100 samples from waveform in the original continuous space. In other words, the problem can be transformed into finding the mapping function between a numerical sequence and another numerical sequence. For instance, the input sequence is [-4.1288461e-16 -2.2452528e-15 -1.1717652e-14 -5.8685417e-14 -2.8203791e-13 -1.3006001e-12] , the output sequence is [1.2080356e-01 0.0000000e+00 0.0000000e+00 0.0000000e+00 0.0000000e+00 0.0000000e+00 ] In practice, we can have thousands of this kind of input-output pairs for training purposes. In the machine learning field, are there any specific models aiming to solve this kind of problem. My feeling is that neural network maybe a fit, but what kind of architecture is a better option. Here, the output is not a categorical variables usually for classification problems.
