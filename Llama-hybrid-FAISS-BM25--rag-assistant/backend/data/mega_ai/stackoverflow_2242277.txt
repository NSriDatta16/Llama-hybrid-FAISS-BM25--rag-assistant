Starting with Javascript - framework?

I don't know much Javascript - just little of core language, but that can be learnd - no problem. I want to get started writing simple demo animations/games with canvas. What I'm not sure about is correct ways of embedding Javascript in pages to make resonably cross-browser (say without IE). Should I just start with vanilla JS or use some framework like JQuery from start which can help me shorter code and cross-browser? Or will starting with framework will make me understand less details of JS itself?
