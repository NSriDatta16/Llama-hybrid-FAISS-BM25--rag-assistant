Having access to the data and code for the analysis in an easy-to-execute form is a sine qua non of reproducible research. Once you verify that the analysis works, you can substitute your own code/data where you are skeptical of the original author's. I'd say that the majority of statistics-containing papers I read have at least one part of the methodology that is left vague. My attempts to reproduce these analyses are often unsuccessful (and always time-consuming), but it is very difficult to say whether this is because of fraud, human error, or (much more likely) my resolving these ambiguities differently than the author. So, having data+code for a paper does not guarantee that its conclusions are true, but it makes it much easier to critique or extend them. Also, "reproducible research" a matter of degree. So the reproducible research movement can be seen as encouraging research that is "more reproducible" than the norm, rather than demanding that research meet some minimum threshold. I'd guess that "release the data and code" is in vogue now because it is a relatively easy and non-threatening step.
