Displaying a string while using cond in Lisp

I'm just starting off with Lisp and need some help. This is technically homework, but I gave it a try and am getting somewhat what I wanted: (defun speed (kmp) (cond ((> kmp 100) "Fast") (( However, if I run the program it displays "Average" instead of just Average (without the quotes). How can I get it to display the string without quotes?
