The functional programming technique currying is named after its (re)-inventor, Haskell Curry . Boolean logic is named after George Boole Duff's device is pretty famous and seems to me to qualify as technique/idiom. I used to do a " Carmack " which was referring to the " fast inverse square root " but according to the Wikipedia entry the technique was probably found by the smarties at SGI in 1990 or so. Even if it doesn't fit your description, it's still a pretty amazing read :) Kleene closure : it's the * operator in regular expressions. It means "0 or more of what precedes it". At one point in time, the Karnaugh Map could have been considered a technique to facilitate programming (albeit at a low level). Markov Chains are named after Andrey Markov and used in programming to generate: Google PageRank Generating Spam-Mail Texts Mnemonic Codewords to replace IDs/Hashvalues The graphics world is full of eponymous techniques: Bresenham's line algorithm BÃ©zier curve Gouraud shading Phong shading Fisher-Yates shuffle , the standard way to implement an in-place random shuffle on an array.
