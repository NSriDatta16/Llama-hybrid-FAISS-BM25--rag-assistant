Ensemble learning timeseries: Standard K-fold cross-validation ok for final step?

I have used 5 different classification models to predict future price direction (up or down) using caret's timeslice for each model type. I now want to put all the models predicted probabilities together into a decision tree (XGboost, etc) to enhance my predictions. Must I also use the timeslice rolling cross validation for the decision tree, or is the standard k-fold cross validation okay for this final step?
