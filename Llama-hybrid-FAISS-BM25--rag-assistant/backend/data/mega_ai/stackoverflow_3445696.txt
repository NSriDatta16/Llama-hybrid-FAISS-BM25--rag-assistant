gradle - how to declare a dependency of a jar in a jar

Using gradle, I am consuming a build from an archiva repository. One of the jars ( javax.jms_1.1.0.200810061358.jar ) has the following content: about.html about_files LICENSE.txt jms.jar META-INF MANIFEST.MF The jar I need is actually the jms.jar inside this javax.jms_1.1.0.200810061358.jar The only way I've been able to consume this jar is by pulling jms.jar out of the repository's javax.jms_1.1.0.200810081358.jar and saving it to the file system and consuming it via: repositories { flatDir: my_dir_with_jms.jar_in_it} someone on the gradle list suggested using an Ivy packager resolver. I looked at this link and was left very confused. I do have other ivy resolvers set up like this: addIvyPattern 'http://archivaserver:8080/archiva/repository/osgi-internal/[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/ivy_[revision].xml' addArtifactPattern "http://archivaserver:8080/archiva/repository/osgi-official/[organisation]/[organisation]/[module]_[revision](-[classifier]).[ext]" Anyone know of a good solution to this?
