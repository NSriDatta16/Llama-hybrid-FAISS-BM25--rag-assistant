Only the data knows for sure what a useful model might be, The ACF and PACF can suggest non-stationarity but they do not disclose the latent cause of the non-stationarity as they are purely descriptive. This caveat is often overlooked in the first few courses in time series analysis. Often the presence of anomalies or level/step shifts or deterministic trends masks or confuses the identification of the underlying model. I suggest you post your actual data and I will use a "robot" to suggest an appropriate model. EDIT AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA : The robot ( actually AUTOBOX in an automatic mode ) developed the following useful equation . Essentially a difference operator (.906 is nearly 1.0) and two intercept changes . The residuals from the model are reasonably random . The Actual vs Cleansed (adjusted) plot is here . Actual,Fit and Forecast is here . In summary after adjusting for the two downwards level shifts ( intercept changes) the process is simply a random walk.
