This is in no way the worlds most elegant solution, and it also assumes that the ending string is always going to be a smaller size than the original, oh and I hardcoded the conversions, but hopefully it points you more or less in the right direction or gives you an idea to jump off from: char* replace( char *string ) { char *aaa = NULL; char *bbb = NULL; char *buffer = malloc( strlen( string ) ); int length = 0; aaa = strstr( string, "aaa" ); bbb = strstr( string, "bbb" ); while ( aaa || bbb ) { if ( aaa && (bbb || aaa Disclaimer, I didn't even test this, but it should be at least semi in the direction of what you want.
