In which cases are non-linear learning methods preferred than logistic regression in classification problems?

We know that neural networks and other learning methods can have better performance relative to logistic regression in some non-linear classification problems. But, it is known too that logistic regression can separate classes with a line that can be curvy if only we add more predictors that are a square, cube, etc of the given predictors (still considered a linear decision boundary). So my question is, can we theoretically solve any classification problem through logistic regression, or are there limitations that I do not realize that make other non-linear learning methods mandatory to certain classification problems?
