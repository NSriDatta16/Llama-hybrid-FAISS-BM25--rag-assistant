Calculating the price elasticity and income elasticity of demand

The demand function for air travel between the U.S. and Europe has been estimated to be $$\ln Q = 2.737 - 1.247 \ln P +1.905 \ln I$$ where $Q$ denotes number of passengers (in thousands) per year, $P$ the (average) ticket price and $I$ the U.S. national income. Determine the price elasticity and income elasticity of demand.
