two things come to mind ... 1. if a series is non-stationary this may be remedied by suitable differencing or suitable de-meaning see What "more" does differencing (d>0) do in ARIMA than detrend? for more . Unwarranted differencing can unfortunately inject structure. If you multiply (scale) your data by 100 ..the problem vanishes. Note that the classic time series example was the airline series which is in integers. https://autobox.com/cms/index.php/blog/entry/u-didnt-need-logs details the data set. The real problem has nothing to do with integers BUT all to do with low count discrete data e.g. 1.1.2.1.0.2.1.0.0.1.0.1.0.1 having just three different values. I have found that if there are more than 7-8 kinds of values ARIMA model identification can be useful but that's just a "rule of thumb" . We then take the forecast and integerize it so as to have it compatible with the observed data.
