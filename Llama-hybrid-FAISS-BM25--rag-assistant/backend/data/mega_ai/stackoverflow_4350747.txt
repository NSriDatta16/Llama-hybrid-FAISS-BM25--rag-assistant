Welcome to the wacky world of CSS, where there is rarely a logical solution for simple problems. In this case there are a couple reasons why your border ain't tight. First is simple, you are explicitly setting the width of div.friendsbox with an inline style. Remove that. Now if you just do that, the containing div that you want a border on will simply stretch to fill the entire width that is available. Here is where it gets tricky, to get the div to only be as wide as its contents (assuming page width > div contents) you must set it to float . So... div.items div { float: left; border: solid 1px red; } At this point you'll have a nice red border around your images, however you'd notice that the border extends below the images a small amount. The problem here is, well I think at least, that img elements are inline by default, which means they are treated like text, which means that extra padding is automatically added by the browser in somewhat unpredictable and not easily controlable ways. So the best solution I came up with was to also float each img element: div.items img { float: left; } Done? Of course not...you see there's one more issue. That box with the grey border is now collapsed, apparently ignorant of all those boxing guys inside of it. This is a CSS quirk, and can be fixed with a trailing element that has a clear style set: span.clear { clear: both; display: block; } And in your markup you'd need to add after the closing tag for the div containing the pictures.
