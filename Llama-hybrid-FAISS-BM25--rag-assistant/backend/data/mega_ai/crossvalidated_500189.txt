What is the effect of PCA on the Error?

I am fitting an ElasticNet model using an array of values for alpha and l1_ratio. I then plot the result of the negative root mean squared error from cross validation in a heatmap, which gives me the best values for these parameters. As you can see, the results are different with and without applying the PCA. This is an unexpected behaviour as I am not reducing the dimension of Xtrain applying PCA. Can you help me understand this strange behaviour or where I've gone wrong? Thanks!
