IMO, the following two tests are a good start: 1) A regression of the test outcomes on the predicted probabilities. If your predictions are correct on average ("calibrated"), the fit of this regression should be the 45Â° line. 2) Two separate histograms of the predicted probabilities: One for the test cases with y = 1, and one for the test cases with y = 0. If your model's predictions are sharp, the two histograms should differ a lot, with the former histogram focussing on high predicted probabilities and the latter focussing on low probabilities. For more stuff along these lines, see Chapter 3 of http://www.albany.edu/economics/research/workingp/2012/lahiriyang.pdf
