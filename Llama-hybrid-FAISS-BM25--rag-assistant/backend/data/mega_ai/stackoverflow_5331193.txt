Executing 32bit and 64bit mshta.exe (bypass default handler)

I'd like to be able to launch a page.hta in 32bit and 64bit versions of the mshta.exe. Create the file c:\page.hta Test Page var elem = [ "UserAgent="+window.navigator.userAgent, "Platform="+window.navigator.platform ]; var taBegin = " "; var taEnd = " "; document.write(taBegin+elem.join("\n")+taEnd); Now here is the batch file to attemp to load the page differently. @echo off rem Launch 32bit c:\Windows\SysWOW64\mshta.exe c:\page.hta rem Launch 64bit c:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe c:\page.hta Another interesting thing, try changing the default handler to notepad for .hta files. If you execute the previous commands, and it launches notepad. It appears that mshta has some logic that only launches the .hta via the default handler. Whatever command is specified as the default handler is used.
