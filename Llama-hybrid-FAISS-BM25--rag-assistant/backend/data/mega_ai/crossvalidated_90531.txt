Comparing estimators of location of the Cauchy distribution

I'm comparing the following 4 estimators of location of the Cauchy distribution: Let $x_{1},..x_{n}$ be observations and $l$ be the log likelihood function. $x=median(x_{1},..x_{n})$, $y=x+\frac{l'(x)}{n/2}$, $z=mean(x_{1},..x_{n})$ and $s=MLE$ I did simulations in R of the mean squared error and probability coverages. I found that the mean was a very bad estimator. The best estimator was $y$ in terms of giving the smallest MSE and the greatest probability coverage. $x$ and $z$ were pretty good estimators as well and in fact when I increased $n$ large enough $x$ and $s$ gave the same results. I know the reason $x$ is a bad estimator. What are the mathematical reasons for my other findings? Thanks
