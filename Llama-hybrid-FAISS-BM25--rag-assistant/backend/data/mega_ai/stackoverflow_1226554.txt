What is the best way to show different form fields for different users in ASP.NET?

What is the best way to show different form fields for different user in ASP.NET? Here is an example: I have a form which has TextBox1, TextBox2, and TextBox3. User A can only see TextBox1 and TextBox3. User B can only see TextBox2 and TextBox3. ... If there are a lot of users or form fields. It will be too tedious to code all the logic. Is there any elegant way to achieve this without hand-coded logic?
