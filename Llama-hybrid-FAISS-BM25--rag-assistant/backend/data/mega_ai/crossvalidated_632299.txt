No ... probably a selection bias? I assume you make additional assumptions about what a time series is . A timeseries is a dataset, where time is an additional variable. You can draw $N$ random numbers that have no autocorrelation (loop, lottery, ...). Now you add a timestamp to it of when they were drawn. You've got a "timeseries" with no autocorrelation. Good examples are repeated experiments that have the same initial state in a lab. Technically, you can put on a timestamp and call it a "timeseries", but it doesn't add anything. Selection bias As mentioned in other answers, it's all about the (auto)correlation of states. If you look at timeseries, they are very often correlated because you only take the time into account if there is a meaningful correlation to be expected . That's why "most" timeseries that are used as such have a correlation.
