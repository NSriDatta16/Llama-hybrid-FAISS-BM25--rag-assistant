Propensity score matching with multiple treatments

Is anyone aware of propensity score matching methods for when there are more than 2 treatment groups? I am working on a project with 4 treatment groups: A B A and B Neither A nor B Calculating propensity scores using multinomial logistic regression might work, but then I'd get multiple scores for each observation so I'm not sure how I'd match/analyze the matched data.
