Correct Redirected HTTP GET retrieval

I'd like to know how to do a HTTP GET request to a server from which I know I will get redirected at least a couple of times... I'd like to get the response (body) of the "last" webpage. It should come up with a code in my specific example... Or, as an alternative, I do know you can start the browser from within your Android app, is it possible to actually retrieve the body from that ? Any help, tips, source whatever would be helpfull, cause till now I have found (and tried) like 4 methods and to me it seems there is a jungle of HttpGet, HttpClient, HttpResponse etc libraries ?
