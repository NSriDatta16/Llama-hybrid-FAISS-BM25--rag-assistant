There's absolutely no reason you need to deal with storing credit card data on your servers if all you want to do is accept credit cards. Lots of folks that have never implemented a non Paypal/Google Checkout system will try to scare you with talk of it being a terribly huge task, but your code just needs to take an encrypted CC from the client and pass it to the gateway. It never needs to live in your DB and your risk is minimized because of it. I'd say the line between using Paypal buttons and using a gateway is simply a choice of if you want the customer to check out on your site or on someone else's. That's it. It's not that much more risk, since all you need to do is buy an SSL cert and use a reputable cart system like Magento, Ubercart for Drupal, etc. There will always be effort involved.
