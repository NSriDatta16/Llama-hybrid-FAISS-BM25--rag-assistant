How can I continue training a neural net in R?

I have data set that is up-dated every month. I've already trained a neural network on a development sample and validated it. For the building process I used R's nnet package. I also tried neuralnet. I am happy with the model. However every month I will get an up-dated dataset. How can I continue to train the existing network using either of those packages? Thank you very much in advance, N
