The main word is "quantile". A common example of this is "percentile". For the specific case, "decile" (one-tenth of the distribution) or "quintile" (one-fifth of the distribtuion) might be appropriate. Another commonly used quantile is "quartile" (one-fourth). You could then say something like "Decile 1 being the 10% most difficult questions and decile 10 being the 10% easiest questions ..." and then carry on with statements like "in decile 3 (description) ..." E.g.: decile 1: 20% below average overall grade; decile 2: 15% below average overall grade ... decile 10: 10% above average overall grade
