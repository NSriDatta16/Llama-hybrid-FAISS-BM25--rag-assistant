How do we ensure that a model generalize well in the real world

When we have trained a model on a training data set as well as the test set, how can we ensure that a model will generalize in the real world.I mean both the test set and the training set are a very small subset compared to what exist in the real world and there might be inherent bias in the datasets as well. As a beginner in machine learning , it will help me and others a lot if you share the techniques to avoid the common pitfalls
