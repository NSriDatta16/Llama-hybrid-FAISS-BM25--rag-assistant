Why do we need to take the transpose of the data for PCA?

I have the following dataset: we measured the temperature 1000 times in 9 different stations across the country. The data are represented in a matrix with 9 rows and 1000 columns. I wrote my own implementation of PCA and I have to reduce the dimensionality to 3. I did it and it works but I do not understand some things. First of all some terminology. On wikipedia I read that the terms variable and observation are usually used. In my case, the observations would be the values of temperature and the variables the 9 stations? Why do I have to take the transpose of the matrix, obtaining a $1000\times 9$ matrix, before doing the PCA? Basically what I need to do is to try to keep the information of the original dataset by just using the temperature values of $3$ out of $9$ stations?
