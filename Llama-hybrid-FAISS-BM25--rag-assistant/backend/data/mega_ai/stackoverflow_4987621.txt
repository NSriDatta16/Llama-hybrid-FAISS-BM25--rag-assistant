I need advice on how to best handle an e-commerce situation

I recently moved to Brazil and started a small subscription based service company. The payment gateway market is under-developed in Brazil, and implementing a local solution is too expensive for me. My requirements are a payment gateway that will automatically process monthly recurrent billing, and that will allow me to manually charge my customers when needed. They would also have to deal with storage and security. I'm leaning towards manually processing payments myself as a restaurant would do, for example, using small swipe machines. Unfortunately, this would require me to store credit card information and I would rather not, but I feel it's my only option. Can anyone give me advice on how to tackle this problem? What are my options? Is my idea a good idea, or a terrible idea? If I decide to store credit card information, what should I keep in mind and how should I go about it?
