Are you interested in counting the executable lines rather than the total file line count? If so you could try a code coverage tool such as EclEmma . As a side effect of the code coverage stats you get stats on the number of executable lines and blocks (and methods and classes). These are rolled up from the method level upwards, so you can see line counts for the packages, source roots and projects as well.
