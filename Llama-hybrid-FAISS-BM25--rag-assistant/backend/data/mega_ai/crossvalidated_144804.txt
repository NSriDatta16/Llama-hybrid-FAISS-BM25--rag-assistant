"Export" machine learning model from R

I can build and implement classic ML models on traditional training/test sets in R, but what if a partner wants to get this model in order to implement his own (any kind of) system? Saving and sending the R-model structure doesn't help, of course; and figuring out the prediction mechanism doesn't work in many (black box) cases neither. So how to generalize and utilize the model's learned rules?
