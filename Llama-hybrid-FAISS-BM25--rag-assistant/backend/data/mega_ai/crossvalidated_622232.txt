Binary data correlation with many variables

I'm struggling with something that at first sight seemed simple to me but turned out no to be. I have a big df (112 samples x 58 characteristics), these characteristics are all binary (presence/absence, yes/no) coded as 1/0. Here's a random example: condition I would like to see if there is some sort of correlation between condition_0 or condition_1 and any of the analysed characteristics. I've thought of generating a proportion table and using a Chisq: prop but I'm getting X-squared = NaN (with the real dataset, the example here gives an actual output). So I'm thinking this is not the right approach. I've also tried a logistic regression but the model doesn't converge and it also seems somewhat odd. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve this? I'll be happy with just a method name. Many many thanks!
