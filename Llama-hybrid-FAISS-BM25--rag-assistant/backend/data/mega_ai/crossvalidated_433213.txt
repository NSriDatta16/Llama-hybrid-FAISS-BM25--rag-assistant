Function of Feature Transformation using PCA

I completely understood the math behind PCA. I have a doubt here while calculating the function that will do the transformation. According to the book : Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville : But when we do Transformation, We go for T = XD instead of above. How both of these are similar. I am confused :(
