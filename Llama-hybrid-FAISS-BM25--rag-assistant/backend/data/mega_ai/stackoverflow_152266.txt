We have one gigantic solution on the source control, on the main branch. But, every developer/team working on the smaller part of the project, has its own branch which contains one solution with only few projects which are needed. In that way, that solution is small enough to be easily maintenaced, and do not influence on the other projects/dlls in the larger solution. However, there is one condition for this: there shouldn't be too much interconnected projects within solution.
