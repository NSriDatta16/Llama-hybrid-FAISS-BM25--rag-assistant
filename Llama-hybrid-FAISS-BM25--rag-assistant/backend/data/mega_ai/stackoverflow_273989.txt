I've never used it myself... as it says in your link: Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303 status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the 302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react to a 302 response as described here for 303. This seems a good enough reason to me to stick with 302. FYI header() takes extra parameters in which you can set the status code: header('Location: /foo.php', true, 303);
