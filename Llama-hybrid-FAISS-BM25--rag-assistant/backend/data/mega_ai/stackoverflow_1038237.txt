Using a regex basically means embedding a tiny program, written in a different programming language, in the middle of your program. I'll ignore the inefficiency of using a regex over native string manipulation, because it probably isn't relevant in most cases. I prefer native text manipulation over regex any time native text manipulation will be easier to follow for other people. Which is true quite frequently, since plenty of the people around me are not strongly familiar with regex. Unless working with something that is very much about parsing (via regex) they should not need to be! Regular expressions are usually slower, less readable, and harder to debug than native string manipulation. The main case where I'll prefer regex over string manipulation is when I want to be able to have different ways to parse strings dependning on the source, and the types of sources will increase over time. Native string manipulation is not really practical in this case. I've had cases where I've stuck a regex column in a database...
