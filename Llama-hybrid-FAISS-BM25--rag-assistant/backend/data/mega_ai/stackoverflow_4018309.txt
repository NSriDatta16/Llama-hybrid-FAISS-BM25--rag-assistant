Best way to display a large amount of text?

I currently have a list and would like to display a large amount of text once a list item has been clicked. The amount of text will vary depending on the list item that's been clicked, ranging anything from a paragraph to a number of paragraphs. I'm still very much an Android noob, so any tutorials that you know of that relate to your answer would be most appreciated. Thank you.
