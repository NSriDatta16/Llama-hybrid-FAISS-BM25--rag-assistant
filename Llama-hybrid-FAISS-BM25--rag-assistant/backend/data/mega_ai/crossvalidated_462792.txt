Bayes Theorem: How to get an intuition for it?

I have taken a handful of statistics/ data science-oriented courses. And to this day, I feel like I grasp the underlying concept but I do not comprehend the in-depth understanding. I am asking this because it's been more of a formulaic relationship, and since it is so applicable and important, I was wondering if anybody had any readings or mental breakthroughs to what Bayes Theorem is!
