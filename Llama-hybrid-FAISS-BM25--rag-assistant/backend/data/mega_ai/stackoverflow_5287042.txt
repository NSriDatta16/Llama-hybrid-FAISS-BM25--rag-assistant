Netbeans JApplet Webstart - icons not appearing on button when run

Hey there - just wondering if anyone knows the trick to getting icons to display on button in a JApplet. When I add the icon from a png in my package via the properties panel it turns up in the NetBeans IDE as expected but when I run the launch file it isn't there. I can confirm that the file exists in my Jar and no exceptions seem to be thrown in relation to missing files. If I create a similar application using a JForm and run it directly from NetBeans the icon appears as expected. EDIT: It seems this is confined to Chrome... works correctly in IE9 and FF 3.6 EDIT: Replicate as follows - no coding required: Create a NetBeans 6.9.1 Project with the following settings: Java --> JavaApplication [Next>] Name e.g. JavaApplication1 Untick "Create Main Class" [Finish] Add a png image "MyIcon" to the src directory. Right Click "JavaApplication1" Project in Projects panel and select New -> JApplet Form [Finish] Drag a button onto the form, right click -> properties -> icon and choose "MyIcon" from the pre-populated dropdown menu. You should see the icon appear on the button in the IDE. Build the project, then navigate via explorer to the dist/launch.html file and run it in Firefox or IE and the icon will be there, run it an Chrome 10 and it won't.
