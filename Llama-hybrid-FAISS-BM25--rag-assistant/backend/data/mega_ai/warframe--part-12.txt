fter long-term gameplay. In Duviri, the player is mostly restricted to using the Drifter, with Warframes being available with certain upgrades as well as in a location called the 'Undercroft'. The Drifter's gameplay is similar to that of The New War, with the added ability to summon a 'Kaithe', a horse-like creature, and a guiding hand to reveal nearby objectives, as well as use one of six melee weapons. The player is granted the opportunity to play out the tale of one of the five royal courtiers of the kingdom of Duviri, and complete six main objectives as the courtier slowly loses control over their respective emotion. After completing these, the courtier and their uncontrolled emotions turn into a dragon, which the player must defeat and pacify. The main gamemode, 'The Duviri Experience', allows the player to play through the tale as well as complete side-objectives, while the gamemode 'The Lone Story' excludes these side-objectives, allowing the player to focus on the story. The third gamemode, 'The Circuit', has the player fight as the Warframe against waves of enemies in the Undercroft, in exchange for unique rewards such as Warframe parts or 'Incarnon' upgrades for existing weapons. Duviri also features lost fragments telling of Duviri's background lore, as well as a vendor, Acrithis, who sells Origin System resources and upgrades, decorations, and more in exchange for resources found throughout the landscape. Duviri's appearance, behavior, and its featured tale and courtier cycles every two hours in the order of Joy, Anger, Envy, Sorrow, and Fear. Whispers in the Walls The Whispers in the Walls expansion was released on December 12, 2023. It explores the escalating threat of a mysterious cosmic entity called the Man in the Wall, and the methods Orokin scientist Albrecht Entrati has taken in order to subdue it. The update added a new enemy faction to the game, The Murmur, along with a boss within that faction named 'The Fragmented One'. The update also added multiple new gamemodes, 'Alchemy', where players use pickups from defeated enemies to fuel a crucible and 'Netracells', a gamemode with much higher enemy levels where players are tasked with killing enemies within a small zone. These mission types both reward players with many new modifications for their melee weapons. With the update's release, cross-platform save began to rollout to different groups of players in waves, with it being fully available to all players as of January 17, 2024. Jade Shadows The Jade Shadows expansion was released in June 2024 with another cinematic quest, focusing on the Stalker, an "Assassin" enemy that had served as a secondary antagonist to the Tenno and as Hunhow's enforcer. This update would heavily simplify the damage system. Instead of all enemy units possessing unique resistances and vulnerabilities separate from their overall faction, all units in a faction will share the same weaknesses. Enemy armor values were also modified, as prior to the update, enemy armor could negate a majority of incoming damage, which necessitated a focus on completely removing the enemy's armor (otherwise known as "armor-stripping"). After the update, enemy armor had a hard cap of 90% damage resistance and would not increase in Steel Path missions, allowing partial armor-stripping (removing only a portion of enemy armor) would be more effective. Some status effects would also be altered as to increase their overall effectiveness. The Lotus Eaters The Lotus Eaters expansion was released in August, 2024, and is primarily a prologue to 1999. Koumei & The Five Fates Koumei & The Five Fates was an update released on October 2, 2024. It had a Japanese theme and included a new Warframe, along with quality of life improvements. 1999 The 1999 expansion, also titled 'Warframe: 1999', was released on December 13, 2024. It is centered around an alternate history 1999 and the Protoframes - individuals that are precursors to certain present-day Warframes. Players i
