Highly likely reasons for ineffectiveness of logistic regression (accuracy is always 0.5)

I am doing cats-vs-dogs competition. So it's binary classification. I randomly pick pictures (i.g. N=7000), resize them to 100x100 and convert to greyscale. Then I use SGDClissifier with loss='log' (logistic regression). But test accuracy always shows approximately 0.5 (+-0.03). It seems like this method does not work. I could always predict [1, ..., 1] and it would have the same accuracy 0.5. I tried LogisticRegression class which is similar to SGDClissifier with loss='log', tried to tune eta0, max_iter, scaling features, shuffle, change N and nothing helped. I think maybe logistic regression cannot solve this type of problem. Or maybe logistic regression prone to be ineffective to something that I use. But I can't find the reason.
