I believe you should define your context in META-INF/context.xml, not META-INF/web.xml (though this may just be a typo in your original post). When you said you moved your code to a Struts application, could you be more specific? Do you mean you are doing your context look up in an Action class now? Also, you may know this already, but while defining your context (JNDI entries etc) in your web apps META-INF/context.xml is acceptable in a developer's environment, I highly discourage using it in any form of shared environments, and certainly not in a production environment.
