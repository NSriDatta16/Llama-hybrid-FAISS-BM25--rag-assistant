You can browse the samples app there : http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/index.html Or you can use the Android Eclipse Plugin that offers a graphical editor for the AndroidManifest.xml file. With this plugin, it's easy to import those samples into your workspace which can be handier to browse through. Just follow the explanations on the previous link. HTH, -- Hubert
