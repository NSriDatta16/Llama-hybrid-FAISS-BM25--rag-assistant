Does L2-SVM involve always using the squared hinge loss?

Im trying to understand the math behind the L1 and L2 SVM but Im kind of confused at this point : in the following picture we see that the regularization term is squared for the L2-SVM. Does that mean that the loss will be squared hinge instaad of the standard hinge ?
