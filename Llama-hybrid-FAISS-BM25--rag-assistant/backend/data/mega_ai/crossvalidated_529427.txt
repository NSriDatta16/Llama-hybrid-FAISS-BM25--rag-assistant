Should outlier detected before or after train test split

Outliers are usually first detected using Boxplot, then the suspicious observations may be sent to experts for justification - justify whether they are true outliers (contaminated data) or leverage points. Suppose I need to perform model selection in a cross validation fashion. Should the outlier detection and justification done before or after data split? If it should be done within cross validation, does it mean that in each round of cross-validation, I need to ask the experts to justify the outliers?
