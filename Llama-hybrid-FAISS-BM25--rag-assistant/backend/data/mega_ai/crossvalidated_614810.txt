If your model specifies some change in the distribution (e.g. a level shift) at the time of the interruption and perhaps following it, you know the series is nonstationary. A more relevant question may be how to account for such changes when testing for stationarity or presence of unit roots (the hypothesis being that aside from the interruption, the series is stationary or has a unit root). There are some versions of the ADF and perhaps other tests that allow for specific changes such as level shifts. Also note that your time series are fairly short (36, 24 or 12 observations), so the tests will tend to have low power. You will thus only be able to detect very pronounced violations of the null hypothesis.
