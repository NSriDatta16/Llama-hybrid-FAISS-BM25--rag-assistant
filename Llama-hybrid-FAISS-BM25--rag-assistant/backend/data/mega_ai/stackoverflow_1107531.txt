Built-in storage unit conversions utilty in Java?

there doesn't seem to be an existing util class for converting a storage unit from one to another in Java, am I right? Or is there one actually I wasn't aware of? What I was looking for is something like java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit utility. I can implement the equivalent for storage unit by myself, but just thought I would ask first before reinventing the wheel. Thanks.
