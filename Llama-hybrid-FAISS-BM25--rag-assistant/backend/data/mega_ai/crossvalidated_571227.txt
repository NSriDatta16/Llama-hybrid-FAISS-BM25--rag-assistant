Inflated or not inflated: true zero dilemma in GLMM

I have the models with overdispersion and almost 40% of the data set are true zeros with biological meaning. I'd like to study the temperature ( temp ) and time storage in days ( storage ) influence on the insect's development ( development ), but the storage is temporally correlated. This is a classic zero dilemma case, inflated or not inflated models? I try to do: #Packages library(lme4) library(glmmTMB) library(tidyverse) library(bbmle) library(broom) #Open my dataset myds But, is difficult for me, the adoption of highly complex models with just AIC metric as support. Please, any help other support decision criteria for model selection in this case?
