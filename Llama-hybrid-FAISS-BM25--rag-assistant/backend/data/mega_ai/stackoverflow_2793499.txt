I've found the solution to my problem - it's a bit more complicated than I'd like ... On any ItemsControl, when you set the DisplayMemberPath property, an instance of the internal class DisplayMemberTemplateSelector is assigned to the ItemTemplateSelector . In effect, this class generates a custom DataTemplate with an appropriate binding to suit the current configuration of DisplayMemberPath. A new instance of this class is created and used every time that DisplayMemberPath is changed. To replicate this on my own Usercontrol, instead of modifying my existing data template on the fly as I had originally intended, I need to create my own template selector helper class and mimic the same approach as ItemsControl.
