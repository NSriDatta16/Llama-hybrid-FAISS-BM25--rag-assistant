The rank of a matrix is defined as the dimension of the column space of a matrix. Therefore, an $n \times n$ matrix has, at most, rank $n$ . If you perform an SVD on a $n \times n$ matrix, you'll have at most $n$ positive singular values. So the observation of having at most $n$ PCs is a property of matrices. If you instead mean that you have an $n \times m$ matrix with $n \le m$ , then the rank of the matrix is at most $\min\{n,m\}$ . Again, this is a property of linear algebra, not a limitation of any software package or implementation. The code snippet is addressed in some detail in PCA: Eigenvectors of opposite sign and not being able to compute eigenvectors with `solve` in R To summarize, the characteristic equation can be rescaled by a positive or negative number, yielding any number of eigenvectors of different lengths and/or opposite directions. It's typical to choose eigenvectors of unit length, so that resolves the "length" ambiguity. However, the sign ambiguity remains; that is, if $x$ is an eigenvector to some matrix, then $-x$ is also an eigenvector of that matrix. In light of this, it's not clear to me what the "repeat data" approach is intended to reveal.
