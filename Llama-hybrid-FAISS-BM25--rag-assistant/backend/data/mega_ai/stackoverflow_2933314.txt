scrollViewWillBeginDragging is merely a courtesy delegate method. Note the return type is void , which means this is not a "shouldXYZ" delegate method with a BOOL return type to control behaviour. It's just telling you "FYI, dragging is about to happen". You will probably have to manually set the scrollEnabled property in your UIScrollView as desired to turn on and off scrolling altogether.
