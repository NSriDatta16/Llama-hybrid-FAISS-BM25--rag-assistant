Time Series Analysis Book/References not from Economists/Econometrics

Are there any time series books not written from an economics/econometrics perspective? I was hoping someone from biostatistics perspective wrote a time-series analysis book where terms like heteroskedasticity isn't used? I wasn't looking for a mixed-effects or longitudinal analysis text, more on spectral densities and box-cox.
