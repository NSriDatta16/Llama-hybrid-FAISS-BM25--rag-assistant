Modelling strategies for analyzing an effect of a predictor through higher hierarchical level

What strategies can be considered when a predictor's direct effect can not be measured directly due to unmeasured confounding? However, data has a hierarchical structure (patients within regions) that may solve some of the problem. We have patients' data including three variables: complications (outcome), rehabilitation (received hours but highly zero-inflated variable), region (patient's place of residence). A model like this gives biased result due to unmeasured confounding (unavailable variables): e.g. very sick patients are excluded from rehabilitation and very fit patients do not need much rehabilitation. complications ~ rehabilitation + region However, patients in different regions are relatively similar and I do know that regional disparities in rehabilitation exist. Can I specify the model in a way that I examine rehabilitation's regional variability on complications? Hierarchical modelling? complications ~ rehabilitation + (rehabilitation | region) Hierarchical modelling analysing correlations between intercepts/rehabilitation? complications ~ rehabilitation + (rehabilitation |c| region) Cross Classification Modelling? complications ~ 1 + (1 + rehabilitation) + (1 | region) Other strategies that I am not aware of. PS! All ideas, including Bayesian solutions, are also very welcome.
