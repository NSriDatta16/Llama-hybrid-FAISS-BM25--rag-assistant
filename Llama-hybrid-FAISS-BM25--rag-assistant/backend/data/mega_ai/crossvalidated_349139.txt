Transform a regression problem in a classification problem and express it ouput as probability function

I am dealing with a regression problem related to predict the demand of a item by customers. This demand is an integer from 0 to 100 for example. I can employ SVR, Random Forest Regressor, etc. in order to predict future demand. As far as I know, it is possible to discretize a regression problem and transform it in a classification problem, splitting it in ordered buckets (maybe 100 buckets in this case). I don't know what possible drawbacks could happen doing it (any link to a resource of this topic is welcome). As a last step, I need express the result of the classifier as a discrete probability distribution. How can I go about doing this?
