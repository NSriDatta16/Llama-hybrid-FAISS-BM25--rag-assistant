Influential observation (strategy) in linear regression model

Suppose I have dataset(518 observations): df$SalesPrice df$SqFeet df$Garage df$Year df$Quality df$Style df$Lot 360.000 3.032 2 1972 2 1 22.221 340.000 2.058 2 1976 2 1 22.912 250.000 1.780 2 1980 2 1 21.345 205.500 1.638 2 1963 2 1 17.342 248.000 1.966 5 1972 2 1 18.902 data.frame': 518 obs. of 7 variables: $ df$SalesPrice: num 360 340 250 206 248 ... $ df$SqFeet : num 3.03 2.06 1.78 1.64 1.97 ... $ df$Garage : int 2 2 2 2 5 1 2 1 3 2 ... $ df$Year : int 1972 1976 1980 1963 1972 1955 1975 1918 1992 1987 ... $ df$Quality : Factor w/ 3 levels "1","2","3": 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 ... $ df$Style : Factor w/ 7 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ df$Lot : num 22.2 22.9 21.3 17.3 18.9 ... Where I want to build a model for variable SalesPrice as Y variable. But first I checked influential observations: Where dashed line is calculated by the formula: p where n is number of observations and p is number of coefficients without intercept. As a result I got 43 influential observations out of 518. My question is: what are the best strategies of dealing with such big amount of influential observations? Is robust regression the only good solution in this situation?
