I would say you can use anova for analyzing noise level measurements, see this stored google search which links many papers using anova in the analysis of noise measurements. As you say, noise measurements in decibel cannot really be added, say, if the problem is finding the resultant noise level from two simultaneous independent sources, like a jet taking off close the the noisy highway you're on. But that is not your problem . You are making a statistical comparison of the noise levels under different conditions, comparing different distributions of noise levels. Your interest is in parameters of those noise level distributions, which is a very different problem from the technical problem of adding noise from independent, simultaneous sources. So, I guess it is more relevant to ask if the distribution of noise levels are sufficiently symmetrical/close to normal, so that the mean is a good statistical parameter. For some related discussion see What is the terminology for data aggregated via summed totals versus data aggregated via means? EDIT After you added the ANOVA example with data: I would suspect that the repeat measurements, the same day, same spot, are autocorrelated, so you should not treat them as independent observations, as you have done. Can you add some time series plot, or autocorrelations? (by site)
