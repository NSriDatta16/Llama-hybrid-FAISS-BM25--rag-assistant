Horrible eclipse performance on macbook pro running 10.5.8

I am using eclipse galileo on my macbook pro. After a few minutes it starts dragging really badly, like it takes 8 seconds to open a file. I don't have many files open at all. I already modified the config file to increase ram and all that stuff. Is there something wrong with this version of eclipse, never had it run so poorly on here, Thanks
