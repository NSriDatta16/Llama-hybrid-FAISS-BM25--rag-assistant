Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) could also be generalized to the case of multivariate time series, as in your case. There are at least two ways of generalization: DTW $_I$ where each feature/dimension is treated independently (the subscript $I$ ); DTW $_D$ where each feature/dimension is treated dependently (the subscript $D$ ). I would not call $k$ -means a classification algorithm: it is a clustering one. The paper that presents the two can be found here . Finally, as for classification of multivariate time series, you could use the similarity score provided by either DTW, and use a similarity/distance/instanced-based algorithm for clustering such as $k$ -NN (e.g., $1$ -NN). If you are interested in the state-of-the-art for classification of multivariate time series, you should read this paper.
