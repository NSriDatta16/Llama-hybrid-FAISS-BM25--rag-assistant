I would strongly recommend you looking at MVCContrib.TestHelper which uses Rhino.Mocks and provides an elegant way to test your controllers. Here's how your test might look like: [TestClass] public class UsersControllerTests : TestControllerBuilder { [TestMethod] public void UsersController_Index() { // arrange // TODO : this initialization part should be externalized // so that it can be reused by other tests var sut = new HomeController(); this.InitializeController(sut); // At this point sut.Request, sut.Response, sut.Session, ... are // stubed objects on which you could define expectations. // act var actual = sut.Index(); // assert actual.AssertViewRendered(); } } And here's an unit test for a controller that is part of a sample ASP.NET MVC application I wrote.
