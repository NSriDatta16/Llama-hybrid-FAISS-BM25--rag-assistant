Whether it makes more sense to evaluate your predictions on the original or on the log scale depends on your application, or on your loss function. Essentially: use a loss function that correctly measures how painful each loss is. (Which is two ways of saying the same thing.) We statisticians here can't tell you this. It depends on your domain. Note that you have at least one error in your analysis. If you want an unbiased prediction, then the RMSE is the correct evaluation tool, since it will be minimized (in expectation) by an unbiased prediction. However, an unbiased prediction $\hat{y}$ on the log scale turns into a biased prediction on the original scale if you simply exponentiate, $e^{\hat{y}}$ . You need a bias correction term, $e^{\hat{y}+\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{2}}$ . (Yes, this also holds for non-time series predictions.) If you want a point prediction of the conditional median , then you can simply exponentiate, $e^{\hat{y}}$ , to turn a median prediction on the log scale into a median prediction on the original scale (because exponentiation is monotone). However, then the RMSE is not an appropriate measure any more, at least on the original scale. You should use the MAE, which is minimized in expectation by a median prediction.
