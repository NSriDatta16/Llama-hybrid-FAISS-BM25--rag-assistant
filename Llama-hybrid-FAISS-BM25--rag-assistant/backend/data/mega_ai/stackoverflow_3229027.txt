The best WPF4 Project on CodePlex.com

I'm learning this days about WPF and the amazing tool from Microsoft wich named "Expression Blend 4". It makes our work easier than ever to design our WPF and Silverlight apps,Particularly impressive to me is the SketchFlow feature, which enables rapid prototyping for our WPF and Silverlight applications.Meanwhile the ability to creat rich web experiences, games, desktop apps, and more. When i Was seaching for samples or examples for a great WPF project on the web, I found some apps like Using the WPF Visualizer to debug applications in Visual Studio 2010 Introducing photoSuru: Feature Overview but they are not avaible to download ,such as payante libraries like Devexpress,Infragistrics and more .. I'm searching for first exemplar for WPF on CodePlex, to not only learn WPF but also to learn good practices for enterprise application development across the board. I searched here in StackOverFlow in therecent topics ,they are talking about the old generation of the WPF , ... WPF4 is amazing !
