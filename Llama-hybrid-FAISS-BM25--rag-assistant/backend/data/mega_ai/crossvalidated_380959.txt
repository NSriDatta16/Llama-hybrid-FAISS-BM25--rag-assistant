How Probability distribution relates to neural networks?

The concept of random variables and probability distributions are confusing in the context of neural networks. In a neural network, which is the random variable and what is the probability distribution of it? How does the output probability of a (say softmax output layer) affects or relates to the random variable? How is this random variable and probability distribution thing related to neural networks or in general machine learning?
