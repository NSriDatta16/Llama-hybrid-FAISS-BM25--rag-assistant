How measure correlation between binary variables and continuous?

I have a dataset of 540 observation like this: facebook email age 1 0 23 1 1 34 1 a 0 are Yes/no, answers to the question: 'how do you find out about this survey?' Can I measure correlation between various methods and Age? In order to prove that: smaller is the age, more people used facebook to find out the survey. I tried to use a linear regression but it doesn't fit well. I have to use logistic regression with age as dependent and others as independent?
