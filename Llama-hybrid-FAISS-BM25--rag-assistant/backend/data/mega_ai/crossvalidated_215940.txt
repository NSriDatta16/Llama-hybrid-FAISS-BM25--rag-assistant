Learn R-Programming with Statistical Background

I am a statistician. I'm pretty good with the concepts of topics like Linear & Logistic Regression & Time Series. But in order to run data I need to learn the R language. Since, having no programming background makes it difficult for me to understand it. How can I easily learn and construct commands in R software? What could help me with achieving that?
