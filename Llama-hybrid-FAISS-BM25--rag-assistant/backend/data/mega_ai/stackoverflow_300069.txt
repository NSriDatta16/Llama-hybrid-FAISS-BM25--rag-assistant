I agree. This is a server-side problem, not something to scrape into shape on the client side. It may also be valuable to organize your web pages where the common content between the pop-up and a main page is maintained separately and imported server-side into the page that has the master-page surround. Pages that link pop-ups should use the comment content, not the surrounder. Lots of ways to do this (but I don't suppose anyone wants to know how FrontPage extensions help). Try server-side includes.
