Start with Logistic Regression, NaiveBayes and SVMs. Linear regression does not work well on Categorical data even after encoding. As mentioned, you can encode your categories using Pd.dummy(One hot encoding), Label Encoder. Drop one of the one hot column to follow the assumptions of Logistic Regression. Also Normalize/Standardise your continuous data and also treat your NA's. Once you are satisfied, then move to DNN's for better accuracy. I hope this helps.
