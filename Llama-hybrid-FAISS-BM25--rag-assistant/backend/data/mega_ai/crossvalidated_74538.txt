Time Series Analysis for Non-Uniform Data

I have wait-time data for a coffee shop for 4 weeks. Since the data is crowdsourced, it is sparse and non-uniform along the time. So my question is: how should I deal with this non-uniform data? What are the some methods in time series forecasting that can handle non-uniform data? Or is there any way to make the data uniform?
