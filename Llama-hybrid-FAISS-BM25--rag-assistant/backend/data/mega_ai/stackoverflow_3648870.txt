Scala: Using HashMap with a default value

I have a mutable HashMap and would like to use it like a default-dictionary. The obvious method appears to be to use getOrElse and provide the default value each time as a second value. However this seems a little inelegant in my use case since the default value doesn't change. var x = HashMap(1 -> "b", 2 -> "a", 3 -> "c") println(x.getOrElse(4, "_") println(x.getOrElse(5, "_")) // And so on... println(x.getOrElse(10, "_")) Is there any way to create a HashMap (or similar class) such that attempting to access undefined keys returns a default value set on the creation of the HashMap? I notice that HashMap.default is just set to throw an exception but I wonder if this can be changed...
