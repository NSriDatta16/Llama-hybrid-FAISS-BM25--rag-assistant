Goodness of fit chi-square test for a number of PCA components

I have been trying to carry out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in R using the function psych::principal . However the returned $p$-value has been very low in several attempts using different sets of variables. Does it mean that the test of the hypothesis that the number of components is sufficient is rejected? (The number of components was obtained using the scree plot and the criterion of eigenvalue larger than 1.) Is it unimportant for the purpose of obtaining components using PCA? If not, what can be done? RC1 RC2 RC4 RC3 RC5 SS loadings 5.19 4.24 3.01 2.63 1.16 Proportion Var 0.27 0.22 0.16 0.14 0.06 Cumulative Var 0.27 0.50 0.66 0.79 0.85 Proportion Explained 0.32 0.26 0.19 0.16 0.07 Cumulative Proportion 0.32 0.58 0.77 0.93 1.00 Test of the hypothesis that 5 components are sufficient. The degrees of freedom for the null model are 171 and the objective function was 23.32 The degrees of freedom for the model are 86 and the objective function was 2.64 The total number of observations was 103 with MLE Chi Square = 241.11 with prob Thank you very much for the answers and input! All help are very much appreciated! I look forward to more detailed documentation of the package to be available.
