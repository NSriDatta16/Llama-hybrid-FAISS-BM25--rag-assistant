Does Bayesian modeling result in fat-tail distributions?

Let's say we have an univariate dataset x that follow a gaussian with parameters (m, s). Under a frequentist methodology, m and s are estimated using MLE and x is modeled as N(m_hat, s_hat). Using the bayesian approach, lets say we put a prior on m. Then the model for x becomes f(x|m) ~ N(m, s). Computing the joint distribution f(x, m) and then the marginal distribution of f(x), wouldn't we get a fatter tail marginal distribution of f(x) than N(m_hat, s_hat) obtained from the frequentist approach? If x is truly normal, why are we modeling it using a fat-tail distribution? Or am I missing anything?
