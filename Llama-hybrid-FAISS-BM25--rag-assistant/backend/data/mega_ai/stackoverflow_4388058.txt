jScrollpane 2 IE8 Problem - strange behavior when hit top/bottom

http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/fullpage_scroll.html and maybe in other demos, but also in my site :( on IE8 (maybe also 6/7) and the example "BOTH", drag the bar to a absolute position, top or bottom then click on the div, you`ll get scrolled to the top of the page or the div.. this only happens if you used the mouse click and NOT the wheel i dont know how to fix this, im using the api.reinitialise(); but apparently thats not the problem i can post my code if necessary but its even on the demos so..btw you can also see the scroll automoving when you hit alt+tab in the window (in my site) # oh, found another user with the same problem jScrollPane strange behavior in Internet Explorer
