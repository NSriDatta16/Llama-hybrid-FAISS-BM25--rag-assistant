Knowing when the variance in a time series is changing

A basic question, but one I have not found. It is said that if your variance is changing over time you should log it before running ARIMA. This is a form of non-stationarity but I have not seen suggestions that you address it by differencing. My question is what is the best way to tell the variance is changing. I have a hard time telling this looking at graphs, which is the only way I have run into testing for it. There has to be a formal test.
