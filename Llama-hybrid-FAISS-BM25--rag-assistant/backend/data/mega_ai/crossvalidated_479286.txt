Yes, Chris Bishop (machine-learning guru) has a chapter on these, called Linear Basis Function Models . Hyphenating properly it would be "linear basis-function models", to avoid any confusion -- the basis functions themselves are generally non linear. In other words, these models are linear in the parameters, as you want, but the basis functions can be nonlinear. See Chapter 3 of his Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , 2006.
