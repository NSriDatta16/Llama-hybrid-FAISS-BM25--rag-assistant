Everything in human history happened at some point in time, so StartYear can not be NULL -- really. If you introduce IsCurrent instead the EndYear then there are no NULLs at all. If you do choose to keep the EndYear , it is common practice to load it with some date in far future, like 3000-01-01 . And finally, if you do keep and leave EndYear NULL -- it is not tragic, the only problem being that it may be hard to distinguish between missing data and the current membership. Note: StartDate may be more appropriate than the StartYear .
