Set the Stretch property of the Image to None to prevent the image from sizing. You have positioned the buttons by setting their margins. As soon as the window is resized their positions and sizes will change. Add a Canvas to the grid and put the image and the buttons on the canvas using absolute positioning (Canvas.Left="..." Canvas.Top="..." If, after doing this, you do not like the results because you still want to resize the the images and move the buttons in sync you could wrap the Canvas in a ViewBox to make it scale. EDIT This solution includes nice scaling through the Viewbox, but it can be removed as well. Please organize all your posts.
