Sure is. This is called Entity Framework Code-First and this is a good tutorial to help getting you started . The idea is that you create some POCO classes seperate to your Repository/Database class. In this Repository/Database class, you define all the relationships between your POCO's. Fortunately, Entity Framework has a number of conventions which you can leverage off, which means you might not need to define every relationship and rule. Eg. If your class is called User , then it will assume (by default, unless you override this) that the database table is called Users and the primary key identity field in the POCO will be UserId and the same in the database table.
