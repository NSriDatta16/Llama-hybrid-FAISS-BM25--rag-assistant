How is that related to the half-coin? It provides intuitive interpretation for the half-coin and any other generalized (with negative probabilities) random variables, the way to think about them. This interpretation is given in the paragraph after the fundamental theorem. Namely, if $\mathcal{X}$ is a generalized random variable (with pgf $f$), there exist two ``classical'' independent random variables $Y$ and $Z$ (with pgfs $g$ anf $h$) such that $\mathcal{X}+Y=Z$ in distribution. What are the $g$ and $h$ that correspond to $f(z)=\sqrt{(z+1)/2)}$? I don't think the answer is simple and nice-looking. Otherwise author would give it. The fundamental theorem just says that there exists $g(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_nz^n$ and $h(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty q_nz^n$ such that $p_n\geq0$, $q_n\geq0$, and $f(z)g(x)=h(z)$.
