You may refer to the below link: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html For eg: if you have to show an image in ur appn, then that image should be kept inside 3 folders \drawable-hdpi, \drawable-ldpi, \drawable-mdpi with the same name but with different sizes. And you can refer that image by just telling the name. Android will automatically take the image from any one of the folder according to ur mobile. Likewise dont keep values as pixels. Instead of that give dip or dp. For more reference you may refer the above link.
