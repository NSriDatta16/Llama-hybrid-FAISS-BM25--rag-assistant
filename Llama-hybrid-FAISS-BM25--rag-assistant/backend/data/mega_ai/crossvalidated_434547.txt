In non-pathological examples, the prior's variance plays an important role in the "stubbornness" of estimates, especially in hierarchical models. This is very well shown in the 8 schools examples in BDA3. Here is a photo which speaks to this. On the horizontal axis is the prior's standard deviation. As the standard deviation shrinks (alternatively, precision increases) the estimates are pooled closer to the population mean estimate. As the standard deviation increases (precision decreases) the the pooling effect is relaxed, and estimates head towards their completely pooled values.
