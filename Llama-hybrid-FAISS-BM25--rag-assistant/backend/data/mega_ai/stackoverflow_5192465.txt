"Unlimited" and "one" are the correct answers. Let me explain detailfully. Unlimited because SVN is designed for collaborative development without imposing limits on the number of people that can contribute to development One because the only developer being able to commit modifications is the one who possesses the latest version of the file. Further modifications require merging previous modifications into current ones. However, in practice you would seriously organize your team in order for only small groups of people working on the same file simultaneously, or everyone commit only very small and simple modifications to shared files. This affects the number of required merge/conflict resolution operations. Simple example: if you have a single global language file, you can allow every developer to add a few lines at the bottom of it without changing other lines. This translates into easy merging, since modifications are only "add lines" Anyway, you sometimes may want to prevent people from simultaneously work on the same file by locking it.
