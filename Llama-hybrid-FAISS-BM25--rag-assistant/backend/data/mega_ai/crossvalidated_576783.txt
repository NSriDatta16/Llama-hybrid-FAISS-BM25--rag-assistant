Reliable methods to validate clustering of text phrases?

Question is in the title. I have clustered the word embeddings of text phrases, and now want to try and check whether the resulting clusters are coherent enough. I have tried methods that are standardly used for cluster validation such as SSE, silhouette scores and Dunn index but none have proven effective in this case. Any other suggestions? Would be grateful for a detailed response or a link to any other methods which may work.
