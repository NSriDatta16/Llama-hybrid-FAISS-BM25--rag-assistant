I think the problem may caused by correlation between your predictors and by non-linear dependiences. You could try computing Pearson $r$ linear-correlation indicator for checking each predictor-house pricing pair. If $r \approx 1$ it means that in fact there is strong possibility that house_pricing(predictor) is linear. And growth of predictor causes growth of house pricing. If $r \approx -1$ is means that pretty same, but growth of predictor would cause drop of house pricing. If $|r|$ is low - below somewhat 0.3 0.4 then your house_pricing(predictor) is not really a linear function. I would also check if input variables are correlated with each other. I think that number of beds and bathrooms are correlated to Square Footage. Maybe PCA (Principal Component Analysis) would help you get better (or more intuitive) results. Or maybe your data is just exceptional and getting more information would make this clean.
