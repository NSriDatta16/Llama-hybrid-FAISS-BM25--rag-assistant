How does average treatment effect relate to averages of individual treatment effects?

I have a balanced panel with two groups, A and B, and run a standard fixed effects regression. I want to derive how the $\beta$ coefficients of these two regressions are related: \begin{eqnarray} y_{it} &=& \beta x_{it} & + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{it} \\ y_{it} &=& \mathbb{I}(i=A) \beta_A x_{it} + \mathbb{I}(i=B) \beta_B x_{it} & +\alpha_i + \epsilon_{it} \end{eqnarray} In my application, the case arises that the estimate of the average treatment effect is very far from the unweighted averages of the interacted treatment effect estimates, i.e. $\hat{\beta} \neq \frac{\hat{\beta}_A + \hat{\beta}_B}{2}$. So I want to understand how OLS does the "weighting" of the two groups when computing $\hat{\beta}$ What I would ideally like to find is a formula that relates $\beta$, $\beta_i$ and the covariances of my $x_{it}$s.
