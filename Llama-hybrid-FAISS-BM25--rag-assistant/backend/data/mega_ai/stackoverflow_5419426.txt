From the call stack, it appears that perhaps one of your web.config files for the application is configured to use ASP.NET session state storage inside SQL Server. You say it is deployed to 4 servers. I would check all of the web.config files and ensure that you are not using in-proc session state on 3 for example, and then trying to use session state storage in SQL on the other.
