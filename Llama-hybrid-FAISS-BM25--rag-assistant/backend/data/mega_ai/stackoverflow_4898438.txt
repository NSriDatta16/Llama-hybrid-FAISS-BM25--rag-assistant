jQuery - getting two functions to work with each other

I'm not too confident with jQuery, however it proves useful for features like dragging and uploading files. I've tried combining a script I found that allows me to upload files without page refresh (which works) and I developed my own dragging system (which works). The problem I have is that when an image is uploaded, I cannot drag it - yet I can drag if the image is already there. Basically - I can't seem to get one to talk to the other. The upload function starts as follows: $(document).ready(function(){ .... $('#upload_container').html(" ); dragme(); .... }); I did originally have $('#upload_container').html as document.getElementByID('upload_container').innerHTML but I seem to remember that would stop the jQuery from picking up the dragme(); declaration (though still doesn't seem to work. Firefox still states that the dragme() function hasn't been defined even though it is there - so I believe that I am calling it incorrectly. The dragme jQuery starts as follows: $(document).ready(function dragme(){ .... $("#draggable").draggable({ drag: function(event, ui){ var pos = $(this).offset(); $("#x").val(pos.left); $("#y").val(pos.top); } .... }); .... }); Will it work if the two are combined or is there a way for them to work by a correct call?
