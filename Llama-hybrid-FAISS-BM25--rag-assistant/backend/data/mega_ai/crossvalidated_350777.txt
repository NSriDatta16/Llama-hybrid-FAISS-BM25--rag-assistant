A reviewer wants me to perform a test to *exclude* the presence of a trend. How?

I have an experiment with N=34 measured points. For each point I measure a variable $x$ and a variable $y$. In my paper I reported the average and the standard deviation of $x_i -y_i$ (where $i$ is the sample index). I've qualitatively plotted the scatter plot $x-y$ vs $x$ and I've stated that I do not see any specific trend for $x-y$ vs $x$. Now the reviewer wants me to perform "a statistical test" (without any other specification) to exclude that any such trend exists. How can I do that? If I measure the correlation coefficient between $x-y$ and $x$ I do find $r \approx 0.45$ which is statistically significant at p So, what kind of test can I use to exclude something? Should I measure the average $r$ of a bootstrapping experiment? Is there any other test? Edit: I've added the scatter plot in question.
