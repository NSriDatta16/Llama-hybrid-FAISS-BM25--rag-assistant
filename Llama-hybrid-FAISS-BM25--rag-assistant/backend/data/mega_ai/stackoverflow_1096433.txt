To compile one file C# programs I have created a .bat file, on which I drag and drop a .cs file and get a .exe in .cs file directory. SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5 cd %~d1\ cd "%~p1" csc %1 You can use this .bat file in a Visual Studio macro to compile active .cs file and run the application. Sub RunCS() If Not ActiveDocument.FullName.EndsWith(".cs") Then Return End If REM Path to batch file Dim compileScript = "C:\dev\compileCS.bat" Dim compileParams As System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo compileParams = New ProcessStartInfo(compileScript, Chr(34) & ActiveDocument.FullName & Chr(34)) Dim compiling As System.Diagnostics.Process compiling = System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(compileParams) compiling.WaitForExit() Dim programFile As String programFile = ActiveDocument.FullName.Substring(0, ActiveDocument.FullName.Length - 3) + ".exe" Dim running As System.Diagnostics.Process running = System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(programFile) End Sub This will run only programs for which all code is in one file. If you want to quickly change projects instead, you can change your solution's Startup Project to Current selection
