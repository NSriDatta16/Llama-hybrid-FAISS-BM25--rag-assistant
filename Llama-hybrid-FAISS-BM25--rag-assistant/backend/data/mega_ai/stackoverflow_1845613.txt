Adjacency matrices are not always invertible . There are papers on this subject; I'm not sure whether there is any simple characterization of the corresponding graphs. A pragmatic approach would be to catch the LinAlgError exception in your code (try… except…), and warn when the adjacency matrix is not invertible (and keep performing your calculations otherwise).
