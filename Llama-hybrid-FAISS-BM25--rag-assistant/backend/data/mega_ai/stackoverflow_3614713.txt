I use DB sessions all the time with Zend and Symfony so its definitely viable, there will be a cost of course but most likely nothing significant. Normally the way these handlers work is to use session_set_save_handler that way it works as normal except for the actual function called which writes the data. However pay attention to the warnings about object destruction.
