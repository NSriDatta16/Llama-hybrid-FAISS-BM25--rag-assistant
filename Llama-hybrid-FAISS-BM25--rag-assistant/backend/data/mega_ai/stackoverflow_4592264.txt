Flash library image get blur(quality reduce?)

I get quite an annoying problem when import image into flash (.png &.jpeg). My image is a 72 dpi png file with sharpen effect , when i use [ Import to stage ], the image imported in the library get blurred( eye-realizable), but the image on the stage keep original quality(not blurred).I have try change library item properties ( lossless png..etc),import again but no thing different. How can i make the library item have same quality as the image on the stage? (when i drag library item to the stage it's still blur , except the image on the stage create by [ import to stage ], also tried with jpeg but nothing different)
