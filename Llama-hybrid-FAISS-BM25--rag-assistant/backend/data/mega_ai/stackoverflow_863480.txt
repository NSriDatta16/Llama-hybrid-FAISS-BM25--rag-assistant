Coda has a totally awesome "revolutionary" find and replace engine, that: Revolutionary Find/Replace. Sure, we've got regular ol' Grep. But we also provide a Grep wrapped with drag and drop simplicity — a Coda first. Want to swap the width and height tags? It’s as simple as searching for width=“x” height=“y” and replacing it with width=“y” height=“x”. That’s it: Coda does the rest.
