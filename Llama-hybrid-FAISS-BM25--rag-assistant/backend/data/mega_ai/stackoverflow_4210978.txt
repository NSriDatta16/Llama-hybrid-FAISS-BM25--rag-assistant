Using OpenGL Shader Language to write a simple shader

I'm going to start this off by saying that I am new to GLSL but have a decent amount of experience with OpenGL. I currently have a project that I want to practice shaders with. I am using gluTeapot and having it rotate around the xyz axis and I want to practice writing a basic shader with it. I currently have a sample shader and it works so I know that the OpenGL side of things is working well. All I need to do at this point is work with my vertex shader and fragment shader. I want to start out with something simple. I want to write a shader that makes alternating stripes of red green and blue. Here's what I know I need to do so far, but I'm not exactly sure how to actually implement it: 1) I know that I need to make constants for red, green, and blue that are of the type vec4 2) I know that I should probably just use mod(ycoord, 3.0) to determine which color belongs at a certain location 3) I know that I am going to have to figure out some way to get this pattern to rotate along with the teapot or else it will just look stupid. I have tried looking around the internet for some good tutorials for the basics of GLSL but I haven't understood any of the ones that I have read well enough to put them to use. I also haven't been able to find any questions here that I have been able to put to use. Any help that you can give to a newbie at writing shaders would be appreciated. Thanks.
