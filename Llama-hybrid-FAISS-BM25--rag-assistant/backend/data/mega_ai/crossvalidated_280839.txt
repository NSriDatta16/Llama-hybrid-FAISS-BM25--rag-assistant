If the dependent variable is nominal, you can use multinomial logistic regression. That is a complicated model with many parameters, so you will need a lot of data for that to work. Introduce some notation: $Y$ is the response with three nominal categories, $t$ is time, $x$ is treatment (two levels) and $z$ is geographical location (5 levels). Then the multinomial logistic regression is then $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} \P (Y_i=r \mid t_i,x_i,z_i) = \frac{e^{ \beta_{0r}+t_i \beta_t +x_i \beta_x + z_i \beta_z }}{1+\sum_{s=1}^2 e^{\beta_{0s}+t_i \beta_t +x_i \beta_x + z_i \beta_z } } $$ for $r=1,2,3$ where $r=3$ is taken as reference. So $\beta_{03}=0$. This model then has slope parameters that do not depend on the alternative chosen, only the intercepts depend on alternative. In the formula above, some of the variables (for instance time) are really vectors of dummys, so the corresponding parameter is also a vector and the product must be read as a dot product. In R, for instance, such models can be estimated by the nnet package (the basic model), while mlogit also contains extensions of this model. Another question is if you really have enough data to estimate such a complicated model.
