Using deep learning to predict optimized output?

I have used deep learning with Keras with 8 layers and 40 neurons to predict the lift and drag of an airfoil of a particular shape, using input data from different airfoil shapes, and output data of lift and drag. The result is very good, with about a 1% error. So if I need to get max lift or drag from my given constraint, how can I use my deep learning model to get it? Is there any library or tools I can explore? Doing a Google search kept giving me optimizing hyperparameters which is not what I'm looking for. Thanks.
