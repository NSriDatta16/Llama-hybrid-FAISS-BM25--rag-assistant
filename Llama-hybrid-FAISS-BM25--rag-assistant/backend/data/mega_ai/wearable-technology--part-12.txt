Europe Collab, showcased an event entitled "Cashless on the Catwalk" at the Collins Music Hall in Islington. Celebrities walking through the event could make purchases for the first time in history from a wearable device using McLear's NFC Rings by tapping the ring on a purchase terminal. CuteCircuit CuteCircuit pioneered the concept of interactive and app-controlled fashion with the creation in 2008 of the Galaxy Dress (part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, US) and in 2012 of the tshirtOS (now infinitshirt). CuteCircuit fashion designs can interact and change colour providing the wearer a new way of communicating and expressing their personality and style. CuteCircuit's designs have been worn on the red carpet by celebrities such as Katy Perry and Nicole Scherzinger. and are part of the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Project Jacquard Project Jacquard, a Google project led by Ivan Poupyrev, has been combining clothing with technology. Google collaborated with Levi Strauss to create a jacket that has touch-sensitive areas that can control a smartphone. The cuff-links are removable and charge in a USB port. Intel and Chromat Intel partnered with the brand Chromat to create a sports bra that responds to changes in the body of the user, as well as a 3D printed carbon fiber dress that changes color based on the user's adrenaline levels. Intel also partnered with Google and TAG Heuer to make a smart watch. Iris van Herpen Smart fabrics and 3D printing have been incorporated in high fashion by the designer Iris van Herpen. Van Herpen was the first designer to incorporate 3D printing technology of rapid prototyping into the fashion industry. Manufacturing process of e-textiles There are several methods which companies manufacture e-textiles from fiber to garment and the insertion of electronics to the process. One of the methods being developed is when stretchable circuits are printed right into a fabric using conductive ink. The conductive ink uses metal fragments in the ink to become electrically conductive. Another method would be using conductive thread or yarn. This development includes the coating of non-conductive fiber (like polyester PET) with conductive material such as metal like gold or silver to produce coated yarns or in order to produce an e-textile. Common fabrication techniques for e-textiles include the following traditional methods: UI/UX Design In approaching user experience (UX) for wearables, collected data from the sensors are transferred wirelessly via a linked cloud database. These data can be analyzed using statistics and presented through user interface (UI) graphics that clearly visualizes the users' habits over time. When working on such a tiny canvas with limited space, essential information with short interactions and a simple UX flow is the driving factor of efficient wearable design. A wearable's core functionality includes simple actions such as reading messages or controlling a fitness app. Most kept it simple, meaning a simple design that fits with devices with varying screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power. Responsiveness was also crucial as sluggish interactions, such as a user needing to twist and turn their wrist to get a gesture to work as intended, can be highly frustrating in the long run. Furthermore, visual design and navigation are core factors in creating a strong UI hierarchy in such a small space. Paired smartly with graphics, shapes, and colours, wordiness can be minimized through quick interactions with its users. Miller argues that "animations can make smartwatch UX fun, but shouldn't be a priority". Too many animations can cause information bloat or decrease the battery life of the wearable. The UI and UX design of health monitoring wearables are crucial in ensuring that users can interact with their devices efficiently and securely. Since most wearable devices have small screens, their UI must be int
