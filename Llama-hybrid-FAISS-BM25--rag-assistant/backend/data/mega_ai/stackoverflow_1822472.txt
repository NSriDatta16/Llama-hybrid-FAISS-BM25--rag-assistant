These would be your primary options: SQL Server means in tables in the msdb database Structured Storage File means a .dts file The file is portable and standalone. It can be run with dtsrun.exe and does not require a full install to run on an app server. The msdb option means you need access to the msdb database but you gain backup/restore capability. It depends on your setup and shop. I prefer the file option, but I'll use either as needed. I would not use these: Visual Basic File: once saved you can't edit it again, only run it (and I forgot how now) SQL Server Meta Data Services: does it still apply? Some more info on www.sqldts.com but it's not updated now. SSIS has mostly replaced DTS.
