Make a view (initialized from initWithNibName) load all its subview

Assuming I load a view controller from a nib, and decide to do something with one of its subview behind the scene. At a later moment in time, I would show the view of this view controller. viewController = [[MyViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MyViewController" bundle:nil]; [viewController.someSubview doSomething]; //later on [mainView addSubview:viewController.view]; The problem is that, the someSubview object doesn't seem to be loaded until the view appears, so the method doSomething is not called. So far my workaround is to call: [mainView addSubview:viewController.view]; [viewController.view removeFromSuperview]; to initialize the subviews of viewcontroller first. Is there any more elegant way (like a loadSubviews method or something) for this task?
