Scikit-learn has compose.ColumnTransformer which allows different columns or column subsets of the input to be transformed separately and the features generated by each transformer will be concatenated to form a single feature space. This is useful for heterogeneous or columnar data, to combine several feature extraction mechanisms or transformations into a single transformer. A demo of mixing numeric and categorical types is here . In your example, CountVectorizer is numeric and Label is categorical.
