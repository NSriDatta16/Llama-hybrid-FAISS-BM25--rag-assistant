Why reinvent the wheel (for documenting at least)? Microsoft has a standard documentation structure, XML documentation , that can be compiled into .chm documentation files. Using the triple /// notation to document your methods: /// MyMethod is a method in the MyClass class. /// Here's how you could make a second paragraph in a description. for information about output statements. /// /// public static void MyMethod(int Int1) { }` you can then use the This is an int. xml to define any parameter values. Once you have documented your class and methods, you can the use Sandcastle to compile it into html help files. To generate the XML files: Open the project's Property Pages dialog box. Clickthe Configuration Properties folder. Click the Build property page. Modify the XML Documentation File property. To help you, I recommend a tool called GhostDoc , which provides context-menu documentation generation for a method. It doesn't provide a perfect documentation, but it provides a good general structure. Combined with Sandcastle, XML documentation is a great tool for documenting code and assemblies.
