A macro-average will compute the metric independently for each class and then take the average (hence treating all classes equally), whereas a micro-average will aggregate the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric. In your case as per your confusion matrix, Class 1 TP = 1 FP = 0 Class 2 TP = 1 FP = 1 Class 3 TP = 1 FP = 0 and the precision formula is given as TP/(TP + FP) So precision Pa = 1 /( 1 + 0 ) = 1 pb = 1 /( 1 + 1) = 0.5 pc = 1 /(1 + 0 ) = 1 Precision with Macro is Pma = pa + pb + pc / 3 = 1 + 0.5 + 1 / 3 = 0.8333 Precision with Micro is Pmi = TPa + TPb + TPc / (TPa + FPa + TPb + FPb + TPc + FPc) = 1 + 1 + 1 / ( 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0) = 0.75 Please refer to the below link which very well described the difference between Marco and Micro.
