Recursive time series forecasting model

In a recursive forecasting model, let's say you are trying to predict sales of Target for the next month and you will append that prediction to your input and predict the month after. Basically, your target is Sales quantity, which you lagged. But let's say you have other continuous numerical features like Price which you will lag as well. As your model is making predictions on Sales_QTY, it will feed it back to sales_qty as input so you will never ran out of values for that one. So how do you deal with your other features (other than the target) in order to generate them as next months inputs in a recursive forecasting model (because eventually you will run out of them)? DO you create a sub-model and try to predict them as well?
