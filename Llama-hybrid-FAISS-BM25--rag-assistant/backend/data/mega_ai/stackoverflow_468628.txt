Our team is now using scrum for several years and although there have been issues at the beginning and a lot of evangelizing was needed until management accepted it and changed their way of working with the teams, it has leveraged our productivity and enhanced our knowledge-transfer across the team-members. From my understanding scrum is very open to deviation, relying on constant feedback and adaption through the retrospective (for the developers) and short iterations (from project planning side/management). Of course, all parties involved (developers, scrum masters, product owners/management/clients) have to accept that scrum works differently than most of the other non-agile development approaches and that they have to modify some of their current methodologies. I personally think, that scrum gives me a greater freedom and effectiveness than with the other "static" development-/project-approaches I experienced in the past.
