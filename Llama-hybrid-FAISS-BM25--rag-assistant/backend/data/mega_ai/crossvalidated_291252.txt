I would conduct this as a single regression analysis since you have the raw data. However, the clustering of observations within studies would violate statistical independence, hence possibly deflating the standard errors of our regression coefficients. To account for the clustering, the standard response might be to perform a mixed-effects analysis (a multi-level model). However, the number of clusters is very small ( n=3 ). When this is the case, the estimators for multi-level models are all faulty. The same goes for other most methods of accounting for clustering - cluster-robust standard errors, ... Bayesian methods could suffice. However, a fixed-effects approach is recommended by McNeish and Stapleton (2016) who performed simulations with as few as four clusters. To account for clustering, they recommend inflating the standard errors of our regression coefficients using the square root of the design effect. Some sample code to do this: # Continuing from OP's example dat final.results now contains your modeling results. You can see the estimates for the different predictors and their 95% confidence intervals. McNeish, D., & Stapleton, L. M. (2016). Modeling Clustered Data with Very Few Clusters.
