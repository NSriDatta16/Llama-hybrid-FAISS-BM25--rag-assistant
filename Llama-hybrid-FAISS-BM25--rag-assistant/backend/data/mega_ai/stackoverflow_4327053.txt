JavaScript: "Dynamic" back reference RegExp replacement

I want to make replacements like this: var txt = "Some text containing $_variable1 and with $_variable2 inside of it as well."; var rx = /(\$_[a-z]+)/g var $_variable1 = "A CAT"; var $_variable2 = "A HOTDOG"; var replaced_txt = txt.replace(rx, $1); I want replaced_txt to equal "...containing A CAT and with A HOTDOG ins...", but the only way to achieve this that I've found so far is this: var replaced_txt = txt.replace(rx, function($1){return eval($1)}); And I have a feeling this is not the most elegant solution, no? Preferably I'd like to avoid eval() I'm grateful for any ideas on this! /C
