Some ideas:1. Could you assign features for jobs and assignments? Performance would be the labels. Then you could simply use an SVM for example. 2. Given a user representation matrix X, each row i is an agent, and a job representation matrix Y, each j is a job representation, and a matrix of performance P, where every row stands for a user and every column how well the agent performed on that job, you could learn X and Y through optimization. Check this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization I hope this helps.
