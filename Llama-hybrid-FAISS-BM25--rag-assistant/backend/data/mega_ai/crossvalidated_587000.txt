This sounds like a classic blunder in experimental design. When you design a study, you need to find a reasonable sample size to provide good power. To do this, you make some assumptions about what the truth might be, such as what you provided above. Indeed, 16.8 = 1.2 * 14, i.e. Renault has 20% of whatever X is compared to Chevy. There is a difference, therefore, between the specific assumptions of the design, and the formal statement of the hypothesis. The setup of classical null hypothesis testing is not so specific as to tell you how much different from the null the alternative hypothesis is - without some very specialized or Bayesian methods. The specific test is whether Renault and Chevy are equal, and the hypothesis is stated accordingly: $$ \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}_0 : \mu_R = \mu_C \\ \mathcal{H}_1 : \mu_R \ne \mu_C \\ \end{array} $$ For a two-tailed test, or swap the appropriate operators for a one tailed test.
