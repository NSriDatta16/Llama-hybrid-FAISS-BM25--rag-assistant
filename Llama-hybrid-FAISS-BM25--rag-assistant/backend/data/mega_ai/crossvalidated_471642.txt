It depends on what model you are using for the making prediction if you are using a Linear Model any model which depends on the Euclidian Distance then you must normalize your data if it is skewed. And If You are using tree-based models like Random Forests, Xgboost, ExtraTrees, Catboost etc. then you do not need to normalize your data before feeding it to model and making prediction Here is a similar question that you asked
