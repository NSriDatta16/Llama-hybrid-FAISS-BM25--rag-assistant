&operator can be applied to anything that has a memory address.You cannot apply & on register variables as they are stored on CPU registers. Also in C , constants are not compile time constants(i.e always allocated storage), so you can safely take address of a constant variable.But in C++ , if you take address of a const variable it will not be a compile time constant and will be allocated storage. Edit By constants i mean, variables declared with const keywords, literals like A,7, are essentially compile time constants.compiler can directly store them in its symbol table.
