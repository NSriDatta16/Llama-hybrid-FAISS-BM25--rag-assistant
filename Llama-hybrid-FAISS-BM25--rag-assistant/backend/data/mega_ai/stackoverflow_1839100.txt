Display Percentage or Amount of discount for catalog price rule in Magento

I'm struggling to figure out how to display the percentage or the amount of discount that is applied to a product in Magento via the Catalog Price Rules. For example: I want the price to be displayed in the front-end as follows: [old-price] [special-price] [discount info] where [old-price] has a css strike through. The [old-price] and [special-price] is available by default through the tax helper. I've tried using the CatalogRule model, but I have no way to load it with a product id as the load function expects an entity id and from what I can tell, there aren't any other useful methods to load by product ID. I've var dumped (as well as using get_class_methods ) just about everything that I found in the price.phtml file (apart from $this of course), but nothing helps. I could just use a simple calculation to work out the discount percentage or amount, but I have no way of knowing whether the catalog rule is based on a percentage, or fixed amount. I hope this all makes sense? Thanks for the help. RÃ©my
