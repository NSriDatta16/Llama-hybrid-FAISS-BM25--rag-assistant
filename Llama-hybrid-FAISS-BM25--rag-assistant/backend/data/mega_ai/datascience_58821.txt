One idea is to train your autoencoder only one normal images which will allow you to represent in a lower dimension space the problem. Your image would be encoded as follows, for $x \in \mathbb{R}^{W \times H \times C}$ $$ f(x) = \tilde{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times d} $$ Then since you are in a lower dimension space you can use a distance-based rule: your normal cases should accumulate in some ball: $$ \{ ||x-u|| where $u$ would be the center (average of all your normal training cases). Then use the train model to encode your images at prediction time. Then if a new point is inside the ball it is a normal case, if it is outside it is an outlier. That's just an idea, I think there are plenty of possible ways to approach the problem.
