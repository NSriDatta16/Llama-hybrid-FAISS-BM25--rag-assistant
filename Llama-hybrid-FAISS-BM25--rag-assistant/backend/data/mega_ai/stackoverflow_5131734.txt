It belongs on the OrganizationController. The Organization controller should be managing any creation/change to the organization model. The user should have no knowledge on how or what is involved in creating an organization. If you give them the ability to create organizations you are coupling logic.

If your user/organization don't really justify existence, aka they aren't really controlling much then merge them into one. If both classes exist I vote for organization.
