Your problem is using a WPF control written in VB.NET in the WinForms designer. If the event handler is causing problems, you can use AddHandler instead of WithEvents and Handles to conditionalize your handler code. Once you are using AddHandler you can wrap adding the handler in a If using the methods described in @gmagana's answer. See this answer for the difference between Handles and AddHandler: Handles vs. AddHandler
