How to prevent functions from being excluded from coverage profiling?

We're using AQTime's coverage profiler to check coverage results for unit tests. It seems to generally work okay, but has a nasty habit of overestimating coverage because some functions don't appear at all. I think this is because the linker has stripped them because they're not called, but obviously it is not ideal because I'd like them to show up as "not covered". Does anyone know if there's a way to configure either Visual C++ or AQTime such that these functions will be correctly tagged as "not covered"?
