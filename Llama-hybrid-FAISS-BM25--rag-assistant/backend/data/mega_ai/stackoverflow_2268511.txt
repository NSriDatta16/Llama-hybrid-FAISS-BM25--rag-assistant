How to render event bars/ribbons like those in google calendar or fullcalendar for jQuery

Looking for a solution on how to render event bars representing date ranges like those in gcal or the jquery fullcalendar plugin. These bars are divs that overlap multiple divs (multiple day events), and can be dragged and dropped into different divs. I will be creating a workshift calendar that is similar to http://www.rotaboard.com ...but with multiday events.
