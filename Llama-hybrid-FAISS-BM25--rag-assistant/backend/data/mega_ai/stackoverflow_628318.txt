Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are slow because they rely on unsupervised learning: EAs are told that some solutions are better than others, but not how to improve them. Neural networks are generally faster, being an instance of supervised learning: they know how to make a solution better by using gradient descent within a function space over certain parameters; this allows them to reach a valid solution faster. Neural networks are often used when there isn't enough knowledge about the problem for other methods to work.
