I work with MSSQL, MySql and PostGres regularly (using .net, java and PHP). One of my favorite things about about MySQL (esp. compared to MSSQL) is the ease with which you can run and restore full database backups. MSSQL's model of using .bak files is really ugly and time-consuming (topic for another post.) But if you want to do somethign like automated testing, or automated build processes (that include building a db from scratch), MySQL can be a bit easier to deal with. A few other points: The management tools have gotten a lot better since the early days. If you are interested in transactions, constraints, etc.. be sure you are defining your tables to use the InnoDB storage engine (instead of MyISAM which is designed for speed.) I do miss MSSQL's schema generating tool, but I think there are equivalent tools out there. We've used a Linux database server and a window's web server (for .net apps) with great success. If you are using something like NHibernate or some other non-MS data abstraction layer, the case to look beyond MSSQL is stronger too...
