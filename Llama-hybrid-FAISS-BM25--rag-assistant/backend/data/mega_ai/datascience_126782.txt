Information retrieval SOTA models

Where can I find sota models of information retrieval? My task is to rank documents by given query by semantic search of embedding. I know that models like ColBERT, SPLADE solve this problem, but I think they are not SOTA now. I tried to find SOTA models on paperswithcode but there almost nothing about this problem.
