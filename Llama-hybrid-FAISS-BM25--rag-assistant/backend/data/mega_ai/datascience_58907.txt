Understanding the "Wide" part of Google's wide and deep

Google's wide and deep recommender model sounds really cool, but I'm struggling to believe I'm grasping the wide section right so wanted to check my understanding. Their paper says the following: The wide component consists of the cross-product transformation of user installed apps and impression apps Each example corresponds to one impression Let's say we have 5 apps, A through E. My understanding is that the cross-product transformation would represent that as 20 columns, representing each possible combination of installed and impressed app (making 25, but then presumably the 5 "matching" cross-products like and(installed=App_A, impressed=App_A) would be removed because presumably Google is smart enough not to impress Apps the user already has). Let's also say we have 3 Users, called X - Z. X has installed apps A and C, and is shown app B and D. Y has installed App B and is shown A and E. Z has installed apps A, C and D and is shown apps B and E. With that dataset, the cross-product transformation should look (I think) like this: My question is; is my understanding of the transformation there correct? If so that's going to be one gigantic matrix in fairly short order, particularly given they have over a billion users and a million different apps.
