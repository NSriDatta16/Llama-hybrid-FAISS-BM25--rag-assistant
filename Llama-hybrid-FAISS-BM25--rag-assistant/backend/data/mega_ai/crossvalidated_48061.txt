I believe it's called a vinculum . On the other hand, MathWorld seems to think it's a macron . The distinction seems to be that a macron goes on top of single character, whereas a vinculum spans more than one. MathWorld seems to use bar and macron interchangeably and they cite Bringhurst, R. The Elements of Typographic Style , 2nd ed. Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks, 1997, p. 271. I would side with MathWorld, but you may get a better answer over at the math site .
