Mean of bootstrapped medians

I have a large set (10^6) of very small sets (5-10 entries) of numbers. For each of them, I want to compute a sensible average measure. An example might be this: $$ x = [-2, 5, -1, 3, 100] $$ Because of the nature of the data, I know that the 100 is not an outlier, but it should also not be taken too seriously (hard to explain better without going into boring details). Hence, I want use use neither the median (which loses too much information), nor the arithmetic mean (which gives too much weight to the 100). Using the intercept of a robust regression $x$ ~ $1$ also effectively treats the 100 as an outlier. So, I came up with the following approach: For a set with $n$ numbers ( $n=5$ in the above example), select with replacement $n$ samples. Compute the median of these $n$ samples. Repeat steps 1 and 2 $m>>1$ times, and compute the mean of the $m$ medians. For a set with $n$ numbers, there are $n^n$ possibilities for sampling with replacement, so if $n$ is small, this can also be done deterministically by exhausting all possibilities. The results I obtained ( $7.8096$ for the above example) correspond extremely well to what I would intuitively consider a good average measure, given what I know about the data. I'm surprised I've never heard about this measure, given how natural it feels for computing a robust average that incorporates all data entries. Does anyone know more about it and can point me to relevant literature? Or more generally to information about the distribution of bootstrapped medians of finite sets of numbers?
