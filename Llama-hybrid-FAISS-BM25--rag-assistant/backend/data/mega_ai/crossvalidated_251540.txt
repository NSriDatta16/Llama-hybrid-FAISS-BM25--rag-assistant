Interpretation of OLS regression coefficients

Much of the empirical literature seems to interpret the coefficient b of a simple linear (OLS) regression Y = a + bX + e as follows: a one-unit increase in X will, ON AVERAGE, cause a b unit increase in Y. My question is - where is the "on average" coming from? Is this interpretion ok? (although we use LS criterion)
