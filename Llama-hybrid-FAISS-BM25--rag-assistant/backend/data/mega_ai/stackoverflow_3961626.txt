There is an ACL extension that is distributed along with Mercurial. You should be able to specify the frozen branches by denying commit to every one except the administrator. I am not sure if named branches can leverage this facility. https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/AclExtension Configuring acls: [acl.deny.branches] frozen-branch = * [acl.allow.branches] branch_name = admin
