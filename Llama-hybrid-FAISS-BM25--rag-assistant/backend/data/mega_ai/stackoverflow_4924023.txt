Using LAZY is a good start, I would recommend you always make everything LAZY if you are at all concerned about performance. Also ensure that you are using weaving, (Java SE agent, or Java EE/Spring, or static), as LAZY OneToOne and ManyToOne depend on this. Changing the Id to your other field would be a good idea, if you always query on it and it is unique. You should also check why your application keeps executing the same query over and over. You should make the query a NameDQuery not use a dynamic query. In EclipseLink you could also enable the query cache on the query (once it is a named query), this will enable cache hits on the query result.
