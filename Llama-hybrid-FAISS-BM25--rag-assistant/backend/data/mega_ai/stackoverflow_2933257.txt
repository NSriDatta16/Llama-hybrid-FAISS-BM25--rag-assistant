My guess is you will maxout whatever the request is handling and the mysql database before Apache server becomes a problem. However, going out on a limb, if proper caching is in place, and a sufficiently smart architecture and pragmatic design, and effectively only the 30 sec polling, you should be able to support a couple 1000 users. But : mock it up, quick and dirty, do roughly what you think you will be doing, and hit it with JMeter (or similar) with 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000, ... till you find the performance wall. I am scared about the aggregating data part... if aggregation is really needed, carefully architect it so you do not need to go to the DB, because this will kill you in production, and you wont find it in development.
