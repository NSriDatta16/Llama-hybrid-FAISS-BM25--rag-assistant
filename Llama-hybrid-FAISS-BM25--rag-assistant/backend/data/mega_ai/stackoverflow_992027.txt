So you do "Actions" and "Open with windows explorer" in 1 library and create a new item in a list and attach files from the same location as in the windows explorer window? Something like http://server/doclib . I never tried this before but it does work. Interestingly the file that I actually get to upload is from the Internet Explorer temporary internet files. What actual filename do you get to see? That temporary storage does add additional characters to the filename that may be valid for a filesystem but not SharePoint.
