Random effects are best used when you are trying to summarize a lot of variation between groups, people, or any other cluster of data ( see lengthier discussion here ). In this case, 50 clusters (states) is a lot of groups to consider, and is not likely your primary theoretical fixed effect of interest. Nonetheless, I believe your assessment is correct that the states can be used as random effects. If you are specifically curious about how each state varies but don't want to enter them as fixed effects, you can use caterpillar plots (shown in the previously linked answer) to show how much each state varies by 1) average increase/decrease in the dependent variable or 2) variation in slopes.
