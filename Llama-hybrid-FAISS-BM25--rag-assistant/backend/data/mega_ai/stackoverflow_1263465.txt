I have the same issue when redeploying, hopefully someone can shed some light on this, otherwise I'm going back to Ganymede...only way around it for me is to always delete the deployed EAR first then things are fine after that when I do a deploy...kind of stupid IMO. Also getting bad memory leaks with galileo...system slows to a crawl after a few hours of usage, and lot more crashes vs Ganymede...sigh serves me right for jumping to a new version!
