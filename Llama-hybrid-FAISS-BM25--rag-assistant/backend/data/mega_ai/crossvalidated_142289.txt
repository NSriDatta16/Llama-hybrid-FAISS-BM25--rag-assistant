Newey West standard errors in regression model without constant

I'm estimating $y_i= \beta_1 \times x_{1i} + \varepsilon_i$ on a time series on $y$ and $x$ , so in presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. My model does not include any intercepts. Are Newey West standard errors calculated on such model appropriate (in other words, the NW correction requires a full model with intercept)? I am using R sandwich and lmtest packages.
