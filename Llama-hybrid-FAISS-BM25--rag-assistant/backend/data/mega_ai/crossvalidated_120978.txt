Range of predicted probabilities by logistic regression

I have a binary classification problem with unbalanced classes, e.g. I have 500 examples of negative class(0) and 20 examples of positive class (1) and I need to estimate the probability of positive class. I use logistic regression, which gives me extremely small probabilities so that optimal threshold by some criteria based on ROC is about 0.1. Is there any way to force (scale) this to be 0.5 or any other arbitrary number? Thank you very much!
