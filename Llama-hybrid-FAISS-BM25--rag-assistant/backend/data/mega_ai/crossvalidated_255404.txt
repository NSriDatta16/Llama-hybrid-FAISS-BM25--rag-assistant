Continuous data discretization rules

I know it all depends on the data, but I am looking for a general, most common rules for continuous data discretization. For example It could be a list like this: Use Supervised MDL discretization (e.g. Fayyad & Irani MDL), if this fails (i.e. no cuts could be found) Use Unsupervised equal frequency discretization, set number of bins based on the number of classes etc. Again, I am aware that there is no gold standard, just looking for a starting point and most common practice in machine learning.
