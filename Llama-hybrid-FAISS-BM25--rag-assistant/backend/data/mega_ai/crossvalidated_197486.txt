What's the difference between Bayesian Optimization (Gaussian Processes) and Simulated Annealing in practice

Both processes seem to be used to estimate the maximum value of an unknown function, and both obviously have different ways of doing so. But in practice is either method essentially interchangeable? Where would I want to use one over the other? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/cifar/NCAP2014-summerschool/slides/Ryan_adams_140814_bayesopt_ncap.pdf Similar Question Bayesian optimization or gradient descent?
