The idea that the t-test is only for small samples is a historical hold over. Yes it was originally developed for small samples, but there is nothing in the theory that distinguishes small from large. In the days before computers were common for doing statistics the t-tables often only went up to around 30 degrees of freedom and the normal was used beyond that as a close approximation of the t distribution. This was for convenience to keep the t-table's size reasonable. Now with computers we can do t-tests for any sample size (though for very large samples the difference between the results of a z-test and a t-test are very small). The main idea is to use a t-test when using the sample to estimate the standard deviations and the z-test if the population standard deviations are known (very rare). The Central Limit Theorem lets us use the normal theory inference (t-tests in this case) even if the population is not normally distributed as long as the sample sizes are large enough. This does mean that your test is approximate (but with your sample sizes, the appromition should be very good). The Wilcoxon test is not a test of means (unless you know that the populations are perfectly symmetric and other unlikely assumptions hold). If the means are the main point of interest then the t-test is probably the better one to quote. Given that your standard deviations are so different, and the shapes are non-normal and possibly different from each other, the difference in the means may not be the most interesting thing going on here. Think about the science and what you want to do with your results. Are decisions being made at the population level or the individual level? Think of this example: you are comparing 2 drugs for a given disease, on drug A half the sample died immediatly the other half recovered in about a week; on drug B all survived and recovered, but the time to recovery was longer than a week. In this case would you really care about which mean recovery time was shorter? Or replace the half dying in A with just taking a really long time to recover (longer than anyone in the B group). When deciding which drug I would want to take I would want the full information, not just which was quicker on average.
