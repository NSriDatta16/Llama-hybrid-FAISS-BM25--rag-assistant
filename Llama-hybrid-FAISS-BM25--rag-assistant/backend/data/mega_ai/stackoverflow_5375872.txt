Combine multiple opengl fragment shaders

I'm wanting to port some image processing work to OpenGL for performance using OpenGL ES. I've got a very simple thresholding algorithm in place but I'd like to combine additional filters to the image (such as contrast). My first thought would be to complete this by using multiple fragment shaders. However, I'd like to do this pretty quickly so would this cause a lot of state change? The only method I've read about is to do this by working on a texture and then calling 'use program' multiple times. Is there a more efficient way to do this? Ideally, I'd like to perform a contrast stretch and a histogram balance as part of the steps. Unless I can combine this into a single shader would an FBO work for me here? I'm a bit new to OpenGL (in case you couldn't tell). Thanks! Simon
