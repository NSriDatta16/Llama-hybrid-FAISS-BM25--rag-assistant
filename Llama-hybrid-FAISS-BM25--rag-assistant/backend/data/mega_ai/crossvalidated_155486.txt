Using zero as a cut-off to discretize a standardized variable is equivalent to using the mean as a cut-off to discretize the raw variable. You can use a different cut-off, but it's rarely a good idea to discretize the predictor at all: see What is the benefit of breaking up a continuous predictor variable? . What kind of response would be flat against investor sentiment until a certain point & then jump up or down? There's not enough information to say why in this case the regression t-test became insignificant (at some level or other) when using the discretized version of investor sentiment index. The kind of thing that can happen is that predictor values are concentrated about the mean, so there's not much difference in the average response for "high" and "low" groups even though further from the mean there's a clear difference in the responses.
