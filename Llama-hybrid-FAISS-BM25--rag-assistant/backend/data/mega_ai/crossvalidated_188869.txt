Standard error for Shannon's index in R

I am interested in examining how the species diversity of bird communities change following timber harvest and have used Vegan in R to run my analyses. Below is a sample of my count data. Plot names are in the columns and corresponding species counts are in the rows (species are a 4-letter code). SRSFC1_post SRSFC1_pre SRSFT1_post SRSFT1_pre SRSFT2_post AMRE 0 0 1 0 0 AMRO 5 1 5 12 1 BCCH 1 2 1 3 4 BHCO 0 0 0 0 0 I calculated Shannon's index for each plot, but have not been able to calculate standard errors for the indexes. Can anyone advise me on how to calculate standard error for the Shannon's index in R? If more details are needed please let me know and thank you in advance. Update - I used bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals as well as to compare to Shannon's indices for bird communities pre- and post-harvest. My understanding is that bootstrapping essentially works by repeatedly taking a sub-sample of a data set, and confidence intervals can be calculated using these data sets. For folks that have similar questions I found Mark Gardener's book 'Community Ecology: Analytical Methods Using R and Excel' to be an excellent resource. This topic is addressed in Chapter 9 and R code is provided (I used code on pg. 237). Books Website: http://www.gardenersown.co.uk/Education/Lectures/Community%20Ecology%20Support%20Files.htm
