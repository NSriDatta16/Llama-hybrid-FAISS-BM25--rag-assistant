"DeepTree" network with binary classifiers at each node

I need to do a project where I build a "DeepTree Network". Let's say I have a 3-classification problem with classes A, B, and C. My tree should then look like this: first node: CNN binary classifier classifying between class C, and superclass A+B second node: CNN binary classifier classifying between class A and B Does anyone know if there are any existing papers on this subject? Or any implementation? The leaves don't need to be CNNs necessarily, any sort of tree implementation like this in TensorFlow would help me a lot.
