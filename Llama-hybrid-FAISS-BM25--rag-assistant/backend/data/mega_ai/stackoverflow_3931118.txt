PropertyInfo , MethodBase etc each have an Attributes property which has this information - but there's nothing in MemberInfo , because each kind of member has its own kind of attributes enum. Hideous as it is, I think you may need to treat each subclass of MemberInfo separately :( You can probably switch on MemberInfo.MemberType and then cast, which will be slightly nicer than lots of as /test-for-null branches, but it's still not ideal :( if (member.MemberType == MemberTypes.Property) { var property = (PropertyInfo) member; ... }
