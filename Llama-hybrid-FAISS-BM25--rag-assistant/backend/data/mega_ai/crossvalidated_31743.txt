You can look for patterns where, on average, all the models out-of-sample continue to do well. My understanding of the word patterns here, is he means different market conditions. A naive approach will analyse all available data (we all know more data is better), to train the best curve fitting model, then run it on all data, and trade with it all the time. The more successful hedge fund managers and algorithmic traders use their market knowledge. As a concrete example the first half hour of a trading session can be more volatile. So they'll try the models on all their data but for just that first half hour, and on all their data, but excluding that first half hour. They may discover that two of their models do well on the first half hour, but eight of them lose money. Whereas, when they exclude that first half hour, seven of their models make money, three lose money. But, rather than taking those two winning models and use them in the first half hour of trading, they say: that is a bad time of day for algorithmic trading, and we're not going to trade at all. The rest of the day they will use their seven models. I.e. it appears that the market is easier to predict with machine learning at those times, so those models have more chance of being reliable going forward. (Time of day isn't the only pattern; others are usually related to news events, e.g. the market is more volatile just before key economic figures are announced.) That is my interpretation of what he is saying; it may be totally wrong, but I hope it is still useful food for thought for somebody.
