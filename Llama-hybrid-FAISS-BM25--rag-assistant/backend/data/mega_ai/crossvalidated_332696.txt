How to set dual parameter of LinearSVC when PCA is applied before?

I have a question concerning the use of the dual space in the cases of linearSVC classifier. Documentation advises to set dual = false when n_samples > n_features, and true otherwise. In the particular case where n_features is highly > n_samples (82 instances for 55000 features, and when using PCA in pipeline before linearSVC, should I consider the initial number of features or the number of features extracted by PCA to set correctly the dual criteria?
