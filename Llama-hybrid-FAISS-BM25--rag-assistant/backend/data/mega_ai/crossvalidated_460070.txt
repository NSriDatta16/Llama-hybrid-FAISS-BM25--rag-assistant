Yi (sample variance estimate of stock returns for stock i) is going to be too volatile. Replace it with a robust estimator like Median Absolute Deviation (M.A.D) in the weight function. I employed the latter successfully in a solvency model for insurance companies. Also, if you regressed the sample variance estimate of stock returns against log (capitalization), a measure of a company's size, you should get an inverse smoothing effect as large companies have, on average, lower volatility in earnings and a lower stock beta. I would combine this with the M.A.D estimate.
