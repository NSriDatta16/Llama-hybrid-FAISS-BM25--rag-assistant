Class imbalance and statistics

I have a dataset with 5000 observations with class 0 and 300 observations with class 1. I would like to run some statistical analysis, for example on the average length of strings, the number of words, ... I was calculating the average. Do you think it makes sense to calculate and compare these values with a similar difference In classes?
