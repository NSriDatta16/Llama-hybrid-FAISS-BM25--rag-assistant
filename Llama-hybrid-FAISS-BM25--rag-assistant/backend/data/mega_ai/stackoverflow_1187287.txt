Managed alternative to user32.dll FlashWindow

In a .Net application that flashes the title bar and the corresponding taskbar button for a window, to attract the users' attention, P/Invoke code something like this is used: [DllImport("user32.dll")] private static extern bool FlashWindow(IntPtr hwnd, bool bInvert); public static void FlashWindow(System.Windows.Forms.Form window) { FlashWindow(window.Handle, false); } How can the same effect be triggered without using P/Invokes? Specifically, the .Net application is being updated to run fully on Linux/Mac OS X with Mono. Is there any way to construct a managed equivalent to FlashWindow or FlashWindowEx?
