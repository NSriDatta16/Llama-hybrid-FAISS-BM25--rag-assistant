Limiting Access to a DLL in .NET

I write in-house software for a company. I always want to leverage OOP techniques as best as I can. In this thinking, I want to create a Data Access Layer (DAL) isolated in its own .DLL . What can I do to limit the access of the DAL DLL to only my business logic layer DLL ? The last thing I need is someone in the company with a little programming knowledge plus access to the system (via Active Directory) to install .NET Express, reference my .DLL , and start firing off data access code outside of the real system. Are there any .NET mechanisms I can employ to limit a DLL to be used only by a pre-selected host application/DLL?
