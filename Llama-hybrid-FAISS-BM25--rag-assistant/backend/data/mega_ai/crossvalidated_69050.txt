PCA is a method of data reduction, usually used when you have a great many variables and wish to capture information about them in a relatively small number of variables. I don't see any reason for doing PCA when you have only 2 variables. My first question is what sort of data you get from TOEIC scores and DMIS stages. Are these continuous variables? Ordinal ones? Googling, it looks like TOEIC is nearly continuous, but DMIS has only 6 levels. So, correlation is a little problematic (not necessarily completely wrong; it depends on what you are willing to assume about DMIS) and PCA is going to possibly compound those problems. Given this, my first step would be to create a parallel box plot of the two variables to see how they vary together.
