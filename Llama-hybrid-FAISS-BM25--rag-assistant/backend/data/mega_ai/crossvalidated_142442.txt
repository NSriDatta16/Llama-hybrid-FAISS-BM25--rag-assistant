Testing model fit and running model validation plots for averaged models

I have carried out a model selection process and averaged the models within the top 2 AICcs (using MuMIn in R). I would like to test the model fit using both the chisq and validation/residual plots. I'm unsure how to write the code for this, or indeed if it is even possible? Any help would be appreciated.
