You're doing this in the wrong place. The view shouldn't care about the preferences class. When a new Foo is created, it should set the value of :email_preference on the object, and then the view will simply display the result of this. I forget the name of the constructor method on ActiveRecord classes, or if there is a callback to leverage here. I'll look it up.
