Firefox scrollTop problem

I have a problem with Firefox scrollTop value and onscroll event. This works great in IE, Safari and Chrome but Firefox seems to lag. I tried to update some background position with the onscroll event, but when I take the handle and drag it up and down quickly, Firefox stops updating the scrollTop value and it causes some lag in my app. You can try this code and look in the Firefox console when dragging the handle and you will see the values something stops the updating : function SaveScrollLocation () { console.log(document.documentElement.scrollTop); } window.onscroll=SaveScrollLocation ; Any idea how to make Firefox respond more quickly?
