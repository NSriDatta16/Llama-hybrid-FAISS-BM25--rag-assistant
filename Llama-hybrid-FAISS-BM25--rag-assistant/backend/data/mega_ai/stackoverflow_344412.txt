the fact that the environment must be set up which is MUCH slower(atm ~1000 sec)! Well at least you know where to focus... Do you know where that time is being spent? Obviously any solution is going to depend on the specifics here. There are three solutions that I've used in this sort of situation: use more machines. Perhaps you could partition your services onto two machines? Would that let you drop your setup time in 1/2? use faster machines? In one situation I know of at team cut their integration test executing down from something like 18 hrs to 1 hr by upgrading the hardware (multiple CPUs, fast RAID storage, more RAM, the works). Sure it cost them on the order of $10k USD but it was worth it. use an in memory database for integration test. Yes I know you'll want to have tests against the real database too, but perhaps you could run the tests initially against an in memory version to get fast feedback.
