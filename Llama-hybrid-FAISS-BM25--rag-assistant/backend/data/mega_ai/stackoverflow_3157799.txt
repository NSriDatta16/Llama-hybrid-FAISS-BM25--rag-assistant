Magento - get filterable attributes by category

I have created a custom navigation module specifically for a website, but I really want to be able to list filterable attributes by a specific category. So for instance my main navigation is: Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 etc. I then that when a user mouses over a category, they are then presented with an expanded menu with a few filterable options e.g.: Category 1 View by manufacturer: Manufacturer 1 Manufacturer 2 Manufacturer 3 etc. I am able to get all filterable attributes for the store, but I want this list to pull in only the filterable attributes per category, as for instance Category 1 may have different manufacturers to Category 2. I then need to cache these results as this will not change often.
