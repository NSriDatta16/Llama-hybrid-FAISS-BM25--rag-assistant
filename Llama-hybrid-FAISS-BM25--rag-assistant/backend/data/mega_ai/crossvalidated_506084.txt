Bayes Factor Analysis

I am new to Bayesian statistics. I have one group (n=10) with two measurements per subject (before/after a treatment manipulation, i.e., Phase "2" and "3" below). I originally used linear mixed-effects modeling in R to analyze the data, and the lsmeans package for post hoc tests. Here is the output from lsmeans : Phase lsmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL 2 0.370 0.292 33.4 -0.223 0.963 3 0.893 0.273 43.8 0.343 1.443 contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value 2 - 3 -0.523 0.345 68.8 -1.516 0.1341 My question is how can I calculate and interpret the Bayes factor? I think the following is the correct code for running this analysis in R: library(BayesFactor) 1/exp(ttest.tstat(t=-1.52, n1=10, rscale = 0.707)[['bf']]) I am not sure what the 'scale r on effect size' is, so clarification on that specifically would be very helpful. Also, the output I got from the code above is: 1.335257, and I am not sure how to interpret this. Thank you in advance for your help.
