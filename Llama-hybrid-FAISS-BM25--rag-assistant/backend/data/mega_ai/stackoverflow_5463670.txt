A far better architecture is to have the applications call some sort of public interface on the send email service. The service itself can then be responsible for recording send in a database. This architecture means that the database becomes internal to the service and so reduces the coupling between your applications (each application knows about a relatively small public contract rather than a database schema). It also means that if you do find some problem with storing MailMessage objects in the database then you can change the storage method without updating all of your clients.
