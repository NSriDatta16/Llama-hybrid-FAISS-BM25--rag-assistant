How do I use a block as an 'or' clause instead of a simple die?

I want to check the results of an operation in the Net::FTP Perl module rather than die. Typically you would do: $ftp->put($my_file) or die "Couldn't upload file"; But I want to do something else instead of just dying in this script so I tried: $ftp->put($my_file) or { log("Couldn't upload $my_file"); return(-1); } log("$my_file uploaded"); But Perl complains of compilation errors saying: syntax error at toto.pl line nnn, near "log" which is the second log in my code fragment. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. cheers,
