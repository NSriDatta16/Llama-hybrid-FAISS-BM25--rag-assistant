The company I work for uses Vault but would I advise it? Well, it's better than VSS that we used before. We combine this with SourceConneXion which is a Delphi IDE plugin and which supports several source control products, including Vault, Subversion, CVS and whatever else you might think of. Since we're developing in both Delphi and .NET, these products work quite well for my organisation. Btw, if you're a single developer and only want one license then Vault is free !
