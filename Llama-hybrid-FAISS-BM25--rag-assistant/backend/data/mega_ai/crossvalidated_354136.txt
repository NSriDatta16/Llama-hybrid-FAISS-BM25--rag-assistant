With categorical data, the variance depends on the mean, which in this case is a proportion. So it is a bit misleading and imprecise to talk about variance when you can simply summarize the data with an intuitive measure: the proportion. If there are more than two categories, a multinomial probability model can be summarized for either sample separately, or the joint sampling distribution of s1 and s2. Here, the probability refers to the proportion of the sample which is A, B, or C in either s1 or s2 and it adds to 1. You can test for differences in proportions which is also called association in a contingency table. This is done with the Pearson Chi-square test, the Cochrane Mantel Haenszel test, logistic regression, or other methods for independent data. You can also test for proportions of differences which is also called agreement . This is done with a percentage agreement, Cohen's Kappa, or a weighted Kappa if the values are ordinal.
