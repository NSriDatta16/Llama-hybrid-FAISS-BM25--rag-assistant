The crux of this question is to know more about dilated convolutions(I guess). So, I am assuming everyone is familiar with the normal convolution operation. I'll mention it very briefly down below. Dilated/Atrous Convolutions Useful when we want to generate output by looking at a larger field of view. Extremely popular in the field of image segmentation. Dilation is a process by which we increase the receptive field of the convolution(receptive field ~ Field of view). Original convolving filter : For dilation : just move each red block around the center by k-1 units away(if the dilation rate = k ) and fill the empty slots by 0. Dilation rate may be varied accordingly to visualize larger areas. Dilated convolutions support the exponentiation of receptive fields without loss of expansion/coverage. Moreover, no additional computation resources are burned. There is no resolution loss unlike pooling and strided convolutions.
