Data Analysis is a process of understanding the data, find patterns and try to obtain inferences due to which the underlying patterns are observed. Machine Learning is when you train a system to learn those patterns and try to predict the upcoming pattern. For example, Think of Amazon.com as a supermarket and one of the employees as a machine, The employee has access to your data. While exploring your data, The employee sees that you buy some chocolates 80% of the time you enter the supermarket and you mostly visit the store on Sundays. The employee finds out that there are 50 other people who follow similar pattern with more/less probability of buying chocolates. The employee then decides to move all the chocolate desks to the supermarket entrance in order to increase the probability and also attract more customers to buy chocolates. Here observing the pattern and behavior of shopping by the customers is data analysis, learning similar patterns and changing the desk place to increase those probabilities is the machine learning process
