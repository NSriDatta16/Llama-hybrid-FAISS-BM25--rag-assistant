Android: SlidingDrawer disappears under SurfaceView

I'm trying to create a SlidingDrawer with LinearLayout content over a FrameLayout. At first it all seems fine, I get my SlidingDrawer's handle at the bottom of the screen. But then, if I start dragging the handle up and the content starts showing, it gets clipped by the border rectangle of the handle. If I drag the handle all the way up the entire content eventually gets shown, however if I now drag the handle down, it will be clipped by the border rectangle of the content. Also, if the handle is all the way up, as soon as I start dragging it the whole content disappears. I can still click on where the handle should be on the screen, drag it and the content would show, but I need to guess where the handle is. What seems to be causing this is the fact that I have a SurfaceView in the xml file just before SlidingDrawer. Removing the view from the xml solves this problem, however I need this view. Here's the xml: Java: package com.package; import android.app.Activity; import android.os.Bundle; public class SlideTest extends Activity { /** Called when the activity is first created. */ @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); } } package com.package; import android.content.Context; import android.util.AttributeSet; import android.view.SurfaceView; public class DrawView extends SurfaceView { public DrawView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) { super(context, attrs); } } Edit: I just noticed that if DrawView extends View and not SurfaceView this problem goes away. However, I'm using a dedicated drawing thread and according to the documentation (and LunarLander example) when using a dedicated drawing thread, it should draw to a SurfaceView. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
