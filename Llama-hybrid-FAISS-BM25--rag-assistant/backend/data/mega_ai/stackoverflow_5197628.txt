This isn't a first wheel, which I'm reinventing because of lack of knowledge, :). Let's assume, that we implement Human Resources Management System for some organization. This organization consists of a set of departments, which has it's own subdepartments and so on. So, we has the hierarchical structure, and every department has at least three attributes: - ID - PARENT_ID (ID of the parent department) - NAME For example, we have SP in database - DeptChangeName(Id, NewName) and we want that one db user can change names only for department with ID = 112 and its children, and other user can change name only for dept with ID = 34 and it's children. So, the privilegy - not only "execute DeptChangeName", but - "Execute DeptChangeName with ID = 112 or children of it". Another example - user "Xxx" can create new subdepartments under ID = 112 with indeterminate depth. If these situations can be solved with Oracle means without "hand-made wheals", can you give me the an appropriate link or phrase for Google?
