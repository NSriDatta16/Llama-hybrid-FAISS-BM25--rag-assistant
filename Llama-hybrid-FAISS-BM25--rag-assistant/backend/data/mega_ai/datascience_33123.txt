Usually, the richer the features the better. One thing to keep in mind, however, regressions, in general, do not work well with data that is highly correlated (multicollinearity). When you expand your features this way, it is something you might want to keep in mind. There is a lot of information on this very topic (and potential ways to mitigate), just google regression and multicollinearity. In short, Yes. Most definitely. @n1k31t4 has some good suggestions. Feel free to generate what features you think will improve your model, then you can use techniques such as PCA and other feature selection techniques to limit yourself to what's important. The other thing to consider is how practical it is as in effort vs. result.
