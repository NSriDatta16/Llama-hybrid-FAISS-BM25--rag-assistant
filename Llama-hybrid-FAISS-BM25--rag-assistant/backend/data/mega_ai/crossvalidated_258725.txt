I am not quite sure if I understood your confusion correctly, if you accept the embedding principle (i.e. the "manifold assumption") the only way you can "decide" your dimension is to construct a projector to low-dimensional manifold. [Levina&Bickel] pointed out that eigenvalue(spectral projector) and projection are two mainstream methods at their time. The method you pointed out ("dimension expansion") is one way to construct projector (approximately). It is widely used in statistics and biostatistics (say [Sampson&Guttorp]) not only because of its performance but also due to its relatively easy idea and control of error rate for general observations. And not surprisingly, in most applications, favorite predictive algorithm will be a spline regression/thin-plate spline since its performance can be dominated by a Taylor-like term. Since [Levina&Bickel] is published, it has never overcome this dimension expansion method in practice since MLE is based on conditionality evidence functional (due to Birnbaum's theorem) which most people will argue that it is not reasonable to use when the inference is on the design (the dimension of the observation is usually part of design of the experiment, not observation of the experiment). I do not know what do you mean by unsatisfactory. If you think there is one way of figuring out the projector exactly(in closed form) for a general manifold(which is the case for most observations embedded in an infinite-dimensional space), that is an unsolved mathematical problem. If you mean the result does not come out in expected successful rate, then you will probably be disappointed in most "machine learning" publications.
