Disable texturing in OpenSceneGraph

I need to completely disable texturing in OSG. I tried glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D) and also using an osg::stateSet, but some nodes that have textures still render their textures. Is there any way to globally turn off texturing? A bit of background : I need to produce an object coverage map for a scene, that is, knowing what object produced each visible pixel. I'm rendering each object with a flat color and reading back the color buffer - this is why texturing breaks what I'm trying to do. Any other ideas about how to accomplish this?
