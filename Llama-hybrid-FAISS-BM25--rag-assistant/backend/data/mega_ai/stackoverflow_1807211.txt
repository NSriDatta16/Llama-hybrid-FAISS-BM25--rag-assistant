Photoshop style GUI design

In a tool such as Photoshop, there is a selection of tools you can click on (e.g. pen, brush etc). Once you click on a tool, you can use that tool to paint, erase etc depending on what tool is selected. I'm wondering how that would be best implemented in an OO design. I could only think of having a GUIManager that always knows which tool is selected, then when the Canvas (drawing area) detects a mouse click or mouse drag it asks GUIManager which tool is selected and applies that tool's behavior. Does anyone describe a possible solution in class level detail (or in any detail if you don't have time).
