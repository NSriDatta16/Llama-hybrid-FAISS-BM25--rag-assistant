To see how T behaves you should plot a histogram of T. For comparison think of the Z test; if you simulated 100 Z scores you would expect that 95% of them would be in the region [-1.96,1.96]. If you got the mean of 100 Z scores it would be pretty close to 0, but usually 1.96 is the critical value of Z so the averages of many Z scores don't tell you anything useful about where your test statistic will lie. Also remember that the distribution of T will vary depending on the size of your data so when simulating T you should simulate it for the same amount of data as your sample size.
