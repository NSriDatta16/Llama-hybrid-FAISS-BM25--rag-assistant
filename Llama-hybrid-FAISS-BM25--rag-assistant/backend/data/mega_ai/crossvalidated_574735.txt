A model with a better fit =/= a model with better forecasts in the time series world. Most 'auto' tuning frameworks optimize based on an approximation of the forecast accuracy rather than in-sample fit. If you want a good fit from an arima you could grid search the parameters to minimize in-sample rmse, but you will overfit. If there is a reason for the peaks and you want to capture it then you could pass variables to account for them, otherwise the model smoothing them out is the most reasonable thing to do.
