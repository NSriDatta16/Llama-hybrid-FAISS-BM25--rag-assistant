Uploading Azure Blob(s) Async : BeginUploadFromStream vs. BackgroundWorker

I am uploading blobs asynchronously to Azure Blob Storage. I can use CloudBlockBlob.BeginUploadFromStream or I could call the synchronous Upload methods (like UploadFile or PutBlock) with a BackgroundWorker. I am looking for some opinions on the pros and cons of either approach. I'll get the ball rolling. It appears much easier to report progress back with the BackgroundWorker approach. Thanks!
