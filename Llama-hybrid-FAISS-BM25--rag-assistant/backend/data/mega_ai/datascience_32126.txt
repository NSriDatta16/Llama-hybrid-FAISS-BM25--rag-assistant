Looking for a good package for anomaly detection in time series

Is there a comprehensive open source package (preferably in python or R) that can be used for anomaly detection in time series? There is a one class SVM package in scikit-learn but it is not for the time series data. Iâ€™m looking for more sophisticated packages that, for example, use Bayesian networks for anomaly detection.
