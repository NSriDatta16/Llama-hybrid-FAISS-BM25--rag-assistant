There are many ways you could do this: assuming the server architecture supports the WSGI standard, then you could do something as simple as plugging in your own handler to generate the HTML (this could just build a string manually if you want to be really straightforward, or else use a template engine like Mako . An example of a WSGI handler might look like this: class HelloWorldHandler(object): def __call__(self, environ, start_response): """ Processes a request for a webpage """ start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/html')]) return " Hello world! " Obviously it is up to you what you return or how you generate it: as I say, for more complex pages a templating engine might be useful. The more involved way would be to leverage a more complete framework, such as paste or turbogears but if you only want to output a static page or two this could be overkill.
