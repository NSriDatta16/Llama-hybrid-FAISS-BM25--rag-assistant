What you should do is to run RawCap, which is a sniffer that can capture traffic to/from the loopback interface in Windows. Just start it with "RawCap.exe 127.0.0.1 loopback.pcap". You can then open up loopback.pcap in Wireshark or NetworkMiner to look at the network traffic. You can find RawCap here: http://www.netresec.com/?page=RawCap Good Luck!
