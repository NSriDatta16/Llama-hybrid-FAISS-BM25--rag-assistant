One approach could be to treat individual eggs, instead of entire "clutches", as your units of observation, with the dependent variable coding for whether an egg has been laid on plant A ("success" = 1) or not (0). Such data is appropriately modelled by Binomial logistic regression. In addition, it will reflect the fact that you have intuitively more confidence in data coming from bigger clutches, because there will be as many data points as eggs per insect and assay. Regarding the correlation between insect preferences across assays, it is reflected by the variance of the random intercept for insects. The role of the random intercept is to model the lack of independence between observations (eggs in assays) in a level of the grouping factor (individual insects), i.e. their general idiosyncratic preference for, or reluctance towards, plant A across assays.
