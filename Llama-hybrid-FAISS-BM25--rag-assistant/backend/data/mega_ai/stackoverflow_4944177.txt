Resolving Webpage expired in IE8

Whenever i click on File->New Window or press ctrl+n in IE8, I get a new window with a page which is displayed from browsers cachec and request does not go to server side. I solved the above issue by adding following lines in each page, response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-cache"); response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); response.setDateHeader ("Expires", 0); response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store"); Now when i click on File->New Window or press ctrl+n in IE8, I get a msg "Webpage has been expired.........Local Copy............." in new window. Instead of displaying above msg i need to display my own msg/page . I have tried different values in response header for Cache-Control, Expire etc. The only thing i want to achieve is that, if there is no page in cache then the request must go to server for processing i.e. whenever user clicks on file->new window or ctrl+n in IE8 the request should go to server.
