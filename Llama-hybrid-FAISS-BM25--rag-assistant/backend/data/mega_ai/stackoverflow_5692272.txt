No, the WebBrowser control included with WinForms is always going to use Internet Explorer (IE) as its rendering agent. It calls the native library shdocvw.dll . There is no way to change that. However, upgrading your computer's version of IE will upgrade the rendering agent used by the control. Lots of people don't like being stuck with IE, however, and for very good reason. There are some alternative web browser controls for the .NET Framework. They are essentially wrappers for the rendering engines used by other browsers. Here are a couple of examples: WebKit .NET is a wrapper for the WebKit engine, used by Google Chrome and Apple Safari. GeckoFX is a wrapper for the Gecko rendering engine, used by Mozilla Firefox. MozNet is an alternative wrapper for Gecko that claims to be more active than GeckoFX.
