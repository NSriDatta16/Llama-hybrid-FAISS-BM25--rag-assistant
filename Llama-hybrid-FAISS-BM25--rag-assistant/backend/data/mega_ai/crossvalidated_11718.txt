Why would you use linear regression on time series in the first place ? If you have time series data there may be lags required for all series and adjustments for Pulses , Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and /or Local Time Trends. Additionally you might have parameters that change over time (N.B. this is not rectified by Arima structure) and/or error variance that may change over time (N.B. Not necessarily rectified by Power Transforms such as reciprocal square roots, logs et. al.).You might need to update your tool set as you are abusing the methodology of linear regression by using it incorrectly on time series data. You should be using Transfer Function Models (Chapter 10) in the seminal BoX-Jenkins text on time series analysis. Routine implementation of these procedure facilitate re-use of models, re-estimating parameters and even augmenting the older model with newly identified structure from the "new data".
