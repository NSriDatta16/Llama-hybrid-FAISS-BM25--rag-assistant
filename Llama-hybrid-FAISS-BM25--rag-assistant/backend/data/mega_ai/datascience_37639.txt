OK WHAT I understood from your understanding is below:- 1.What do I set η to? Answer:**It is learning rate. As usual everyone uses **η=0.01 . Learning rate is crucial because if you set bigger values when updating weights the it will reach to a local minima and never reach to global minima. Now if you set it low then it will gradually went to global minima. This iris dataset problem is so trivial that it takes no time to reach global minima but for a complex dataset you will need another factor such as decay rate. After a while, when training you will find the accuracy isn't increasing then the neural net suppose that it reached global minima now if you set decay rate to learning rate like 0.01* decay rate then learning rate will be much less and then it will TRULY converges to global minima as the gradient will be minimized in a small amount. 2.Z is the label for your dataset.You should have used one hot encoding. I think rather than writting everything here i would suggest following links. Please go to there and then pick up a paper and pen.do the math.Bang. How Neural Network learns And obviously check 3Blue1Brown youtube channel's playlist on Neural Net. Welcome to Deep Learning.Best of luck.
