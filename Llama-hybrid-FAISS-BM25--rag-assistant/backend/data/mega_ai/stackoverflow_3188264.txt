First, instead of the cascaded if-else, create a HashMap and put each combination of condition and path. Then, retrieval is simply: public static Uri getVideoPath(String cond){ Uri tempPath = map.get(condition); if (tempPath == null) tempPath = Uri.parse("http://www.personal.psu.edu/tmv105/video/clear/"); return tempPath; } You can't get a directory listing using File 's listFiles() as that only work on local files. You'll have to open the URL and read the directory listing. Assuming your server supports PHP, you'll probably be better off adding an index.php that simply returns a list of files in text/plain. Once you have that loaded into an array, the rest of Patrick 's code will do the trick.
