Poisson is usually used for response variables that are counts. You say that your response is "ordered" and the usual method there is ordinal logistic regression. There are some differences: When you have a count, then only non-negative integers are possible, even in theory. You can't own 1.25 cars. When you have an ordinal response, you could be in-between (say) "good" and "excellent". With a count, the idea of multiplying the response variable is sensible. Two cars is twice as many cars as one car. With an ordinal response, this is not so. "Excellent" is not twice as good as "good". The models make different assumptions. Poisson regression assumes that the mean equals the variance. With an ordinal response "mean" and "variance" don't (technically) make any sense, but the usual ordinal logistic model assumes proportional odds.
