I would strongly recommend Lua as an alternative to SQLite-kind of data storage. Because: The language was designed as a data description language to begin with The syntax is human readable (XML is not ) One can compile Lua chunks to binary, for added performance This is the "native language collection" option of the accepted answer. If you're using C/C++ as the application level, it is perfectly reasonable to throw in the Lua engine (100kB of binary) just for the sake of reading configs/data or writing them out.
