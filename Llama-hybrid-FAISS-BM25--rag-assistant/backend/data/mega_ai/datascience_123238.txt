After a lot of searching I just found the answer to this, as I was running into this myself. You're inputting a 2D dataframe to your vectorizer, but it's only expecting one sequence of data. Unlike a lot of estimators and transforers (e.g. SVM, XGBoost) a vectorizer here really only wants an individual series of strings to vectorize. It's trying here to vectorize a collection of features, and getting confused that there are only 4 things to vectorize (which is each series in the dataframe), rather than the sample-size amount, which would be the case if it was fed each column individually. That's how the information is getting flipped horizontally. TLDR you want to feed it only a single column you want it to vectorize, rather than multiple at once.
