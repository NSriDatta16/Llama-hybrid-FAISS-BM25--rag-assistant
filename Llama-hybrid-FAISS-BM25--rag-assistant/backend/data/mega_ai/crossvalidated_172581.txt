Determining the limiting distribution

I just started on a course with stochastic processes, so I am really new to this and I have a problem with the following exercise A Markov chain $X_0, X_1, X_2$ has the transition probability matrix $$P=\begin{Vmatrix} 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\ 0 & 0.6 & 0.4 \\ 0.5 & 0 & 0.5\end{Vmatrix}$$ Determine the limiting distribution In my book it says that the limiting distribution $\pi$ is the unique nonnegative solution of the following equations. $$\pi_j=\sum_{k=0}^N \pi_kP_{kj}, \qquad for \qquad j=0,1,...,N \qquad (*)$$ $$\sum_{k=0}^N \pi_k=1 \qquad (**)$$ By this I get that I have to write a system of linear equations and this is the system I get $${\frac {7}{10}\pi_0}+{\frac {2}{5}\pi_1}+{\frac {1}{10}\pi_2}=\pi_0 \qquad (1)$$ $${\frac {0}{10}\pi_0}+{\frac {3}{5}\pi_1}+{\frac {4}{10}\pi_2}=\pi_1 \qquad (2)$$ $${\frac {3}{10}\pi_0}+{\frac {0}{5}\pi_1}+{\frac {1}{2}\pi_2}=\pi_2 \qquad (3)$$ $$\pi_0+\pi_1+\pi_2=1 \qquad (4)$$ I understand that my columns have to sum to 1 because of (*),(**) so in (3) I have 3/10 for $\pi_0$. I solve for (1),(2) and (4) and the solution I get is $\pi_0={\frac{5}{11}}, \pi_1={\frac{3}{11}}, \pi_2={\frac{3}{11}}$ which is not the answer to the exercise in my book. The answer my book gives is that the solution is $\pi_0={\frac{10}{21}}, \pi_1={\frac{5}{21}}, \pi_2={\frac{6}{21}}$ and I can't quite work out what I'm doing wrong?
