Cannot disable or enable an Exchange mailbox running a Powershell command inside C#

I have a couple of powershell command that are very simple. disable-mailbox dadelgad -confirm:$false enable-mailbox -identity 'dadelgad' -database 'NET5014DB10' -Alias 'dadelgad' The first command is to disable an exchange mailbox and the second enables the mailbox. I am logged in as a user who is in the Organization Management group which has full admin priviledges to Exchange but is not a domain admin. If I run these commands directly in Powershell, they work fine but they do not work when called from C#. I created a very simple windows forms app that has a couple of buttons that invokes these commands from C# code. Running the app as the user with full Exchange right, most commands work with no problem such as get-mailbox -identity 'dadelgad'. I can set flags in Exchange, add alias emails and do most functions but I cannot disable or enable an account. Do I need to be a domain admin to do these functions. It almost seems like a permission issue but the user has full rights to Exchange and can perform both of these commands directly in Powershell. Any help would be appreciated?
