How to display configurable product in each color in Magento product listing?

I have a configurable product which is available in many different colors and sizes. I want the configurable product to appear once for every color. My idea is to assign one simple product of the configurable product in every color to the category of the configurable product. Then I want to change the listing, so that the (colored) simple product links to it's master product (the configurable one). The other way would be, to just assign the configurable product to a category and then list it multiple times with different colors. But I think this would be to complicated. Solution Sincerely I have lost my code. But here is how I've managed it: Set visibility for all slave products to catalog so that they appear in the product listing Override the Product Model and it's getProductUrl function: public function getProductUrl($useSid = null) { $product = $this; $product->loadParentProductIds(); $parentIds = $product->getParentProductIds(); if(count($parentIds) > 0 && $product->getTypeId() == Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Type::TYPE_SIMPLE) { $parent = Mage::getModel("catalog/product")->setId($parentIds[0])->load(); return $this->getUrlModel()->getProductUrl($parent, $useSid); } return $this->getUrlModel()->getProductUrl($product, $useSid); } This way each slave product links to it's master product. The tricky part is to attach the attributes to the url. You can add #attributecode1=value1&attributecode2=value2 to the url to preselect the attribute select boxes. I only had this part quick & dirty and am pretty sure someone can do this much better.
