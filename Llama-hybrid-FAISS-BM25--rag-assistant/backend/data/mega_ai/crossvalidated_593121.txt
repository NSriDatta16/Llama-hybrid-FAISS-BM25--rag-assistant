With this type of outcome variable it would be wise to use ordinal logistic regression. This page shows one way to do that in R, with links to further reading about how to interpret the regression coefficients. As you seem to expect a peak at an intermediate dose level and only seem to have a small set of dose levels, you could code dose as an unordered categorical predictor.* Then post-hoc tests comparing the regression coefficients for the different levels of dose will provide what you need. The emmeans package provides useful tools for such post-modeling analysis. *With a large number of dose levels you could model dose flexibly and continuously, for example with regression splines, and plot model predictions (with confidence intervals) as a function of dose .
