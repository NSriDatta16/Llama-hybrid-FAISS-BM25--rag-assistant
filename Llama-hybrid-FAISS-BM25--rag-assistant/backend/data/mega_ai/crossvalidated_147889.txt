First off, I took the liberty of editing your question. Mainly, I changed all "confidence intervals" to "prediction intervals". CIs refer to unobservable parameters in our model. PIs refer to future observable realizations . There is a difference here, although this is often confused. Second, yes, you could resample your $X$ forecast using its predictive density, then plug it into the ARIMAX model, which would give you empirical forecast densities for $Y$. Of course, you should also account for the parameter uncertainty in the models, both for $X$ and $Y$, so you should not only take the model for $X$ as given and only resample from its error distribution, but you should also sample from the estimated distribution for each parameter in the model for $X$ and from its error distribution, then plug the simulated realization into the model for $Y$ and sample from the estimated distributions for the parameters in the model for $Y$. I think that unless you have a very simple model (like ARIMA(0,0,0)), you will indeed find widening prediction intervals this way. Your PIs will likely get a lot bigger than you want ;-) (And actually, you should also account not only for parameter uncertainty, but also for model uncertainty, since you also "estimated" the particular ARIMA(p,d,q) model you use for $X$ and $Y$.) Third, ARIMAX is really aimed at situations where you do know future $X$ with certainty, e.g., future interventions. If you need to forecast $X$, and $Y$ depends on $X$, and $X$ possibly even depends on $Y$, then you may want to look at Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models.
