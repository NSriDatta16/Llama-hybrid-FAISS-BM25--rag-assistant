Reasons to discourage "here" links in web pages

I know that using "here" for a link's text is considered bad, but if I want to persuade business- or architect-type people, what are the best arguments to use? I know it can have some effect on Search Engine Optimization (SEO), but can anyone explain this and any other reasons in more detail? An example: The StackOverflow site can be found here .
