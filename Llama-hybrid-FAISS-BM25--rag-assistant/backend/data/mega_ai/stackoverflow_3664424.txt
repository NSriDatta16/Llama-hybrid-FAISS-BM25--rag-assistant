Enabling Debugging Logs while loading JavaFX Applet

My JavaFX app is working when executed via the JavaFX Eclipse plugin. But when I try to embed it into my web project, it is not being rendered properly and after a while a black rectangle is loaded in it's place. Here is the code for loading my JavaFX Application: javafx({ codebase: "/applets/", archive: "HelloApplet.jar", draggable: false, width: 250, height: 80, code: "hello.HelloApplet", name: "HelloApplet" }); And here is the code for my JavaFX App: package hello; // some imports here // ... Stage { title: "My Applet" width: 250 height: 80 scene: Scene { content: Text { x: 10 y: 30 font: Font { size: 24 } fill: Color.BLUE effect: DropShadow{ offsetX: 3 offsetY: 3} content: "Hello World!" } // Text } // Scene } // Stage In my web project i have placed the generated HelloApplet.jar into: src/main/webapp/applets/HelloApplet.jar but to no avail it is still not loading what am i doing wrong here? am i missing something? Is it possible to enable any logging while loading the applet?
