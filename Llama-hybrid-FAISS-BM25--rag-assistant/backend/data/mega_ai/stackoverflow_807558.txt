This will undoubtedly get closed as subjective, but I'll go ahead and throw my full, unqualified support behind the DevExpress suite of controls, specifically the XtraGrid. I have never worked with another control that had as much speed, customizability, and both reliable and robust designer support. I'm using Telerik in my current job, and while the version I have now is lightyears better than the version I started with, I still don't think it holds a candle to DevExpress's offering.
