Ordinal response and ordinal predictors

I have recently applied a questionnaire to our students to understand their likelihood to use SCRUM for future projects in their curricula. Most of the predictors and the response variable are 5-point Likert scales. I would like to understand how to proceed in a regression context. I understand that I might need, for example, to apply an ordinal logistic regression, but how should I treat the predictors? As continuous variables (bias)? With dummies (difficult to interpret, bad coding)? Is there some particular model suited to this task? I am currently using the ordinal package in R to fit a cumulative link model ( clm ), but I am not completely sure it is the best way to proceed (nor do I completely understand the underlying assumptions). Somebody in another thread suggested using ordPens , but it seems to ask for a numeric variables (confusing me), while asking for a parameter $\lambda$ that I do not really know how to select (best from a set of options).
