ASP.Net get columns with values, add them and then divide

I've got some code which is working as it should but it just seems like a bit of a round about way in doing it and wondered if anyone had any ideas of how to tidy it up Here's my code Dim TotalNumber As Double Dim NumberFilled As String NumberFilled = Nothing For x = 0 To drCode2a.Tables(0).Columns.Count - 1 If Not drCode2a.Tables(0).Rows(0)(x).ToString() = "0" Then NumberFilled += drCode2a.Tables(0).Rows(0)(x).ToString() & "-" TotalNumber = TotalNumber + drCode2a.Tables(0).Rows(0)(x).ToString() End If Next Dim delimiters As Char() = New Char() {"-"c} Dim TotalNumberFilled As String() = NumberFilled.Split(delimiters, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) Dim AverageRating As Double = TotalNumber / TotalNumberFilled.Length Response.Write(NumberFilled & " " & TotalNumber & " " & AverageRating) Basically for my example NumberFilled = "1-2-" and TotalNumber = 3 and AverageRating = 1.5 It shows that 2 columns were filled out and the total they equal is 3 so the average = 1.5 As I said it works like it should but I'd like to tidy up if possible Thanks
