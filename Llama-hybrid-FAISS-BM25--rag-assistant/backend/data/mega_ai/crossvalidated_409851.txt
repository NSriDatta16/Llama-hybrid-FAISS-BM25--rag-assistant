Disclaimer: I'm new too, but here is my answer in case it helps you (or helps me by being corrected by the experts). So, when you look at any population, such as the population of rubber ducks sold in Walmart in USA, you will find that the population of such rubber ducks has some properties, such as the arithmetic mean of the weight of the rubber ducks, or the arithmetic mean of their volume, etc --- these properties are called statistics . So the arithmetic mean of the weights of the rubber ducks in Walmart is a statistic . Likewise, the arithmetic mean volume of the rubber ducks is yet another statistic. The term average refers to a special kind of a statistic . Now, which statistic ? It seems that the term average is sort of flexible and allows it to be defined in different ways. Which I think why whuber asked you "what kind of average ... ?" . It seems to me that the actual definition of average , in your question, is not really important to answer your question. So let's leave how average is defined aside, and look at it as some statistic about some population . Now, what is the expected value? Well, the _expected value, is, as the name says, our expectation/guess of what a statistic's value should be. Let me give you an example. In the case when our statistic is defined to be "the arithmetic mean of the weight of rubber ducks in Walmart" , our expected value of the statistic becomes our guess of the value of that statistic --- But you may ask, what is the point? Why should we ask about our guess of that statistic? Suppose that we don't know the actual value of the statistic (i.e. arithmetic mean of weight of rubber ducks in Walmart), but all we know weight of only $100$ rubber ducks that were uniformly and randomly sampled across Walmart stores in USA. In this case, the expected value (i.e. our guess) of the statistic is: $$\begin{split} E[\text{statistic}] &= \frac{1}{100} 1\text{kg} + \frac{1}{100} 1.01\text{kg} + \frac{1}{100} 0.98\text{kg} + \ldots \\ &= \frac{1}{100} (1\text{kg} + 1.01\text{kg} + 0.98\text{kg} + \ldots) \\ \end{split}$$ Here, we normalized each observation (weight of a single rubber duck in Walmart) by $1/100$ since we sampled them randomly and uniformly. But what if we sampled them in a biased way? Such that $50$ of the rubber ducks came from a small Walmart store that has only $10\%$ of total Walmart's rubber ducks in USA, while the remaining $50$ sampled rubber ducks came from one of Walmart's largest stores that contain, say, $90\%$ of total Walmart's rubber ducks in USA (only two Walmart stores sell rubber ducks in this example). In that case our expected value of the statistic becomes: $$\begin{split} E[\text{statistic from store 1}] &= \frac{1}{50} (1\text{kg} + 1.01\text{kg} + 0.98\text{kg} + \ldots) = 1\\ \end{split}$$ $$\begin{split} E[\text{statistic from store 2}] &= \frac{1}{50} (0.78\text{kg} + 0.9\text{kg} + 0.83\text{kg} + \ldots) = 0.87\\ \end{split}$$ Then the statistic becomes: $$\begin{split} E[\text{statistic}] &= 0.1 \times E[\text{statistic from store 1}] & + 0.9 \times E[\text{statistic from store 2}] \\ &= 0.1 \times 1 & + 0.9 \times 0.87 \\ \end{split}$$ As you see, our guess of the statistic, aka the expected value of the statistic, changes based on the information that we have. E.g. initially our guess of the statistic was simply the arithmetic mean of the $100$ samples, and it was a good guess since the the samples were uniformly and randomly taken. But then, as got other information saying that our samples are biased, we calculated our guess (i.e. expected value) differently. So back to your question. What is the difference between the expected value, and the average? The difference is that: The expected value is a guess for a statistic's value. The average could be a guess, i.e. an expected value, because sometimes average is used to calculate such guess. But average could be the statistic itself that we try to measure (e.g. if we define average to be the arithmetic mean of rubber ducks weight in all Walmart stores in USA). In other words, your question sounds like: what's the difference between an orange, and fruit. Maybe not exactly, but I hope it gives you an idea.
