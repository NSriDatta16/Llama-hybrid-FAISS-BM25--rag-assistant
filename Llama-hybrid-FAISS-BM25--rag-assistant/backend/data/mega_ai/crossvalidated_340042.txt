How does model averaging with a categorical variable work?

I have a series of models (~14) which do not include a categorical variable. One model (#15) however, does have a categorical variable with 3 levels. Normally for this model one of the categories becomes the intercept (typically based on alphabetical order). Simple enough. But what happens when I model average? The other two categories are dependent on this intercept for context, but model averaging will change the intercept! I wish to use full averaging using R package 'MuMIn' if that helps at all.
