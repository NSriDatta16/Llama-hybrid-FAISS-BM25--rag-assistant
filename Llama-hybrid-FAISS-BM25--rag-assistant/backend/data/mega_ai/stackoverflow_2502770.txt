Unsure if there is a more elegant way or not (I couldn't seem to find one), but those strings are stored in %windir%\System32\Shell32.dll . Theoretically, you could merely read that file in and extract the appropriate strings. Seems a bit hacky-ish, but should get the job done. Here's a link to an article that discusses where they live in said file: http://www.askvg.com/customize-new-folder-and-new-shortcut-text-in-windows-xp/ Seems like there could or even should be an interface to them via the Windows API, but trolling through the documentation I couldn't find one. Perhaps you'll have more luck.
