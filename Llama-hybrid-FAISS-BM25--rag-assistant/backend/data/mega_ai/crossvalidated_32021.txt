I agree with Douglas Zare; I don't think there's an answer to this problem as stated, although I will approach my discussion more laboriously. Suppose team A and team B are rated on an Elo system (originally used for chess but now used in many sports contexts) and have a 58% and 54% win percentage against teams with an average rating of X. For discussion, let X=1500, although the number doesn't matter. Then the rating of A is 1556 and the rating of B is 1527. But if A and B play each other, A is expected to win versus B 54% of the time, not 70% of the time. In fact, the more often they play the less likely it is that A beats B in at least 70% of the games. For more discussion and the key equations, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system
