For 3-10 second sound files, you can just serve them as any other file. If you have 100 of them, it will not amount to much storage. They are easily transmitted over http. I don't think you need a service or site for that amount of data. There's a jQuery plugin that plays sound . Embed that into your web pages and you're done.
