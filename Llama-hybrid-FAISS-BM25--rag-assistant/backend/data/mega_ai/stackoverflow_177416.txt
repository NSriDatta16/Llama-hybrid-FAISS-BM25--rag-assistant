Why don't you apply an extension method on IQueryable called ApplyBaseEntryFilter() which would apply this filter and return an IQueryable . This is an example of how to reuse linq query fragments. Using extension methods on IQueryable is a great way to re-use queries as you should neve rneed to copy and paste query fragments around your application, hope that helps.
