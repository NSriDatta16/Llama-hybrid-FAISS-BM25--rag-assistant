Time series: one I(1) and one I(0) variable, should I use VAR/VEC, test for cointegration?

Like the title says, I've got two time series, one is stationary to begin with and thus has no unit root, the other time serie is stationary after one-time differencing. I want to create a model out of this and I know that when unit roots are present, I should test for cointegration. But I've read in Engle & Granger (1987) that cointegration tests are only to be done when you have two or more I(1) variables, is that correct? So I cannot find in literature if I should now use a VAR model on differences or test for cointegration and perhaps do a Vector Error Correction model. Can anyone help me? I would be very thankful!
