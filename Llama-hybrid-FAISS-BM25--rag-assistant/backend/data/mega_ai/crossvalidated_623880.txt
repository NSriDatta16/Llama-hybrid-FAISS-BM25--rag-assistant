These are important concepts that are in many ways more fundamental than statistics, they are about philosophy of science. I know only a little about this, so what follows is mainly a summary of my thinking and not an expert answer. Theories are organising frameworks that contain several related ideas. A single theory can lead to or contain several hypotheses . A hypothesis is much more specific: it is an explanation for a phenomenon that includes a specific mechanism. Note that these are research or scientific hypotheses , not the statistical hypotheses that we frame in our models 1 . A research or scientific hypothesis has to be translated into a statistical hypothesis to be amenable to quantitative analysis (or perhaps 'quantitative falsification', to coin a phrase). I've yet to find a good discussion about how best to go about this; it is an interesting and complex challenge. A hypothesis can lead to one or more predictions , which can be tested. The more specific and novel the predictions that arise from a hypothesis, the more useful that hypothesis is. If a precise prediction is found to be wrong through appropriate experimentation or observation, we can judge the hypothesis to be incorrect i.e. falsified . This falsification step usually involves statistical analysis but it not may require it, especially if a single observation is sufficient for falsification (this can be captured using Bayesian philosophy/approaches, but it may not be needed). The proverbial black swan is of course the usual go-to example for the power of a single observation. Real-world examples are harder to come by, but Eddington's observation of light bending around the sun during a solar eclipse (predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity) might be one; I don't know enough about the details to be sure though. I've found Popper's essay on Science as Falsification 2 to be a short, clear and insightful exposition of this viewpoint. His vision is an excellent goal for science to aspire to, even if it is an incomplete or incorrect description of how science actually functions. It's a strongly contested view, and I'd encourage looking at alternate viewpoints as well. I find 'theory' and 'testable' are harder to pin down than the other terms. Especially the latter - one can in principle refer to theories or predictions as testable, which muddies the waters somewhat. On this front, Kuhn and Lakatos raised important and interesting ideas about how it is that theories rise and fall. The processes they describe have a strong social dynamic and are much messier than the Popperian falsification of hypotheses described above. Hypotheses that form part of a theory can be falsified while the theory itself survives in some reduced or modified form, for example. Often, the theory is jettisoned only when a substantial portion of its core ideas are falsified or replaced by a theory that improves on it - by making new predictions, or more precise and accurate ones. 1 I think statistics has done science a disservice by causing so much confusion around the term 'hypothesis'. Null hypothesis statistical testing has arguably led to a great deal of poor science in part because people think that they are pursuing some high scientific goal by 'testing hypotheses' even though it's the uninteresting kind of hypotheses. 2 Popper, K. R. (1963). Science as falsification. Conjectures and refutations, 1(1963), 33-39.
