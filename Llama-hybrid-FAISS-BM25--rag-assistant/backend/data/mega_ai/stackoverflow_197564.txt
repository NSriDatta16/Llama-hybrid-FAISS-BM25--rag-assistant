Hey there, We've used Castle Windsor Interceptors, based on this article: http://www.davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2007/03/14/CastleWindsorAOPPolicyInjectionApplicationBlock.aspx as well as the one mentioned above. I found the whole thing pretty easy and it's a very elegant way to do AOP. However.... Careful with the performance though. Using interception creates a dynamic proxy that will definitely slow things down. Based on our benchmarks using a 500 Node computing farm we saw a performance decrease of about 30% by using interception in Windsor, this was outside what we were doing inside the interception as well (essentially logging method calls and params passed in to our methdods). and simply removing the interception sped the whole app up quite a bit. Careful you don't make your expensive calls really expensive. :) If I were you I would look to cache at a different level, probably by implementing an IRepository type pattern and then backing that with various caching strategies where appropriate. Good luck, -- Matt.
