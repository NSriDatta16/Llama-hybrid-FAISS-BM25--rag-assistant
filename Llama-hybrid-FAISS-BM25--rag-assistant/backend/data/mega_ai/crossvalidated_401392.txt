To control for a variable, one can equalize two groups on a relevant trait and then compare the difference on the issue you're researching. I can only explain this with an example, not formally, B-school is years in the past, so there. If you would say: Brazil is richer than Switzerland because Brasil has a national income of 3524 billion $ and Switzerland just 551 billion you would be correct in absolute terms, but anyone over 12 with a passing knowledge about the world would suspect that there's something wrong with that statement, too. It would be better to elevate Switzerlands population to that of Brasil and then compare income again. So, if Switzerlands population was the size of Brazils their income would be: (210 million / 8,5 million) * 551 billion dollars = 13612 billion dollars This makes them about 4 times as rich as Brazil with 3524 billion dollars. And yes, you can also take the per capita approach, where you compare average incomes. But the above approach, you can apply that several times.
