Here is a document about your issue: http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/LalouxPCA.pdf The idea is simple, you calculate the Marcenko-Pastur distribution with a modified variance of the elements of the matrix. The modified variance simply correspond to the variance explained by other eigenvalue than the first one. As said by john, you have to replace $\sigma^2$ by $(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}-\sum_{j=1}^{J}\lambda_{j})/n$ for the first $J$ eigenvalues. If you have normalized your problem and you only want to remove the first component, you have to replace $\sigma^2$ by $\frac{1-\lambda_{1}}{n}$. You will obtain: $$ \rho'(\lambda)= \frac{nQ}{2\pi(1-\lambda_{1})}(\frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_{max}-\lambda)(\lambda-\lambda_{min})}}{\lambda}) $$ With: $$ \lambda_{min/max}= \frac{n}{(1-\lambda_{1})}(1+\frac{1}{Q}\pm2\sqrt{\frac{1}{Q}}) $$ As there is probably more information in your matrix than just one big eigenvalue and noise, you will observe some difference. For exemple in market correlation studies we can observe a leakage of the eigenvalues by the upper edge of the spectrum. (It corresponds to financial sectors). Another approach mentioned in the document is to consider $\sigma^2$ as a single parameter in the marcenko pastur distribution. You then have to adjust this parameter to fit your curve. For more information useful techniques and references, you can take a look at: http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0507111
