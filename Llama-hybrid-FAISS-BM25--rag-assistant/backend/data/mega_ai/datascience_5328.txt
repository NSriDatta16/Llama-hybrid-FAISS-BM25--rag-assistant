use classification to improve clustering

I am from information security field, and have some introductory level understanding of machine learning field. My problem is to identify behavioural patterns from network traffic. If I use supervised learning ( classification ) the results are very promising but I encounter of a problem of missing out a pattern with slight change in behaviour. And If I use clustering then i need to do a much work on manual tuning of centroids position to get better clusters. I am thinking to ensemble classification and clustering and use classification output to tune cluster centroids. Is this is a good idea to address the problem?
