Random forest variance

I've been using RFs for about a month now (no experience before). What I've noticed so far that if I keep the configuration of a RF (number of trees, objective function, split conditions, etc) and rerun on the same data, I get very different results every time I do it: false positives and true positives vary from trial to trial quite a bit, which is annoying because I want a stable, predictable result. Is there any way to control it? Intuitively increase in tree number should take care of the problem, but it doesn't. I'd appreciate suggestions on this.
