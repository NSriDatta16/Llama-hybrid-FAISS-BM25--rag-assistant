Is the output size of the last layer of a standard fully connected neural network the same as the input size?

Let's say I have a neural net with Dense layers. The input layer has 3 neurons, the single hidden layer has 5 neurons, and the final output layer has 2 neurons. For layer 1, 3 inputs go in and 5 inputs go out. For layer 2, the 5 inputs from layer 1 go in and 2 inputs go out. So for layer 3, would 2 inputs go in and 2 inputs come out?
