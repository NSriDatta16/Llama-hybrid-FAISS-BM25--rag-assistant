statistical differences between time series

I have 2 timeseries representing the energy expenditure of 2 group of patients. Data are sampled every hour. The resulting plots represent indeed the hourly pattern of the EE of the 2 groups. Is there a statistical test in order to compare (and emphatize differences) between 2 hourly patterns? Thanks!
