There's no simple way to do this in SL3. My recommendation would be to use a WriteableBitmap and save that to IsolatedStorage and then prompt the user with a FileSave Dialog to save to their box (and then they would have to put it in PowerPoint). The only problem with that Dialog in SL3 is that it doesn't allow you to set the extention type so they would need to type in the PNG or JPG extention. Both this and the PrtSc , Ctrl + P require multi-step user action and that is always a point of failure. In SL4 there are more choices - you don't even need the Clipboard in an SLOOB. You can just use AutomationFactory to automate PowerPoint.
