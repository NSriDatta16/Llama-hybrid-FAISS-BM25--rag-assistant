How do I programmatically resize an eclipse ViewPart?

I have a ViewPart that is created using a regular plugin extension point with a ratio that defines it's height. At a later point I have a block of code that is adding some more things to the Canvas for the ViewPart. The new items are not shown unless the user drags the edge of the ViewPart to make it bigger. Is there a way to programmatically tell the ViewPart to resize itself either to match it's current contents or to a value I specify?
