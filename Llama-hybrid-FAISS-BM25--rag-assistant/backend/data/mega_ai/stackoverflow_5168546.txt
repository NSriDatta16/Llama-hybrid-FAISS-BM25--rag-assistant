How Do I Build a Mailto Hyperlink Column in a Cognos Report?

I am building a report which shows a list of users that are out of compliance due to not meeting a training deadline. The queries that show and filter the data have been built and I have verified the correct information is showing in my list. I now want to add some "action items" to the grid. The first item I am working on is a "Hyperlink Button" that will launch an email to the out-of-compliance user. The email should be addressed to this user, have a hard coded subject, and contain a body that has hard coded text with some data points from the query. The "List Column Body" for the button column has its "Source Type" property set to "Report Expression" Expression: 'mailto:'+ [ExceptionsByOrgQuery].[Email] + '?subject=Compliance%20Exception&body=Hello%20' + [ExceptionsByOrgQuery].[Full Name - First Last] + '%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AYou%20are%20overdue%20for%20training.%20%20Please%20complete%20the%20following%20training%20as%20soon%20as%20possible.%0D%0ATraining%20course%3A%20' + [ExceptionsByOrgQuery].[Activity Name] + '%0D%0ADue%20Date%3A%20' + [ExceptionsByOrgQuery].[Date] All the variables that are used to build the link are in the query and should be matching up to the items for that row, correct? For some reason I am getting an error when trying to validate this report. The error I receive is: RSV-VAL-0032 The following expression is not valid:...expression here... If the item exists in a query but is not referenced in the layout, add it to a property list. CRX-API-0005 An error ocurred at or near the position '11'. The variable named 'ExceptionsByOrgQuery].[Email]' is invalid. I'm more unsure what the first part of the error means. The email variable is not shown in the grid, but it is part of the query. I can add it to the grid and verify that it is in the query, but I do not want that value to display in the report (nor do I want the variable [Full Name - First Last] to be displayed; it's just for the greeting in the email). ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The List is populating from a query called [ReportQuery] It contains the following data items. [Name] [Organization] ?org?) [Registration Status] [Title] [Activity Name] [Due Date] [Email] [Name - First Last] (the first item is the label and the second portion is expression that is used to make the data item) EDIT 1 (from melee's suggestions): I've attempted the method you describe, but am now seeing this error: RSV-VAL-0032 The following expression is not valid: ''. If the item exists in a query but is not referenced in the layout, add it to a property list. CRX-API-0005 An error ocurred at or near the position '21'. The variable named '[ReportQuery].[Email]' is invalid. I did a query regarding this error and saw that that the List object needed to have the properties that I used in the mailto in a "Properties" property. Defining this property allowed me to select items from the query. I did this with mailto, but it appears to be not matching up values to the correct row; ie. I've set the subject argument on the mailto to be the user's name ([ReportQuery].[Name]) and it doesn't match up with what is shown on the row in the table.
