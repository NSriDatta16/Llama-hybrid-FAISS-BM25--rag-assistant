Probably the reason it hasn't gotten more attention is that the J2EE world has become so used to piling on so many layers onto an application, that naked objects comes across as naive. Where are our services? You mean that any naked object gives me immediate access to the database? What if we needed to expose the application with RMI calls? Plus there isn't as much to market, because it puts the burden of developing a successful application squarely on the application developers not the framework developers :)
