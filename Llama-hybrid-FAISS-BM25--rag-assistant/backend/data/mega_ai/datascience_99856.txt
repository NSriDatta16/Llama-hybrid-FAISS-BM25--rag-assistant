Here I assume that with "non-trainable parameters" you refer to what Keras says in the output of its model.summary() . You don't eliminate non-trainable parameters, because they are non-trainable for a reason , and they are needed by the model or by the optimizer. Some examples of non-trainable parameters are: Pre-trained embedding matrices, which are loaded at the beginning and then frozen, and do not change during the training. Statistics parameters from batch normalization layers, that are updated but not during backpropagation.
