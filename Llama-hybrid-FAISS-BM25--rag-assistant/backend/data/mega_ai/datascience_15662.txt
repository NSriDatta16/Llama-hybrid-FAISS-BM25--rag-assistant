My Neural Network is not learning anything

I try to train convolutional neural net for a classification problem. However, my neural net is not learning anything. It guesses only two labels and ignores the rest. Even though I try to train to overfit my neural net, the loss function is not decreasing at all. My I try to make my network go as deep as 12 layers of the convolutional neural net in order to overfit the subsampling data. However, it is not working. Do you have any suggestion what to look?
