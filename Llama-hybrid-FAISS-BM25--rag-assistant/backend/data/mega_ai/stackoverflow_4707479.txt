The keyword abstract makes no difference. The only thing the specification says is: For compatibility with older versions of the Java platform, it is permitted but discouraged, as a matter of style, to redundantly specify the abstract modifier for methods declared in interfaces. A quick test shows that the keyword indeed makes no difference. These two are both valid: abstract class A implements B { } interface B { public void meth(); } abstract class A implements B { } interface B { public abstract void meth(); } and these two are both invalid: class A implements B { } interface B { public void meth(); } class A implements B { } interface B { public abstract void meth(); } A.java:1: A is not abstract and does not override abstract method meth() in B class A implements B { } ^ 1 error
