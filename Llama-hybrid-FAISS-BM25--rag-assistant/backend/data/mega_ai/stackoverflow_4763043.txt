Using hidden frame to store or pass data between pages

We need to implement a mechanism to persist information between web pages in the same session. There is a lot of information on the client-side and passing it back and forth to the server across requests is something we want to avoid. HTML5 local storage is one option. The other option mentioned was "using a hidden frame where the data is kept". I am not sure what this option really means. Does it mean keeping a hidden frame that holds on to the data across page requests? How would this be accomplished? Are there any jquery plugins or sample code I can look at? What are the advantages and disadvantages?
