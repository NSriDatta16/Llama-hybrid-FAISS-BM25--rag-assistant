No, null is a very distinctive value. For example - just one of over a dozen - null may mean "we don't have a value at all", while the empty string means "we have an answer and it is nothing." This would be useful, for example, as an answer to a question - never got an answer or the answer was nothing... There's a GREAT whitepaper floating around out there entitled something like "the 18 meanings of NULL" - I don't recall just what the integer is! ANyway, that paper has been out there since at least the early 1990s and is truly fantastic if you can find it - I have not done a web search. The real issue with nulls is that they can "errantly" alter what rows are returned. For example, if you say select strcol1, datecol2, someint3 from fubar where ... If strcol1 happens to be null, you will NOT get a value back for that row because there's an implied "where strcol1 is not null" - thus a whole row can be missing. This is not true for all RDBMS systems, but has been true for some for quite a while so if you want your code to be able to be moved from one RDBMS to another, you should be VERY careful when handling nulls. Another point: Oracle - or at least some versions of Oracle - will silently convert empty strings to null! This is truly outrageous, but somehow, they've had this in production "forever." Watch out! My solution is to use some other string to mean "the empty string", most often a single space character.
