A people can have null or many offices but normally one office. A office is in one department and the department is in one organisation. In the simplest case each sub level has a attribute of the type from the next level and the next level has a list of Objects from the sub level. class People{ Office office } class Office{ static hasMany = [employee:People] Department department } class Department{ static hasMany = [offices:Office] Organisation organisation } class Organisation{ static hasMany = [departments:Department] } If you like to know in which organisation is a people you can do this: def people = ... def organisation = people.office.department.organisation
