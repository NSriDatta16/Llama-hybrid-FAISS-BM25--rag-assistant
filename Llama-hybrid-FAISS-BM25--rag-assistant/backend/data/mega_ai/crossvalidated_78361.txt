In a general framework, profile likelihood intervals are approximate confidence intervals. The proof of this result is essentially the same as proving that the likelihood ratio statistic is (asymptotically) approximately distributed as a $\chi^2_k$ distribution. The idea consists of inverting the hypothesis test obtained from a likelihood ratio statistic. For example, a $0.147$-level profile likelihood interval has an approximate confidence of $95\%$. These are classical results and therefore I will simply provide some references on this: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2347496 http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0132 http://www.unc.edu/courses/2010fall/ecol/563/001/docs/lectures/lecture11.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Profile_likelihood The following R code shows that, even for small samples, the intervals obtained with both approaches are similar (I am re-using Elvis example): Note that you have to use the normalised profile likelihood. data(sleep) x If we use a larger sample size, the confidence intervals are even closer: set.seed(123) x AN IMPORTANT POINT: Note that for specific samples different kinds of confidence intervals may differ in terms of their length or location, what really matters is their coverage. In the long run, all of them should provide the same coverage, independently on how much they differ for specific samples.
