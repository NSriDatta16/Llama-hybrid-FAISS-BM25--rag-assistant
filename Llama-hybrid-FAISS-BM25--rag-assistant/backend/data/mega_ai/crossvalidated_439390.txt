How do I know I divide dataset into training set, validation set and test set in a correct/appropriate proportion?

Chapter 3 of Tom M. Mitchell. Machine Learning (free) gives this advice: One common heuristic is to withhold one-third of the available examples for the validation set, using the other two-thirds for training. Note: the part cited above does not involve test set. Page 70 of that books says the available data has been split into three subsets: the training examples, the validation examples used for pruning the tree, and a set of test examples used to provide an unbiased estimate of accuracy over future unseen examples. Note: the part cited above does not give specific number like one-third, two-thirds. In practice, such as iris dataset, mnist dataset, titanic dataset, ImageNet dataset, when do I need to divide dataset into training set, validation set and test set? How to do that? How do I know I divide dataset into training set, validation set and test set in a correct/appropriate proportion? for example, there are 70000 examples in mnist, It can be split in a training set of the first 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. this dividing does involve the validation set, why?
