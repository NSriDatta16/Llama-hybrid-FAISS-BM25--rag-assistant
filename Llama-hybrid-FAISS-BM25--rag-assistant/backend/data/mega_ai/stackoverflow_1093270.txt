There is no supported way to add a deployment administrator to Dynamics CRM 4.0 SQL. It is important that you setup at least two deployment administrators in the event that one account is deactivated. The only option would be to reinstall CRM and then import the organization. In our case we were fortunate that we were able to have the deactivated account reactivated and we were able to add at least two deployment administrators in both the UAT and PROD environments. In order to register a CRM plugin you need to be a CRM System Admin, Customizer and Deployment Administrator.
