The following code appears to be the problem: m_SelectedRTMMenuData.ChannelMeasSet.MeasKV.ClearMeasurementData; It looks like ChannelMeasSet is a huge data structure that the compiler is trying to copy to your stack for some reason. I'm not sure why the compiler would attempt to do that without seeing the rest of your object declaration. Furthermore, the compiler appears to have allocated two separate temporary storage areas on the stack, one for each line where you call this (even though only one will be used at any given time). You have at least two possible solutions: Make the stack bigger. There is probably a Delphi directive for this. Rework your data structures so the compiler isn't inclined to copy huge temporary objects around.
