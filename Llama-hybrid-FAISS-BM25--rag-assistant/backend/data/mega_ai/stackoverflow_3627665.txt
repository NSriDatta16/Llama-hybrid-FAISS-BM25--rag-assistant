It would be convenient if your editor handled escaping entity references for you. In the ASP.NET world, I use the TinyMCE editor , which handles escaping entity references nicely, and you'll find plenty of other editors that will do the same whether you are dealing with web forms or some other .NET technology. As for HTML storage in XML, I find it easier to stuff the HTML content in a CDATA section, just to avoid the hassles of encoding/decoding content.
