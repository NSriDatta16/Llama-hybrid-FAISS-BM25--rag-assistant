C# PDF library for headless Linux server

I'm currently trying to find a PDF library which will run without a running X server. I have already tried the following... Migradoc/PDFSharp (requires X) ITextSharp (requires X) SharpPDF (might work, but I am looking for something with a bit more features) The library does not have to be opensource or free. My solution runs on Apache2.2 mod_mono. Does anyone know of such library? --- edit --- The test code used for itextsharp, which produces errors on my testserver is listed below (the code for Migradoc and SharpPDF is just as simple): using System; using sharp=iTextSharp.text; using iTextSharp.text.pdf; using iTextSharp.text.xml; using System.IO; namespace pdftester { public static class ITextSharpTest { public static void HelloWorld(string filename) { Stream stream = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.Create); sharp.Document document = new sharp.Document(); PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, stream); document.Open(); document.Add(new sharp.Paragraph("Hello world")); document.Close(); } } }
