Placeholder control, and aligning child controls

I have a program that displays messages posted to a forum. Right now, I am using the Response.Write method in the code behind to insert the HTML I want. But I would much rather avoid putting HTML in the code behind (because it is not in the spirit of the whole code behind/design separation feature of .NET). I would like to use a content placeholder, and insert child controls dynamically. However, I can only seem to insert them side by side, and one after another. I would like to have something that looks like this: Table Column 1 Table Column 2 Username: [UserName] [MessageSubject] Posted on: [PostDate] User Rating: [UserRating] But the only thing I can seem to accomplish is: Username: [UserName]Posted On: [PostDate] User Rating [UserRating][MessageSubject], without links or formatting. How do I put paragraphs, line breaks, form buttons and regular hyperlinks into a content placeholder, and make them align the way I want them to?
