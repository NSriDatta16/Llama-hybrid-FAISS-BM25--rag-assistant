Your error term is a bit strange because it is multiplicative to time and not to seasonality and trend. I would reconsider if this should be expected in your real data. However, what you have seems close enough to a multiplicative time series to get at least decent estimates: $Y_t = T_t \cdot S_t \cdot e_t$ Such a time series can be decomposed easily if you define an appropriate frequency for the time series. With stats::decompose : set.seed(1) x fit_trend |t|) #9.182801e-01 1.060280e-02 8.660734e+01 2.253371e-29 You could also check out the forecast package which offers more flexible and automated decomposition of time series.
