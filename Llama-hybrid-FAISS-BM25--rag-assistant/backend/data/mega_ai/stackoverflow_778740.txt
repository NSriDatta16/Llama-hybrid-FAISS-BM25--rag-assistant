There is a very good summary here in another Stack Overflow question. To quote the accepted answer: Serialization is the conversion of an object to a series of bytes, so that the object can be easily saved to persistent storage or streamed across a communication link. The byte stream can then be deserialised - converted into a replica of the original object.
