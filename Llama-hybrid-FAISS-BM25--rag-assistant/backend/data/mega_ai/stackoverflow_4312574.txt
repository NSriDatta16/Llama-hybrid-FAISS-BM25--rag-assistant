session_unset just clears the $_SESSION variable. Itâ€™s equivalent to doing: $_SESSION = array(); So this does only affect the local $_SESSION variable instance but not the session data in the session storage. In contrast to that, session_destroy destroys the session data that is stored in the session storage (e.g. the session file in the file system). Everything else remains unchanged.
