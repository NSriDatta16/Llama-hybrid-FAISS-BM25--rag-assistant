First, a change in p from 0.045 to 0.051 is essentially meaningless. It simply points out, yet again, how using a simple cutoff of p Second, a high leverage point forces the regression line to be near the point, even if it is a data entry error or an extremely odd case. Thus, it can radically change the regression line and, therefore, change all the associated statistics. Third, since in your case the high leverage point was "nonsensical" your first regression is not to be taken seriously and should be ignored. If that high leverage point was "real" - that is, simply an unusual case - then there might be more to say.
