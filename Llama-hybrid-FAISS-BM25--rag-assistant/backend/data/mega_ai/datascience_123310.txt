What is a good approach for classifying pairs of mutually dependent populations?

Imagine you have several pairs of populations - 1a and 1b, 2a and 2b, ... , na and nb . 'a' denotes a normal population and 'b' - an affected population. Populations 'a' and 'b' are mutually dependent in pairs, meaning the features of an affected population depend on the initial features of that population, i.e. a normal population. How to correctly classify the populations 1b, 2b,..., nb using machine learning, if you're interested in comparing how different are the differences in each pair 'a' and 'b' rather than comparing diferences between the populations 'b' directly? How to tranform the original covariates of the populations 'a' and 'b' , so they represent both populations simultaneously?
