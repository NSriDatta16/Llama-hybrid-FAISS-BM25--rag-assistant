Rewards in reinforcement learning for minimization problem

I am new to ML/DL/RL. I am looking to solve the classic travelling salesman problem (TSP), where the salesman has to visit all cities only once and finding the smallest path to do that (minimize travelling distance). The Q learning method is well defined for maximizing reward (maximization problem). Can I give the reward as negative of distance to make it solve minimization problem as described above?
