I have to ask: have you tried the tablestyle VALIGN:MIDDLE? something like: t=Table(data) t.setStyle(TableStyle([('VALIGN',(-1,-1),(-1,-1),'MIDDLE')])) (more details in section 7.2 of the ReportLab user guide) If that doesn't do it, then your paragraph object must be the full height of the cell, and internally aligned to the bottom. Could you please post a small sample that reproduces the problem?
