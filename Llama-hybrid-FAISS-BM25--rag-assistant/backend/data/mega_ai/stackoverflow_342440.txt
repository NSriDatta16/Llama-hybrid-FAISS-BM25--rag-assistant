Why cant you use runs? Use runs to concatonate all of the values that arent' going to have events, then those that have events break out into thier own text block, rinse lather repeat. It seems to me that you should be able to do this with RegEx and some looping. Check out Jesse Liberty's post on wrap panel and see if that fosters any thought. http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/archive/2008/12/03/the-wrap-panel.aspx hth
