What is the IE6 equivalent to Request.UserAgent.ToLower().Contains("msie")?

What is the IE6 equivalent to Request.UserAgent.ToLower().Contains("msie")? As above it detects any instance of IE obviously, but I'm looking to only pull IE6 users so I can display a message telling them the site will render oddly in their browsers. I haven't been able to find the answer in my searches.
