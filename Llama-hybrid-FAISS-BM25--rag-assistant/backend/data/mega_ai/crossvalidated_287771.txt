Where does the error term of a time series MA process come from?

Consider an MA(1) process: $$ Y_t = a + a_1u_t + a_2u_{t-1} $$ where $a$ is some constant, and $u_t$ is an error term. How do we know know the error terms? They must come from some previous regression, right? P.S. I've read What can be an intuitive understanding of the error term of a moving average time series? but I couldn't find an answer.
