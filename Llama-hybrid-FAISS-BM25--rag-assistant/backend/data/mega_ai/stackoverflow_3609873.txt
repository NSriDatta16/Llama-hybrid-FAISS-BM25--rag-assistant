Slow performing Flex application on fast webserver

A flex app is becoming very slow when deployed on a virtual (vmware) Red Hat 5.5 server (SAN storage) If I serve a static file with Apache on this web server, this file is downloaded very fast. But the (pre)loading of the flex app on the same webserver is very slow. What could be the reason for this?
