In the Î²-TCVAE paper, can someone help with the derivation (S3) in Appendix C.1?

Paper: Isolating Sources of Disentanglement in VAEs I follow as far as, $$\mathbb{E}_{q(z)}[log[q(z)] = \mathbb{E}_{q(z, n)}[\ log\ \mathbb{E}_{n'\sim\ p(n)}[q(z|n')]\ ]$$ Subsequently, I don't follow how they get the following and beyond that: $$\mathbb{E}_{q(z, n)}\left[\ log\ \mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbb{B_m})}\left[\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m = 1}^Mq(z|n_m)\right]\right ]$$
