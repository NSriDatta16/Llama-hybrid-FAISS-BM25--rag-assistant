How to train LSTM model on multiple time series data?

How to train LSTM model on multiple time series data? Use case: I have weekly sales of 20,000 agents for last 5 years. Need to forecast upcoming weekly sales for each agent. Do I need to follow a batch processing technique - take one agent at a time, train LSTM model then forecast? Any better ways?
