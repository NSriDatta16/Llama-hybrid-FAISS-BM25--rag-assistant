PCA is often a means to an ends; leading up to either inputs to a multiple regression or for use in a cluster analysis. I think in your case, you are talking about using the results of a PCA to perform a regression. In that case, your objective of performing a PCA is to get rid of mulitcollinearity and get orthogonal inputs to a multiple regression, not surprisingly this is called Principal Components Regression. Here, if all your original inputs were orthogonal then doing a PCA would give you another set of orthogonal inputs. Therefore; if you are doing a PCA, one would assume that your inputs have multicollinearity. Given the above, you would want to do PCA to get a few input variable from a problem that has a number of inputs. To determine how many of those new orthogonal variables you should retain, a scree plot is often used (Johnson & Wichern, 2001, p. 445). If you have a large number of observations, then you could also use the rule of thumb that with $\hat{ \lambda_{i} }$ as the $i^{th}$ largest estimated eigenvalue only use up to and including those values where $\frac{ \hat{ \lambda_{i} } }{p}$ are greater than or equal to one (Johnson & Wichern, 2001, p. 451).
