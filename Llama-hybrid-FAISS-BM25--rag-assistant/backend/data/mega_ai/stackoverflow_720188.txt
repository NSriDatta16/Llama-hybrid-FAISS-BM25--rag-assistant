Not sure what exactly the problem is. (Java is designed to be fairly platform agnostic.) Take a look at java.io.File static constant pathSeparator, pathSeparatorChar, and separator, and separatorChar. If you have a constant tree structure for how you are organizing your resources (i.e. in dot format: resources.data.test.woof.txt), you can use the File.separatorChar instead of the '.' and you have your system specific path. Also, don't neglect the very informative System.getProperty() method. That should be sufficient to walk any path on any FS.
