That is just not the way strings / array work, in PHP. In PHP, "a" and "A" are two different strings . Array keys are either integers or strings. So, $a["a"] and $a["A"] point to two distinct entries in the array. You have two possible solutions : Either always using lower-case (or upper-case) keys -- which is probably the best solution. Or search through all the array for a possible matching key, each time you want to access an entry -- which is a bad solution, as you'll have to loop over (in average) half the array, instead of doing a fast access by key. In the first case, you'll have to use strtolower() each time you want to access an array-item : $array[strtolower('KEY')] = 153; echo $array[strtolower('KEY')]; In the second case, mabe something like this might work : (Well, this is a not-tested idea ; but it might serve you as a basis) if (isset($array['key'])) { // use the value -- found by key-access (fast) } else { // search for the key -- looping over the array (slow) foreach ($array as $upperKey => $value) { if (strtolower($upperKey) == 'key') { // You've found the correct key // => use the value } } } But, again it is a bad solution !
