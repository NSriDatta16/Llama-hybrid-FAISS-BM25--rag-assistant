Read/write file to internal private storage

I'm porting the application from Symbian/iPhone to Android, part of which is saving some data into file. I used the FileOutputStream to save the file into private folder /data/data/package_name/files : FileOutputStream fos = iContext.openFileOutput( IDS_LIST_FILE_NAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE ); fos.write( data.getBytes() ); fos.close(); Now I am looking for a way how to load them. I am using the FileInputStream , but it allows me to read the file byte by byte, which is pretty inefficient: int ch; StringBuffer fileContent = new StringBuffer(""); FileInputStream fis = iContext.openFileInput( IDS_LIST_FILE_NAME ); while( (ch = fis.read()) != -1) fileContent.append((char)ch); String data = new String(fileContent); So my question is how to read the file using better way?
