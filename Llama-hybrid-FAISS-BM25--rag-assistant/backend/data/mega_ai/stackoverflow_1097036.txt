Puzzles are interesting, but for the pragmatic programmer who does not want to think about (or more importantly depend on) the more arcane aspects of garbage collection, would setting data1 = null as soon as it is no longer needed solve the problem? If so, I'd rather do that then weird synchronized block and dummy variable magic. Of course, it is sad that the memory does not get freed as soon as the array goes out of scope, which is what people were hoping for in this thread . This should be fixed in the JVM.
