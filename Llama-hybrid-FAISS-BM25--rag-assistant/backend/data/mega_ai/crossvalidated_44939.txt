Prediction model problem

I am trying to design a model that can estimate the number of customers I will receive in every store every month using the number of customers I received every month in every store for the last five years up to and including the day before's numbers. How can I even approach this from a programming perspective? What kind of a mathematical representation would be best in this case? I want the model to always pull the last five years' information, including the day prior. I estimated (forecasted) how many customers I will receive every month for each store; however, for some reason, the number is not always right. I want to be able to pull information as recent as the last five years but including the first ten days of the month in order to predict the remainder of the month's traffic. Essentially, I need the most recent information included in my prediction, meaning using all information including "yesterday's". I am thinking of using the Poisson GLM or Poisson time series but I am trying to avoid the time series regression. Any suggestions or ideas on where to search for an answer or on how to solve this? I am using SAS.
