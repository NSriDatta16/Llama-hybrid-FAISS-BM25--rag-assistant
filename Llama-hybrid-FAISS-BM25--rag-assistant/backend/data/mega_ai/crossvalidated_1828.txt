I think that this is best described with the following picture (in this case showing k-fold cross-validation): Cross-validation is a technique used to protect against overfitting in a predictive model, particularly in a case where the amount of data may be limited. In cross-validation, you make a fixed number of folds (or partitions) of the data, run the analysis on each fold, and then average the overall error estimate.
