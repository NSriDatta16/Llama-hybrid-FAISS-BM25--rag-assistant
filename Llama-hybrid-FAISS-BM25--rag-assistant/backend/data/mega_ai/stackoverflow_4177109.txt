How to organise, test, document and package a Clojure project

I've been learning some Clojure, and I currently have a single .clj file which I edit in a text editor and which I execute on the command line. Where can I find a guide on the practical aspects of scaling this up to larger programs/libraries? How should I lay out multiple .clj files on the filesystem? How should I organize and execute test code? How should I document the program/library? How should I package it? I'm looking for information on the practical aspects on scaling up from small scripts to something real.
