If you are interested in a very high-level (enterprise architecture) framework, I suggest you to take a look at the MIKE2.0 Methodology . Being an information management framework, MIKE2.0 has, certainly, much wider coverage than the domain of your interest, but it is a solid, interesting and open (licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution License) framework. A better fit for your focus is the Extract, transform, load (ETL) framework, which is extremely popular in contexts of Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing. On a more practical note, you might want to check my answer on Quora on open source master data management (MDM) solutions. Pay attention to the Talend solutions (disclaimer: I am not affiliated with this or any company), which cover a wide spectrum of MDM, ETL and data integration domains as open source and commercial offerings.
