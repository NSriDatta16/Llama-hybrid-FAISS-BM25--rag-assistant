Running a 32-bit OS is a mistake; you should definitely upgrade at the earliest convenience. I don't know whether Java requires its heap to be in a single contiguous chunk, but if it does, asking for 1.8G of heap on a 32-bit box sounds like a tall order. You're assuming that there is a chunk of address space, almost half of it, free at JVM startup time. Depending on what other libraries are loaded at the time, there may not be. Libraries can allocate memory anywhere they like, so it could fragment your address space sufficiently that 1.8G is not available in one chunk. There is only about 3G address space max available on Linux 32-bit anyway. Libraries and the JVM itself uses some to start with.
