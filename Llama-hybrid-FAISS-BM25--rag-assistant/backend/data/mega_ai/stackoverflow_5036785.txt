There is no autoresizing for a window. You can centre a window or a panel within its browser window by simply placing it in the centre of the available size using code such as this: var containerSize = [[aWindow platformWindow] contentBounds].size, aSize = [aWindow frame].size, targetFrame = CGRectMake((containerSize.width - aSize.width) / 2.0, (containerSize.height - aSize.height) / 2.0, aSize.width, aSize.height); [aWindow setFrame:targetFrame display:YES animate:NO]; From there on you can update it to stay in the centre whenever the platform window resizes. Listen for CPWindowDidResizeNotification notifications sent by [aWindow platformWindow] . I can't think of an easy way to prevent a window from being dragged around short of removing its titlebar by creating it with the CPBorderlessWindowMask mask.
