It depends. See the MySQL SELECT statement syntax , specifically FOR UPDATE and LOCK IN SHARE MODE . "If you use FOR UPDATE with a storage engine that uses page or row locks, rows examined by the query are write-locked until the end of the current transaction. Using LOCK IN SHARE MODE sets a shared lock that permits other transactions to read the examined rows but not to update or delete them."
