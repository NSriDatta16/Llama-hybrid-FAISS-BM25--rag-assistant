Several good answers already on storage vs performance, but in addition I'd add the nugget that one further indication for me that de-normalization should be considered is where you're going to require queries using self-joins. Conceptually of course there's nothing wrong with self-joining tables, but experience shows that it's one of the more difficult concepts for inexperienced programmers to grasp and consequently tends to produce bugs. You'll most likely ease the future maintenance path if you can design the need for these out. It's a matter of judgement of course and so is an indication, not a rule.
