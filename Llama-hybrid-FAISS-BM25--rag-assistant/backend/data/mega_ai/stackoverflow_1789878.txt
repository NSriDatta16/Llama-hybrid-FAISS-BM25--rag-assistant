The question is, why are you resolving it in that fashion? If you instead have the dependency injected, then you can easily mock: public class HomeController { private readonly IOrganisationService organisationService; public HomeController(IOrganisationService organisationService) { this.organisationService = organisationService; } public ActionResult Index() { var x = this.organisationService; } }
