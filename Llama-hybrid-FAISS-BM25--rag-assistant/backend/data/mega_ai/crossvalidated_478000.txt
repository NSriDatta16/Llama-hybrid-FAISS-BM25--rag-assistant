Interpretation of standard deviation and mean value of MAE?

This is a very basic question but I have trouble making sense of it. I am reading a paper ( Feigin, Micha, Daniel Freedman, and Brian W. Anthony. "A deep learning framework for single-sided sound speed inversion in medical ultrasound." IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 67.4 (2019): 1142-1151. ), the paper is a deep learning paper(a CNN is trained). I came across a table in which the error rates are reported. The error is a rooted mean squared error, plus there is also a mean and standard deviation reported for MAE. Is this common to report mean and standard deviation of MAE? Why would one need to know for example, standard deviation or even mean of MAE? Isn't MAE itself an interpretable metric?
