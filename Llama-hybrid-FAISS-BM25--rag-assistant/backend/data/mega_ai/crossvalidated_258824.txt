Computing by hand vs. R's magic wand

I have fitted a polynomial to a data set that I have. Thus I have obtained coefficients $\beta_i$ for $i=0,1,2$ and have a relationship of the form is $$Y=\beta_0+\beta_{1}X+\beta_{2}X^{2}+\varepsilon$$ between the predictor $X$ and the response $Y$, where $\varepsilon$ is the error term. My question is about computing confidence intervals . I can compute for each of the coefficients $\beta_i$ the confidence interval using the confint() function from R. This gets me three (95%) confidence intervals $[a_0,b_0]$,$[a_1,b_1]$ and $[a_2,b_2]$ for $\beta_0$,$\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. Lets say I would like to predict the average value that I will obtain for $Y$ for a new sample point $x=0.25$, that is, I would like to know the confidence interval around this point. Using the previously obtained confidence intervals for coefficients, I can compute that $x$ has to lie in (with probability 95%) in the interval $$[a_0+a_{1}0.25+a_{2}0.25^{2},b_0+b_{1}\tilde 0.25+b_{2}0.25^{2}].$$ Unfortunately, when I compare the values that I obtain in this way with the output of the R command predict(my_fitted_data, data.frame(x=0.25),interval = 'confidence') , that interval is way smaller than the one I obtaind by computing the interval, as described, by hand. Did I do anything wrong? If so, what? Thank you.
