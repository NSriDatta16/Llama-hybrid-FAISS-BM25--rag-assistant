how to substitute part of a string in python?

How to replace a set of characters inside another string in Python? Here is what I'm trying to do: let's say I have a string 'abcdefghijkl' and want to replace the 2-d from the end symbol (k) with A. I'm getting an error: >>> aa = 'abcdefghijkl' >>> print aa[-2] k >>> aa[-2]='A' Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in aa[-2]='A' TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment So, the question: is there an elegant way to replace (substitute) with a string symbols inside another string starting from specified position? Something like: # subst(whole_string,symbols_to_substiture_with,starting_position) >>> print aa abcdefghijkl >>> aa = subst(aa,'A',-2) >>> print aa abcdefghijAl What would be a not-brute-force code for the subst?
