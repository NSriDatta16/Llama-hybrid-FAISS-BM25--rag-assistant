Have you looked at the Wikipedia entry I linked in your question? You don't plot "the mean of the data", but for each data point measured in two ways, you plot the difference in the two measurements ($y$) against the average of the two measurements ($x$). Using R and some toy data: > set.seed(1) > measurements measurements [,1] [,2] [1,] -0.6264538 1.51178117 [2,] 0.1836433 0.38984324 [3,] -0.8356286 -0.62124058 [4,] 1.5952808 -2.21469989 [5,] 0.3295078 1.12493092 [6,] -0.8204684 -0.04493361 [7,] 0.4874291 -0.01619026 [8,] 0.7383247 0.94383621 [9,] 0.5757814 0.82122120 [10,] -0.3053884 0.59390132 > xx yy xx [1] 0.4426637 0.2867433 -0.7284346 -0.3097095 0.7272193 -0.4327010 0.2356194 0.8410805 0.6985013 0.1442565 > yy [1] 2.1382350 0.2061999 0.2143880 -3.8099807 0.7954231 0.7755348 -0.5036193 0.2055115 0.2454398 0.8992897 > plot(xx, yy, pch=19, xlab="Average", ylab="Difference") To get the limits of agreement (see under "Application" in the Wikipedia page), you calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the differences, i.e., the $y$ values, and plot horizontal lines at the mean $\pm 1.96$ standard deviations. > upper lower upper [1] 3.141753 > lower [1] -2.908468 > abline(h=c(upper,lower), lty=2) (You can't see the upper limit of agreement because the plot only goes up to $y\approx 2.1$.) As to the interpretation of the plot and the limits of agreement, again look to Wikipedia: If the differences within mean Â± 1.96 SD are not clinically important, the two methods may be used interchangeably.
