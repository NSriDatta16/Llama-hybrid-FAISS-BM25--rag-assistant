How to leverage the *C* in Objective-C?

I've been doing iPhone development full-time over the last couple of months. Having previous experience only in OOP , I've relied heavily on Apple's APIs, which eventhough majestic I must reckon, led me to write code that in retrospective looks like a weird mix of ruby/smalltalk with added boilerplate . So I'm thinking I'm missing out, and ordering K&R. Yet I wonder how what I'll learn, can specifically be put to good use in iOS work, without fighting against the devices' API and the whole OO pardadigm ?
