How to open an UIView in fullscreen mode with a tabbar?

this is my problem. I have a tabBar application. In first tab, i have a table. On click on table it shows a modal view. To go back from modal view to first view, i use [self presentModalViewController:nw animated:YES]; The problem is that if i click on the tabbar while is opened a modal view, it opens second view, but first view's table don't work because the modal view is still opened althoug it appear as closed. It's a way to open modal view in fullscreen covering the tab bar? Or also to check if modal view is closed or not from another view? EDIT: I tried with all of this code: nw = [[NewsViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"NewsViewController" bundle:nil]; nw.modalInPopover = YES; nw.wantsFullScreenLayout = YES; nw.hidesBottomBarWhenPushed = YES; nw.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320, 480); nw.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationFullScreen; nw.view.frame = [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame]; [nw.view setNeedsLayout]; but nothing!!! It wan't go in fullscreen!! Any idea please? thanks, alberto
