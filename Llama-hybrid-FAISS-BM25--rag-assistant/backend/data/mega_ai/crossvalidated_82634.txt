Is there an overfitting in the data?

In my training set, I have 4026 instances, two classes and 104 attributes. The training error (error on the entire training set) is about 14% and 10 fold CV error on the training set is about 27%. Does this mean that my model is overfitting the training data? EDIT (More Results): Total Instance 4026 (+: 951, -:3075) Model Random forest (default settings in Weka) Training Error:14%, 10 Fold CV Error: 27%, Training F-score (+):67%, Training F-score (-): 91%, 10 Fold CV F-score (+): 31%, 10 Fold CV F-score (-): 83% After Random Undersampling, Total Instance 1902 (+ and -:951 each) After Random Undersampling, Training Error:16%, 10 Fold CV Error: 36%, Training F-score (+):85%, Training F-score (-): 84%, 10 Fold CV F-score (+): 65%, 10 Fold CV F-score (-): 63%
