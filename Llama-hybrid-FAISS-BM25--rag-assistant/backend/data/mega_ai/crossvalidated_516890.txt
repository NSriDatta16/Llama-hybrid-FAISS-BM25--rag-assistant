Aleatoric uncertainty in Gaussian Processes

I'm pretty new to statistics and machine learning and I'm studying and implementing GPs. One thing I observed in my studies is that in the figures representing all possible functions given the training points, that there's no variance at the training points. If there is inherent observation noise in training data, why is there no variance at the training points for a Gaussian Process? Should there be? If so, how could we incorporate this?
