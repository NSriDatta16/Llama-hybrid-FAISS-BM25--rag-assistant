TFS build agent, same port as team server?

My team foundation is setup to use port 8080, when I am creating a new build agent it defaults to port 9191. Which one should I use? I am getting an error when I try and run my build, it says the build agent was unreachable. I created a share on my drive c:\tfsbuilds, and I added the TFSService account and gave it full rights. I am using the \computername\tfsbuilds as my path to the builds folder. What else could be wrong? Error message Team Foundation Build on computer TFSBUILDS.MyServer1.local (port 9191) is not responding. (Detail Message: Unable to connect to the remote server)
