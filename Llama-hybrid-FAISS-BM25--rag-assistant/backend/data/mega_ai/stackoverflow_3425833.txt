Looks to me like none of the indexes shown in your post are very useful. I'd expect it to do a full table scan no matter what. If you can, add an index on DTE_OF_SRVCE, CLM_TYPE, PRGRM_ID and see if that helps. If you want to try for an index-only retrieval, add ID to the end of the index (so it'd be DTE_OF_SRVCE, CLM_TYPE, PRGRM_ID, ID). Share and enjoy.
