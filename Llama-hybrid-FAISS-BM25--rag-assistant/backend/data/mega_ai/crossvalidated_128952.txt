SPSS logistic regression. categorical --> dummies

All our variables (question asked to students in our questionnaire) given by school are answered by: 1) very important 2) important 3) unimportant 4) vert unimportant we want to use these variables as independent variables in a logistic regression (binary regression spss). Do we need to change it into dummies where we chose a reference category (very important/very unimportant). Or can we just use it like this? I would be very gradeful for some help! Tom
