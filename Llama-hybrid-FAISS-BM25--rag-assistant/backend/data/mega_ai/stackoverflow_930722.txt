I would definitely discourage you from building your own. Think about this for a minute. If you expect building a calendar will take you say X hours, then you should spend X/10 hours looking for a calendar that: Comes even halfway close to what you need. At worst you'll waste 10% of your time with a potential gain of saving 50% of your time. I know there hundreds of calendars out there so you'll probably find one that fits your needs almost entirely i.e. with progressive rendering and all (drag and drop is something you'll probably need to do yourself). Has a license that suits your needs. Most of them have liberal licenses because it's such a common control. If the calendar has high adoption you'll be better off because it will have fewer bugs since it will have been tested in the wild but yours will continue to show bugs across the vast array of browsers months down the line. You really don't want so spend your time fixing bugs when you could spend that same time coding features. If the community is big it might even have cool features that you can get for free without even having thought of them (like shifting the start of the week from Mon to Sun for some countries). You can focus the time saved building on drag and drop functionality and tweaking the calendar to your needs.
