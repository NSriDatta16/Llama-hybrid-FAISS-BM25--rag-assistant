Linq grouping .include("Table") returning null on Table

I have a linq query that is grouping by answers by QuestionGroup. I need to have the table AssessmentQuestionsReference load so that i can bind to it in my WPF app. var groupedAnswers = from a in App.ents.AssessmentAnswers.Include("AssessmentQuestions") where a.Organisations.OrganisationID == App.selectedOrganisation.OrganisationID group a by a.AssessmentQuestions.AssessmentQuestionGroups.QuestionGroup into g select new { Group = g.Key, Answer = g }; When i drill down into g, AssessmentQuestions is "null". I am not sure why as i thought it should have loaded it even without the include as i am going through that table to get the question groups. Any ideas?
