The analogous marginal effect is the same linear model parameter from your general linear model for independent data. The interpretation differs slightly, in that gaussian GLMs (or OLS) estimate mean differences, whereas logistic regression (a type of binomial GLM) estimates a log odds ratio. The Gamma distribution uses an inverse link which gives rise to a harmonic mean difference . This might be a good way of comparing variability in the number of tasks a machine can perform per hour, and puts more or less influence on the same metrics that an arithmetic mean difference would. Poisson regression uses a log-link, and this estimates a geometric mean difference. For instance, in modeling count outcomes based outcomes over consistent time denominators, the geometric mean difference would be a relative rate. In general any model for independent data will estimate a marginal effect. The difference arises when you consider models for dependent data. When you have repeated measures within an individual and use a conditional likelihood (e.g. random effects) to control for the (possibly) of hundreds of unmeasured variables, the fixed effects are conditional effects, or that is an expected "difference" (on some scale) within an individual having all fixed effects equal.
