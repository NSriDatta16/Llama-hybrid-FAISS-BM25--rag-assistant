Well, it's possible but it wouldn't work: NER models rely on indications in the text close to the entity, for example it finds X to be a location in the sentence "Peter went to X by train" because "to go to" is likely to be followed by a location (and "by train" makes it even more likely). So the problem is that the email doesn't have any context information about the category. I think regular classification would be more likely to work, but the main question is how to represent the strings so that the model distinguishes the categories. It could be with n-grams of characters or maybe characters embeddings, but it's not sure that this would work well.
