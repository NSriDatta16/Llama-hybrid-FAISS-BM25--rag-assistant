Reversing a dependency tree into the original sentence

I'm wondering if it is possible to convert a dependency parser such as (ROOT (S (NP (PRP$ My) (NN dog)) (ADVP (RB also)) (VP (VBZ likes) (S (VP (VBG eating) (NP (NN sausage))))) into "My dog also likes eating sausage." with Standford CoreNLP or otherwise
