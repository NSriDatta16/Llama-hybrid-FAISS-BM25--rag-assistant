Trouble overriding a method in Gallery view in Android

OKay gang, forgive me if this question is ubernoobness, but i am having trouble overriding a couple of methods of the Gallery class in my CustomGallery class, which is extended from Gallery. can someone tell me why this is okay to override: @Override public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1, MotionEvent e2, float velocityX, float velocityY) { return super.onFling(e1, e2, 0, velocityY); } but this one creates an error - "The method onFinishedMovement() of type CustomGallery must override a superclass method": @Override private void onFinishedMovement() { // } As far as I can tell they are all members of the same class, but clearly I am missing something. Thanks for any help understanding this!
