What is the best approach to modelling local time series house prices?

I have a dataset of house prices over time and have broken it down into neighbourhoods. For each neighbourhood I would like to create a time series model that captures the local price movements. What is the best approach to do so that also captures correlations between neighbourhoods over time?
