Structural change test for data which is not time series

I am preoccupied with an issue that can we use Chow, CUSUM or any other structural change test for a variable which does not depend on time? For example, one wants to determine specific point for changing pattern of data that is not periodically observed (e.g. age vs. height or rate: to find a specific age point that there is a change for height variable). If these are not suitable for such data, can you advise me appropriate method? Thank you very much
