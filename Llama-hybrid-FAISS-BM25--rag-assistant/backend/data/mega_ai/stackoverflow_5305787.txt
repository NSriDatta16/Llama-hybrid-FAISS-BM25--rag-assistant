Your question doesn't provide an awful lot of context, and with the amount of information given people could be inclined to simply tell you yes, maybe with small, but pertinent additions. Practice generally sees locking occur on an instance of a dedicated object , being sure to stay away from locking on this since you lock the whole instance of the current object down, which is scarcely, if ever the intent - but, in your case, we don't rightly know to the fullest extent, however, I hardly think locking your storage instance is the way to go. Also, since you mention client and server interaction, it isn't as straight forward. Depending on the load and many other factors, you might want to provide many reads of the file from the server yet only a single write at any one time on the client that is downloading; for this purpose I would recommend using the ReaderWriterLockSlim class, which exposes TryEnterReadLock , TryEnterWriteLock and corresponding release methods. For more detailed information on this class see this MSDN link . Also, remember to use try , catch and finally when coding within the scope of a lock, always releasing the lock in the finally block.
