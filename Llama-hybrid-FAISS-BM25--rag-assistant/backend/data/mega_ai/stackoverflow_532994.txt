UI Testing Framework + Continuous Integration?

So I have an application that I inherited and I want to build up an automated test suite around it. The application wasn't designed with testability in mind, and the code is a "big ball of mud". My plan was to use a UI Automation testing framework and create a suite of tests at the UI level until I had enough coverage to allow me to start refactoring with confidence and introducing some seams into the code to improve testability and design. It's a .Net WinForms application, and the two frameworks I'm aware of are: NUnitForms and Project White From what I've read both frameworks pose issues when trying to run as part of an automated build (Continuous Integration) due to the fact that most CI products run as a Windows Service and if the UI uses modal dialogs the application will die a horrible death. I'm using CruiseControl.Net as my CI tool. Does anybody have any suggestions to work around this issue? An alternative framework to use that may make the situation better? Thanks, Dylan
