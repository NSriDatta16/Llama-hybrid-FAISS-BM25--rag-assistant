Are Bayesian and Frequentists approaches mutually exclusive, contradictory?

I often hear of a debate between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to statistical inference, with both sides (although I've heard much more from the Bayesian side) giving detailed arguments as to why their side is better. What I haven't been convinced of is why this argument is important at all. If I approach a problem from a Bayesian perspective, would this contradict results if I had first approached it from a Frequentist perspective? I haven't really heard of any concrete distinctions.
