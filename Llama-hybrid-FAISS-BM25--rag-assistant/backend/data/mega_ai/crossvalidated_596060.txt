Why don't discrete time survival models require a random effect?

I learned that you can use random effects as a way to induce correlation in regression models. Say, we measure cholesterol over a 12 week period. The random effect "tells" the regression model that the data isn't independent: person's response in week 1 should be correlated to their response in week 2 and so on. Of course, you can specify more complicated types of correlation (I believe a simple random effect induces a compound symmetry correlation structure). When you fit a discrete time survival model, you first transform the time-to-event data into counting process format (sometimes called person-period data ) where rows are pseudo-observations for a person in each time period. Then you fit a model for binary data, usually logistic regression, to all the pseudo-observations. I don't see people adding random effects or specifying a correlation structure in discrete time survival models. What "tells" the model that the multiple rows (pseudo-observations) for each person are not independent? Isn't the model treating pseudo observations as uncorrelated when they should have some correlation?
