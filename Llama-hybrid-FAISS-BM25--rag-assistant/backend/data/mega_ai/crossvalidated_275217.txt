The effect of correlation depends on the type of classifier. Some classifiers like Naive Bayes assume feature independence but others like SVM are less sensitive to the correlation of variables. Note that SVM usually performs well in image analysis where having correlated predictors is extremely common. You can also try creating a new predictor using the correlated ones.
