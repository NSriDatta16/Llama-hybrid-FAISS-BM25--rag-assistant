Application access permission to files on internal storage

A question about the internal storage that's private to each application (especially when storing files with Context.MODE_PRIVATE). How is that storage actually assigned to the application? Just by package name or also somehow bound to the sign key of the app? Let's say I have installed application 1 and then write another application 2 with the same name and package name (just differently signed with different keys) and install it (app 2 replacing app 1), would that application 2 get access to the /data/data/[app]/files ? Or would I not even be able to replace app1 with app2 due to different sign keys in the first place?
