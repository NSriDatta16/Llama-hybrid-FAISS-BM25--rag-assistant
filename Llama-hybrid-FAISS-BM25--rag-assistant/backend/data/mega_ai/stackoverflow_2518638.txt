null is a special value- it is not false, it is not 0, or the empty string or NaN or undefined. null is what you get when you look for an object that is not there- not an undefined property of an object, but the thing itself. a paragraph with one textNode will return null for the nodes nextSibling, a regexp that does'n match returns null instead of the array and so on. maybe it should have its own type, but then it starts to be something, a something with a type, instead of the absence of an object.
