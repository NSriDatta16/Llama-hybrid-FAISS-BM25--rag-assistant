Two options I would consider: Serialization - when the memory footprint of your lookup list is acceptable for your application, and the application is persistent (a daemon or server app), then create it and store it as a binary file, read the binary file on application startup. Upside - fast lookups. Downside - memory footprint, application initialization time. SQL storage - when the lookup is amenable to index-based lookup, and you don't want to hold the entire list in memory. Upside - reduced init time, reduced memory footprint. Downside - requires DBMS (extra app dependency, design expertise), fast, but not as fast as holding the whole list in memeory
