The easiest way to tune a single hyperparameter is to use what is called the elbow method. Do the following: Define a range of C you want to try, i.e C = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, ...] Loop over all values of C in your range Train a new model with the current value of C Evaluate each model on the validation set and store the results Plot your metric over over your range of C's If you didn't choose a too narrow range you should visually see your optimal value of C by finding the value that either minimize or maximize your metric. If you need to tune C alongside other hyperparameters you can use strategies such as grid search, randomized search or bayesian search.
