I am using 2016 as a reference point, so it seems to me at first glance that pooled cross-sectional data is the way to go with time dummies. Perhaps. It appears your data is more aptly described as repeated cross-sectional data. The survey repeatedly samples a new subset of individuals in each survey wave. You could certainly estimate a standard linear model that 'pools' all available years together, but it will ignore the heterogeneity across groups with ties to different regions of the world. But understanding that there may be problems with unobserved time-invariant, within-region-of-origin effects, should I go for a fixed effects model instead? A fixed effects estimation strategy is worth exploring if you suspect the omission of any time-constant confounders that may also be correlated with other explicitly measured variables included in your model. Estimating a "region-of-origin" fixed effect adjusts for all time-invariant heterogeneity, observed and unobserved, across groups from different countries. Would, culture, for example, be considered a time-invariant effect, thus making a fixed effect model more appropriate? It depends why you want to treat their country-of-origin as fixed. But, in general, you can do this. The “culture” (i.e., arts, laws, language, religion, music, diet, etc.) of the immigrant population is likely a time-constant attribute of the individuals that comprise the group. Their learning and socialization process more than likely occurred in their home country, though the ‘acculturation process’ starts to take effect as the group assimilates to the prevailing culture of their host country (e.g., eating the food, learning the language, etc.). Treating their country-of-origin as fixed is one way to adjust for the customs and habits of the group that were ingrained since birth and likely influence the way they interact with others and organize their personal lives. Many of these habits, which will largely be unmeasured, might also influence their emotional/psychological well-being and also be correlated with other variables in your model. Is physical activity part of their daily rituals? How is their diet? Did most individuals attend public school or parochial school, and was it compulsory? Arguably, this is all part of their “culture” before immigrating. It is difficult to offer further insight without seeing the model under consideration or a subset of your data frame, but I hope this helps.
