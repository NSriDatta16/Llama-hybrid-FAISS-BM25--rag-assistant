Based on the answer to a similar question , you can manually pass a username and password when sending a request. (And according to the MooTools Docs , the user and password parameters do exactly this.) Further, the XMLHttpRequest spec says: If authentication fails, Authorization is not in the list of author request headers, request username is non-null, and request password is non-null, user agents must not prompt the end user for their username and password. This means you can set a dummy username and password, and the browser won't prompt the user. If you get back a 401 status code, it means authorization is required.
