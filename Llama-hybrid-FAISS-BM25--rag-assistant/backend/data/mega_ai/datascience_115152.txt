How to recall old learning - like humans

When humans learn something and do not use that for some time, we tend to forget it. However, good thing is if needed in future, and we see the data again we do not need to learn it from scratch. We just recall it. For a machine learning model, can someone suggest how to build an architecture which does this. I understand the concept of LSTM but that is a very basic unit. For cases like NLP where we need large models, I am seeking suggestions here, how to solve this.
