Firebird is the most "comptible to SQL" embedded database. The engine of the embedded version is the same as the server edition. Pay attention that with Firebird embedded only one client at a time can connect to the database, so you can span multiple connection from the same process but not connect from different processes. This issue is fixed in Firebird 2.5 and above.
