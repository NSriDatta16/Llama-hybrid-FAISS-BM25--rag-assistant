The fact that the Java spec allows a dummy method does not change the fact that Java does garbage collection, it just means that it can ignore requests from you to do it explicitly. Here is a good (slightly old) article about garbage collection in Java, which has a short paragraph on System.gc(): http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jtp01274.html
