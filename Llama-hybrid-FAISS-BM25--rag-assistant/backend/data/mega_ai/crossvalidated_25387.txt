Problem with e1071 libsvm?

I have a dataset with two overlapping classes, seven points in each class, points are in two-dimensional space. In R, and I'm running svm from the e1071 package to build a separating hyperplane for these classes. I'm using the following command: svm(x, y, scale = FALSE, type = 'C-classification', kernel = 'linear', cost = 50000) where x contains my data points and y contains their labels. The command returns an svm-object, which I use to calculate parameters $w$ (normal vector) and $b$ (intercept) of the separating hyperplane. Figure (a) below shows my points and the hyperplane returned by the svm command (let's call this hyperplane the optimal one). The blue point with symbol O shows the space origin, dotted lines show the margin, circled are points which have non-zero $\xi$ (slack variables). Figure (b) shows another hyperplane, which is a parallel translation of the optimal one by 5 (b_new = b_optimal - 5). It is not difficult to see that for this hyperplane the objective function $$ 0.5||w||^2 + cost \sum \xi_i $$ (which is minimized by C-classification svm) will have lower value than for the optimal hyperplane shown in figure (a). So does it look like there is a problem with this svm function? Or did I make a mistake somewhere? Below is the R code I used in this experiment. library(e1071) get_obj_func_info
