If you want to fully automate your SQL Server Index maintenance then I seriously recommend that you check out Michelle Ufford's stored procedure for this. Index Defrag Script V4.1 It is what I consider to be the best index maintenance script I have ever read. One of the best features about this script are that you can customize the threshold values that you use in order to determine whether or not to REBUILD or REORGANIZE a given index strucutre. It also provides the option to limit the number of CPU cores that are utilized by the procedure. An excellent option if you intend to run the script on a busy live production database. Warning: As with all internet available code, be sure you test it thoroughly before using in a production environment. You will also most likely want to incorporate your own customisation and features too.
