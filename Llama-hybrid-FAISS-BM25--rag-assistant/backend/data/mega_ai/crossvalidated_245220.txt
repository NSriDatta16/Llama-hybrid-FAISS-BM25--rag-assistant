The example problem you gave sounds like a regression problem, since tomorrow's day open is a continuous value you'd like to predict. A typical approach would be to assume a distribution for your target value and estimate its parameters given some input. There are many ways to do this, but Gaussian process regression might be a good fit. Gaussian processes produce an estimate of the mean and variance of the target variable, which together specify the probability distribution. They can be quite flexible for many applications. Here is a good tutorial: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mebden/reports/GPtutorial.pdf And "thee book" with a link to some GP software: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/
