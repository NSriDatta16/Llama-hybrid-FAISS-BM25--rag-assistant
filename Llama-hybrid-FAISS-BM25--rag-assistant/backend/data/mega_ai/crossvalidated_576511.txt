How to handle independent variable in regression where no relationship exists between samples

I would like to use a multinomial logistic regression to get win probabilities for each of the 5 horses that participate in any given race using each horses previous average speed. RACE_ID H1_SPEED H2_SPEED H3_SPEED H4_SPEED H5_SPEED WINNING_HORSE 1 40.482081 44.199627 42.034929 39.004813 43.830139 5 2 39.482081 42.199627 41.034929 41.004813 40.830139 4 I am stuck on how to handle the independent variables for each horse given that any of the 5 horses average speed can be placed in any of H1_SPEED through H5_SPEED . Given the fact that for each race I can put any of the 5 horses under H1_SPEED meaning there is no real relationship between H1_SPEED from RACE_ID 1 and H1_SPEED from RACE_ID 2 other than the arbitrary position I selected. Would there be any difference if the dataset looked like this - For RACE_ID 1 I swapped H3_SPEED and H5_SPEED and changed WINNING_HORSE from 5 to 3 For RACE_ID 2 I swapped H4_SPEED and H1_SPEED and changed WINNING_HORSE from 4 to 1 RACE_ID H1_SPEED H2_SPEED H3_SPEED H4_SPEED H5_SPEED WINNING_HORSE 1 40.482081 44.199627 43.830139 39.004813 42.034929 3 2 41.004813 42.199627 41.034929 39.482081 40.830139 1 Is this an issue, if so how should this be handled? What if I wanted to add more independent features per horse?
