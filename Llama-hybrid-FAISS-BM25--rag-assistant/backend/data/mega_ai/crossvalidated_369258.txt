In vanilla autoencoders, i.e. autoencoders with a single hidden layer, it's common to use linear activations for both the hidden and output layers. You can do it with non-linear activations for the hidden layers, but it is often imperative to use unbounded activations for the output layer, or, alternatively, transform the input to conform to the codomain of the activation function.
