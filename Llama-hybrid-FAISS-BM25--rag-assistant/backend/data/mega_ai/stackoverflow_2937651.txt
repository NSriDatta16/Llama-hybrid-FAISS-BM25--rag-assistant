This is essentially an EAV model , with all of the advantages and disadvantages therein. An EAV model is used in circumstances where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe a thing (an "entity" or "object") is potentially vast, but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest. It is also known as a "sparse matrix." A good example of an appropriate use for an EAV table is symptoms in a medical database. Although there are potentially thousands of possible symptoms, the average person going to the doctor will only present with a much smaller number of symptoms. The Wikipedia article about EAV should tell you whether this model is appropriate for your particular application, and suggest some best practices in that regard. Note that if your example columns are Gender and Marital Status, and you have a Persons table, those columns more appropriately belong in the Persons table, not an EAV table.
