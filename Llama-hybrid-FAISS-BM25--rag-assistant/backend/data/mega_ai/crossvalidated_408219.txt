Artificial Neural Network and Neural Network are same in meaning w.r.t. AI and Machine Learning. Researchers use the term interchangeably. That's why the search engine displayed like that. In terms of Biology, a neural network will refer to the communication structure of the brain. I believe there is hardly any resource that will point the similarity. We use ANN and NN as synonyms to each other and do not require any explicit mentioning.
