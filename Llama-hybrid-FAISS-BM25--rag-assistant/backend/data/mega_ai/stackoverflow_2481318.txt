Best way of storing an "array of records" at design-time

I have a set of data that I need to store at design-time to construct the contents of a group of components at run-time. Something like this: type TVulnerabilityData = record Vulnerability: TVulnerability; Name: string; Description: string; ErrorMessage: string; end; What's the best way of storing this data at design-time for later retrieval at run-time? I'll have about 20 records for which I know all the contents of each "record" but I'm stuck on what's the best way of storing the data. The only semi-elegant idea I've come up with is "construct" each record on the unit's initialization like this: var VulnerabilityData: array[Low(TVulnerability)..High(TVulnerability)] of TVulnerabilityData; .... initialization VulnerabilityData[0].Vulnerability := vVulnerability1; VulnerabilityData[0].Name := 'Name of Vulnerability1'; VulnerabilityData[0].Description := 'Description of Vulnerability1'; VulnerabilityData[0].ErrorMessage := 'Error Message of Vulnerability1'; VulnerabilityData[1]...... ..... VulnerabilityData[20]...... Is there a better and/or more elegant solution than this? Thanks for reading and for any insights you might provide.
