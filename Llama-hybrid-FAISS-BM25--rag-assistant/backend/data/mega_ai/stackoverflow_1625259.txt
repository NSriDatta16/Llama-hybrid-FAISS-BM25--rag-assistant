Slow (to none) performance on SQL 2005 after attaching SQL 2000 database

Issue: Using the detach/attach SQL database from a SQL 2000 SP4 instance to a much beefier SQL 2005 SP2 server. Run reindex, reorganize and update statistics a couple of times, but without any success. Queries on SQL 2000 took about 1-2 sec. to complete, now the same queries take 2-3 min on the SQL 2005 (and even 2008 - tested it there also). Have looked at the execution plans and the overall percent matches or are alike on each server.
