Calculation of RMSE for random forest model

I'm building a random forest regression model in R to forecast sales demand and comparing it to other traditional forecasting models, such as naive, mean, holts method, exponential smoothing, etc. The performance metric used to compare the models is RMSE. For the traditional models, its quite straightforward to calculate the RMSE: Just take the difference between the actual observations and prediction, square these residuals, take the mean, and then take the square root. For the random forest model, it seems that the RMSE isn't calculated directly from the resample predictions vs. actual observations, but rather takes the mean of the RMSE of all the resamples: Random Forest 93 samples 10 predictors No pre-processing Resampling: Rolling Forecasting Origin Resampling (1 held-out with no fixed window) Summary of sample sizes: 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, ... Resampling results across tuning parameters: splitrule RMSE Rsquared MAE variance 9.566489 NaN 9.566489 extratrees 9.654556 NaN 9.654556 Tuning parameter 'mtry' was held constant at a value of 3 RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value. The final values used for the model were mtry = 3 and splitrule = variance. The 9.566489 can also be calculated by taking the mean of the resample RMSEs: mean(randomforest[["resample"]][["RMSE"]]) [1] 9.566489 Whenever I calculate the RMSE based on the actual observations vs. the resample predictions, I get a different RMSE: rmse(randomforest$pred$pred, randomforest$pred$obs) [1] 13.54068 Why is the RMSE automatically calculated using the average of the resample RMSE instead of like the other models (rmse of predictions compared to actual observations)? Which RMSE is considered the final RMSE of the random forest model. I need to have a consistent calculation among all models in order to make a fair comparison.
