You don't need any extra variables at all. The simplest idea -- start with "tomorrow", look at successive days until you find a day in the mask -- is also the most elegant to implement. The trick to doing it nicely is to think of the days as Sunday=0, Monday=1 and so on (only inside this function). Then, "today" is actually t-1 (where t is the input to the function, so it goes from 1 to 7), and "tomorrow" is (t-1+1)%7 i.e t%7 , etc. This is simple and has been tested against litb's code exhaustively, just to be sure :-) int getNextDay(int m, int t) { if((m&127)==0) return t; //If no day is set, return today t=t%7; //Start with tomorrow while((m&(1 Edit: If you want "next" to mean "today or later", then the "t=t%7" line should be changed to t=t-1 or --t .
