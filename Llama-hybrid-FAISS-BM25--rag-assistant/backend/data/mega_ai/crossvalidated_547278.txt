This is what I have early championed which was ultimately and independently supported by Makridakis and Hibon: ARMA Models and the Boxâ€“Jenkins Methodology or I can make it available to you via my email address. Also see Are seasonal differencing and polynomial trends interchangeable? for a discussion of this topic and Auto-regression versus linear regression of x(t)-with-t for modelling time series AND stochastic vs. deterministic trend in time series
