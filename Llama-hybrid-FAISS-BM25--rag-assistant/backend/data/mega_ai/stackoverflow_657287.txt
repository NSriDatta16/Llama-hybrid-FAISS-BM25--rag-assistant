SQL Server 2008 Sparse Columns - Inverses

SQL Server 2008 introduces the notion of sparse columns - where only a few of a very large number of rows have a value. We want to use this concept but the major use is to create a view where the sparse column IS NULL. Not the more usual - NOT IS NULL. Microsoft say the sparse column and associated index is optimized for retrieval of the NOT NULL rows. Does anyone know if there is a downside to checking for the NULL condition?
