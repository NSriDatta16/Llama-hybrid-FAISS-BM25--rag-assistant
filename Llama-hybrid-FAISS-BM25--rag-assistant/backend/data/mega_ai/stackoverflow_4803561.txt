Problem in connecting IBOutlet

In my application, I am trying to remove all existing subviews and add a new one created in Interface Builder. However, I don't seem to be able to connect the view. When a button clicks, the following function is executed (inside a subclass of UIViewController): // Display a list of settings to choose from - (void) settings { SettingsRootController *settingsController = [[SettingsRootController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SettingsRootController" bundle:nil]; _settingsController = settingsController; for (UIView *view in self.view.subviews) { [view removeFromSuperview]; } [self.view addSubview:_settingsController.view2]; int a = [self.view.subviews count]; [self.view setNeedsDisplay]; ...... } #import @interface SettingsRootController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UIView *_view2; } @property(nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIView *view2; Inside the Interface Builder, I created a new View-based xib. Set file owner to SettingsRootController. Randomly drag a UITextView into the xib. Connect the UITextView to view and view2 in SettingsRootController. However, if the above line is: [self.view addSubview:_settingsController.view2]; a would always be 0, and thus the new screen is empty. But if change to: [self.view addSubview:_settingsController.view]; I could see the UITextView.
