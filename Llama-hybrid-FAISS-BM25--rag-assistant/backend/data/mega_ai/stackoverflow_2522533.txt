Using ActiveX would not be cross-browser compatible, although you could develop plugins for each of the major browser this would still require installation or authorisation by the user. I'm afraid you're going to find this rather difficult unless you're happy to cut one of your requirements (e.g. the first). To fulfill the second requirement, you should look into registering a custom URL protocol handler . Then you can launch your installed application from a simple link: Click to open with my app! For users that don't have your application installed, however, the URL wouldn't work. One workaround for IE (since you mentioned ActiveX) would be to have your application append to the user agent string , then check for the existence of this string with your server-side or client-side code. If it's not there then you know your application is installed.
