How do you calculate precision and recall for multiclass classification using confusion matrix?

I wonder how to compute precision and recall using a confusion matrix for a multi-class classification problem. Specifically, an observation can only be assigned to its most probable class / label. I would like to compute: Precision = TP / (TP+FP) Recall = TP / (TP+FN) for each class, and then compute the micro-averaged F-measure.
