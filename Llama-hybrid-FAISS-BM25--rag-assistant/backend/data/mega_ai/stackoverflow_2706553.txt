If you are coding to a requirement/api that is stable, there is no reason not to refactor now, if you have time. If the api/requirements are a moving target, whether to refactor or not is going to be a situational and subjective decision. BUT..... If you haven't done so yet, write tests that give wide coverage before refactoring. I cannot stress this enough.
