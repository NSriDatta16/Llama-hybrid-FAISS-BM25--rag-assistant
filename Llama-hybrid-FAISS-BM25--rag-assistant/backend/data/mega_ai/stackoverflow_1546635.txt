Yes, this is a bad practice, especially when you have a means to avoid an exception (check the string length before trying to index into it). Try and catch blocks are designed to partition "normal" logic from "exceptional" and error logic. In your example, you have spread "normal" logic into the exceptional/error block (not finding a match is not exceptional). You are also misusing substring so you can leverage the error it produces as control flow.
