Random Forest Regressor Overfitting

I'm implementing a Random Forest Regressor using Random Forest algorithm in scikit-learn. Please consider the following performance in terms of RMSE: RMSE Train: 33.67 RMSE Test : 88.01 The prediction performance seems to be very good, but I would know if such an algorithm, according to the performances expressed in RMSE considering both Train and Test, is in overfitting. More in general, do you think that it is overfitting? The second question, is there a sort of difference between train and test error to establish overfitting? Thank you in advance
