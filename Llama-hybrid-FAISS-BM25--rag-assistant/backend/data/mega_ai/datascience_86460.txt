using simple autoencoder for feature selection

I am using a simple autoencoder to extract the informative features and I have multiple Q: I know that the features extracted will be a linear combination of the original features so I consider that the feature that has a larger mean weight (has the highest percentage in the formation of new features) will be important so I will take that features but I don't know if this is true or not the second things is that I want to apply the grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the model but I can't do that please if anyone can help me in this and save my life
