I could think of another way to crossfade scenes, but it depends on how complex your scene renderer is. If it is simple, you could start a shader program before rendering the second scene that does the desired blending effect. I would try glBlend (GL_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) and manipulate the fragments' alpha values in the shader. FBOs are btw. available for years already - extension or not. If your renderer is complex and uses shader programs, you could just as well render both scenes to FBOs and blend these. Using FBOs is a very common technique for allowing to easily apply all kinds of effect rendering.
