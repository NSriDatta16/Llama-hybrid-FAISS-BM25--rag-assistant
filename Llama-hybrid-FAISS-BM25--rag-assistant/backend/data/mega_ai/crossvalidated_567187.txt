Are there any clustering algorithms that produce monotone clusters?

My dataset contains two variables: y - a binary indicator of an event. score - the log odds ratio obtained from a logistic regression. I need to cluster the the score variable to produce 20 clusters, each of which will have a specified average score and event rate. One crucial restriction is that the event rate and score curves by cluster needs to be monotone, meaning that as the cluster number goes up so do the average values of both variables. So far I have tried doing this with k-means, but the results obtained violate the aforementioned condition. Can anyone recommend any clustering algorithms, which could account for the monotonicity restriction(preferably in python)?
