Confidence interval of averaged-regression fit

I have a model; Y ~ mX, where Y is a set of new random number generated using Poisson distribution. i.e $Y_i \sim \text{poisson}(H_i)$. Hence I am performing 100 replications, during each replication, generating a new set of values of Y, using poisson($H_i$), and then fitting the model. Let Y-hat be the fitted values of Y during each replication. At the end, I am averaging the Y-hat values. The question that I want to ask is how to calculate the confidence interval for this averaged-Y-hat, based on the confidence interval of the Y-hats fitted in each replication.
