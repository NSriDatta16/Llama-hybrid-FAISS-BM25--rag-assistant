There's a pluggable Django app ( django-ajax-forms ) that helps validate forms on the client side through JavaScript. But as AlbertoPL says, use client side validation only as a usability measure (e.g. telling a user that his desired username is already taken without reloading the registration page). There are all kind of ways to sidestep client side validation, in most cases as simple as deactivating JavaScript. Generally speaking: presume all data coming from the outside as faulty until validated.
