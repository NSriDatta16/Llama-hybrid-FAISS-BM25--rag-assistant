Cross validation with k folds means you will have to split you data set in k disjoint groups. In your case for 10-folds you split your data set in 10 disjoint groups each with 400 samples ($G_i$ with $i$ from 1 to 10). Usually the groups should have roughly the same size. Now do the following: Train your classifier on $Train_1 = G_2\cup G_3 \cup ... \cup G_{10}$ and test it on $Test_1 = G_1$. Save test results for later use. Train your classifier on $Train_2 = G_1 \cup G_3 \cup .. \cup G_{10}$ and test on $Test_2 = G_2$ and save results for later use. Repeat another 8 steps and collect the results. Now you have for each instance of your dataset, how it was classified, since the reunion of all $Test_i$ is the original data set (each group $G_i$ is tested once). You can measure how do you like the errors. Now there are a couple of things which I believe you have to pay some attention. You said you have 20 target classes and 4000 samples. I do not know about your specific problem, but it does not seem to have plenty of data. So, I believe is better to do multiple cross validations and average the results, thus you decrease the chance to get too biased results. Another thing to pay attention for is how do you build your folds. You might use simple random sampling, but I believe is better to use a stratified random procedure. Thus you increase the chances to have a usable CV estimation. You might also consider bootstrap testing if you do not have enough instances for a 10-fold cross validation with stratified sampling.
