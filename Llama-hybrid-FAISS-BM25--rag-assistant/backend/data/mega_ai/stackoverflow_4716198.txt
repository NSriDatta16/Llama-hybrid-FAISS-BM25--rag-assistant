Why is my window subview showing, but not handling any touches?

I have my UIWindow structured in Interface Builder as: window drawingView (custom UIView) toolbar (UIToolbar) Where the drawingView handles touches using touchesBegan etc. However, when I try and add 'someView' (a custom UIView) which has UIButtons on it as a subview of window, the buttons don't receive any of the touches. I create 'someView' with: [[[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] addSubview:someView]; 'someView' displays fine on top of the drawingView, but the touches don't seem to register at all, and get passed through to drawingView. Why is that? Another odd thing is that the backgroundColor of someView always seems to be clear, even if I set it to something else programatically or in IB. Also, when I create someView using [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:someView]; it works fine, handling touches and all. The reason I want to add it as a subview is because I want a more general way of adding someView, that is works on the iphone as well.
