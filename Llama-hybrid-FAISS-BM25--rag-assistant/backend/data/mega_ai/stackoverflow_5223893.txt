The NDepend team is proud to finally provides an elegant answer to this question :) Thanks to the new NDepend v4 Code Query LINQ (CQLinq) feature , what you are asking for can be written for example like: let staticMethods = Application.Assemblies.WithName("nunit.core") .ChildMethods().Where(m => m.IsStatic) from t in Application.Assemblies.WithName("nunit.util") .ChildTypes().UsingAny(staticMethods ) let staticMethodsUsed = staticMethods.UsedBy(t) select new { t, staticMethodsUsed } There are many other ways to write such query, but this way is certainly the most concise and optimized one ( the top-right panel tells it is executed in 4ms ):
