Strict exogeneity means that the error $u_t$ is uncorrelated with all past and future values of the seasonal dummies. This means that such variables cannot react to shocks to $y$ in the past or the future. Suppose consumers feel worried about the economy in December and such sentiments are unobserved. This means there was a negative shock to Amazon sales that month as people cut back on presents. Big negative error. I don't get my pony. But Amazon just cannot decide to have a Christmas season again in January. Contrast this to the effect of police on crime example from earlier in that chapter. If there was a gang war in December, the police force would jump $n$ months later as the mayor gets tough on crime and the cadets graduate. Now that would violate the strict exogeneity assumption.
