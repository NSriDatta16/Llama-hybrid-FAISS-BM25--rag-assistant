I am not very familiar with R, but from the problem description I do not see anything surprising. You do your PCA on 103 "active" data points and find the first principle component (PC1) that explains most of the variance. This means that when you project your 103 "active" data points onto this PC1 direction you get the largest possible variance $Var(z) = \frac{1}{102}\Sigma_{i=1}^{103} z_i^2 $, where $z_i$ are the projections. Now when you project the whole dataset (1645 data points) onto the same direction, the variance is given by $Var(z) = \frac{1}{1644}\Sigma_{i=1}^{1645} z_i^2$, and this can easily be smaller than before. I strongly suspect that your "active" PC1 explains very little variance of the "passive" data points. In this case your "passive" data points would have a very different PC1, and PC1 calculated on the whole data set would also be quite different from the one you get from the "active" data points only. But this is not necessarily so: it can also be that all the "passive" data points are located close to zero, and so don't contribute much to the variance, whereas division by 1644 instead of 102 makes the variance decrease 10-fold.
