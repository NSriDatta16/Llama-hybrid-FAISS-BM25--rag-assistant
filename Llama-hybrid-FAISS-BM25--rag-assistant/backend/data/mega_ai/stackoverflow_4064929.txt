CSS: how to "plot" invisible text over an image?

Say I have a webpage containing a 200x200 image. At coordinates 50,50,150,150 (x1, y1, x2, y2), say I have the letter "A". How do I do the following in CSS: Overlay the image with the character "A" starting at the coordinates x1, y1? Size the text such that it fits x1, y1, x2, y2? Make the text invisible (but still on "top" of the image so that it can be selected)? Also, say that this image can be moved by the user (e.g. via drag and drop). How would I maintain the position of the overlaid text?
