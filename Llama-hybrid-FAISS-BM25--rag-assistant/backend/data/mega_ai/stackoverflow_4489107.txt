NOTE - unfortunately this post is of only historic interest as, sadly, ASIHttpRequest stopped development after some years. A tragedy for the community. The best answer today (2014) is: "simply, you must use one of the libraries available to do this." It would be, literally, crazy to "roll your own" when there are perfect libraries out there, with literally 10+ man-years of development behind them. So, find a library (sadly not ASIHttpRequest any more!) Hope it helps! Simply use ASIHttpRequest. It's the most-used library in all of iOS and the usual networking library on Mac. Progress tracking is built-in. It is utterly trivial to use. Don't forget to make a small donation to the guy if you can - if he stops developing it we're all stuffed!
