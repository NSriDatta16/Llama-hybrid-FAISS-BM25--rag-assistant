How to filter by more than 1 habtm association

I'm pretty new at Rails, so don't kill me if this a stupid question =P I have the following models: class Profile I'm looking for an elegant way (without writing sql joins or anything, if possible) to get all the profiles that have a particular sector and a particular language. I've googled but all I could find is how to do it for 1 habtm, but I need it for 2. All I have is the following: def some_method(sector_id, language_id) Sector.find(sector_id).profiles end But I don't know then how to add the filter by language_id without messing with joins conditions or writing sql, and of course, all in one query... Is there a clean/elegant way to do this? Thanks!
