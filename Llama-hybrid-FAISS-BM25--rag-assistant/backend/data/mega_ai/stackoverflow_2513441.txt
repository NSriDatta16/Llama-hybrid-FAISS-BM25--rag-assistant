Move application to second monitor in MFC

I'm developing an application in VS2008 VC++.net I want to move the application to the secondary monitor. Not by clicking and dragging using mouse. Is there any function like MoveToMonitor by pressing the button or any shortcut keys. Then it should move to secondary monitor.
