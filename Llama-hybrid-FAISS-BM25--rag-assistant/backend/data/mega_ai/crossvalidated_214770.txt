Model selection in binary logistic regression

I have 3 possible "final" models in binary logistic regression (N=176, Number of events = 36). Now I am trying to decide which one to select. ItÂ´s clear,"All models are wrong, but some are useful", but I have to decide. My goal is prediction and so parsimony over complexity. Which criterion to use? Corrected AIC in combination with adjusted Pseudo-R2? And then AUC with calibration curve for each model in order to compare them?
