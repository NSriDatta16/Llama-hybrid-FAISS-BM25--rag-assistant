If you want to eliminate FTP, you could allow them to upload files to your site leveraging using FileUpload . Once the file is uploaded you can do your server side processing. EDIT: From the OP's comment's it seems to be an automated process. That said, if their process generates the file, you could: Allow them to continue their current process which would involve them generating their file and placing it somewhere where it could be accessed via a URI with authentication, you could access this file on a schedule and process it. From what it seems right now they generate a file and upload it to your FTP server, so there seems to a manual element to begin with.
