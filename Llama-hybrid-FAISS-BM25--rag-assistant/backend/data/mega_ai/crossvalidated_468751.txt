But my question is, does the NN take all series in consideration when creating the forecasts for one series? Well, that depends your exact model. A typical choice might be a neural network $f$ , with the model defined as: $p(x^k_t| x_{ where $t$ indexes time, $k$ indexes over your 4 sequences, and $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are vectors of size 4. In this case, $x^1_t$ is independent of $x_t^2$ (conditioned on previous elements $x_{ ) so the model does not "take into account" the prediction for sequence 1 when predicting sequence 2. In fact, the well known pixelrnn paper had basically the same issue. They modeled images as 3 sequences of pixel values (one sequence for red, one for green, one for blue). And this had the same issue -- the blue value of a pixel may depend in some way on the red value. So, their model takes this into account by defining: $p(x^k_t| x_{ , allowing the neural network to learn a joint distribution over the three pixel values (or in your case, the 4 categories). P.S. actually I believe they used a discrete distribution in pixelrnn, and not a gaussian, but the point is the same.
