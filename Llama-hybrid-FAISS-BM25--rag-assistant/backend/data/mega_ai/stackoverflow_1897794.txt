@pkarasev, You didn't say much about the nature of the application or what kind of organization. If you work for an academic institution and the application is to be shared with other researchers on a non-commercial basis, we have a program that may allow you to distribute it on a no-cost basis for users. Even if your application is to be sold, we can make so that you don't have to use NAG's license management in the application. If you've got more questions and just want to talk with someone call either me or or John Holden in our Oxford UK office (+44 1865 511245) Rob Meyer +1 630 598-5215
