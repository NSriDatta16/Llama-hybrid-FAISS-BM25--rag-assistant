Random Forest Learning Curve

I created the following learning curve in order to diagnose my Random Forest model. As I can see the curve indicates high variance and 'underfitting' (not overfitting), because cross-validation error is much lower than training error. What are the general recommendations to improve a given model? For example, I know that increasing the number of training examples might help resolve high variance issue (for the overfitting case). Is it true for my case? What if I don't have more training data?
