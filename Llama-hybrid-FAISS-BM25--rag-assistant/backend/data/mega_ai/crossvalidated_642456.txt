This doesn't directly answer your question "Is there a better package or better way for this evaluation?" but... You probably shouldn't be using person_id as an explanatory variable. Even if you fit a model that you're happy with for the 20 people in your study, you wouldn't be able to use it to make predictions for any new people. I suspect that removing patient_id is not just conceptually a good idea, but it should also fix R's complaints. If it doesn't, and your question really is about debugging software, you may get better answers at StackExchange , because here on CrossValidated we tend to focus more on concepts than on software implementations. All that being said, your plan for CV (leaving one whole patient out at a time) is a good idea. See for example the "subject-wise CV" of Saeb et al. (2017), "The need to approximate the use-case in clinical machine learning."
