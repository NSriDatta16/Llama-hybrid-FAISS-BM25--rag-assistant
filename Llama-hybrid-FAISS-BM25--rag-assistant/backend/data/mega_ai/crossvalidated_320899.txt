Testing mutations separately has in large part been a complete failure in genomics. Comprehensive models are recommended, e.g., specifying mutation effects as random effects in a hierarchical (Bayesian or otherwise) model. The two-at-a-time approach you are using will likely result in small non-biologically useful effects upon validation. If you insist on two-at-a-time testing, this is a setting for the use of Rao's efficient score test and doesn't require expensive permutation tests unless you meant the permutation test to adjust for simultaneous testing of all mutations not just the two. For the score test you fit a single model with all the adjustment variables, then use the score equations to get an instant 3 d.f. test (main effects of two mutations + their interaction) without refitting the adjustment effects. There is a paper in the genomics literature somewhere that I've seen. I wish I had the reference.
