How to sort entities by 5 star user rating

I am trying to find a formula http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html The one from the above link is too hard to implement. Is there a nicer and simpler way to sort entities by a five star user rating control ? Think at jokes. People say jokes and others rate them with 1 to 5 stars. If a) 5 users rate a joke with 5, b) another 1000 rate another joke with 4 and finally, c) another 1000 rate another joke with 3.8, I want this specific order: joke b) joke c) joke a)
