How to interpret the negative variances

I had used the already published Likert scale for the survey. And the responses to the survey from 98 participants were collected. The survey likert scale was from 1-5 from strongly diasgree to srongle agree. Looking at the variables the average value of one of the factors is above the 3 for all the questions. The figure below is the avg of the responses. But while evaluating the variances the estimate, std.lv are valued seems to be negatives. Estimate Std.Err z-value P(>|z|) Std.lv Std.all .Competence -0.188 0.105 -1.796 0.073 -0.324 -0.324 and it is giving the warning: lavaan WARNING: some estimated lv variances are negative Model i am using: model However, what these variables predict appears to be significant with other variables i.e Motivation and Engagement seems to be co-related. Now, due to the value of negative in the estimate, I am confused about how to interpret the result? I can add further information if need to answer the question. Also, in the output of the LavaanPlot, the loadings are high. I am stuck in the interpretation for many days. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.
