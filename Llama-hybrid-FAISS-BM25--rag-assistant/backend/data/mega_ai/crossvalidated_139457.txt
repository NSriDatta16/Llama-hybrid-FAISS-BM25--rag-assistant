Detecting anomalies in a time series where new data points will be continuously added

I have a time series data and I will be adding more data points in a consistent manner. I want to figure out whether the new data point added is an outlier, in regards to the previously observed data points. I was wondering if I should be using a linear regression method with a moving average method, in order to ensure that I use the same number of data points each time a new data point comes in. I would like some help on how to approach this problem. Thank you.
