Typical file systems (*nix, ms-dos, etc) organize files hierarchically. For example, c:\ represents the top of a hierarchy c:\foo is the next level in the hierarchy c:\foo\bar is a sub-node of \foo etc.. Each file exists in one and only one location in this hierarchy. By contrast, a database file system organizes files by metadata attributes. For example, topic, type, author, etc.. Rather than existing in one particular place in a hierarchy, the file exists in multiple "places" depending on its attributes. The last question you ask is unanswerable.
