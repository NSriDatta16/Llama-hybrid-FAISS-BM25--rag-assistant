Estimation of so called HAR model

Consider an observed time series $\{Y_t\}_{t=1}^T$ and averaged values $$ Y_t^{(h)}=\frac{1}{h} \sum_{i=0}^{h-1} Y_{t-i} $$ and what is called an HAR model (this is a specific example) $$ Y_{t+1}=c+\beta_1 Y_t^{(h_1)}+\beta_2 Y_t^{(h_2)}+\beta_3 Y_t^{(h_3)}+\varepsilon_{t+1} $$ this can be seen as a restricted $AR(p)$ model where $p=\max\{h_1,h_2,h_3\}$. It is claimed to me that this type of model can be estimated by ordinary least squares. Which assumptions do I need to impose for this to be a consistent estimation? Simply the usual zero mean error and error uncorrelated with explanatory? Maybe if someone could give a reference for why it works for the $AR$ and why doing this averaging thing does not mess anything up it would be great! Thanks.
