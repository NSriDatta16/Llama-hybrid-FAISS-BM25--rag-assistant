You can use RewriteMap to call an external program. But, as Pekka said in his comment, you better not do this. It just makes it more complex and fragile. mod_rewrite is one of the best documented modules around and there are tons of tutorials, raging from simple to complex. I have done big website moves with many, many pages and a completely restructured URL schema. Even these can usually be done with a couple dozen rewrite rules or so. Start with the rewrite guide .
