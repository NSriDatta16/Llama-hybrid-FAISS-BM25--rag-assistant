Unlike Autoencoders, Botzmann Machines (restricted or not) do not have an output layer and thus classified as deep generative models. There is a variety of implementations in Pytorch. This one is GPU compatible ( https://github.com/GabrielBianconi/pytorch-rbm ) and I have found it particularly helpful in the past. RBMs can come quite handy in a variety of tasks such as Dimensionality reduction Collaborative filtering for recommender systems Feature learning and others. This was an interesting read in case you want to find out more about RBMs. https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/guide-to-restricted-boltzmann-machines-using-pytorch-ee50d1ed21a8
