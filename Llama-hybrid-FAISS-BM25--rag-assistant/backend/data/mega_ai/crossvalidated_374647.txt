How do Bayesians gamble?

Try to earn the most at this game : there are two discrete random processes x(t) and y(t) with two unknown continuous distributions, both are IID processes at iteration (t-1) you pick either "x" or "y", to be used in the following iteration t at iteration t both x(t) and y(t) are revealed if you picked "x" at t-1 your reward is x(t) dollars , otherwise it's y(t) dollars then you pick "x" or "y" again and the game repeats ... Frequentist strategy at iteration t, estimate the mean E[x] and E[y] , averaging the t past samples of x(t) and y(t) respectively pick "x" or "y", depending on which of the two random processes has the highest estimated mean Bayesian strategy? Help! What would a Bayesian do?
