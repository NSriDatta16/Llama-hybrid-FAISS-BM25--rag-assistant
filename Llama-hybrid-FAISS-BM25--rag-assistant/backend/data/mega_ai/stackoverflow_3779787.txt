You can do this with a number of different NLP tools, but nothing to my knowledge comes with it ready out of the box. Perhaps the easiest place to start would be with LingPipe (java), and you can use their very good sentiment analysis tutorial . You could also use NLTK if python is more your bent. There are some good blog posts over at Streamhacker that describe how you would use Naive Bayes to implement that.
