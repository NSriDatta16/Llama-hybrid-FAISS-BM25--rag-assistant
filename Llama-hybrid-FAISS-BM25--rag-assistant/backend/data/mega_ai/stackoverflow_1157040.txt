If more than one row is returned, the value that is stored will be the last value in the list, according to this . If you haven't specified an order for retrieval via ORDER BY , then the order returned will be at the convenience of the database engine. It may very well vary by the database instance. It may be in the order created, or even appear "random" because of where the data is placed within the database block structure. The moral of the story: Always make singleton SELECT s return a single row When #1 can't be done, use an ORDER BY to make sure the one you care about comes last
