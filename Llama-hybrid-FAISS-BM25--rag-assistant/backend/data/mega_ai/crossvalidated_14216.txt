Since the ordinary cross-correlation coefficient between two time series is possibly meaningless due to auto-correlation in either of the series see http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/dbs202/cat/stats/corr.html for a refresher about the assumptions of joint bivariate normality assumption required to test the cross-correlation or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udny_Yule for one of the earlier references of Spurious Correlation. That being the case one can pre-whiten using the ARIMA model for the "x series" and compute cross-correlations of the suitably filtered series. This is analogous to pulling out the within relationship in order to identify the among relationship. This leads to a Transfer Function which may or may not include empirically identified Pulses, Level Shifts , Local Time Trends and/or Seasonal Pulses to render the model's error process Gaussian. Given this and ( some more ) one may then be able to test the incremental value of "x" in describing "y's behavior". Books from authors like Wei or G.E.P.Box or Hanssens might be useful to you to provide "reading support"
