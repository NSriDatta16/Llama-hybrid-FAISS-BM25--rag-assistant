Time Series in SAS getting contradiction?

The 2td graph shows auto-correlation function has significantly zero value after 10-ish but the table which checks nullity correlation says it has auto-correlation not-equal to 0 for lag=24 unlike to 2td graph says. Is it a SAS problem or Am I analyzing it in a wrong way?
