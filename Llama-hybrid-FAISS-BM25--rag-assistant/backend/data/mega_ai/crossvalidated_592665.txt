Yes, this approach is correct. To give some context: You have your two uniformly distributed random variables, let's call them $A$ and $B$ , and you have a dependent random variable $G$ that is zero if the sum is greater 100, i.e. $A+B > 100$ , and zero otherwise. You then ask for the correlation of $A$ and $B$ under the condition that $G=1$ . This situation can be depicted with the following Bayesian network : The color of $G$ is darker to indicate that this random variable is conditioned on. Now, this pattern is known as a collider pattern where $G$ is the collider, and it is well-known that, even though $A$ and $B$ don't influence each other directly, they can be dependent when we condition on $G$ . And you have computed the correlation of this dependency. The correlation will be negative because if $A$ is small, $B$ has to be large to get $G$ above 100.
