That model is qualitatively wrong in so far as it predicts negative values for Expenses for 22 out of 127 cases. This is a by-product of fitting a hyperplane to data for a non-negative response, which pays essentially no attention to the boundedness of the response, nonlinearity, or the side-effects of skewed distributions, including at least one outlier. Your one concession to those features is to cube Capital, which doesn't seem justified to me. It's just a result of a few minutes' tinkering, and emphatically not offered as any kind of best model, but I got not-too-bad-looking results from a Poisson regression of Expenses on the log of Production, Salary, Capital and Material prices with "robust" standard errors. See http://blog.stata.com/tag/poisson-regression/ for more on this approach. Using log of Production is an attempt to tame the outlier and tackle the nonlinearity. A much simpler model is a power function relating Expenses to Production, which yields a power round about 0.8, depending how you estimate it. The fact that this power is not 1 underlines that taking Expenses to depend linearly on Production is a poor approximation. Here are observed vs fitted plots for my Poisson model with log of Product as one of the predictors and the other predictors taken as they come. and with Product instead of log Product. This model is clearly performing poorly. My main suggestions therefore are Fit the model on log scale using Poisson regression. (Depending on software, it may be convenient to use a generalized linear model command, function or routine.) How you calculate standard errors of estimates is important. The one predictor you must do something about is Production. It works much better when log-transformed and should not be left as it comes. Although four-predictor models can be found with fair behaviour, consider also just using (log of) Production as a single predictor.
