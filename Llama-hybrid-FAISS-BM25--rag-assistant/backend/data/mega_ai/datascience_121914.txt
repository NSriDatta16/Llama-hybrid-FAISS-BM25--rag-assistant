Yes there are multiple ways to check the relationship between the input and target variables. Some of which are: 1.) Correlation based techniques - You can use Pearson , Spearman or Kendall correlation depending on whether your variables are linearly or non linearly related. 2.) Use mutual_info_gain to check the dependency between 2 variables. 3.) Calculate the feature importance using machine learning models. There are other techniques you can use too. Google is your best friend! Cheers!
