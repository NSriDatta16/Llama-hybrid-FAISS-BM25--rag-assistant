Why we cannot computing the integral of P(x) in Bayesian Inference analytically?

Recently, I read slides on Variational Inference. The Bayesian rule is $$ P(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{x} ; \mathbf{\theta}) = \frac{P(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}; \mathbf{\theta})P(\mathbf{z}; \mathbf{\theta})}{ P(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta}) } $$ And we can calculate the integral of $P(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta})$ , however, why we can't computing the integral of it analytically? Does it mean find calculating the integral is hard? Or we can find such closed-form formulation to calculate the integral but the computation is not polynomial? Many slides claim that it is hard to compute the integral of $P(x)$ in Bayesian Inference analytically. But few slides explain why.
