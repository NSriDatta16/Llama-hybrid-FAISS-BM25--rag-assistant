T-SQL: Round to nearest 15 minute interval

What's the best way to round an HH:MM value to the closest 15 minute interval? I don't track seconds so they don't matter. 00:08:00 becomes 00:15:00 00:07:00 becomes 00:00:00 01:59:00 becomes 02:00:00 and so on. Is there an elegant, non UDF or Case statement method for doing this? EDIT: Here's the SQL I'm using to get the above values that I'd like to round: CONVERT(CHAR(8), DATEADD(n, SUM(DATEDIFF(n, starttime, stoptime)), 0), 108) starttime and stoptime are SQL datetime s.
