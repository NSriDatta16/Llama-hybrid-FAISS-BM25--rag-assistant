add a panGesture recognizer to your subview class UIPanGestureRecognizer *panGesture = [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(panPiece:)]; [panGesture setMaximumNumberOfTouches:2]; [panGesture setDelegate:self]; [self addGestureRecognizer:panGesture]; use this code for the translation and you wouldn't have any problems with dragging the wrong view - (void)panPiece:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { [self adjustAnchorPointForGestureRecognizer:gestureRecognizer]; if ([gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan || [gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { CGPoint translation = [gestureRecognizer translationInView:[self superview]]; self.center = CGPointMake([self center].x + translation.x, [self center].y + translation.y); [gestureRecognizer setTranslation:CGPointZero inView:[self superview]]; } }
