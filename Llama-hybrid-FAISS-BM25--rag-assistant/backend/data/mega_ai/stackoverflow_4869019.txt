Update: Ok, then the issue only lies in using double quotes for product . Use single quotes and escape them: document.getElementById('results').innerHTML += ' ' + ...; But you really should consider to refactor your code. E.g. you could write it like this: var results = document.getElementById('results'); var container = document.createDocumentFragment(); for (var i = 0, l = result.rows.length; i It is more code but easier to maintain in the long run... You have syntax and quotation issues. This should work: onkeyup="updateRecord('item[\'id\']', 'product', this)" But the code seems a bit weird to me. Is this in your actual HTML or are you echoing or printing it? Because '+ item['product'] + ' looks weird in HTML. It will literally put '+ item['product'] + ' inside the tag. Please post a more complete version of your code.
