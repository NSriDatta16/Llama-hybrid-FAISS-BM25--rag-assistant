Had to develop a payment module for DPS in NZ some time back. How this works is, you go to pay on the site and the payment module php code runs that sends off the details to an acquiring institutions payment website who process the transaction for you with the bank. In my case as I recall it was DPS NZ via some soap calls. The Soap calls contained details such as the total cost, the currency, the merchant number to identify who you are paying. The acquiring institution (DPS in this case) then takes your credit card number and expiry date and do the processing. Then, again via some soap calls back to your own magento website you get redirected back with the error code - success, etc. DPS use soap I think, but other payment websites may use other protocols to work. The other possibility is that your credit card acquiring page could be hosted on your website and you accept the credit card numbers and do all the processing within magento to the acquirer. In short, the process is controlled by the payment module itself. If you want to see more detail, have a look at the payment module tutorials that are available and also the comments in the magento forums. You can also look at the paypal module code.
