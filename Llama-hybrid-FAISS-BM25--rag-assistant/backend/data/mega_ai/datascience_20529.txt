Reinforcement learning for continuous (rather than discrete) actions

I'm familiar with traditional reinforcement learning where the algorithm must choose a categorical action (e.g., best move in a game or the highest click-through-rate ad among a set of ads). Does reinforcement learning work for problems with continuous actions? Are there any easy to understand references that you recommend? I was hoping to be able to use reinforcement learning to assign credit limits, which are represented in dollars (i.e., continuous amounts). Edit: I've come across this paper from Google's DeepMind, which so far seems relevant.
