There are alternatives out there. Using cloud capabilities for computing is helpful for many different types of problems and I've been using the cloud for a couple years now. There are moments where you need more computational capabilities, for instance if you needed more ram to process data or if you needed GPUs for neural nets computation. The only drawback is the price of some of these services. The quickest ways to use is just sign up and go through the tutorials on Amazon Machine Learning https://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/tutorial.html or Azure Machine Learning https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/ RStudio on an Amazon instance Another alternative is to set up RStudio on an Amazon instance. http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/ http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/video_guide.html This tutorial will teach you how to connect to an Amazon instance running R and showing the GUI on your browser. iPython HTML Notebook on Amazon's AWS The same can be done with python using an IPython notebook to interact with the remote instance. https://gist.github.com/iamatypeofwalrus/5183133 Spark on the cloud If you know Apache Spark you can also use https://databricks.com/ Advanced topic: Deep Learning on Amazon EC2 GPU with Python and nolearn Setup a GPU Amazon instance to run deep learning algorithms http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/10/13/deep-learning-amazon-ec2-gpu-python-nolearn/
