The customer.customerID field should be a Primary Key for the customer table. Then it does not matter which way you drag the arrow. SQLServer is clever enough to figure it out. As per a comment that was added to this answer... You should drag the 'arrow' from the referenced table to the referencing table (in your case from the Customer to the Order table). Then check the relationship that SQLServer automatically assigns.
