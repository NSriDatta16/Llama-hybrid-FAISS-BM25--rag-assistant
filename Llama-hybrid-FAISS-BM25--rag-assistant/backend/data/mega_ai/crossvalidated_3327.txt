If you have a specific model you wish to compare against: I would recommend Least-squares as a metric to minimize and score possible parameter values against a specific dataset. All you basically have to do is plug in your parameter estimates, use those to generate predicted values, and compute the average squared deviation from the true values. However, You might consider turning your question around slightly: "Which model would best fit my data?" In which case I would suggest making an assumption of a normally distributed error term ~ something one could argue is akin to the least squares assumption. Then, depending on your choice of model, you could make an assumption about how you think the other model parameters are distributed (assigning a Bayesian prior) and the use something like the MCMC package from R to sample from the distribution of the parameters. Then you could look at posterior means & variances to get an idea of which model has the best fit.
