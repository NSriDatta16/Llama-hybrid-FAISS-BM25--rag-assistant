Specify the name of compiled binary (*.exe) within source code in Visual Studio 2008

From this thread http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1863547 It seems this cannot be done with: #pragma comment(linker, "/out:mycool.exe") Is there some simple way this can be done without having to use project settings, make files etc? Added: Why do I want to do this. Well this gets into another subject which is probably my next question - working with the IDE. I have to provide many examples in one project. They are simple single files that demonstrate different ways of doing things and each one should really be a different executable EXample1.exe, Example2.exe. I only want to paste the source code or hand someone a SINGLE file with everything needed to make the example executable (on a web forum for example. I do not want to attach a 3.6MB project folder just to get a different executable name!
