What makes sense depends on your coding standards. I would avoid benchmarking sub-queries vs joins until the query itself has been optimized (removing extraneous joins, tautologous where clauses, excessive column retrieval) AND profiling demonstrates the need to optimize a particular query. Even then, your time is probably better spent on defining good indexes for the RDBMS to use during execution.
