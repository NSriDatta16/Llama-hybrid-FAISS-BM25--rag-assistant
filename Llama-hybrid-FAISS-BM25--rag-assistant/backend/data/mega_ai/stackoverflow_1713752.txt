From a practical standpoint, there's a huge base of legacy COBOL code running a lot of systems out in the world (many of them mission-critical) and it's likely cost-prohibitive to replace all of that software any time soon. The average COBOL programmer is probably nearing retirement age. Therefore one could reasonably assume that there will continue to be demand for new COBOL programmers for some indeterminate amount of time to come. From a personal development/enrichment perspective, it certainly makes sense to study COBOL (and any number of other technologies both new and "less-new".). I'm not sure I'd put it near the top of my list, but its historical significance is reason enough to put it on the list. Somewhere.
