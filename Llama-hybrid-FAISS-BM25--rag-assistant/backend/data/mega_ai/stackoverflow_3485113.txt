Your regex only includes [A-Z] , not [a-z] . Try $match = "/\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b/i"; to make the regex case-insensitive. You can test this live on http://regexpal.com . However, I'd advise you to try one of the expressions on the page mentioned by strager : http://fightingforalostcause.net/misc/2006/compare-email-regex.php . They have been perfected over time and will probably behave better. But Gmail users will be satisfied with yours, since they'll be able to use plus aliases which are rejected incorrectly by many validators.
