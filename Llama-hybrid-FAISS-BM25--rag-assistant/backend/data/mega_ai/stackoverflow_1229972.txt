Iteration is synonymous with sprint, sprint is just the Scrum terminology. On the question about sprint length, the only caution I would note is that in Scrum you are using the past sprints to gain a level of predictability on your teams ability to deliver on their commitments for the sprint. They do this by developing a velocity over a number of sprints. A change in the team members or the length of the sprint are factors that will affect the velocity for a sprint, over past sprints. Just as background, velocity is the sum of estimation points assigned to the backlog items, or stories, that were completely finished during that sprint. Most Agile proponents (Mike Cohn, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland for instance), recommend that teams use "the recent weather" to base their future estimations on how much they think they can commit to in a sprint. This means using the average from the last few sprints as the basis for an estimate in the upcoming sprint planning session. Once again, varying the sprint length reduces your teams ability to provide that velocity statistic which the team uses for sprint planning, and the product owner uses for release planning (i.e. predicting when the project will end or what will be in the project at the end). I recommend Mike Cohn's book on Agile Estimating and Planning to provide an overview of the way sprints, estimation and planning all can fit together.
