coverage percentage using a complex sql query...?

Ok, i've been trying to solve this for about 2 hours now... Please advise: Tables: PROFILE [id (int), name (varchar), ...] SKILL [id (int), id_profile (int), id_app (int), lvl (int), ...] APP [id (int), ...] The lvl can basically go from 0 to 3. I'm trying to get this particular stat: "What is the percentage of apps that is covered by at least two people having a skill of 2 or higher?" Thanks a lot
