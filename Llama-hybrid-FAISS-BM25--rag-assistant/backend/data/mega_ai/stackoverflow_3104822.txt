Installing hudson slave on windows xp

I am trying to install a slave on windows xp on a different machine from the master. I tried clicking on new node and it only give me the option of choosing dumb slave. Is it supposed to be like that? Anyway, I fill out the node name as "Test" and i select launch using jnlp and i hit save. Now when I click on that node i download the slave-agent.jnlp and slave.jar files from that screen and i open a command prompt and enter java -jar slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://servername:portnumber/hudson/computer/Test/slave-agent.jnlp but I get the following java errors: java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out: connect at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.doConnect(Unknown Source) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connectToAddress(Unknown Source) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connect(Unknown Source) at java.net.SocksSocketImpl.connect(Unknown Source) at java.net.Socket.connect(Unknown Source) at java.net.Socket.connect(Unknown Source) at java.net.Socket. (Unknown Source) at java.net.Socket. (Unknown Source) at hudson.remoting.Engine.connect(Engine.java:265) at hudson.remoting.Engine.run(Engine.java:185) When i try to run it from the web interface it cannot connect and it looks like it is trying to use a port number like 59870 instead of the real portnumber to connect to the host. Does anyone know why I can't install the slave agent?
