Your residuals don't seem like they're so close to zero. Look on the x-axis of your histogram. Your interquartile range is hundreds of thousands if not a couple million, so you have many residuals that are quite enormous. Yes, you're working with large numbers, but the tight clustering on your graphs only looks tight on a gigantic scale. I would say that this is why you have gotten tight-looking fits but an $R^2$ value that is not strong enough. The outlier idea by Marat Seroglazov is interesting, but it looks like you should have enough data to cushion that outlier effect. I am quite curious about the interquartile range of your residuals.
