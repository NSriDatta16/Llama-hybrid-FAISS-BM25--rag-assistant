Use a 2-sample Student's t-test for every gene and look at the mean expression of each gene. The grouping variable for the t-test is the cluster membership (1,2). Within each cluster you can look at the mean expression for each gene (assigned to that cluster). Your question is really to find out what the means are, so you would simply be exploiting the t-test to output the averages for each gene in cluster 1 and cluster 2. You could also just run summary statistics to see what the means are for each gene in the assigned cluster. There are assumptions surrounding use of the t-test, which involve normality, skewness, variance inequality between the two groups, etc. Outliers can also bias the t-test, since they will drag the means into territory where there are no data. (the average of 1, 2, 3, and 1000000) is a little north of 250,000 -- where there are no data).
