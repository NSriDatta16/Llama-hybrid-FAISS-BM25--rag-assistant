How PCA implemeted in ClustofVar package and how to determine ranking of each column?

I am clustering columns of the Titanic dataset (Has 7 columns) using ClustofVar package https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v050i13 Columns in the dataset are clustered as shown in the Dendrogram https://i.stack.imgur.com/mOAL8.jpg . I want to know which columns effect the survial column. From dendrogram, The surival & sex of person are clustered closely. So, I understand these two columns (survial & sex) are highly related. Sex is for sure highly related to survival column. What is the next best column that effects survival column ? Do i look at the next high correlation value ? Correlation values changing with the number of clusters I cut the tree into. The below snippet cuts the Dendrogram into 3 clusters that shows the squared correlations as https://i.stack.imgur.com/2G8sr.jpg . When i cut the dendrogram to 4 clusters, i get https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGy8S.jpg . How to know how many clusters to cut the dendrogram into ? #Squared loading Correlations summary(tree) tree.cut I am not quite sure of PCA implemented in hclustvar function of the ClustofVar Package. If someone has interest and patience to explain it, would be really helpful :) PS1: Are there any other algorithms that can give the ranking for columns or can solve my problem more efficiently? PS2: Till now i am focusing only on unsupervised learning algorithms. Do i need to use supervised learning to achieve what i stated in PS1 ?
