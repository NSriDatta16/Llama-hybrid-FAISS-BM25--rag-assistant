one hot coding is fine, but you need to use sparse matrices ( you only store position of non zero entries to avoid memory overload). there are many ml libraries that handle this. bag of words language models is the typical example of this. ( eg library scikit-learn, glmnet) for combinations you might look into market basket analysis which has computationally efficient methods of finding combinations, and various metrics
