Why eval() isn't working here to deserialize such a simple JSON object?

I am trying to use eval() function to deserialize this JSON text by using eval function. var personJSON = { "FirstName": "Burak", "LastName": "Ozdogan", "Id": "001", "Department": "Information Technologies" }; var personBurakOzdogan = eval('(' + personJSON + ')'); But I am getting this error: *Microsoft JScript compilation error: Expected ']'* Is there something that I skip which I cannot catch? Thanks
