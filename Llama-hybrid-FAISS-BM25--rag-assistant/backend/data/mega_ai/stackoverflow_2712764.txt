IOError: Client read error (Timeout?) I got the same error a lot although my server side is python/django. I assumed it was the client timing out, but looking back though the logs for you now there seems to be a coincidence of this ceasing when I changed something in the authentication routines. Is it possible that the server is receiving the file but then refusing to write it to storage? Also, you aware that several flash clients do not send cookies? You have to work around it by injecting the session keys into uploadify's 'scriptData' variable. x-------------------------------- Edit. This python/django code starts off the routine to which uploadify submits itself: # Adobe Flash doesn't always send the cookies, esp. from Apple Mac's. # So we've told flash to send the session keys via POST. So recreate the # session now. Also facilitates testing via curl. cookie_name = settings.SESSION_COOKIE_NAME if request.member.is_anonymous() and request.POST.has_key(cookie_name): # Convert posted session keys into a session and fetch session request.COOKIES[cookie_name] = request.POST[cookie_name] SessionMiddleware().process_request(request) # boot anyone who is still anonymous if request.member.is_anonymous(): response['message'] = "Your session is invalid. Please login." return HttpResponse(simplejson.dumps(response), mimetype='application/json')
