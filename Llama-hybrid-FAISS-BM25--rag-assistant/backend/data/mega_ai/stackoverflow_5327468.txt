What is the best way to represent a complicated truth table in Java or other OO/non-functional languages?

I am implementing a lot of complicated business logic that is represented in a truth table/business rules matrix. In the past, implementing these rules has often resulted in a lot of if...else statements. I can't help but think that a functional language lends itself to expressing these rules more elegantly. How can I make implementation in Java less painful? What are some helpful patterns when doing this?
