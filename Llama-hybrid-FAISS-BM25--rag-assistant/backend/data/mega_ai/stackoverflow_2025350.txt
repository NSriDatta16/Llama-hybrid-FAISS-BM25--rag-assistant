I think the biggest advantage of server development is also the biggest roadblock for clouds: you own the servers. They're under YOUR control. You can walk over and see where your data is. You don't have to worry about it being in a data center somewhere else. You don't have to worry about a company going out of business or mishandling your information. This is a real worry for conservative businesses. Data is the lifeblood of most organizations, so a decision to put it into someone else's hands isn't taken lightly. The problem with server development is that greater control brings greater responsibility. You have to pay for all that hardware, software, electricity, data center real estate, and people to maintain it all. You assume that your security and data handling practices are as good as or better than the cloud firm you might be handing the data to. If this is bad assumption, cloud computing starts looking better. I think it has little to do with development considerations and everything to do with business realities.
