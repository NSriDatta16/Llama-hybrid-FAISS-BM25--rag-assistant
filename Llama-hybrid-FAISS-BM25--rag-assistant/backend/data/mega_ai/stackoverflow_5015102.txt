How to capture network traffic application wise using winpcap?

I have to make a windows based application for which captures network traffic per application where some of running application uses same port number for sending and receiving the packets. I have used winpcap and successfully captured and filtered them port wise and destination wise but I dont know how to capture them application wise that means how to know application information from ip packets. Is only winpcap can solve the problem or some other api's or library shoud be used. Can we get the application information from which packet is generated from packet header? ** Can anyone give me example that uses iphlpapi and winpcap in vc++ for capturing network traffic per application. **
