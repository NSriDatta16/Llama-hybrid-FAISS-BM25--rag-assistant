How to build CHM / HTML Documentation with Sandcastle? Use the Sandcastle Help File Builder . Can build HTML file from XML or have to used .cs and dll files? I think it uses the *.dll and the *.xml (both together) as input. One of the 'tips' in the SHFB documentation says, "When selecting either an assembly or an XML comments file, the help file builder will automatically add the partner file for you (i.e. the XML comments file for the like-named assembly or the assembly for the like-named comments file). Multiple files can also be selected and added in one go or dragged from Windows Explorer and dropped on the Documentation Sources node."
