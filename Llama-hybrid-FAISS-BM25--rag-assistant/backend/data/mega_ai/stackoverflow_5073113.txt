How to handle cleanup of external data when deleting Core Data objects

I am fairly new to Core Data and have run into an issue which others must have encountered. My data model includes images and I am keeping those external to the database and simply storing a path/URL to the image. (as recommended in one of Apple's Core Data presentations) When deleting my image object I can manually traverse relationships and remove the image files but I am wondering if there is a more elegant way to do this. The ideal solution would be tied to the image object somehow and would work with Core Data undo/redo.
