Security is mostly done on the Controller or Action level via attributes. More information on the Authorize attribute can be found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.authorizeattribute%28VS.100%29.aspx#using_authorizeattribute You can easily see how it works by going File-> New MVC project and checking out the AccountController.cs file inside the /Controllers/ directory. Be aware the answers by Vitaly and Agent_9191 are not current and reference mostly preview MVC builds. Those articles may reference code and or functionality that does not exist or has been depreciated.
