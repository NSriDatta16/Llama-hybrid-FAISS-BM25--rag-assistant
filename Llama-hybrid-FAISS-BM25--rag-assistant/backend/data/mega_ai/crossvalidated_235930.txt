The difference is because decomposition.PCA does not standardize your variables before doing PCA, whereas in your manual computation you call StandardScaler to do the standardization. Hence, you are observing this difference: PCA on correlation or covariance? If you replace pca.fit_transform(x) with x_std = StandardScaler().fit_transform(x) pca.fit_transform(x_std) you will get the same result as with manual computation... ...but only up to the order of the PCs. That is because when you run ev , eig = np.linalg.eig(cov) you get eigenvalues not necessarily in the decreasing order. I get array([ 0.07168571, 2.49382602, 1.43448827]) So you will want to order them manually. Sklearn does that for you. Regarding reconstructing original variables, please see How to reverse PCA and reconstruct original variables from several principal components?
