bank = array or set. The term comes from the signal processing terminology . A hint from the paper you mention: In this way, a bank of neurons in a CNN applies a convolution operation to its input. A single layer in a CNN typically has multiple banks of neurons, each performing a convolution with a different filter. These banks of neurons become distinct input channels into the next layer. The parameter of each neuron bank in a convolutional layer is called a filter bank or just filter (a.k.a. kernel a.k.a. feature detector). For example, using this illustration from Stanford's deep learning tutorial : The filter bank is the yellow sliding window, and its value is: \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} The green array is the input to one neuron bank, and the pink array is the output of one neuron bank. I don't think the term neuron bank is commonly used nowadays. (That's a lot of confusing terms for a simple mathematical operationâ€¦ )
