How does the "skip" method work for upsampling? (fully convolutional NN)

I'm studying fully convolutional neural networks for image segmentation, so far i've study and kind of understood the deconv network. Following this tutorial ( Upsampling ) i can't really understand how the "skip" method works. I understood how to apply max unpooling and the transpose convolution for upsampling,but how does the "skip" method "relate" to those 2 methods? Why do we use this "skip" method? Max unpooling and transpose convolution are not enough to upsample and give back a better resolution map?
