You can try many things, clearly there is no "only one solution" to do this. You can to design a quick and dirty SVM to separate your healthy and patient data. Depending on how it works (good or bad) If very good: you can try to add some dimensionality reduction to highlight the key factors to differentiate between healthy / patient. Else: you can try to use different SVM Kernels (RBF, etc.) A different model: KNN, Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree. If you try to compare different kind of models or different settings for a given type of model, do not forget to add a cross-validation step. Finally, you should keep 30% of your dataset (30% healthy and 30% patient) aside from any analysis. Do not use these data any time for training, it will be useful to validate your model on "new data" and prevent overfitting. You should select these 30% data randomly. Have a look to some machine learning tutorial (R or Python with ScikitLearn).
