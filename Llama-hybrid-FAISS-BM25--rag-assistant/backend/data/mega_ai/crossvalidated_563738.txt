I want to second the answer by jacobe, but also add a bit of detail. Assume that there is some probability $p$ of a coin toss being a head. Assign the outcome head to a score of $1$ and tails to a score of $0$ . Note that the average score from a large number of coin tosses is also the average frequency of getting heads. The "expected" score from any given coin toss is \begin{equation} p\cdot 1+(1-p)\cdot 0 \end{equation} Of course, this simplifies to \begin{equation} p \end{equation} do to our scoring system. The law of large numbers tells us that, as we flip the coin more times, we should eventually see the average approaching to this expectation value (assuming all coin tosses are independent of each other). Now, if your question is: why do we even believe there is a probability $p$ of getting heads, then I'm not sure there is a justification. At least, I haven't heard it. This comes back to what jacobe said about probability vs. statistics. The existence of $p$ and independence of events are assumptions for our model. If the statistical results seem consistent, that's a good sign for the model.
