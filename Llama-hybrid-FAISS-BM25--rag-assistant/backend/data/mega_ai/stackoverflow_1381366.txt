Is licensing information retained in some way in an swf file, compiled by Adobobe CS4 Professional?

I mean, is it theoretically possible to determine (based only on the content of the swf file) that the software which compiled the given swf was licensed trial or something else? I guess Adobe would implement something like this to discourage using pirated software.
