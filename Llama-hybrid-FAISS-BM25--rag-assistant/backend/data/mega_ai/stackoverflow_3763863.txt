You are doing Include("Product").Include("Inventory").Include("Inventory.Storage") and you are wondering why so many records are fetched and why so see such a big SQL query? Please make sure you understand what the Include method is about. If you want a simpler query, please use the following: var res = from pi in objectSet where pi.Product.CategoryId == categoryId select pi; Please note however that this will possible load Products , Inventories and Storages lazily, which could cause many more queries to be sent when you iterate over those sub collections.
