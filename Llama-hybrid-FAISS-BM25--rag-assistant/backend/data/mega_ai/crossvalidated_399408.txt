Short answers: We restrict ourself to the stationary region as on the non-stationary one ARMA processes become explosive (that is, they go to infinity) It is possible to fit a non-stationary model to time series but that won't be an ARMA model (but it may belong to the family of ARMA models) Non-stationary time series need to be at least locally stationary to be modelled. If they are not, we won't have enough observations at each time point to be able to make reasonable estimates. However, if we have a good "sceleton" (see e.g. Tong,H., Non-Linear Time Series) for the series we might be able to extract the non-stationary/nonlinear dynamics from the data and leave a stationary process behind to play with.
