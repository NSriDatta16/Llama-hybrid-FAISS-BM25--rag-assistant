Text + tabular data for classification

I have a dataset of "mixed" types e.g text | date | amount | supplier -----+--------+---------+------------ where text is rather short sentences (text from banktransactions), date is when the transaction occured, amount the amount of the transaction and supplier being where they have purchased it from e.g "Wallmart". I want to predict the supplier . Using only the text (Tf-IDF + KNN) I can achieve a (precison,recall) = (0.94,0.4) (overall), but for some suppliers I can see that the amount could help differentiate even more since some suppliers have almost identical text, but the amount differes greatly. My issue is though that I find it difficult to add the amount as a feature. What I have tried is: Using the supplier predictions, based on text, aswell with the amount as a feature in a LightGBM model. Overall that didn't do anything good Using the amount as an interactive term between the probability predicitons from a Logistic Regression regression, in a new Logistic Regression (didn't do very much overall aswell) I can find a lot (!) of text regarding text-classification but I struggle to find anything about text+tabular classification. Any ideas of how to tackle such problems?
