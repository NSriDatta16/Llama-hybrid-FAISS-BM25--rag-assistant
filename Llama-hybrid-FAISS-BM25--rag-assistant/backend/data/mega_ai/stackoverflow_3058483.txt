A lot depends on the details. A complete solution could take into account velocities or other issues. But treating this simply... You don't want to always resolve vertically first. Imagine an actor nudges horizontally into a block. If you resolve vertically first then the actor will pop up above that block, when a small horizontal movement would have sufficed. Find what the vertical and horizontal movements would need to be to "get out of collision", and then apply the one with the smallest absolute value. Then repeat a few times, in case the movement puts the actor into another block. But don't repeat forever, because the actor could be wedged somewhere that never resolves. Maybe if your last movement still leaves you in collision, you could just average the last two movements and leave it there.
