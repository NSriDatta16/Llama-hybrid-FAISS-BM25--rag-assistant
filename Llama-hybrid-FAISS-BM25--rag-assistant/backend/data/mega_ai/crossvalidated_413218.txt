No matter the shape of the population distribution, the Central Limit Theorem holds that the sampling distribution of the sample means (and sample variances) approaches a normal distribution as the sample size $T$ (number of observations or data points) gets larger, especially for sample sizes over 30. As you take more samples, the sample distribution graph will look more like a normal distribution, and so on average , the sample moments will be the population moments as $T\uparrow$ . (If you add up the means or standard deviations from all of your samples and find the average, that average will be close to the actual moments for the population.)
