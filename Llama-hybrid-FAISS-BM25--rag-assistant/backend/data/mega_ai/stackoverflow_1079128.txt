What's the difference between IFrame and Frame?

Looking at options for embedding the 3D Secure page inside my own order form, I came across the following: "Some commerce sites will devote the full browser page to the authentication rather than using a frame (not necessarily an iFrame, which is a less secure object anyway)." from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure Can someone give me the lowdown as to why iframes are less secure, and cause problems, as opposed to normal frames? And what are the basic differences? The way I see it, iframe is the way to go.
