You could try a quadkey. It's a spatial index and reduce the dimension. It subdivide a map into tiles but you can use it to store points. You can download my php class hilbert-curve @ phpclasses.org. It also includes a z-curve and a moore-curve. Important is to know it uses a mercator projection. You can look for Bing maps tiling. It explains how to use a quadkey. You need x,y coordinate and z (zoom or depth) value. Then it gives you a quadkey.
