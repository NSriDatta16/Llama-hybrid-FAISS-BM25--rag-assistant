RBF SVM use cases (vs logistic regression and random forest)

Support Vector Machines with radial-base function kernel is a general-purpose supervised classifier. While I know theoretical foundations for these SVMs, and their strong points, I am not aware of cases in which they are the preferred method. So, is there is a class of problems for which RBF SVMs are superior to other ML techniques? (Either in terms of score, or other - like robustness, easiness to start, interpretability etc.) I am asking, as my default approach is centered around logistic regression (perhaps with some interactions), random forest and a bit of neural networks. None of my friends doing ML (some are Kaggle winners) is a SVM-user (but it may be an artifact of my community, or the problems they deal with).
