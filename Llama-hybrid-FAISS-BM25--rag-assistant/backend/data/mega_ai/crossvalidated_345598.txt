Here is a quick example which you can use to understand the odd's ratio of any variable. lets say $\beta_1$ = 0.7 and $\beta_2$ = -0.3 and let $\beta_o$ = C So your logistic regression model will be $$\hat y = \hat \pi = \frac {1}{1 + e^{-(C + 0.7x_1 -0.3x_2)}}$$ you see that inside part of the exponential constant is the same as a linear regression function. But now when we extract odd ratio's The odd ratio of $\beta1$ $$\beta_1 = e^{\beta_1} = e^{0.7} = 2.01$$ The odd ratio of $\beta2$ $$\beta_2 = e^{\beta_2} = e^{-0.3} = 0.74$$ Now for $\beta1$, when every thing else is constant, 1 unit increase of $X_1$ causes a $(2.01-1)\% = 101\%$ increase in probability $\hat y$. Now for $\beta2$, when every thing else is constant, 1 unit increase of $X_2$ causes a $(1- 0.74)\% = 26\%$ decrease in probability $\hat y$. It can also be interpreted as 1 unit decreasae in $X_2$ causes a $\frac {1}{e^{-0.3}} = 1.35$, or the a increase of 35% in probability $\hat y$. Finaly if odd's ratio is 1, it means there is no change in probability.
