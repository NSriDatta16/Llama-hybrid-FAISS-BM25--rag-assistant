How can I edit Kerberos 5 configuration files with Perl?

Has anyone come across a Perl module that will parse (and write) kerberos configuration files (ie /etc/krb5.conf )? I have looked at quite a few parsing modules like Config::General , Config::Auto , etc., but none seem to be able to handle nested structures like the following: pam = { debug = false ticket_lifetime = 36000 renew_lifetime = 36000 forwardable = true krb4_convert = false } It also needs to handle INI -style sections, for example: [domain_realm] .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM example.com = EXAMPLE.COM [appdefaults] pam = { debug = false ticket_lifetime = 36000 renew_lifetime = 36000 forwardable = true krb4_convert = false } More details on the format can be found at the krb5 conf documentation Iâ€™m at the point of writing my own parser, but I'd rather not have to do so if someone else has written a nice, elegant module already.
