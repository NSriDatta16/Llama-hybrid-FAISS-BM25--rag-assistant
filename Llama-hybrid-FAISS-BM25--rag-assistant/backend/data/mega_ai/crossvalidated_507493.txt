Estimating population parameter from bootstrapped sample distribution, other than mean value

I'm a rather novice to statistics, so my terminology here might not be totally correct. But I will do my best to explain my question clearly. My question is about understanding whether it is making sense to use bootstrapping method to calculate a confidence interval for a certain parameter of a population. In case of estimating a population mean, what I studied is that sample mean is my best point estimate. And with the central limit theorem, the center point of a "sample mean distribution" should be same as that of a population if the sample size and the number of resampling are big enough. And the sample distribution of mean is normally distributed and from here, I can define a confidence interval of the sample mean distribution. And the population mean is expected to be within this confidence interval. A lot of online materials explain this case. But let's assume that there is an imaginary statistics "Foo" and I want to calculate a population confidence interval of "Foo" from the bootstrapped sample distribution. But we don't know the relation between the sample distribution of the "Foo" and the population parameter "Foo", not like the mean statistics explained above. Then, it makes no sense to me to use bootstrapping method to estimate the population parameter "Foo". The best I can do is, calculating sample distribution of the "Foo". Is my understanding here correct? If my understanding in the paragraph 2 is correct, then what are the practical usages of bootstrapping method? Thanks.
