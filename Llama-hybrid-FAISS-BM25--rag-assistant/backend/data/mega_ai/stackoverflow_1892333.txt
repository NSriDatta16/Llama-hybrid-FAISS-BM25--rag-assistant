XSLT - Accessing Key's by index - For example, in Muenchian Grouping

2638 Maple Avenue Padua WI 53701 229000 2 Story Contemporary, Transitional 2328 2 1/2 4 2 car, attached 22 Very nice home on a one block dead end street with woods nearby. Very special location for quiet and privacy! Home features open floor plan with large rooms - new patio doors to pretty yard. updates: shingles, vinyl siding, refrig and dishwasher, garage door. Fireplace in family room flanked by great built-ins. add first floor laundry and award winning Padua schools. Broxton ... Cutler ... Argyle ... Stratmore ... Padua ... Oseola ... Fenmore ... Cutler ... Padua ... Cutler ... Oseola ... In my textbook (XML 2nd Edition by Patrick Carey) it provides an example of using 'Muenchian Grouping' to find unique selections. The part I don't understand is thus: It gets to here, in the progression of the example where it states: " property[generate-id()=generate-id(key("cityNames", "Cutler" )[1])] " which says that this will find the first 'Cutler' in the selection, due to the index of '[1]'. Which given the XML above will return "Cutler" Now the example progresses to thus: " property[generate-id()=generate-id(key("cityNames", city )[1])] " which says that this will find the first and only the first (therefore unique) of each city within the key. Creating a group of unique values of all the city's within. Which given the XML above will return "Argyle Broxton Cutler Fenmore Padua Stratmore Oseola" (note that there is no multiples) . Now, my question is thus: why does the second statement return a range of values, instead of just one? Thanks
