It's quite a bit easier to work with .wav files I think, although Matlab way well have utilities for such things, in fact it does: Reading .wav The easiest way to implement a low pass filter is a moving average filter. The simplest way to do this would be be to loop over the data and take an average of each group of n values. I'm not sure exactly how the cutoff frequency would depend on n, but you could experiment a bit. Otherwise, I know that there is a signal processing toolkit for Octave and I think that Matlab has a built-in filter function: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/fp/Matlab_Filter_Implementation.html A third way which is over the top, would be to perform an FFT and do the filtering in the frequency domain. Once you have the low-frequency part of the signal you can check for samples that are above an amplitude threshold and output where in the data these were found.
