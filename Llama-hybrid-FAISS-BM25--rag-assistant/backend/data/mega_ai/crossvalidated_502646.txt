Predictions with small datasets

I started learning Machine learning a while ago and now I face my first real world example. The problem is I have small data set (less then 50 rows) and about 200 features to predict one continuous value (regression problem). The main idea is to create a model, and then play with the features until I get the the predicted value close to the value that I want. Then I make an experiment and hopefully the value is close to predicted. I read some articles about small data in Machine learning, so I know to use simple models (linear regression, random forest), use feature selection, use K-Fold for cross-validation, remove outliers, maybe generate synthetic data, use Ensemble learning, Regularization. I would like to know what are your recommendations, can I solve the problem any other way (maybe not even machine learning?), and how to improve accuracy. If you have any sources on this that would be also great. I only used google till now.
