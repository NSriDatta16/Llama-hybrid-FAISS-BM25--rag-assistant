Grouping controllers in Asp.NET MVC?

I would like to create a sub folder in the controllers folder of an Asp.Net MVC application. But when ever I do this and try to navigate to a page the controller can not be found. Here's a concrete example. Currently I have: Controlers/UserAdminControler.cs Controlers/PageAdminControler.cs Controlers/MenuAdminControler.cs Controlers/SomeOtherControler.cs ... I want to organize it like this: Controlers/Admin/UserAdminControler.cs Controlers/Admin/PageAdminControler.cs Controlers/Admin/MenuAdminControler.cs Controlers/SomeOtherControler.cs ... I found a way to create "Areas." This is a really nice idea and article but that is not really what I am looking for my site: http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/04/areas-in-aspnetmvc.aspx As well I have found that you can create sub folders in the Views directory (when you return View() you simply supply the path as a parameter). All I need now is to figure out how to add sub folders in the controllers directory.
