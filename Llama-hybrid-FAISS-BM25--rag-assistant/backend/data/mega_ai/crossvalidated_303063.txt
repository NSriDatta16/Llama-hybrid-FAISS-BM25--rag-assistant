How to write interpretation for transformed response variable?

I have an average score as a response, while days and distance as independent variables. Distance is categorical with two categories: long distance and short distance. This is my regression: (Y)^1/2 = 4.53 + 4.92 day - 0.54 day^2 - 0.2*Short Therefore, I have two curves: Long distance: (Y)^1/2 = 4.53 + 4.92 day - 0.54 day^2 Short distance: (Y)^1/2 = 4.33 + 4.92 day - 0.54 day^2 How should I make the interpretation?
