I see that it is an old post, but I came across the same problem recently. I am not sure what this value implies, but, it is not the forecast for sure. One reason is that if you run the following predict(model,n=1000) and look at the time series, the values are the same with a greater mean squared error. Nevertheless, the main premise behind the GARCH model is stationarity such that the volatility converges to a fixed value over time. To demonstrate this, for a stationary time series R, consider the following g where the horizontal line is the unconditional variance: $$ \sigma^2 = \frac{\omega}{1-\alpha-\beta} $$
