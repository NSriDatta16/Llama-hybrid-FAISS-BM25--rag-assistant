For figures you can use the method described here : http://texblog.net/latex-archive/layout/centering-figure-table/ namely, do something like this: \begin{figure}[h] \makebox[\textwidth]{% \includegraphics[width=1.5\linewidth]{bla.png} } \end{figure} Notice that if you have subfigures in the figure, you'll probably want to enter into paragraph mode inside the box, like so: \begin{figure}[h] \makebox[\textwidth]{\parbox{1.5\textwidth}{ % \centering \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{a.png}} \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{b.png}} \end{figure} For allowing the figure to be centered in the page, protruding into both margins rather than only the right margin. This usually does the trick for images. Notice that with this method, the caption of the image will still be in the delimited by the normal margins of the page (which is a good thing).
