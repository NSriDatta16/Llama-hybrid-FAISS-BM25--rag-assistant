Perhaps other will offer a more detailed explanation on what exactly is going on but here are some practical tips/ideas: Finding a difference on the manipulation check and on the variable of interest is already very encouraging. It is certainly good enough for many accomplished researchers and prestigious publications so don't worry about the project being a waste of time because of that. This could be an example of the “ecological fallacy”. When you try to correlate the manipulation check (superordinate identity) and the taxes your participants would be willing to spend, you are looking at individual-level data, which can have another pattern than group-level data. Don't obsess over statistical significance or put too much emphasis on the significance threshold. For example, correlation can be high or low, not only present or absent, and it is meaningful to interpret that kind of differences. A related idea is that “the difference between significant and not significant is not itself significant”. Concretely this means that the p -value of the F-test is something like .03 and the correlation is not significantly different from 0 with p = .08, both results are in fact very similar. As a consequence of the previous points, you should in any case create plots and interpret them (possibly post them here as well if you wish) rather than pour over lists of p -values. The Pearson correlation coefficient reflects linear relationships. It's possible than the relationship between a quantitative measure of the manipulation and the outcome has another shape, explaining the null result, even if the ANOVA suggests the manipulation does produce some sort of effect. The absence of a significant difference should not be interpreted as definitive evidence that there was no effect (as you appear to do in several places). If the sample size is small it often means that you just don't know precisely the sign or the magnitude of the correlation, but not necessarily that it is very close to 0.
