Just in case someone else has this same issue: We finally found out that there where some timeout errors from the SQL server, and there was an error message prompt on the Notes server that would block the agent for running until clicked on the ok button (!). In order to avoid these "visual" prompt errors on the server I found out about the SilentMode option on my OCBC connection definition: here's what you have to do: con.SilentMode = True Thanks anyway!
