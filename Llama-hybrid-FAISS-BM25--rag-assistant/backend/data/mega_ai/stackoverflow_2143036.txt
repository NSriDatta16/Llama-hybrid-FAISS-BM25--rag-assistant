Global variables in SQL

Let's say I wanted to create a sql script and do something like this: DECLARE @SomeVariable int SET @SomeVariable = 'VALUE' FROM someTable --do stuff with @SomeVariable GO CREATE PROCEDURE myProcedure ( @MyParameter ) AS SET NOCOUNT ON --Do something --Do something using @SomeVariable SET NOCOUNT OFF RETURN 0 GO I can't, because @SomeVariable dies with the batch he belongs to, and myProcedure requires its own batch. Obviously I could create a #temp table and stuff any values I needed in there, but then I would have to select from it - adding code that, while trivial, hurts readability and seems silly when all I need is a global variable. Is there a better way? To be painfully clear. I KNOW SQL Server has "global variables" called "tables" - I mentioned in the above paragraph that using a #table is a possible solution, as is using an actual permanent table. What I'm looking for here is probably more of a global constant that I can use anywhere within a given script, not a global variable - so we can all stop wetting our pants about the evils of global variables.
