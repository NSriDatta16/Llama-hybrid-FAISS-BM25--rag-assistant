I know quite a few professional Access developers who have developed and maintained Enterprise-level apps using Access as the front end (either MDB or ADP) and supporting user populations in the 100s (and even in a few cases, thousands). Like any Enterprise-level application development, it requires a higher level of programming skill than building a little Access database for your 5-person department. Oddly enough, the design principles that make for an efficient Enterprise-level app also make for a more efficient workgroup-level Access app. I think the reason most of the people posting in this thread can't conceive of it as a good solution is simply because they've never seen it done properly, or were themselves not sympathetic to the development model that Access uses. Yes, it's hard to do properly. But at that level, so is every other development platform -- all of them require planning, experience and a high-level skillset. And you can rag on Access apps developed by people without all of that (Enterprise or not), but frankly, I've encountered a boatload of non-Access database apps of all kinds that are incredibly badly implemented. Sturgeon's law applies everywhere, and there's no reason to assume that Access development would be any different.
