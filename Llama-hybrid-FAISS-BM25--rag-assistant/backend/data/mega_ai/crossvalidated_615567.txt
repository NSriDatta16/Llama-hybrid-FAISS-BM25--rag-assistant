Can a machine learning algorithm learn to differentiate a function?

As the question says, can a machine learning algorithm learn to differentiate a function?(Eg. If we give such a network a function $f(x)$ , it should output its derivative $f'(x)$ .) Clearly, a simple feed forward neural network should not be able to do so, but I have a strong feeling that recurrent neural networks can. Has this been done before? How complex does the network have to be?
