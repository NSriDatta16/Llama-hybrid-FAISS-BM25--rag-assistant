Paul Irish's approach to IE specific CSS is the most elegant I've seen. It uses conditional statements to add classes to the HTML element, which can then be used to apply appropriate IE version specific CSS without resorting to hacks. The CSS validates, and it will continue to work down the line for future browser versions. The full details of the approach can be seen on his site . This doesn't cover browser specific hacks for Mozilla and Chrome... but I don't really find I need those anyway.
