It looks like the method name ( isWhitespace ) is inconsistent with its function (to detect separators). The "separator" functionality is fairly clear if you look at the full list of characters from the Javadoc page you quoted: * It is a Unicode space character (SPACE_SEPARATOR, LINE_SEPARATOR, or PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR) but is not also a non-breaking space ('\u00A0', '\u2007', '\u202F'). * It is '\u0009', HORIZONTAL TABULATION. * It is '\u000A', LINE FEED. * It is '\u000B', VERTICAL TABULATION. * It is '\u000C', FORM FEED. * It is '\u000D', CARRIAGE RETURN. * It is '\u001C', FILE SEPARATOR. * It is '\u001D', GROUP SEPARATOR. * It is '\u001E', RECORD SEPARATOR. * It is '\u001F', UNIT SEPARATOR. A non-breaking space's function is supposed to be visual space between words that is not separated by hyphenation algorithms.
