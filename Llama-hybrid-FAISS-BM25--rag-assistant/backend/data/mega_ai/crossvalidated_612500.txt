Is it possible to turn PCA into ICA by rotating the eigenvectors?

Assume that you have made a PCA analysis and you got your eigenvectors inside the projection matrix $W$ . If you project your data $X$ with $W$ , then you get the desired projected dimension. But PCA and ICA are opposite. If we look at this picture. PCA is projecting the most principal data, while ICA is projecting the most non commonly data. My question is simple: Is it possible to turn PCA into ICA by rotating the eigenvectors in some angles? If yes, how?
