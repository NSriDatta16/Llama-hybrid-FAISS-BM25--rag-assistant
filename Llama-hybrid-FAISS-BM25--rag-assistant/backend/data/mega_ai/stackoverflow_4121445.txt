I ran into the same problem as you, but I came up with a JVM bug report ( https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=6354345 ) that cast some light on the issue. It basically comes down to the Java agent library not ever being intended to be loaded twice into the same VM. Sucks, but seems like it's basic limitation of the agent system that you can't do both at the same time.
