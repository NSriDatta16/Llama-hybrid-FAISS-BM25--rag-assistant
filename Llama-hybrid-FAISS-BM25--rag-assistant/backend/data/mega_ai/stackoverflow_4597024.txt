Current state of client-side XSLT

Last I heard, Blizzard was one of the few companies to put client-side XSLT into practice (2008). Is this still the case in 2011, or are more people now exploring this technique in production? It seems that modern browsers (IE9, FF4, Chrome) and client processing power are primed to exploit this standard for tangible savings in server CPU power and bandwidth on large scale properties. Am I missing something? The negative aspects I'm aware of include additional rendering time additional assets required on uncached page load additional layer of complexity noticably less developer experience than server-side template techniques The benefits I perceive include template composition offloaded on the client caching of common template fragments offloaded on the client logical separation of document structure and data well-documented web standard supported by all modern browsers Finally, although I know it's impossible to predict the future, I am curious to know opinions on whether or not client-side XSLT's day will come. With interest in HTML5 driving users to upgrade their browsers and developers to explore new techniques, I'm eager to see what develops. Thanks in advance, Casey Edit: Any insight into how transformed XML is viewed by Google and the ramifications it has on SEO is appreciated too.
