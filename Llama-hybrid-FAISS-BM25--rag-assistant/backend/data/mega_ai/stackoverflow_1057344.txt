Couple of quick options:- Use a 64bit system to run the stateserver and give it plenty of storage, this is not necessarily lots of RAM (although that helps performance) but a seriously oversized Pagefile would do, use a speedy RAID set up to minimise the impact of the paging. Use a SQL server based state store instead.
