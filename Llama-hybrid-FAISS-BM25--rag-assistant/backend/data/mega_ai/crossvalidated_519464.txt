This is definitely not an "autoregressive" model, which is a time series process where today's realizations depend on last week's realizations, and the ones from the week(s) before that. So: something completely different. I do not think there is a specific name for this process, beyond "simulation". A procedure like this can be useful when we are interested in finding out how well a model building algorithm performs in recovering a known underlying data generating process. For instance, we might simulate an autoregressive time series of order $p$ , run the simulated data through an AR fitting algorithm and check whether it will recover the original order $p$ , and how closely the fitted parameters match the ones used in the original simulation. (The answer is usually surprisingly disappointing.) I have done similar things and never called them any different than a "simulation", with some words of explanation as to what precisely I was simulating.
