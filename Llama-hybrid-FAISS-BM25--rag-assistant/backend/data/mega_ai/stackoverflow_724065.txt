I've done something similar using just the "EAGLayer" or whatever it's called. Just draw the background first then draw more things on top. This worked because the tapping functionality of the bottom "layer" was either none or minimal. When I wanted tapping functionality in the bottom "layer" I just looked for taps near certain xy coords (as opposed to dragging/dropping buttons like you would with a real layer.) It really depends on what you want to do with the bottom layer. If all you want is the flower pic then my approach works. If you want to drag/drop more complex UI controls then my approach won't work.
