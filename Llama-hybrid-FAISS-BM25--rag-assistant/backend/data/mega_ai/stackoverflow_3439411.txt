RDBMS strategies for storing heirarchical lists? querying/outputting them?

I'd like to store a fair bit of text data with the following structure: 1. Overall Text A 1.1 Subsection Text 1.1.1 Clarification A 1.1.2 Clarification B 1.2 Another Subsection 1.2.1 Don't forget A 1.2.2 Don't forget B 1.2.3 or C! 2. Overall Text B 2.1 getting the idea yet? Section levels would range from 1 (flat) to 4, though there is no absolute max. Each item would be at least one paragraph's worth of text. And it's important to preserve the numbering scheme. I'm using MySQL and PHP for the site, and this concerns a section I'd like to add. How does one best store these data and relationships in an RDBMS, and then how does one get them out again and display them logically with PHP?
