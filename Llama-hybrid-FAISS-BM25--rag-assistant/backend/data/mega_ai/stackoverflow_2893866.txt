Drag rows out of a multiselect DataGridView

I'm having a problem dragging rows out of a datagridview. The grid has the property multiselect = true and every time I select the rows I want to drag out and then left click on the grid again, the selected rows disappear. Anyone got a solution / a working example? Thx.
