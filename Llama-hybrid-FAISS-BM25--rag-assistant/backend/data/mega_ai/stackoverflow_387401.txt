The document which is displayed (for each mime type) is specified in a particular folder in the "system file system" (which is a NetBeans concept which is a virtual file system composed from contributions from individual modules; this is how functionality is dynamically registered in NetBeans). Modules typically specify their system file system contributions in a file named "layer.xml" in the plugin. The create plugin templates typically offer to create this for you. For example, here's how the Python example is registered: ... ... Here, PythonExample.py is a sample file in the same directory as the layer file. Therefore, what you need to do is create a plugin which overrides the existing registration(s) for the mime type(s) you care about and provide alternate sample documents. You may need to hide the existing registration first (see the _hidden part from http://doc.javanb.com/netbeans-api-javadoc-5-0-0/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/MultiFileSystem.html ). Hopefully this guides you in the right direction. However, in thinking about it, we probably ought to make the preview area editable - so people can cut & paste whatever codefragment they care about right in there. This wouldn't be persistent, so whenever you change languages you get the original samples back - but it provides a quick way to see your own code. This shouldn't be just for the Fonts & Colors customization, but for the Formatting preview panels as well. I've filed an issue against NetBeans for this: http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=155964 -- Tor
