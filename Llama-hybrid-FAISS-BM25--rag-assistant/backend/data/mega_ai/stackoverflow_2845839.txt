I'd store the schema as a blob of XML and the data as another blob of XML. You can easily serialize/unserialize this and there are standards for XML schemas already. If you need to index some part of the data for fast retrieval, then I'd pull that information out into additional columns on which you can index. But certainly keep the XML blobs.
