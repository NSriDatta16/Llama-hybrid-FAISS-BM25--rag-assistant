how to configure Magento in my local xampp

Now i want to install magento, I downloaded the files from magentocommerce.com and extract it and run the installation file. In the second step once i entered the DBhost,Dbusername and DBpassword and navigate my installation to the next step it throws an error "*o Database server does not support the InnoDB storage engine.o Database connection error." Can anyone please guide me to install magento in my local. Regards, Arun
