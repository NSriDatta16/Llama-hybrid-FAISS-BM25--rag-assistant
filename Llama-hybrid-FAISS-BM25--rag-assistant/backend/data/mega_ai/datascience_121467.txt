How does variational autoencoders actually work in comparison to GAN?

I want to know about how variational autoencoders work. I am currently working in a company and we want to incorporate variational autoencoders for creating synthetic data. I have questions regarding this method though, is this the only way to generate synthetic or artificial data? Is there a difference between VAE and GANs, is one preferred over the other? I am also not a person with a lot of mathematical background and a bit wary on the implementation of it. Finally, I have gone through many links and videos on the implementation through PyTorch and Tensorflow. Are both similar in implementation? I went through this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zKuYvjFFS8&ab_channel=ArxivInsights However, still not fully grasped a simpler way to implement this technique. Any help with understanding and its implementation would be greatly appreciated.
