How do I drag and drop between two listboxes in XUL?

I am trying to implement drag and drop between two listboxes. I have a few problems 1) I am not detecting any drag events of any kind from the source list box/ I do not seem to be able to drag from it 2) I can drag from my desktop to the target listbox and I am able to detect 'dragenter' 'dragover' and 'dragexit' events. I am noticing that the event parameter is undefined in my 'dragenter' callback - is this a problem? 3) I cannot figure out how to complete the drag and drop operation. From https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/Drag_Operations#Performing_ ... "If the mouse was released over an element that is a valid drop target, that is, one that cancelled the last dragenter or dragover event, then the drop will be successful, and a drop event will fire at the target. Otherwise, the drag operation is cancelled and no drop event is fired." This seems to be referring to a 'drop' event, though there is not one listed at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Events . I can't seem to detect the end of the drag in order to call one of the example 'doDrop()' functions that I find on MDC. My example, so far: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/713676 List1 List2
