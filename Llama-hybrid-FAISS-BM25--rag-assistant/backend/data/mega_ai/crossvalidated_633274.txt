The sampling algorithms are designed in such a way that frequency of samples is proportional to probability associated with respective state of parameter space. Then, if you for example want to calculate mean value of some parameter conditioned on specific value of some other parameter you average across relevant samples. For proof that the sampling procedures generate appropriate sample distribution I recommend books by Bishop (Pattern recognition and machine learning) and MacKay's book on information theory.
