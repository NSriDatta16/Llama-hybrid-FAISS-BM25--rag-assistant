The situation you are describing would be a subset of typical Adjust Plus/Minus calculations. One way to set this regression up would be to set "Team 1 Winning" as the dependent variable. This target variable would be 1 sometimes and 0 sometimes. Then, create a large matrix of dummy variables (this could be a sparse matrix) with all players represented. Players on team 1 would be represented with a 1, players on team 2 would be represented with a -1, and players not represented in the given game would be a 0. This could then be solved using a logistic regression to estimate player effects. Given that colinearity would be likely in the dataset, a penalized regression approach would likely give more valid results.
