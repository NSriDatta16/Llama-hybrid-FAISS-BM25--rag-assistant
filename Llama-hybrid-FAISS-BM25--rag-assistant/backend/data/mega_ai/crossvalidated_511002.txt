Significance of different levels of categorial variable in the GLM

Problem I would like to measure the effects of different treatments on the distribution of subjects between the two groups ( If you need more details, subjects are cells and I want to measure the effect of different gene knockouts on cell differentiation ). I fit Generalized Linear Model of the following form: \begin{align} Y &\sim {\rm Binom}(p|N) \\ {\rm logit}(p) &\sim N(\beta X^T, \Sigma) \end{align} Here $Y$ represents observed number of subjects in each of the two groups for different treatments and design matrix $X$ represents dummy-encoded categorical treatment variable. Note that columns of $X$ are orthogonal as each observed subject is only treated by one treatment. When generating $X$ I drop the level that corresponds to non-treated subjects such that the intercept represent the background distribution between the two groups in the absence of the treatment. Therefore coefficients $\beta$ represent the effect of each treatment compared to non-treated control. Question When interpreting the output from summary.glm() (below), do I need to correct the p-values (i.e., Pr(>|z|) ) if I want to select the treatments that have significant effects? Will the answer change if I observe the same population before and after treatment? Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.2600440 0.2522047 -12.926 I found a related question on CrossValidated: How to test the statistical significance for categorical variable in linear regression? However, that question deals with interpreting the overall significance of the categorical variable rather than its levels. EDIT : The model is a logistic regression and is formulated as follows: \begin{align} Y &\sim {\rm Binom}(p|N) \\ {\rm logit}(p) &= \beta X^T + \epsilon \\ \epsilon &\sim Logistic(0, S) \end{align}
