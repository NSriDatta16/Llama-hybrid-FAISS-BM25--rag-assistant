I'm using treat warnings as errors. In a rare cases, when some acceptable warning shows up (i.e. referencing obsolete member, or missing documentation on XML serialization classes), then it has to be explicitly suppressed with #pragma disable (and optionally reason for not having a clean code could be provided as a comment along). Presence of this directive also allows to find out, who accepted this warning violation (by "blame" action of version control) in case there are some questions.
