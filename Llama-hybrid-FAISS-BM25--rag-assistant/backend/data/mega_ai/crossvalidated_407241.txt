In principle you can do this, but you have to correct for autocorrelation in the Markov chain. This is done by various packages (e.g. coda) that calculate naive (uncorrected) and corrected SEs for the mean and other statistics (see summary in coda). With coda, you can also calculate what is called the "effective sample size", i.e. an effective n for the Markov Chain, corrected for autocorrelation. You could use the effective sample size in your formula, if you want to calculate SEs for non-standard outputs. Note, however, that this method assumes that the autocorrelation is homogenous, while in practice it often changes when the MCMC explores different areas of the parameter space. If that is the case, correcting with the average autocorrelation is likely anti-conservative.
