If you have access to run svnadmin on their server, it'll be no problem, and I see Dav has already linked to instructions for that. Now, if you don't have access to run svnadmin , as far as I know it's not possible to use the SVN client itself (maybe TortoiseSVN for you) to copy the entire repository. ( EDIT : never mind, I guess that was wrong. I'll leave the git info here just for the fun of it though.) But you can convert a whole Subversion repository to git, and here are instructions for doing that: http://pauldowman.com/2008/07/26/how-to-convert-from-subversion-to-git/ From there, you might be able to convert the git repository back into an SVN repository on another server. I know it's not really the answer you were looking for but if nothing else works, it will at least let you save your project's history in some form. (And hey, you could take it as an excuse to switch to distributed version control, which is all the rage these days)
