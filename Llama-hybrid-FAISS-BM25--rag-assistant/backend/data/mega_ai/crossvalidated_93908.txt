Intuitively, the (estimated) model parameters are hazard ratios. They're constant across time. So for any arbitrary "average" hazard function (of time), hazard ratios are all you need to describe the difference in risk between groups. The "intercept" from a Cox model is a baseline hazard function, or a time-varying hazard function for individuals having 0 values for all parameters. As is the case in semi-parametric inference, we like to use nifty tricks to avoid estimating such complicated functions as a baseline hazard. The partial likelihood is a ratio of hazards among those who fail and those who live on at each failure time: (individuals in the "risk set"). If you write out the math, you'll see that the baseline hazard function cancels out and so you get partial likelihood contributions that do not vary as a function of time. The one wrinkle about information regarding times is the specification of the risk set: this is why only the ordering of event times matters... this is what compelled Cox to call it a partial likelihood and not a conditional likelihood. When you think of the interpretation of the $p$-value, you consider the event times as given, but permutations of which individuals fail when is the only contribution to "randomness" in the sample. The partial likelihood behaves much like a regular likelihood and can be maximized to obtain estimates of time-invariant hazard ratios.
