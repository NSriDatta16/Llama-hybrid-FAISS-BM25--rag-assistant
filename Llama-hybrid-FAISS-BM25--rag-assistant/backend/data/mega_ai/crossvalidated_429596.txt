Demand forecasting

I am forecasting number of phone calls (y) i ll be getting based on the products sold(x) and I am doing the following: (forecasted y) = (y/x averaged for past three weeks) * (forecasted x). 1. Please let me know if this is apt to do there is any other method I can try. 2. Also how should I calculate the percentage change in y based on the percentage change in x I feel this method is flawed because forecasted y are already forecasted using x historical and then by multiplying by forecasted x am I increasing the impact of x on y Thank you so much everyone!
