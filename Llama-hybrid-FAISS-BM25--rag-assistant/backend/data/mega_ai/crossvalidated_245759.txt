I don't see any reason to be concerned about heteroscedasticity. The absence of any predicted values in the interval $[135, 145]$ is a little weird, but not necessarily problematic, and isn't related to the issue of heteroscedasticity. Homoscedasticity just means that the vertical scatter of the points around the line is constantâ€”it has nothing really to do with their horizontal spread (see here ). Most likely there is a gap in $X$ that corresponds to the gap in $\hat y$ here. Also, be aware that the nature of variance is that it will appear to spread out more where there is more data / a higher density of data, so I doubt the slight difference in spread between the left cluster and middle cluster of residuals means anything. On the other hand, you have a single datum with a high fitted value that could be driving your results. I might be worried about that. You could check the leverage and Cook's distance values associated with that point (cf., here ), or try fitting the model without it as a sensitivity analysis and see if the results are similar enough with respect to what you care about.
