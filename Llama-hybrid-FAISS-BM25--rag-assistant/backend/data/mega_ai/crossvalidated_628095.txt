A couple of thoughts on this: I wouldn't describe any of the effects in this regression model as time-varying. As you correctly point out in the last paragraph, this is a deterministic seasonal pattern, consisting of a linear trend plus trigonometric components. Are the priors on the model coefficients $\alpha, \mu, \{ \nu_k \}, \{ \lambda_k \}$ essential? Given enough observations, you could just estimate them with OLS. I agree that a state-space model would give you more flexibility. Allowing time-varying coefficients is one advantage, but there are others: Your starting point would be a linear state-space model, so you don't need particle filters. You can implement this very easily (and efficiently) with the Kalman filter. Even if you assume that your model coefficients are fixed, the Kalman filter would give you estimates of these coefficients at each time point using only the data that has already been observed. This is particularly useful if you're interested in 1-step-ahead forecasts.
