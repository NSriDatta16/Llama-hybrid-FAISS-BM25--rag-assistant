jquery slideshow using background images

I have a div which currently has a static background image. I need to create a slideshow of background images for this div. I am able to achieve this by just setting a timeout and then changing the background image in the CSS but this is not very elegant. I would ideally like to fade the background images out and in, but the div contains other page elements so I can not alter the opacity in any way. Does anyone know of a good way to do this using jquery?? Here's some code which fades out/in but fades out the contents of the div too. $("#slideshow").fadeOut(5000, function(){ $("#slideshow").css('background-image','url(myImage.jpg)'); $("#slideshow").fadeIn(5000); });
