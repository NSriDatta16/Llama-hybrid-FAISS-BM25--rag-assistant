A RubyGems with documentation, source management and API documentation?

I have been wondering why so many coders have bad organization in their documents. I think I know why. As usual it has to do with standardization. If no standard it out there, everyone has to reinvent the wheel all the time. So I upload a gem at RubyGems.org. But that was only 1/4 of it all. I have to write a tutorial for it, making categories, text style, size, color etc I have to generate API documentation from my code I have to put it in Git-hub (never done this, but that should be correct?) It's a painful process. Wouldn't it be great if every gem followed the same documentation structure. You upload your gem, you write a documentation for it that everyone can edit, the API documentation has been generated too, maybe created automatically, if you provided your account information for example. A good process. I think that would boost up good collaboration and environment than every gem has its own structure (bad documentations) and putting API documentation here and there. Don't you agree?
