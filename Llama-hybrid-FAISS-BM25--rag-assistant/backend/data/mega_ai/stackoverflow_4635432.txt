How to extract the content of a specific div from another page on the same server?

Hello friends I am running 2 applications on the same server and I wanted to import some content of Application-1 into Application-2 and similarly some content of Application-2 into Application-2. Currently this is how I am getting it: Like this I am saving these 2 files with the HTML of those applications Now lets say I have a in cms.html which I want to import in of Application-2's index.php file and a in blog.html which I want in of Application-1's index.php file. How do I do this? UPDATE : Both applications are Joomla and WordPress. My Template is a simple one without any JavaScript so kindly suggest a PHP solution until and unless it is compulsory to load JavaScript, I want to keep it simple and light. Please also note I have just started learning programing hence It will be very difficult for me to understand too technical a language hence requesting a simple language. Hope you understand. If my approach is wrong at the very first place, then please feel free to suggest a better method of doing this task. Kindly help. UPDATE 2 : Please not my issue is not of getting content from the other application. My issue is to get a fragment of the HTML file that is being generated.
