I just did a fresh check out of the NHibernate source code and ran NCover on the NHibernate.Test DLL, which contains most of the NHibernate test cases. The result was a coverage of about 80% . However, since there are test cases in other DLL:s as well the total coverage probably is slightly higher than that.
