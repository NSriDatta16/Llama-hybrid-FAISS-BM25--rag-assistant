I'm not sure Windows XP will fully support what you need. There are three things you have to do to enable Unicode with a command console: Start the command window with cmd /u . The /u says your programs will output Unicode. Use chcp 65001 to indicate you want to use UTF-8 instead of one of the code pages. Select a font with more glyph coverage. The command windows in newer versions of Windows offer Lucida Console Unicode . My XP box has a subset of that called Lucida Console . It doesn't have a very extensive repertoire, but it should be sufficient if you're just trying to display some accented characters.
