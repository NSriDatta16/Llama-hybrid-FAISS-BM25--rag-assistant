Intervention analysis and forecasting in this type of data

I am working on a project where I am to do the intervention analysis and forecasting based on the time series. The problem is something like: I have a normal time series entries but in between them some known event like natural calamities (storm, tornado) happens. I have the data for that and it affects the normal time series. Now my objective is to forecast the value of time series both in normal mode and also when I have a prediction of storm coming. I have been reading Forecasting with dynamic regression chapter 7 about intervention analysis. I am also reading about the transfer function modeling. Can you please help me as in which model is good for this kind of time series analysis? Or may be some link which can guide me as how to do it? I will appreciate a link with some example in R or some examples. EDIT: I guess I was not correct in description but I know the exact time information of all the previous storm events and I sort of want to find out the effect of storm intervention on the time series and I can forecast more closely if I know that there is a storm happening right now.
