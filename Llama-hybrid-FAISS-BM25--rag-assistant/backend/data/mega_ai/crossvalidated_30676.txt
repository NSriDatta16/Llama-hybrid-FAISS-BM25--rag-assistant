I Assume from your question and comment that the 30 output variables can not (easily) or should not be transformed to a single variate. One idea to deal with data of $\mathbf{X_A}^{(n \times p_A)} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{X_B}^{(n \times p_B)}$ is that you could do regression of $\mathbf{X_A}^{(n \times p_A)} \mapsto \mathbf{X_B}^{(n \times p_B)}$ and vice versa. Additional knowledge (e.g. that variate $i$ in set A corresponds to variate $i$ also in set B) can help to restrict the mapping model and/or with the interpretation. So what about multi block PCA (or -PLS) which take this idea further? For these methods, both multivariate fingerprints for the same samples (or same individuals) are analyzed together as independent variables, with or without a third dependent block. R. Brereton: "Chemometrics for Pattern Recognition" discusses some techniques in the last chapter ("Comparing Different Patterns") and googling will lead you to a number of papers, also introductions. Note that your situations sounds similar to problems where e.g. spectroscopic and genetic measurements are analysed together (two matrices with a row-wise correspondence as opposed to analyzing e.g. time series of spectra where a data cube is analysed). Here's a paper dealing with multi-block analysis: Sahar Hassani: Analysis of -omics data: Graphical interpretation- and validation tools in multi-block methods . Also, maybe this is a good starting point into another direction: Hoefsloot et.al., Multiset Data Analysis: ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis and Related Methods, in: Comprehensive Chemometrics â€” Chemical and Biochemical Data Analysis (I don't have access to it, just saw the abstract)
