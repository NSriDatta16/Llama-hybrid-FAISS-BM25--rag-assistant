What type of stationarity preferred during the time series analysis: strong stationary or week stationary?

I was googling the answer for the above-mentioned question. I had the definition of both but I don't know which one is preferred during the analysis. So which one is recommended? Reason? Thank you! In this blog , it mentioned that "Note that statistics assumes that the variable examined is strong stationary (serial independent)." Well, I got a short answer from the professor. According to him, weak stationary is the basic and it will be the same for Gaussian distributions. WHY??? And my question was which one would be more preferred. Anybody would like to elaborate a little bit:)
