PCA for unsupervised feature selection

If I understood correctly, "using results of PCA to select features" (as recommended in this answer ) implies visually analysing bi-plots of first two principal components - i.e. the angle between a feature and a principal component. This approach seems impossible with high number of features. Is there a way to interpret the loadings of principal components for automatic feature selection?
