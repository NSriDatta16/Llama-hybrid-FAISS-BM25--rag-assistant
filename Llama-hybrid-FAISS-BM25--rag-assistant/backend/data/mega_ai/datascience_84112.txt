Subsequence parttern matching for time series

I have a set of time series data (just like voice sequence data) with the pattern as shown in the first figure (theoretical data). The measured data is given as presented in the second figure. What I want to do is localizing/finding the subsequent pattern as shown in the red squares. Is there any algorithm to solve this problem? It looks like the classification/regression problem in machine learning, but I have no idea how to start it.
