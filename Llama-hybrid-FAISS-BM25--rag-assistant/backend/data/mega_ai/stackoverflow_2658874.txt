Wireshark uses the pcap (or possibly winpcap) library to capture network packets. Although they are written in C/C++ there are various .net wrappers available for them including WinPcapNet, SharpPcap and Pcap.net. I haven't used any of these so I can't comment on their usability. I'm posting this from my phone so it's an absolute pain adding links, if you go to the Wikipedia page for pcap you should find the links you need there.
