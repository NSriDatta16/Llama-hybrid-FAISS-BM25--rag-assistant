So I took this opportunity to learn Stan and some Bayesian modelling. This allows filling everything in into a model and let it do it's thing Here is the Stan model I used: data { int Npos; int Nneg; int testPos[Npos]; int testNeg[Nneg]; int Nc; int chelsea[Nc]; int Npop; int deaths[Npop]; } parameters { real tpr; real fpr; real infectionRate; real lethality; } model { testPos ~ bernoulli(tpr); testNeg ~ bernoulli(fpr); chelsea ~ bernoulli(infectionRate*tpr + (1-infectionRate)*fpr); deaths ~ bernoulli(infectionRate*lethality); } This models the true positive rate (tpr) and False Positive rate (fpr) based on the Biomedics paper. We use these together with the chelsea study date to estiamte the infectionRate. And lastly we use this to estimate the mortality rate. We get confidence intervals for all paramaters estimated. If we would have just used the mean estimates from previous step we would get similar estimation for all the means but the 97.5% quantile estimation for lethality rate would have been 0.48% without propagating uncertainty vs 0.63% with. So not as huge of a difference as I thought, but a nice effect and I learned a new tool. Thanks Stan.(and Bj√∂rn for the reference)
