Which .NET Development Controls/Tools suite do you think can be worth to pay for

I'm thinking on purchase a Control suite to meet some specific client needs in a WPF LOB Application. I also have application SilverLight, ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC Any Advise on that? I consider evaluate Telerik, DevExpress, ComponentOne, Infragistics. I want to pay less money but get the more benefits that I can afford. Thanks
