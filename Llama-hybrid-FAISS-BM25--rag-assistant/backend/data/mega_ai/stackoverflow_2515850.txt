Symfony 1.4: how to enable non-numerical IDs for routes in admin generator?

My model is built on non-numerical ID's (36-char. GUID to be specific). The problem is that when I run symfony 1.4 admin generator, it assumes that all my IDs are numeric and applies default routing requirements. I tried providing specific routing requirements as advised here: http://www.codemassacre.com/2009/04/27/symfony-12-admin-with-custom-primary-key/ In my case the snippet from routing.yml is: organization: class: sfPropelRouteCollection options: model: Organization module: account prefix_path: /account column: id with_wildcard_routes: true requirements: id: \w+ However, I am still getting 404 errors indicating that my route wasn't matched. The URL I am matching is "/account/8985329a-fd3b-41a0-b27b-f45c80d51765/edit". It looks like my requirement for the given route is being ignored. I could create my routes manually but I'd rather not.
