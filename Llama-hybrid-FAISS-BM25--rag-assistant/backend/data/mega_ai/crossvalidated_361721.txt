ACF gives you information about moving average(MA) processes while PACF gives you insight about auto regressive (AR) processes. The graphs you have in your output can produce a consistent model. For a brief explanation (without the theory), you can look at Table 3.1 p 104 here . For more theoretic answer you can read couple of sections before the graph.
