If I could make a suggestion, there might be a more elegant solution. Simply disallow non-numeric keys to be entered at all: **Allow me to revise, this function should work better than the one previously posted: $(".pricing").keypress(function(event) { // disallow anything non-numeric var nonNumeric = /[0-9\.]+/g; var key = String.fromCharCode(event.which); if (!(key == '' || nonNumeric.test(String.fromCharCode(event.which)) || event.which == 8 || event.which == 13)) { return false; } }); Of course, you'll probably want to fine tune a bit but this should get you started. Also, if you're concerned about what dclowd9901 said above, you could display a validation message saying that non-numeric entries are not allowed, rather than simply swallowing the keystroke.
