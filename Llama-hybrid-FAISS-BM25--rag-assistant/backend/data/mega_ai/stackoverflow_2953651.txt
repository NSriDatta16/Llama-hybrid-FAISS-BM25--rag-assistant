Python unicode Decode Error SUDs

OK so I have # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the top of my script and it worked for being able to pull data from the database that had funny chars(Ñ ,Õ,é,—,–,’,…) in it and store that data into variables...but I have run into other problems, see I pull my data, organize it, and then dump it into a variables like so: title = product[1] Where product[1] is from my database result set Then I load it up for Suds like so: array_of_inventory_item_submit = ca_client_inventory.factory.create('ArrayOfInventoryItemSubmit') for product in products: inventory_item_submit = ca_client_inventory.factory.create('InventoryItemSubmit') inventory_item_list = get_item_list(product) inventory_item_submit = [inventory_item_list] array_of_inventory_item_submit.InventoryItemSubmit.append(inventory_item_submit) #Call that service baby! ca_client_inventory.service.SynchInventoryItemList(accountID, array_of_inventory_item_submit) Where get_item_list sets product[1] to title and (including a whole bunch of other nodes): inventory_item_submit.Title = title So everything runs fine until I call ca_client_inventory.service.SynchInventoryItemList that contains array_of_inventory_item_submit which contains the title w/ the funky char...here is the error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "upload_all_inventory_ebay.py", line 421, in ca_client_inventory.service.SynchInventoryItemList(accountID, array_of_inventory_item_submit) File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/client.py", line 539, in __call__ File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/client.py", line 592, in invoke File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/bindings/binding.py", line 118, in get_message File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/bindings/document.py", line 63, in bodycontent File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/bindings/document.py", line 105, in mkparam File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/bindings/binding.py", line 260, in mkparam File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/core.py", line 62, in process File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/core.py", line 75, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 102, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 243, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 182, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/core.py", line 75, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 102, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 298, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 182, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/core.py", line 75, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 102, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 298, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 182, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/core.py", line 75, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 102, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 243, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 182, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/core.py", line 75, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 102, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/mx/appender.py", line 198, in append File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/sax/element.py", line 251, in setText File "build/bdist.macosx-10.6-i386/egg/suds/sax/text.py", line 43, in __new__ UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 116: ordinal not in range(128) Now what? My guess is my script can take in these funky chars because I have # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the top but Suds does NOT have that at the top of its files. Do I really want to go and change the Suds files...we all know this is the least desired last possible solution...what can I do?
