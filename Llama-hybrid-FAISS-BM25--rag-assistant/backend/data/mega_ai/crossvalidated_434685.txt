What is Gaussian in BO: Can I use bayesian optimization for binary classification task?

BO works based on gaussian process, so what is gaussian there? Can I use BO for binary classification task, for example neural network which has output with logistic activation and is minimizing binary cross entropy loss ? target is thus from binary distribution and the noise is not gaussian.
