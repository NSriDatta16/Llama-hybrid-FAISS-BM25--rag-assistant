What is the meaning of fuzz factor?

I came across this documentation in keras for the list of backend functions One of which was keras.backend.epsilon() The documentation says that it returns the value of the fuzz factor used in numeric expressions. However I could not understand what fuzz factor is and how is it used in the context of neural networks. Please help me out. Thanks in advance
