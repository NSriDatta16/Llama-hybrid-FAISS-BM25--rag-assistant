I'm assuming you are trying to send the file as an email attachment using intents. The reason why the file is empty is that the email app does not have access to the file in /data/data/package_name/myfile_name , due to Androids security model (the /data/data/package_name directory is private to your app). In order to add the file as an attachment, you need to write it to public storage (such as the SD card) so the email app can access it.
