I use something mixed. On the wiki, there is a requirements page (among other pages), which describes the features and delivery data. Some features has separated topics where design/implementation details are explained. The requirements topic includes links to bugs with a short description of the bug/feature. Not all features are reflected as bugs. All bugs are listed in the current release section, if they are planned to be fixed in that release. A separated link goes to bug-tracking system to show all the bugs for the product (there are many products in the bug tracker). So: all features, bug fixes are listed on the requirements page under a particular release; bug tracking system contains bugs found during testing; there is no exact definition which requests go to the bug tracker and which don't. An external reviewer may report feature requests as tickets in the bug tracker. the key point is to keep all the requirements together and organized per release. Maybe there are better ways to organize things, but this one is the simplest to me, and doesn't require lots of time.
