CODA gleman.diag, Error in chol.default(W):

I'd like to use gelman.diag for an MCMC chain I ran in JAGS. It is very large, so I can't provide it. The chain contains several MVN distributions, and I use a wishart prior on the precision matrix. Just wondering what potential sources of this error might be? Thanks you
