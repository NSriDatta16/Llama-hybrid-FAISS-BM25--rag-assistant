You can just subscribe to each button's Click event as you create them. For example: Button newButton = new Button(); // Setup button... newButton.Click += this.ClickHandler; Then, somewhere else: private void ClickHandler(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { // Do something here } The other, potentially more elegant, option would be to bind the Button's Command to an ICommand. You could also set it's CommandParameter in order to pass additional, button specific, information.
