The most painless way would be to use cookies to track a re-visit, and possibly validate the User-Agent. It's fairly easy to fake headers though, so it's not the most secure approach. Alternatively, have a validation page - e.g. the link you share goes to a page requesting either an email address or phone number, then you email or SMS the real link to the new user. This way, you can filter out duplicates fairly easily, at the cost of privacy issues. There are lots of SMS gateway providers out there, and message costs are fairly low, although you need a paid app for this approach to make sense. Hope this helps, Phil Lello
