How can I override an HTML "rules" attribute using CSS?

The DITA Open Toolkit automatically inflicts some inline table attributes when one publishes to HTML, including frame="border" and rules="all". I need to override this "rules" attribute using CSS styles for cells, and while I can get the desired result in IE and Chrome, Firefox puts solid black gridlines in the table and refuses to budge on the matter. Obviously I can't edit the HTML, company policy is to not edit the XSLT, so how can I remove these gridlines using CSS alone? I've tried various cunning combinations of border-xxxxxx styles and given them !important declarations to no effect. The HTML says... Type Comment Caution Think twice. Attention Be careful. Danger Be scared. Be very scared. The CSS says table {border: 1px solid black; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 9pt; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 4px;} tr {border: none;} .cellrowborder {border: none;} So while it looks as I'd expect in IE, it doesn't in Firefox UNLESS I remove those frame/border/rules attributes in the HTML. Which I can't in production.
