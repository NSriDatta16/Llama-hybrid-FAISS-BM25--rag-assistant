I think the simplest way to do this is not to use forms at all. You can run Fiddler during a normal request and you will see your POST request occur. You can then replay and modify that request using Fiddler's 'Request Builder' (drag the actual request onto the 'Request Builder' tab and it will clone the request.) This allows you to create whatever bad inputs you wish without worrying about generating new forms to handle this.
