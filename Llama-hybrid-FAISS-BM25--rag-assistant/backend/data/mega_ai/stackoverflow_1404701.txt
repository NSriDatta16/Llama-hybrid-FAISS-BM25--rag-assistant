The pragma stuff has been explained already. "using namespace std" means that the compiler searches certain standard functions in the run time library (cout e.g. would actually be std::cout). The background is that you can group symbols in namespaces which are then a prefix of the symbol. This allows you to use identical symbols (e.g. function names) by putting them in different name spaces. The "using namespace" directive means to automatically prefix symbols with the namespace specified. Now if you have your own cout function from a namespace "mystuff" you can distinguish it from the standard one by writing "mystuff::cout". The SDL call initializes the video and audio subsystems (e.g. looks whether there are video and audio devices available and whether they support all features SDL needs). "atexit (SDL_Quit)" means that the function "SDL_Quit" will automatically be called when your program terminates. system ("pause") halts your program and waits for a keypress.
