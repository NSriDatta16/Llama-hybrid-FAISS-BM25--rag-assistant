macro to copy and transpose every seventh row and past in new sheet

I have surveys being done for my agents the system gives me a report in XML format. When I get the same changed to Excel I get the surveys in the below mentioned format Survey number Agent Name Rating 1 Rating 2 Rating 3 Rating 4 Rating 5 Comments With this format I have around 700 surveys every day and I need to get the same transposed to the below mentioned format Survey number/Agent Name/Rating 1/Rating 2/Rating 3/Rating 4/Rating 5/Comments The problem is the macro goes on and on and the file becomes heavy. Can anyone help as to how a macro could detect the next survey and automatically copy the data from one sheet and then transpose the same on the next sheet so as to fall right below the earlier line. I do not have much of knowledge in VB.
