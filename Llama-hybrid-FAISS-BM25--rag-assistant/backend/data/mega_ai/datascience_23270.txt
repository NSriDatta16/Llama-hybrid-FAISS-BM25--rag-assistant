The answer is yes. If Test & Score is given only one data set, then all it can do is show results of cross-validation. To test the models on a separate data set, use separate File widgets to load training and test data. Connect File widget with training data to Test & Score, and the connect File widget with Test data to Test & Score. The connect whatever learner to test (in the workflow on the figure I've used logistic regression and random forest). Make sure "Test on train data" is selected in the Test & Score.
