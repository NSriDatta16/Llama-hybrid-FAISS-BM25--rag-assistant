The answer by Vas is correct. Credible intervals are the most Bayesian way. However I understand there is sometimes a need to present a simple index of uncertainty. My first thought is to estimate the fisher information / Hessian (making a variational approximation). The square root of the diagonals of this should give a 'standard error'-like quantity, in the same units as the parameter of interest. For posterior $q(\theta)$ , $$ H_{ij} =\left[ \frac{\partial^2 \ \mathrm{log}(q)}{\partial\theta_{ij}} \right] $$ $$ std. err. \approx \sqrt{H_{ii}} $$ Most optimisation tools give Hessian e.g. fmincon . Note the caveats with this approach - assumes unimodal, gaussian densities. And isn't Bayesian. The benefits - works with multivariate posteriors, and you can see axes of correlations between parameters as eigenvectors of $H$ .
