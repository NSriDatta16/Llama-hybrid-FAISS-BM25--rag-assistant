Detect collision between transparent UIImageviews

I am searching for a pixel collision with two UIImageview with transparency. The check should be done after an UIView was dragged and it should detect if the UIView overlaps another UIImageview. With CGRectIntersectsRect only the frames are compared. Maybe there is a solution of create a new UIImageview from the overlapped area and check if there is only transparency in it? Maybe someone has another hint or solution?
