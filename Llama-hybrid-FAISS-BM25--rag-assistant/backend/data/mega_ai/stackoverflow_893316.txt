Perform sum, average, and multiplication across all columns in a table?

I have a table that looks like this: id test1 test2 test3 test4 ... test200 1 90 87 85 86 70 2 100 95 83 92 80 . . 18000 I know there are standard operations to perform sums and averages on a single column and multiply the value of two columns together but is it possible to do it across all columns in a row with a given id? If its not clear, I want to do something like this across rows instead of across columns. Thanks
