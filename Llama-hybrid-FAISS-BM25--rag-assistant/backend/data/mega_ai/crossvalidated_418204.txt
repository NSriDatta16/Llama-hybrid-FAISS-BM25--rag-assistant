Can variational autoencoder be used to generate similar images?

I trained the variational autoencoder . Suppose if we take the mnist dataset and visualize it, the distribution of classes are clustered but are very close to each other. When i take a point/encoding vector(ex: label 1) from a class and do the nearest neighbor, i get other labels(ex : 7,0,3,6,9) as nearest neighbors.
