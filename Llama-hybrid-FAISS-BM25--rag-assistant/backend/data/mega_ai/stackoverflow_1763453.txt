I believe you could fix this by only applying the sortable to the root element, rather than all of them in the tree. This works in all browsers I have tested, but unfortunately leads to a slightly less smooth experience as the position at which the item will be inserted after dragging "jumps around" quite a bit. Essentially this would look like this: 1 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.3.1 2.3.2 $("#sortableNestedList").sortable({ ... });
