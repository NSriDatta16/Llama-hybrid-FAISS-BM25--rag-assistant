According to Dive into HTML5 : When an Opera user tries to submit a form with an field, Opera automatically offers RFC-compliant email validation, even if scripting is disabled. Opera also offers validation of web addresses entered into fields, and numbers in fields. The validation of numbers even takes into account the min and max attributes, so Opera will not let you submit the form if you enter a number that is too large. (The quoted paragraph is about the last in the article.) So far as I'm aware -and bearing in mind I've not tested with Opera 10, I'm taking their word for it- no other browser yet validates forms automatically.
