It can be troublesome to mix user settings and user data in the same storage location. This approach will basically double the number of times the database structure has to change. If there is a bug in the settings code, there is a chance to corrupt/lose user data which is much more serious than corrupting/losing a user setting. If the user wants to move or back up their data, the settings are also carried with it. I would advise against keeping the settings in the database.
