I allow myself to be guided by OWASP here: They are unacceptable for the following reasons: Collection of information about people without their explicit consent (such as "Mother's maiden name") is illegal in most privacy regimes. Such collection is subject to privacy laws, review and correction by the subject, and so on. IT Security Policies and standards such as ISO 27000 prohibit the clear text storage of passwords, but almost all Q&A schemes store both the question and answer in the clear The information in the answers is public for a goodly portion of the users of the Internet, and thus is found using public sources Edit (2018): OWASP seems to have re-arranged their materials. The wayback machine captured a copy of the original page .
