I have done some previous work classifying vehicles (heavy or light) based on their driving behaviors. This required calculating speed and accelerations, which you can easily do by using numerical formulas such as the five-point stencil. You already know that points are separated by 0.25 seconds and the distances can be calculated using the haversine formula. More features can be derived such as the driving range, maximum and average speeds, number of left and right turns, hard breaks and sharp accelerations. Try plotting the polylines on Google Earth (or a similar mapping tool) to see if there is a distinctive geographical pattern (are they far apart from each other, or all in the same region?). If patterns are visible, a clustering algorithm may help.
