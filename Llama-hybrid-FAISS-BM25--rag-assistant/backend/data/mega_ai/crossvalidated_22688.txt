Jbowman's answer is correct but to add to the "real life" dimension he or she adverts to: You really should think about "real life" here because the basic answer to your question is: "Impossible to say; it depends on what you are modeling." The answer to the main question -- can there be a "significant" interaction between two "nonsignificant" predictors -- is "of course." Imagine, e.g., a disease that is equally likely to be terminal for members of two subpopulations & that can be effectively treated with an intervention in only 1. Membership in the groups will not predict death from the disease; and the main effect of the treatment -- which will be a (sample-size weighted) average of the effect on the two groups might well be nonsignificant too if the sample size of the treatment-responsive population or the effect size of the intervention is small. But add a cross-product interaction term -- & voila, you see that the effect of treatment is "significant" for the treatment-responsive group. Maybe you can see from this example that your questions about the relative "likelihood" & "theoretical possibility" etc. of signficant interactions conditional on the predictor & moderator being significant can't be answered in a meaningful way. Everything depends on how the predictor & moderator are related to the outcome being modeled. For a phenomenon in which it is not meaningful or plausible to envision the two variables interacting, there's no point asking about how "likely" or "theoretically possible," whether or not the predictor and moderator are significant or nonsignificant (likely the interaction will be nonsignificant in that case, but if it turns out otherwise, it's likely a coincidence or a reflection of "significant" but meaningless relations between variables when you have large sample, etc.) If such a relationship is plausible, then by definition a "significant" interaction is "theoretically possible" & whether one would expect the predictor and moderator to be significant or nonsignificant on their own in that situation necessarily depends on what you are modeling. (Because the universe of things you might investigate is infinite, there's no way to say what's more likely -- both variables, one, or neither "significant" ) Statistics won't help anyone who doesn't known what & why he or she is using them to understand a particular phenomenon.
