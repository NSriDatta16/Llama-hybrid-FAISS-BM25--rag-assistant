Can CSS choose a different default font and size depending on Language

I have the following CSS fragment: INPUT{ font-family: Raavi; font-size: 14px;} Which works fine when the textbox contains some Punjabi script like this: ਪੰਜਾਬੀ But the user might enter English instead, and I would rather use the Verdana font with a different size, since the English letters in the Raavi font are real funky and the size is wrong. So my question could be stated as: Is there any type of conditional font-family and size selection within CSS based on the input Is there anyway for CSS to know about the input language? So I could create the following PSEUDO_CSS: INPUT{ EN-font-family: Verdana; EN-font-size: 12px; PA-font-family; Raavi; EN-font-size: 14px;} or INPUT.EN{ font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;} INPUT.PA{ font-family: Raavi; font-size: 14px;}
