If I understand your second option correctly, you'd wind up with 300 * 200 datapoints. This probably didn't work because of the fact that the errors for a given participant's measurements will almost surely be correlated. I think you have realized this already, since you mention that you want to "predict variation within participant". This sounds exactly like a mixed model (aka mixed effects model or random effects model). This resource is longer than the wiki page, but I find it a little less obtuse. Although the programming example is in SPSS, you should find lots of mixed model packages in R. I'm not sure how popular neural or tree-based mixed models are, though - according to this post , they at least exist. An alternative: you could predict the entire 200-length vector of attention variables for each participant, given the participant's 30 questionnaire answers and 200 reaction times. This gives you only 300 datapoints, but at least they're all independent of one another.
