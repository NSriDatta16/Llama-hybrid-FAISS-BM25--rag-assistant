Disable Text Selection in Chrome

I am building a touchscreen kiosk that will use Google Chrome to display the content. There is no keyboard except for a virtual keyboard that will pop up for entering name info on certain screens. Nowhere on the kiosk will a user need to select anything. When I place my finger anywhere on the screen and drag it around, the blue selection fields start appearing. I have got to do away with that. Initially I was using Opera, which has a config feature for disabling text selection. I couldn't find the equivalent for this in Chrome. Anyone know if there IS a config for this in Chrome, or alternatively what Javascript will accomplish this?
