for loop chcek previous ID and skip iteration if needed

I have this code, " id=" "> Basically what this does is spit of some options for a select menu, however sometimes the select options get duplicated, is there a way so I only ever spit out 1 instance of each value? Using what I already have in the for loop? Some like check the $info['grade_id'] does not match the previous one and if it does skip that iteration? This is what the information array looks like, array(4) { [0]=> array(20) { ["career_id"]=> string(2) "22" ["career_name"]=> string(7) "Builder" ["career_desc"]=> string(293) "Depending on the area of building that you would like to go into will depend on the aspects you will cover.

However there is only one record in the database, can I just strip any repeated data of the array?
