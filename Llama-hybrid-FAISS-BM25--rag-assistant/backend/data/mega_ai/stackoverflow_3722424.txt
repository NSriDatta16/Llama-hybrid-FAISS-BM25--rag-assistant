Store a large PHP array, plain php, or gzipped serialized data?

I have a static large array-of-arrays, witch represents tree structure with about ~100k nodes, this array is only read-only reference for value lockups. Now, witch of this methods will perform better? First, simply array definition in pure PHP file, for including in requests Second, serialize this array, gzip serialized output, and load gzipped file and unserialize for every request Or convert array to SQLite or somethin' similar, but storage must be capable of fast lockup of long "ID path" ie. 1->5556->123->45->455->Node_name (With actually PHP table doing very good) Memory limit on server is not a problem
