Depends on what you mean by security. Authorization is basically the same, if not easier. Forms Authentication is supported and encouraged and you need only stick an [Authorize] attribute on controllers or controller actions. Not too much to learn there. ViewState is gone, so you don't need to worry about ViewState validation or any of that kludge. If you're referring to XSS, I would say that it's about the same; you need to escape your data on the output and it's very easy to do: The only thing I can think of that you might find a bit different is handling CSRF/XSRF. Fortunately, most of this is already built in to the framework . So on the whole I'd say no, the learning curve for security in ASP.NET MVC should not be nearly as steep as the learning curve for the architecture itself.
