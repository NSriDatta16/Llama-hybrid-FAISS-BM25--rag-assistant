Generating Qt Q_OBJECT classes pragmatically

How might one go about making a Q_OBJECT based class (one that has signals and/or slots) through metaprogramming? I don't care if it's templates or preprocessor, neither appears to work and I really need it too. What I want is to be able to bind arbitrary function like things to Qt signals. Qt signals are incapable of this, boost signals are. So, I need a Qt object that can connect to a Qt signal and simply forward it on to a boost signal. I'll need to do this a bunch, so it would be nice to automate. The main problem appears to be--no big surprise--the moc processor. It doesn't understand basic preprocessing (except ifs) and apparently can't do template classes either. Any ideas?
