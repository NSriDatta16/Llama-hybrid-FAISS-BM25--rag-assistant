Nesting scrollviews will always lead to touch-responder issues. I'm assuming that the inner is the primary one—the one users interact with more? In general, you're probably going to have to write some of your own touch responders (at least, that has been my experience, both in code and around SO). Make the vertical scrolling more forgiving, but only detect a narrow range of swipes and drags (near-horizontal lines) for the outer. That way, most of the touch inputs will be sent to the inner view. As far as the bouncing goes, remove one of the places where you set the property and see what happens. Which method is this in? Hopefully this code is residing in a UIView subclass…?
