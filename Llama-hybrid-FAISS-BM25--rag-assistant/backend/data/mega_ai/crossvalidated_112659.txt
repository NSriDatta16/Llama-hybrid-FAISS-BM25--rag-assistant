Can ayone help me in solving the below Problems of probability distribution?

Patients arrive randomly and independently at a doctor's surgery from 8·0 A.M. at an average rate of one in Five minutes.The waiting room holds 2 persons. What is the probability that the room will be full when the doctor arrives at 9·0 A.M.? Answer is 53.84% I have tried Poisson distribution with parameter as 12/Hour? and i am getting like 99% as answers.
