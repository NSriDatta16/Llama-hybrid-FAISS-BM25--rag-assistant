If you change the URL fragment (the part after the # ) on each page change, the URL in the address bar can always be bookmarked. If you do this with a frame (probably the easiest way), every page load would update the URL fragment of the parent document. If an incoming link has this fragment set you open the frame not with the homepage, but with the requested content page.
