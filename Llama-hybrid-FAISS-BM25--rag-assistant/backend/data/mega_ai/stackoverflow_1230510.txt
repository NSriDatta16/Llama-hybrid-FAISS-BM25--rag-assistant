Drag and Drop simulation?

I have a proprietary application with the only way to pass data externally - drag and drop from other application (like dragging a file from Windows explorer). My question is, is it possible to simulate drag'n'drop from external applicaiton? Pure win32 solution preferred, dependencies like MFC and WTL could be included too. Help!
