GAN is basically a generative network. How can it have inference ? Will the inference and training be same thing for GAN ? Well, GANs are essentially two neural networks in series. One is called the Generator and the other is called the Discriminator . You need to train these two networks sequentially, i.e. you train the Generator and then you train the Discriminator (not at the same time). The inference of a GAN is performed by the Discriminator network, which labels the output of the Generator. I found this post very helpful, I hope you find it too! Can it (GAN) be run on embedded devices , where memory is really an issue? Well, if your embedded resources can afford two neural networks running at the same time, then it should be ok.
