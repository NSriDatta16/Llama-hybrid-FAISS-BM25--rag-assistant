This is a tricky one. In v2 of the API, you can do: map.fromLatLngToContainerPixel(marker.getLatLng(), zoomLevel); In v3, the method fromLatLngToContainerPixel has been moved to the MapCanvasProjection object. To get a MapCanvasProjection object, you need to call getProjection on an OverlayView object. It looks like the Marker class is extended from OverlayView, but unfortunately it doesn't have the getProjection method. I have no idea why - may be worth filing a bug. The way I've done it is by creating my own custom marker class, based on OverlayView, so it still has the getProjection method: var point = this.getProjection().fromLatLngToDivPixel(this.latlng_); You can read Google's tutorial on custom overlays or copy their example to get you started.
