For a website, is it true the MVC pattern is only used on the server side?

I'm diving into the field of web development after ten years of desktop application development. I'm learning as fast as I can the high level concepts, one of them being MVC. I've noticed things like javascript, css, and html don't fall into the M, V, or the C. I haven't explicitly read it anywhere, but am I right to understand that the MVC pattern is only used to organize code and data on the server side of a website? I apologize if this is a weird question, remember I'm a noob! :) Thanks in advance for all your help!
