Cakephp Facebook Connect using Nick Baker's plugin : Error=> FB Dosen't exist

I am working on Nick Baker's CakePHP Facebook plugin. I am doing exactly as he has described in his screencast http://tv.cakephp.org/video/webtechnick/2011/01/12/nick_baker_--_facebook_integration_with_cakephp But when I am trying to get the currently logged in user $this->Connect->user() using the Facebook.Connect component, i do not get any return value..... When I debug the current session, ( debug($this->Session); ), i get the following : app/app_controller.php (line 10) SessionComponent Object ( [__active] => 1 [__bare] => 0 [valid] => [error] => Array ( [2] => FB doesn't exist ) [_userAgent] => 36267ef3c9f36ab07ac8e68d1deb03aa [path] => /sharefaredev [lastError] => 2 [security] => medium [time] => 1301436341 [sessionTime] => 1301448341 [cookieLifeTime] => 720000 [watchKeys] => Array ( ) [id] => [host] => localhost [timeout] => [enabled] => 1 ) Where does the error come from? I'm not able to make that out. Please help! Thanks in Advance :)
