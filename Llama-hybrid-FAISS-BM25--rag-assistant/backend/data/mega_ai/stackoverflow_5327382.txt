Your OneToOne Relation ship is managed by the A-side not by the Foo-side. So you need to change relationship on the A-side (because hibernate payes ony attention to the side where the relationship is managed) A old = loadedFooInstance.getA(); oldA.setFoo(null); C c = new C(); c.setFoo(loadedFooInstance); /*and it is good practic to update foo too*/ loadedFooInstance.setA(c); The other way is to change the side which manage the relationship: public abstract class A{ ... @OneToOne(mappedBy = "a") private Foo foo; ... } public class Foo{ ... @OneToOne @JoinColumn(name = "a_id", nullable = false) private A a ... } But this would change your database layout too!
