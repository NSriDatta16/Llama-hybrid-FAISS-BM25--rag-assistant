The model computed by SVMLight, is in the dual, i.e., it has to store all support vectors and their weights. The SVM-Perf works in primal and not dual. That's why only linear kernel is allowed. Thus, it saves a single $w$ as computed by the answer of Marc. You see so few documents as Support Vectors because the concepts you try to separate are well defined. For example, I have seen that it takes fewer "football" articles to learn the small concept of "football", than e.g. articles of "politics" to learn the fuzzy concept of "politics". Another reason could be that the size of your documents is a quite large, i.e. you have a dense space.
