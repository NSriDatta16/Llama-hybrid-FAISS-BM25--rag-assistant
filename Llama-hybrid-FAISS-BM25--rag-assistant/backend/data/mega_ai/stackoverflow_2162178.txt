If the R side of your skills is pretty good, then you'll definitely want to start reading Edward Tufte 's books, particularly The Visual Display of Quantitative Information and Beautiful Evidence , both of which provide excellent insights into how to present data effectively and efficiently. You should be somewhat forewarned that everyone has a different idea of "beautiful," however. Tufte is a big believer in maximizing a quantity he calls the "data-ink ratio": how much of the page's ink is dedicated to data instead of what he calls "chartjunk". This causes his work to have a sleek, minimalist oeuvre that certainly makes it easier to digest everything but that some people may find too utilitarian. But for Tufte, function and form are pretty close to one thing: the more it helps you, the more beautiful and elegant it is.
