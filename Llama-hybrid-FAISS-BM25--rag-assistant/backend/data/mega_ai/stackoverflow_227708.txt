Reacting to click on ListItems in CheckboxList

I would like to apply some logic to a page containing a CheckBoxList control when the user checks or unchecks individual checkbox items. Say, for instance to dynamically show or hide a related control. I came up with a way using ASP.Net 2.0 callback mechanism (AJAX) with a combination of client-side Javascript and server-side logic in the code-behind. However, this solution is not very bullet-proof (i.e. most likely suffers from timing issues). It is not portable, because the code needs to know the sequential ids of individual items, etc. The code I came up with is separated in two functions, one handling the onclick event, and the other processing the returned callback string : function OnCheckBoxClicked() { // gathers the semi-colon separated list of labels, // associated with the currently checked items var texts = ''; // iterate over each individual checkbox item // items in a checkboxlist are sequential, so // stop iteration at the first missing sequence number for (var index = 0; index In this example, my checkboxes match categories of a blog post. I need to process the resulting callback string as containing a list of semicolon-separated names of checkboxes to check/uncheck, in order to make sure that related parent/child categories are synchronized correctly. This string results from logic executed on the server. In other cases, the resulting callback string might be something else. function UpdateCheckBoxes(returnmessage, context) { if (returnmessage == null || returnmessage == '') return ; // iterate over each individual checkbox item // items in a checkboxlist are sequential, so // stop iteration at the first missing sequence number for (var index = 0; index 0) { // do something } } } Isn't there a more elegant solution to this problem?
