How to down-weight older data in time series regression

In a regression fit of vectors varying with time $t$ $\qquad y \sim [x_t\ x_{t-1}\ x_{t-2}\ ...] \cdot [c_t\ c_{t-1}\ c_{t-2} \ ...] $ , how can one down-weight the older $x_t$ to model "older is less relevant" (than the regression gives) ? Say that rows in data matrix $X$ are observables (stocks, market segments ...) and columns are times. Correct me, Weighted least squares weights rows; how does one weight columns, times ? Added: Down-weighting older data in time series looks complex, much more so than linear least squares with i.i.d. errors in rows (observations) -- just divide through by $\sigma_i$; or classification with i.i.d. errors in columns (e.g. features) -- just centre each column. Can anyone say either yes, I downweight time series; here are some examples on the web no: down-weighting time series is complex, not for novices. ( http://AndrewGelman.com/2005/06/21/timeseries_regr discussed this question 10 years ago, mentioning Kalman filters and hierarchical Bayes, but with no examples.)
