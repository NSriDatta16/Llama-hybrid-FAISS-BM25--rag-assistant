Conflict between jQuery, Prototype, and plugins

I am trying to deconflict Prototype and jQuery in a rails app. I discovered that jQuery broke Prototype a good way into the app. I started the process by adding $jq = jQuery.noConflict(); to the application.js file. I then began going through all the .erb and .js files in the project, looking for jQuery calls to $ and replacing them with $jq . Then I got to some of the jQuery plugin files. Do I have to convert all $ references to $jq in the jQuery plugin .js files?
