Variance of classification accuracy?

I am using binary classification and at the moment mainly 10-fold crossvalidation. However the result of the crossvalidation is very variable - hence what I was doing recently was to run the 10-fold crossvalidation itself repeatedly, and then average over these classification accuracies (I know that the accuracy of each crossvalidation is already an average of the accuracies for the 10 different test folds). Is this a sensible/common thing to do - and does it make sense to also calculate the variance of these iterations?
