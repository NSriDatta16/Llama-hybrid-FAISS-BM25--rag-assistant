Estimate variables which sum to zero?

Assume we have $y_i$ such that $\sum y_i=0$ . Assume we have estimation machinery (some machine learning) which can estimate each $y_i$ . So we can forget constraint and eastimate each of them, or we can estimate (n-1) of them and assign one of them as minus sum of estimates, or plenty other ways. So the question is: What is the best way to choose for estimation of $y_i$ taking into account constraint $\sum_i y_i = 0$ ? I guess it should be standard question, but cannot google it.
