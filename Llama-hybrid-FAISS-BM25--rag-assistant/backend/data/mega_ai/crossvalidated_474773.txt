See section 12.9 of Hyndman and Athanasopoulos's textbook. https://otexts.com/fpp2/missing-outliers.html Often in a time series you need to handle outliers -- e.g. if you are predicting airline passengers you will have big outliers around Sept 11, 2001 and currently due to COVID-19. These are special events that have to be handled or they will throw everything off. So, yes, you need to handle these before the decomposition. Data errors, or likely data errors, have to go. Otherwise be careful. Be particularly careful in just applying some global filter (e.g. everything outside 3 standard deviations). You may be just suppressing the naturally high variability of the data.
