Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and discrete parameter spaces

I've just started building models in stan ; to build familiarity with the tool, I'm working through some of the exercises in Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd ed.). The Waterbuck exercise supposes that the data $n \sim \text{binomial}(N, \theta)$, with $(N, \theta)$ unknown. Since Hamiltonian Monte Carlo doesn't permit discrete parameters, I've declared $N$ as a real $\in [72, \infty)$ and coded a real-valued binomial distribution using the lbeta function. A histogram of the results looks virtually identical to what I found by computing the posterior density directly. However, I'm concerned that there may be some subtle reasons that I should not trust these results in general; since the real-valued inference on $N$ assigns positive probability to non-integer values, we know that these values are impossible, as fractional waterbuck don't exist in reality. On the other hand, the results appear to be fine, so the simplification would appear to have no effect on inference in this case. Are there any guiding principles or rules of thumb for modeling in this way, or is this method of "promoting" a discrete parameter to a real bad practice?
