Object databases have a very nice niche for problems like representing geometry e.g. CAD systems, where object graphs can be very deep indeed. JOIN performance degrades rapidly for around 7 tables in most relational systems, so deeply self-referential structures in CAD perform better in object databases. But important applications like financial data lend themselves to a relational representation. The relational model has a firm mathematical basis, and SQL is a successful and popular language. There is little incentive for financial institutions like banks, brokerages, and insurance companies to switch away from RDBMS.
