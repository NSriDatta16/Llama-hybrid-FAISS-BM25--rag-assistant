Defining the set $$ \text{Bogus Data} = \left\{ x:\int f(x\mid \theta)\,\pi(\theta)\,d\theta = \infty \right\} \, , $$ we have $$ \mathrm{Pr}\left(X\in\text{Bogus Data}\right) = \int_\text{Bogus Data} \int f(x\mid \theta)\,\pi(\theta)\,d\theta\,dx = \int_\text{Bogus Data} \infty\,dx \, . $$ The last integral will be equal to $\infty$ if the Lebesgue measure of $\text{Bogus Data}$ is positive. But this is impossible, because this integral gives you a probability (a real number between $0$ and $1$). Hence, it follows that the Lebesgue measure of $\text{Bogus Data}$ is equal to $0$, and, of course, it also follows that $\mathrm{Pr}\left(X\in\text{Bogus Data}\right)=0$. In words: the prior predictive probability of those sample values that make the posterior improper is equal to zero. Moral of the story: beware of null sets, they may bite, however improbable it may be. P.S. As pointed out by Prof. Robert in the comments, this reasoning blows up if the prior is improper.
