Is it possible to send just a token via the MVVM Light Messenger?

I've been refactoring some code that was originally using the Messenger in MVVM Foundation to now use the Messenger in MVVM Light Toolit. One thing that I can't seem to find an equivalent for is the case where all you want to do is send a Token (i.e, the Token is acting as both a unique identifier for the message and the message itself). Original Code (MVVM Foundation) - one string does it all // send code mvvmFoundationMessenger.NotifyColleagues("QuestionTimedOut"); // register code mvvmFoundationMessenger.Register( "QuestionTimedOut", () => UpdateOnQuestionTimedOut()); New Code (MVVM Light) - is there a more elegant solution than this? // send code mvvmLightMessenger.Send("QuestionTimedOut", "QuestionTimedOut"); // register code mvvmLightMessenger.Register ( this, "QuestionTimedOut", token => UpdateOnQuestionTimedOut()); I realize I could explicitly new up a NotificationMessage but that would add even more code.
