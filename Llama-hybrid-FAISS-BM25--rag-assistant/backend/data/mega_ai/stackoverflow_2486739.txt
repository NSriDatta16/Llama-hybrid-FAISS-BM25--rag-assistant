My first reaction is that in JBoss it's not possible to override the log4j configuration like that. JBoss isn't allowing log4j to locate its own configuration, as it normally would, the location of conf/jboss-log4j.xml is specified in conf/jboss-service.xml . To my knowledge, all log4j configuration in a given JBoss server must be centralised in to a single file, usually conf/jboss-log4j.xml . Have you tried, as a test, moving the contents of your log4j.properties into the existing conf/jboss-log4j.xml file? If that works fine, then the problem is almost certainly caused by your attempt to override log4j. Having said that, I'd be surprised if jboss/log4j is that fragile, but perhaps in certain cases, it rejects this.
