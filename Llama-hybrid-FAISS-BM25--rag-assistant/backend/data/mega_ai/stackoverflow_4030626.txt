(March 2012): As mentioned in Mike Morearty 's answer (which I upvoted), git 1.7.10+ will support this feature. Original answer (October 2010): Currently, no. As I mentioned in Is it possible to include a file in your .gitconfig , you already have 3 separate gitconfig for you to get your settings organized: $GIT_DIR/config Repository specific configuration file. (The filename is of course relative to the repository root, not the working directory.) ~/.gitconfig User-specific configuration file. Also called "global" configuration file. $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig System-wide configuration file Config File inclusion was discussed in May 2010, and a first patch was written by Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason, but I don't see this patch in one of the latest " what's cooking in Git ".
