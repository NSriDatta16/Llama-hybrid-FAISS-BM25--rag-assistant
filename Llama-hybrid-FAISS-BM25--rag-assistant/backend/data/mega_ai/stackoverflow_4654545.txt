You need profiler to measure code execution (see What Are Some Good .NET Profilers? to start your search). Looking at your comments it is unclear what you trying to optimize. Generally you need to go down to measure CPU clock cycles when your code is executed 1000s of times and purely CPU bound, in other cases per-function execution time is usually enough. But you are saying that your code is too slow to run that many times to calculate average time with stopwatch. You also need to figure out if CPU is the bottleneck for your application or there is somthing else that makes it slow. Looking at CPU % in TaskManager can give you information on it - less then 100% CPU usage pretty much guarantees that there is something else (i.e. network or disk activity) makes program slow. Basically providing more detail on type of code you trying to measure to meet your performance goals will make helping you much easier.
