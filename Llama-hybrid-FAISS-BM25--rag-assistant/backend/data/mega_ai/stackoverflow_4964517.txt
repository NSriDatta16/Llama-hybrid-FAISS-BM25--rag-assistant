Lambda expression are used (among other things) as a shorthand to specifying anonymous functions (also called anonymous delegates or anonymous methods). That is, pointers to function that you define on-the-fly. See this common JQuery Ajax example: $.ajax({ url: "test.html", context: document.body, success: function(){ $(this).addClass("done"); } }); The success parameter uses Javascript's on-the-fly function definition and pointer. So yes, there is a kindof lambda syntax for anonymous function in javascript . In fact, this is very similar to VB.NET's lambda syntax , used very powerfully for both expression trees and anonymous functions: Dim newNinjaList = NinjaList.Where(Function(n) n.primaryWeapon = "dagger") So, you could say there's a lambda syntax in JQuery, though many would consider it inelegant. If you mean lambda expressions to specify expression trees , then the answer is simple: no, JQuery does not use any kind of lambda syntax for expression trees .
