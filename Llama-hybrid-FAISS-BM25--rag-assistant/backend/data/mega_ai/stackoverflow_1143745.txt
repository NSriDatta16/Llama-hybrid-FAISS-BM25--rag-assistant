Did you really take a good look at Altova's StyleVision ? This is a simple drag&drop application which allows you to read an XML file or schema and then drop it on a form. This form could then be translated to an XSLT that generates the HTML page you want. Of course, you've mentioned Altova so you've seen this product. Right? So you need something better than this? Haven't found it, so I'm interested too. :-) (Yes, StyleVision seems to do everything you've asked for. What's wrong with it?)
