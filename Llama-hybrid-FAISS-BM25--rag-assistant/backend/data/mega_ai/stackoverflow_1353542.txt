As others have suggested, you can use hashing to generate an integer that will be unique with high probability. However, if you need the integer to always be unique, you should rank the permutations, i.e. assign an order to them. For example, a common order of permutations for set {1,2,3} is the lexicographical order: 1,2,3 1,3,2 2,1,3 2,3,1 3,1,2 3,2,1 In this case, the id of a permutation is its index in the lexicographical order. There are other methods of ranking permutations, of course. Making ids a range of continuous integers makes it possible to implement the storage of processed permutations as a bit field or a boolean array.
