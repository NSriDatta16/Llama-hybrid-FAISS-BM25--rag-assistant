How to wrap a group of words with tags, JavaScript Replace Regular Expressions

I am trying to wrap some words with HTML tags, for that I am using regular expressions. I am almost there: This is my regexp /((apple|banana|cherry|orange)\b\s?)+/gi and this is my replacement: $& which works perfectly for my example text: Apple Banana apple cherry, Cherry orange and Oranges Apple, Banana the result being: Apple Banana apple cherry , Cherry orange and Oranges Apple , Banana I could be pragmatic and live with this but I would reaaaaaally like to have it perfect and not include the space after the final match. i.e. my perfect result would be (see the tag shifted left after "Cherry orange"): Apple Banana apple cherry , Cherry orange and Oranges Apple , Banana
