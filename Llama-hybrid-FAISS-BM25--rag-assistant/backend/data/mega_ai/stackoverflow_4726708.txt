I'll try to answer as best I can here: What you're asking about is variable variable names - this isn't in Python. (I think it's in VB.Net but don't hold me to that) The user gets a terminal menu which allows him to create a new user and assign a name, salary, position. How would you instantiate that object and later call it if you want to manage it, call functions, etc.? What's the design pattern here? This is how I'd add a new person (Mickey-mouse example): # Looping until we get a "fin" message while True: print "Enter name, or "fin" to finish:" new_name = raw_input() if new_name == "fin": break print "Enter salary:" new_salary = raw_input() print "Enter position:" new_pos = raw_input() # Dummy database - the insert method would post this customer to the database cnn = db.connect() insert(cnn, new_name, new_salary, new_pos) cnn.commit() cnn.close() Ok, so you want to now get a person from the database. while True: print "Enter name of employee, or "fin" to finish:" emp_name = raw_input() if emp_name == "fin": break # Like above, the "select_employee" would retreive someone from a database cnn = db.connect() person = select_employee(cnn, emp_name) cnn.close() # Person is now a variable, holding the person you specified: print(person.name) print(person.salary) print(person.position) # It's up to you from here what you want to do This is just a basic, rough example, but I think you get what I mean. Also, as you can see, I didn't use a class here. A class for something like this would pretty much always be a better idea, but this was just to demonstrate how you'd change and use a variable during runtime.
