Many people have asked for a ForEach method - and indeed it is handy (which is why we've got one in MoreLINQ ). It's also potentially dangerous. Most of LINQ firmly discourages side-effects. They're possible, but discouraged. That's why OrderBy etc return new collections rather than sorting existing ones. Now consider ForEach - it's an "action" rather than a function, in that it doesn't return anything. If it doesn't have any side-effects, it's absolutely pointless! So, it goes against part of the philosophy of LINQ - it's basically not approaching things in a functional style. I'm not trying to make a case for or against, really - in practice, I think a useful thing to have, and I'm not surprised that it's in so many libraries etc. It's a very obvious pseudo-operator to add. Just think about what you're doing, and notice the fact that you're introducing side-effects. It's sort of a border between the functional style of LINQ and a more imperative style of coding.
