Decide on a known set of reference hardware, run some sort of repeatable reference benchmark against this, and get a good known value to compare to. Then you can run this benchmark against other systems to figure out how to scale the values you get from your target benchmark runs. The closer your reference benchmark is to your actual application, the more accurate the results of your scaling will be. You could have a single deterministic run (single code path, maybe average of multiple executions) of your application used as your reference benchmark.
