Best heuristic for malloc

Consider using malloc() to allocate x bytes of memory in a fragmented heap. Assume the heap has multiple contiguous locations of size greater than x bytes. Which is the best (that leads to least heap wastage) heuristic to choose a location among the following? Select smallest location that is bigger than x bytes. Select largest location that is bigger than x bytes. My intuition is smallest location that is bigger than x bytes. I am not sure which is the best in practice. No, this is not any assignment question. I was reading this How do malloc() and free() work? and this looks like a good follow up question to ask.
