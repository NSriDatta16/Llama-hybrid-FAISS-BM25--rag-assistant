However, I have been told that my approach might be incorrect because I should treat correct, incorrect and non-solved questions as interval variables. I do not understand this advice, you should ask for clarification. One way to interpret it is that the three categories correct/ incorrect, unsolved question can be ordered, but then, how? Maybe you could try multinomial logistic regression, or, use a chi-square test.
