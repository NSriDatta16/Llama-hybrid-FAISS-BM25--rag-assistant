Can I test a proportion (k success out of n) against an expected probability obtained from a logistic GLM?

I have a logistic regression model which is obtained from literature about the probability of developing a toxicity ($y_{i}=1$ or $0$) when patients are given dose $X_{i}$. $X_{i}$ is a continuous variable. The model can be written as: $Y_{i} \sim B(1,\pi_{i})$ $E(Y_{i})=\pi_{i}$ and $\operatorname{var}(Y_{i})=\pi_{i}(1-\pi_{i})$ $\operatorname{logit}(\pi_{i})=\alpha+\beta X_{i}$ and the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (and their confidence intervals) are known. Now I have a sample of patients (from a different population than the model population) with known $X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$. In general, I would like to test whether the new patient population behaves significantly different than model above. One method that I can think of is to compare the sample's proportion of toxicity against the expected probability of toxicity computed from the model. Suppose that the proportion of toxicity in the sample is $\hat{\pi}$. Given $X_{i}, i=1,...n$ in the sample, I can compute the expected probability of toxicity as $\frac{\sum\pi_{i}}{n}$. The null hypothesis is $H_0:\hat{\pi}=\frac{\sum\pi_{i}}{n}$ This equals a binomial test. My questions are: 1) Assuming the model (excluding the confidence interval) from the literature is the ground truth, is this a proper test? Do I need to assume that each $X_{i}$ in the population has equal probability? 2) Or I should test $\hat{\pi}$ against the expected probability of toxicity from the theoretical model population? Given equal probability of $X_{i}$, thus equal probability of $\pi_{i}$, $E(\pi_{i})=0.5$, which sounds like I am comparing the sample proportion against 0.5, no matter what the model is. 3) Are there any other methods of comparing the patient population to the given model, e.g. hypothesis based on $\beta$?
