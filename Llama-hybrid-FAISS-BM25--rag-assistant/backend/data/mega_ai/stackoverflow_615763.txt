I prefer to just use stored procs for dataset retrieval, and do any complex "work" on the application side. Because you are correct, trying to "debug" what's happening inside the guts of a many layered, cursor-looping, temp-table using, nested stored proc is very difficult. That said, MS KB 316549 describes how to use visual studio to debug stored procs. According to this article, there are a number of limitations to debugging in this fashion: You cannot "break" execution. You cannot "edit and continue." You cannot change the order of statement execution. Although you can change the value of variables, your changes may not take effect because the variable values are cached. Output from the SQL PRINT statement is not displayed. Edit : Obviously, if you are the person making this stored proc, then don't make it "many layered, cursor-looping, temp-table using, and nested". In my role as a DBA, though, that's pretty much what I encounter daily from the app developers.
