np-complete but not "hard"

Is there some language that is NP-complete but for which we know some "quick" algorithm? I don't mean like the ones for knapsack where we can do well on average, I mean that even in the worst case the runtime is something like 2^n^epsilon, where the result holds for any epsilon>0 and so we can allow it to get arbitrarily close to 0.
