This is a rare case where I would consider dichtomizing the data to 0 and 100 and then using logistic regression. Another possibility is to use Poisson or negative binomial regression on the count with an offset for what was the denominator. The choice, I think, depends on substantive issues: Do you want the actual abundance or the proportion?
