convolutional neural network vs Genetic algorithms which one has a better object recognition ratio

I have read good things about genetic algorithms and convolutional neural networks when it comes to object recognition. I would like to train a software to recognize any computer that has ever been on my computer network without looking at the mac address because it can change.Typical object recognition. What would be the best algorithm to use in this case. CNN or GA.
