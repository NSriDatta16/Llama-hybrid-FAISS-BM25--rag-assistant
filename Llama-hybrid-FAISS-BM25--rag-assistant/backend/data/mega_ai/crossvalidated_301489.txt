If you want to determine whether the probability distributions themselves differ, and not whether samples are drawn from the same distribution (which is what the two-sample KS test checks) then your best bet is with kernel mean embeddings. Essentially, you can use characteristic kernels and your samples to implicitly compare the two pdfs themselves (wikipedia, as always, to the rescue: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_embedding_of_distributions ). In this particular instance, what you'd want is to see whether the inner product between your two distributions is less than some level that you set, I believe.
