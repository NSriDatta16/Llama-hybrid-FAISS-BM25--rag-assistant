XGBoost's exact greedy split finding algorithm enumerates over all possible splits for each feature to find the best split. For floating-type features, the algorithm uses a histogram-based approximation to determine the candidate split points. This means that the split values chosen for floating-type features are not necessarily one of the unique values for that feature. For ordinal-type features, the algorithm treats the feature as categorical and enumerates over all possible splits based on the unique values in that feature. This means that the split values for ordinal-type features will be one of the unique values for that feature.
