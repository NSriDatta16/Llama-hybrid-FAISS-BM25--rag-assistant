The blocks in code coverage with VS2010

I run the C++ code to get code coverage results as is in this post . #include using namespace std; int testfunction(int input) { if (input > 0) { return 1; } else { return 0; } } int main() { testfunction(-1); testfunction(1); } The code coverage result says there are three blocks in the main(), and four blocks in the testfunction(). What does the block mean? How does are there the 3/4 blocks in main/testfunction? ADDED When I modified the code as follows, int main() { testfunction(1); testfunction(1); } or as follows int main() { testfunction(-1); testfunction(-1); } I have this result. And it seems that the testfunction() has four blocks. the function entry if block else block condition I got hints from this post .
