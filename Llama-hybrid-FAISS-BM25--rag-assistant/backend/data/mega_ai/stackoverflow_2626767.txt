Prevent checkins to SVN

My team uses SVN for our software platform, and we create tags periodically to help keep module versions straight. Best practice, as I understand it, is not to modify a tag once it has been created. However, it seems that sometimes the temptation is too great and a modification is made to one of the tags. Is there a way to prevent these kinds of checkins, or at least make them a complete pain so that we can discourage them automatically? Thanks, Joe
