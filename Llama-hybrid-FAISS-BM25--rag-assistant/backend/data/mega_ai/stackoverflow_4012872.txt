how to center a footer div on a webpage

I want to center my web page footer and create a reasonable gab between it and the above content. Currently, the footer has a line and paragraph joined to the above content. I can push down the content but the line does not move. I am sure the property I am missing out in my css style sheet. Could someone help? This is my html mark up: Copyright (c) 2010 mysite.com All rights reserved Which css property can I use to solve this problem? A sample would be appreciated. Thanks.
