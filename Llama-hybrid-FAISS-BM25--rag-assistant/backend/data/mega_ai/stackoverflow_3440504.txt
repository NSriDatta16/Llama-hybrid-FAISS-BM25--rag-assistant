Beside the performance and scalability issues, the main drawback is to use full text search in MySQL, you must use MyISAM as the storage engine, which is quite rare in most business nowadays. Anyway, I would strongly recommend you to try out Sphinx: http://www.sphinxsearch.com/ . It is very easy to setup and integrate with MySQL. Prominent users of Sphinx include Craigslist and MySQL.
