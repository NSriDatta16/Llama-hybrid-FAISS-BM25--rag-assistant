You could use 10-fold Cross-validation for this. I believe it's pretty standard approach for classification algorithm performance evaluation. The basic idea is to divide your learning samples into 10 subsets. Then use one subset for test data and others for train data. Repeat this for each subset and calculate average performance at the end.
