How to use uniform distribution to see central limit theorem in action?

I would like to use MATLAB to visualize the Central Limit Theorem in action. I would like to use rand() to produce 10 samples of uniform distribution U[0,1] and compute their average, then save it to a matrix 'Mat'. I would then use a histogram to visualize the convergence in distribution. How would you do this and normalize that histogram so it is a valid probability density (instead of just counting the frequency of occurrence)? To generate the samples I am doing something like: Mat = rand(N,sizeOfVector) > rand(1); But I guess I am going to the wrong side.
