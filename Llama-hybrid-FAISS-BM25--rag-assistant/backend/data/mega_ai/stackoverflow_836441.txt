Sure. MVC exists to put a view on top of a model. If your app is all view and no model, you don't need to force a model in there. As your app gets more complex, and there becomes an obvious model, you can re-factor. In other words, you wouldn't use M, V and C for Hello World. It would strictly be "V". "C" adds more view-specific smarts, and "M" adds business logic, persistence and retrieval.
