In httpclient what is the most elegant/correct way to turn HttpEntity to a String?

I'm fetching a web page using the Apache httpcomponents Java library . After connecting the result I get is an HttpEntity which has a method getContent() which returns an InputStream and also has a method writeTo() which writes to an OutputStream. I want to turn the result into a String for extracting information. What is the most elegant (and safe) way to do this? Some possible solutions: Write to a ByteArrayOutputStream and then convert those bytes to a String with a String constructor use InputStreamReader to read straight from the stream, and put into a StringBuilder Both of these feel a bit ugly. Would you recommend choosing one of these or something else?
