As others have told you PCA does not look for amplitude - in fact it is standard procedure to normalize your variables before a PCA. You did not do this by the way. It looks for correlations between the columns. The result you want to generate you would get by Randomly generating a column Generating a second random column with similar parameters but also adding the first column to it. In your example this would basically be first column + randbetween. Generate additional uncorrelated columns as in 1 Normalize and then get eigenvalues and vectors
