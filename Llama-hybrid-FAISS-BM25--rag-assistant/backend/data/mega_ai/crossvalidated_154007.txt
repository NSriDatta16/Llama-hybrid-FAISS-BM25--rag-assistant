Most accepted theory to analyse trend in data series

I have pollutant concentration for long period I want to determine trend. I have read some of the question answers in this blog regarding same . I have few queries. What is most accepted theory to calculate trend which is mostly used by climate scientists. Could someone suggest/provide any research paper. My data also have some missing data sometimes for days and sometime for some month due to instrument error or other reason . So how the missing data is deal in trend analysis ? Interpolating data in parameters like temperature is not that much big issue because temperature does not show large fluctuations. But pollutant concentration which shows large fluctuation from day to day so I think its not a good idea to interpolate the concentration. So how can we deal with missing data 3) I will depersonalized the data can we check piece-wise trend in time series. By piece-wise I mean to say suppose my data shows enhancement for 10 years from starting and after that the concentrations now decreases. So how to deal with that. 4) I have to report the significance in the trend as well. I am using MATLAB for dealing and analysis of the data. Could someone suggest/help me in this regard I shall be extremely thankful. Thanks Gracy
