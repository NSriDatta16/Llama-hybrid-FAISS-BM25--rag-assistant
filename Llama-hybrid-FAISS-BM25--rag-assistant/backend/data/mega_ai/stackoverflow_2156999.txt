There's no way that I know of to silently save files to the user's drive, which is what it seems like you're hoping to do. I think you can ASK for files to be saved one at a time (prompting the user each time) using something like: function saveAsMe (filename) { document.execCommand('SaveAs',null,filename) } If you wanted to only prompt the user once, you could grab all the images silently, zip them up in a bundle, then have the user download that. This might mean doing XmlHttpRequest on all the files, zipping them in Javascript, UPLOADING them to a staging area, and then asking the user if they would like to download the zip file. Sounds absurd, I know. There are local storage options in the browser, but they are only for the developer's use, within the sandbox, as far as I know. (e.g. Gmail offline caching.)
