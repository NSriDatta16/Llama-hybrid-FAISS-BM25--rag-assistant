jQuery - readability vs. performance(?)

Considering the to fragments of jQuery code which does the same: $(" ").css({ "background-color" : "red", "color" : "white", "border" : "solid 1px black" }) .appendTo( someElement ); and $(" ") .appendTo( someElement ); The first one is more readable in my opinion, but is there a performance difference between the two? Or is the performance difference so small that readability should go before the explicit tag declaration? [Edit: clarification] Using css and style is just an example. It could be adding numerous other attributes/values as well.
