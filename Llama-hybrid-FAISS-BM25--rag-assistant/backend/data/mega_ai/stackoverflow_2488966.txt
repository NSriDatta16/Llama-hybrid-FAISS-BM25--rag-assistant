I'd recommend looking at a technology such as OAuth ( http://oauth.net/ ). This enables the user to authorize access to their account to an application without having to actually enter their username and password into it. Also means you dont have to worry about secure storage of the users credentials, and if their passwords change etc it doesn't matter. It's used by facebook / twitter and a lot of other big name companies so its not going away (Its actually in the process of getting approved as an offical standard).
