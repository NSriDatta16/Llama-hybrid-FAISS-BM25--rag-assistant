Do you really need an installer? It's most macish to have a DMG image with the app in it, so the user can just drag it to the Programs folder. If it's more complex, I think you have use a .pkg package. The Installer app will install the files out of it. Those packages can be created by using PackageMaker, which is brought by XCode.
