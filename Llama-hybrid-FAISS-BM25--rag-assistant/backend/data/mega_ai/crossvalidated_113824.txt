Modeling a non-stationary bounded series

I'm trying to model a time series variable that represents a percentage, strictly bounded between 0 and 1, that is also non-stationary about the mean. Is there a model form that is able to account for non-stationary behavior while producing forecasts within the [0,1] interval? I came across the following work while researching the topic which I believe could be extended to answer this particular question (just a hunch based on a quick reading): Park, Joon Y., and Peter CB Phillips. " Nonlinear regressions with integrated time series. " Econometrica 69.1 (2001): 117-161. Park, Joon Y., and Peter CB Phillips. " Nonstationary binary choice. " Econometrica 68.5 (2000): 1249-1280. Hu, Ling, and Robert de Jong. Nonstationary Censored Regression . mimeo, Ohio State Uni, 2006. Unfortunately, I'm unaware of any implementation (preferably in R ) of the ML estimators discussed. Per Alecos' requests, below is a plot of the series that led to this question and the de-trended series
