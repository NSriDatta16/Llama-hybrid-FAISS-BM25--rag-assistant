Google App Engine - Bulkloading using RemoteApiServlet - Billing

I am using the App Engine RemoteApiServlet and the Bulkloader to load data into the datastore. As the dataset that i was uploading was huge (a million entities) I enabled "Billing" on my application and set the max. daily budget to $5 and later to $10. After i loaded the entities, using the App Engine admin console, i determined that i would be billed ~ $7 for CPU hours (as i ended up using ~ 70 CPU hours). However when i look at the Billing history, i was charged only 0.05$ (for storage) and $0.0 for CPU hours. I want to know if this is expected? Is Bulkloading using the RemoteApiServlet not billed for CPU hours ? If yes, when i set a max daily budget of $5 and exceeded my CPU quota i started getting HTTP 503's from the service. If the usage of the RemoteApiServlet is exempted from billing, then why was I seeing the 503 errors?
