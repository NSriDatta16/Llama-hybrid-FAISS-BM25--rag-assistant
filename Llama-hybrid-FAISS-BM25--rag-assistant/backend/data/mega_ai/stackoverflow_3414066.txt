System.Windows.Forms.Trackbar - how to prevent user from dragging the slider?

Is there some way to (temporarily) prevent user from changing the value of TrackBar by dragging the slider? Only way I found is to set Enabled property to false but it also greys out the trackbar. Edit: Since IÂ´m getting more answers about why shouldn't I do it rather than how it's possible to do it, I decided to explain why I would like to do it. I'm not using it to allow user adjust value of some application property, but to display and control progress of some action. Imagine for example your favourite media player - it probably contains some control (I'd call it trackbar but English is not my native language so it's maybe wrong) that displays what part of movie it's currently playing, but also allows you to control it - move back or forward in time and watch the different part. I use the trackbar in exactly this way - I don't know any other component that would be better (Progressbar won't allow me changing the "position"). It's working fine, the only thing I'd like to do is not to allow user to "use the trackbar unless the movie is paused". For this exact reason I've used trackbar component many times in Delphi 6, but when it was disabled it didn't grey out and in my opinion it worked fine. That's why I asked here if it's possible to achieve the same effect in C#.
