How do I copy my entire working copy between hard drives?

Whenever I try to copy an entire working copy using simple drag and drop between two computers (e.g. from an old computer to a new one, or from one VM to another) in order to avoid having to redownload the entire several GB set of code from our online repository I get an error as soon as I reach any of the hidden SVN-BASE files. Is there a way to copy an entire working copy with these intact? I'm using Vista x64.
