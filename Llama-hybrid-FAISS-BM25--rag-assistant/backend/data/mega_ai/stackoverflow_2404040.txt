remember that nvarchar requires 2 bytes per character so if an int is 4 character then to use the same space you could only use 2 characters in the nvarchar column. I would go with int or even smallint (up to 32,767 and 2 bytes of storage) if tinyint (up to 255) is not enough So I would use the first table in this case don't know what your queries will look like but might be an idea of switching the columns around and starting with typeid
