Yes, the p-value for the effect of a 10-unit change in the covariate (years in this case) is the same as that for the effect of a 1-unit change. Here's the demonstration: the p-value for the original question (effect of a 1-unit change) is $P(|Z|>\frac{\hat\beta}{\sigma_{\hat\beta}})$ , i.e. the tail area of the Normal distribution beyond the ratio of (estimated change)/(standard error of estimated change). The estimated effect of a 10-unit change in the covariate is $10\hat\beta$ , but the standard error of this change is $10\sigma_{\hat\beta}$ ; the changes cancel out and we end up with the same p-value as before. In the case of a logistic regression you will be doing tests on the log-odds ratio scale [or equivalently on the scale of additive changes in the log-odds], but the concept is the same.
