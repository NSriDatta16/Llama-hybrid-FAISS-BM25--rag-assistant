Strong database names on database server

We have a SQL server with many databases in it. We have customers with multiple versions of a similar app and multiple apps for a single customer. Almost all databases are tied to specific websites. How do you stay organized with your database names? Surely there is no single answer, but do you have a database naming strategy that is working for you? We are considering: Customer + Product + Phase of Development (Production, Staging, etc.) But that becomes awkward when a customer runs three versions of a product.
