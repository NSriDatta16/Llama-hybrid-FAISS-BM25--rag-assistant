Interface Builder can't see classes in a static library

I have refactored some UIView sub-classes into a static library. However, when using Interface Builder to create view components for a project that uses the static library I find that it is unaware of the library classes. What do I need to do to make the class interfaces visible to Interface Builder? Update: The correct answer refers to dragging the headers into the 'XIB browser'. The '.h' files can be dragged from a finder window to the window area identified in this image: alt text http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/1221/xibbrowser.png
