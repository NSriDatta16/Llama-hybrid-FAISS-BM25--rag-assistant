Help Understanding the inserted and deleted Table SQL Server

If a run an INSERT INTO statement that triggers an INSERT AFTER trigger. What table/row(s) does the inserted and deleted objects represent in the trigger? For example, INSERT INTO Person.person (personID, name) VALUES (1, 'robert') CREATE TRIGGER myTrigger ON Person.person AFTER INSERT AS BEGIN insert into Person.PersonMovies (personID, movieID) select inserted.personID from inserted _--i know the code is incomplete, but i'm curious only about the inserted part._ END I'm confused as to what records are held by the inserted table. Would it be the records in the insert statement that triggered the trigger or the Person.PersonMovies table?
