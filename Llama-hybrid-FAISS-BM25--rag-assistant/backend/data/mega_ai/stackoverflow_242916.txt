Terminalfour site manager - Content Management System

I am about to start a project, ongoing actually for the next 2 years where we as an organisation will be implementing TerminalFour Site Manager I am basically after any advice or support if anyone has used this piece of software, and what they think about it. So far, apart from it being clearly not the prettiest of interfaces, it does seem that it can handle the majority of basic website editing etc quite well. I do see limitations though when it comes to custom built templates and linking with external data, RSS, MySQL tables and the like. So as mentioned, if anyone else has used it or is going to use, what are your thoughts? Thanks
