why do some people don't use scikit-learn library instead of writing long python functions?

The other day I was exploring Kaggle and I found most of them don't use scikit-learn or any other library but instead they write these long python scripts. For example, why they write a function for train/test split when you can just use the scikit-learn library which is hassle free are there any advantages of not using any library and writing python code directly. p.s: I'm a Data Science Beginner.
