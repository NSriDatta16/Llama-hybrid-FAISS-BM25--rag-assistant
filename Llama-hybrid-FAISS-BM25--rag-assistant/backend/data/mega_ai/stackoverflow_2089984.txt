There's one approach that is not especially elegant but you can start another (broker)process with medium level integrity which can do the 'dirty work' and use IPC to communicate with it. To make your life easier I would suggest you to use sockets for communication because they don't require security check which can be tricky when you have communication between processes with different integrity levels. In order to skip UAC warning when you spawn new process you can modify BHO registration script and add few registry values that will inform IE to silently elevate new process to medium level.
