SQL Server has a hierarchical data type. Haven't used it but looks interesting. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc794278.aspx . What I often use in these situations is a Left Right Tree. These are efficient for querying the data. Most importantly, I have a specific layer for loading and persisting my tree. This would grab all children from the db and load up the tree in memory. The layer would also be responsible for moving nodes within the tree, deleting nodes, ect. Once you have a tree organized in memory you can do everything from there. Hope that helps, let me know if you want some code samples of a generic left/right tree.
