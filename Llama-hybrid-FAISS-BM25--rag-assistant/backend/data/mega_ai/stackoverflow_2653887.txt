No, MIBs aren't strictly required to be able to query a SNMP agent. A MIB allows a SNMP client to interpret the information returned by the agent (i.e., by giving it a readable name rather than just the OID, correctly displaying data in the desired format, etc.). If you know the OID, a client should be able to query the agent without being provided a MIB.
