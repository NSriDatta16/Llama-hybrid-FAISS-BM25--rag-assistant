This is a simple CSS problem. Take a look at your HTML: ... ... ... Get that inline height assignment out of there! Your footer is not inside your form. It is outside it. So as the form grows, it overflows the parent div (which cannot change in height). So as the form grows the other divs are not pushed down and out of the way. Instead the form just overflows and covers everything up. If you let the parent div grow by removing the inline height, then as the form grows, the parent div would grow pushing everything, including the footer down. Also, the way you use those s and all the inline CSS is not very elegant. You should read up on CSS.
