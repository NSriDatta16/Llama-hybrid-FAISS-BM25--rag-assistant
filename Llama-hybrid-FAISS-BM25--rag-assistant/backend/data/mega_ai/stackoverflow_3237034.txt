how can i get catch the root of a stackoverflow exception on recursive code

I have the following recursive code and i am getting a stackoverflow exception. I can't figure out the root cause because once i get the exception,i dont get the full call stack in Visual studio. The idea is that there are org teams that roll up into larger "Main" teams. Does anyone see a flaw on this code below that could be the culprit? private Unit GetUnit(Unit organisationalUnit) { if (organisationalUnit.IsMainUnit) { return organisationalUnit; } if (organisationalUnit.Parent == null) return null; return GetUnit(organisationalUnit.Parent); }
