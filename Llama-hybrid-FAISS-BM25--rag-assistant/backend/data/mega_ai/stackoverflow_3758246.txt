the only animation that would work for me in this kind situation is a custom jQuery animation which would change the backgroundcolor, fading it to its 'to be' color. this way the attention gets drawn, but not too much to make people sick. Edit: Since you cant .animate() the background color you need to use this plugin: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
