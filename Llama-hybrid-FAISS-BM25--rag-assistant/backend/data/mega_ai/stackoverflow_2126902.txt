You don't need to find the Item, it is already the Sender. I.e. you can do procedure TForm1.MyItem1Click(Sender: TObject); begin if Sender = MyItem1 then [...] else if Sender = MyItem2 then I generally use the tag property to differentiate the MenuItem that triggered the handler. Not elegant, but works. procedure TForm1.Item1Click(Sender: TObject); begin case TMenuItem(Sender).Tag of 0: [..]; 1: [..]; [..] One has to remember to set the all menu item's OnClick events to point to the same handler. This is something I don't remember till I see clicking one has no effect..
