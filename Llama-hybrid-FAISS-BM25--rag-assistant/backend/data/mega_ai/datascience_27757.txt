If you are interested in very recent, highly advanced works I would highly recommend keeping an eye on Google Brain's research paper releases. They have categories from Machine Intelligence, NLP, Machine Translation, Machine Perception, etc.. Many of these research papers involve Deep NN's so it should satisfy your desires. https://research.google.com/pubs/papers.html
