I have a Master's in Computer Science and my thesis was about time-series prediction using Neural Networks. The book Hands on machine learning with Scikit and Tensorflow was extremely helpful from a practical point of view. It really lays things very clearly, without much theory and math. I strongly recommend it. On the other hand, the book by Ian Goodfellow is also a must (kind of the bible of DL). There you'll find the theoretical explanations, also it will leave you much much more knowledgeable with regards to deep learning and the humble beginning of the field till now. Another, as others have suggested, is of course, Deep Learning with Python by Chollet. I indulged reading this book. Indeed it was very well written, and again, it teaches you tricks and concepts that you hardly grasp from tutorials and courses online. Furthermore, I see you are familiar with Matlab, so maybe you have taken some stats/probability classes, otherwise, all these will overwhelm you a bit.
