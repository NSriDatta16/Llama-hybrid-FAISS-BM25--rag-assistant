You can take a look at scikit-learn's implementation. pay attention to the class_ weight argument which can have values of a dictionary of class weights or 'auto': class sklearn.svm.SVC(C=1.0, kernel='rbf', degree=3, gamma=0.0, coef0=0.0, shrinking=True, probability=False, tol=0.001, cache_size=200, class_weight=None, verbose=False, max_iter=-1, random_state=None) You can play with the value of class_weight argument which can be a class weight dictionary or 'auto'. In 'auto' mode the learning algorithm will automatically assign weights to each class based on the number of samples within each of them. scikit-learn has several other classification algorithms, some of which accept class weights.
