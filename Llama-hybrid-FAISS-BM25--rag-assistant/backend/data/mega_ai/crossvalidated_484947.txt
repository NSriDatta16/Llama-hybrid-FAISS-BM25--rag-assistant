Graphical representation of unconditional expected value

First, let tell you that I've being struggling with the concept of unconditional expectation for linear regression . For conditional expectation is easier: We know that the conditional expectation function is defined by the average of all the possible values that $Y$ can take given a certain value of $X$ . And then , if we take every of those averaged $Y$ values, corresponding to all the $X$ 's values we have, and link them with a line, we are going to have the conditional expectation function . For that same data, if we fit a linear regression, the function of that regression is supposed to be the same, or at least the best approximation to the conditional expectation function . Something like this (source: https://www.timlrx.com/2018/02/26/notes-on-regression-approximation-of-the-conditional-expectation-function/ ): For unconditional expectation we know that our value does not depend on the value that $X$ takes: $$E(Y)= a + bX$$ And with that, we say that $Y$ take a constant value for every number that $x$ 's can take: it takes and average. As far as I know, we use the unconditional expectation form for a linear regression when our $X$ variable is fixed, it is no random. That is, we use unconditional expectation when we are performing an experiment, where we consciously make $X$ take a certain value. I still cannot understand, how we are supposed to imagine in unconditional expectation, our $Y$ value taking a constant value for group of $X$ 's. And the thing is: if in a conditional expectation mode of regression , we are expecting that our linear regression approximates to the conditional expectation function , in a unconditional expectation regression , how we are supposed to see that our linear regression line approximates a constant value of $Y$ . Wouldn't that be a constant line with zero slope? I still don't know if I'm misinterpreting all this, but it has been confusing me around for a good time.
