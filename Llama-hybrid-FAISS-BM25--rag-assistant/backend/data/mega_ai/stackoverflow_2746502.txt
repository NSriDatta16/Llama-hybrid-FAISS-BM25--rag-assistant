I would agree with Robert, Give flexmonkey a look. We use it combined with Selinium for testing our web app and we have had some good results. Also.. are you looking to do functional testing or performance GUI testing. What we have found that to do individual GUI testing profiling combined with programmatic sampling is a good starting point. If regression testing is what you are looking for FlexMonkey is a good start. If you want to test load performance between your AIR app our QA department is in the process of evaluating tools and seem to be pretty positive on NeoTys's offereing.
