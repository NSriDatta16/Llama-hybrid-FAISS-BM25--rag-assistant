Is the average of betas from Y ~ X and X ~ Y valid?

I am interested in the relationship between two time series variables: $Y$ and $X$ . The two variables are related to each other, and it's not clear from theory which one causes the other. Given this, I have no good reason to prefer the linear regression $ Y = \alpha + \beta X$ over $ X = \kappa + \gamma Y $ . Clearly there is some relationship between $\beta$ and $\gamma$ , though I recall enough statistics to understand that $\beta = 1/ \gamma$ is not true. Or perhaps it's not even close? I'm a bit hazy. The problem is to decide how much of $X$ one ought to hold against $Y$ . I'm considering taking the average of $\beta$ and $1/ \gamma$ and using that as the hedge ratio. Is the average of $\beta$ and $1/ \gamma$ a meaningful concept? And as a secondary question (perhaps this should be another post), what is the appropriate way to deal with the fact that the two variables are related to each other -- meaning that there really isn't an independent and dependent variable?
