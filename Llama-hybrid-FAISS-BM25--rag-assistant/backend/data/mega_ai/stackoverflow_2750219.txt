I think the assignment is expecting you to list a single average per city/short-code combination. You'll need to employ the GROUP BY clause and the AVG function. Also, CustCity will never be 'WA'; you probably have to derive the 'WA' check from the zip code (I don't live in the U.S., but I guess that looking at the first two digits will suffice).
