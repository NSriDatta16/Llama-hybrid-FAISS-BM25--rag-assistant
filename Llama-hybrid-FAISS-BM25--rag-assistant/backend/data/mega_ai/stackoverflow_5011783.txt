The JAVA_OPTS environment variable is only respected by certain applications (for example the wrapper scripts that are typically used to launch Tomcat). The java command doesn't pay any attention to it. You need to put the options on the java command line ... before the classname; e.g. java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m ... some.pkg.MainClass ... (A 1Gb heap should be more than adequate for buffering a 50Mb file.)
