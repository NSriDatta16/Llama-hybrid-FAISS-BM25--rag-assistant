It is common for the correlation or other relationship between aggregated data to show a stronger relationship than the individual or unaggregated data. Basically, if there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ and you also have a grouping variable that is related to $x$ and/or $y$ then looking at only the averages (or other aggregation) of the groups will remove much of the variation within the groups while maintaining the relationship, making the relationship look stronger in the aggregate. Here is some R code to simulate some data and compare the raw to the aggregated data, look at the graph to see the lower variation and higher correlation: library(MASS) tmp.s cor(x, y) # [1] 0.6511773 cor(x2, y2) [1] 0.9498334 A related concept is the Ecological Fallacy . The extreme case is Simpson's paradox , where the aggregated data can show an opposite relationship to the data at the individual level.
