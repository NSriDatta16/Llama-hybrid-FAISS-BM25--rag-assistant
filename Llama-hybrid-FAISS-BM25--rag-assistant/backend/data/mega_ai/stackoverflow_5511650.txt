Implement a presistent B-Tree

I'm interested to implement a presistent B-Tree using either c++ or java, as I need to store some path expressions e.g. //scientist/person/... /[Albert Einstein]. I tried google, but I was not satisfied. Some hints on this would be very helpful, or any ideas as where to start with. The BTree must be stored on the the disk however.
