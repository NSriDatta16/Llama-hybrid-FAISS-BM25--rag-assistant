For a single time series, I usually make the split in various train test splits ie: You have data from August of 2020 to August 2021. Split taking 2 months by 2 months, this process is called splitting window, then you have a 'window' of two months of data, based in this you can train, make the inference and calculate your metrics using the test set which will be taken the values after this 2 months.
