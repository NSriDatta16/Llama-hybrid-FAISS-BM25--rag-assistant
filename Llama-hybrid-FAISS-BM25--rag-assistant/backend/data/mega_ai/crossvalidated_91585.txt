Why do we assign fractional ranks in rank tests?

Both Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed rank test follow this procedure: sort the data assign ranks, Ties receive a rank equal to the average of the ranks they span compute the statistic using a sum the ranks compare statistic against critical values and make verdict For me the 3rd step seems like an unnecessary complication . If we intend to sum the ranks anyway, there is no difference if we sum 2 and 3 or 2.5 and 2.5. Am I missing something?
