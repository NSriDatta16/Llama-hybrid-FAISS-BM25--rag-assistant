Is there any way to explicitly measure the complexity of a Machine Learning Model in Python

I'm interested in model debugging , and one of the points that it mentions is to compare your model with a "less complex" one to check if the performance is substantially better on the most complex model as compared with the simpler one. So, it raises my questions: Suppose you have a Ensemble model and a Linear model for a classification task "It seems natural to think that the ensemble model is more complex than the linear model" What would it be a model's agnostic way to numerically measure its complexity to compare two or more models in such terms? Is there any Python/R implementation that can help with such a task?
