How to interpret a crash report?

I have got a crash report from one of my application's users, who found application to be freezing and then he has to force quit it. I am having trouble to extract information from it which can help me to resolve its cause. Can some one help me to interpret it or can give me some initial push so that I can interpret it my self? Crash report is as follow, (it is very long, so I have pasted a part of it): Date/Time: 2010-06-23 12:07:53 -0700 OS Version: 10.6.4 (Build 10F569) Architecture: x86_64 Report Version: 6 Command: XYZ Path: /Applications/XYZ.app/Contents/MacOS/XYZ Version: 1.5.6 build-0182 (1.5.6) Parent: launchd [94] PID: 463 Event: hang Duration: 4.41s (sampling started after 2 seconds) Steps: 24 (100ms sampling interval) Pageins: 1 Pageouts: 0 Process: XYZ [463] Path: /Applications/XYZ.app/Contents/MacOS/XYZ UID: 501 Process: AirPort Base Station Agent [118] Path: /System/Library/CoreServices/AirPort Base Station Agent.app/Contents/MacOS/AirPort Base Station Agent UID: 501 Thread a0923d4 DispatchQueue 1 User stack: 24 ???
