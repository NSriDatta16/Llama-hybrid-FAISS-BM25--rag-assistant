Parameterise Service start option in WiX installer

I have a ServiceInstall component in a WiX installer where I have a requirement to either start auto or demand depending on parameters passed into the MSI. So the Xml element in question is WiX will not allow using a PArameter for the Start attribute, so Im stuck with completely suplicating the component with a condition, eg/ SERVICESTART="demand" ... and completely duplicating the whole component, with a different setting for Start and a different Condition. Anyone know of a more elegant solution? One where I don;t have to maintain 2 COmponents whjich do exactly the same thing except the Attribute for Start?
