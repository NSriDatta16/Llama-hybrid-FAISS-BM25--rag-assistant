If you go to Xcode's organizer you'll see that your device is actually not allowed to run the debug mode (with a development provision file), since your SDK version is lower than your device's OS. Apple just doesn't allow that to happen. I assume that you want to keep your old SDK is because you want to check the compatibility with older OS. I would suggest you upgrade your Xcode and its SDK to the latest version (3.2.5/4.2.1) while testing your app on old and new OS devices.
