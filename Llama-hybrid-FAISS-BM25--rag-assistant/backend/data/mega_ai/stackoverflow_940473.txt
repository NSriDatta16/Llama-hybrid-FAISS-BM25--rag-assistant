I'm guessing you're working from the Embedding Jetty document (since you've started with a handler). I would (instead) check further down that document and follow the Quick Start - Servlets section. Derive your own servlet from HttpServlet and implement the doGet()/doPost() methods. You will want to return the form as you've done in the above example.
