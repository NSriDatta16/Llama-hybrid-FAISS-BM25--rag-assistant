What is the differences between void DoSomething(const Foo& foo) and void DoSomething(Foo foo)? pragmatically there is no difference, the const will prevent you from changing the contents of 'foo' whereas passing by value will also not affect the contents of the argument, however in terms of effectiveness the const Foo& foo is more effective since it wouldn't create a copy when the object is passed to the method.
