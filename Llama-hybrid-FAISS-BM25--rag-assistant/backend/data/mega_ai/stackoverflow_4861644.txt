For storing data locally and accessing them offline take a look at Gears and Web Storage . The main problem is what degree of functionality you want to provide with your website. It always requires some work on the client (user) side to "store" aka. save your website offline. You would have to store all your functionality in one page that the user stores (be it a Flash movie or some Javascript-Code).
