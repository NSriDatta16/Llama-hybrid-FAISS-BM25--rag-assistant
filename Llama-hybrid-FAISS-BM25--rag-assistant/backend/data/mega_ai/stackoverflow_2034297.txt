Your question title and first sentence are different. :) I'm not sure about where to place your tests. That would depend on language and C# is not something I'm familiar with but I imagine that a substantial part of your code is inside private methods. I'd feel uncomfortable if that was not tested. Code coverage would drop quite a bit.
