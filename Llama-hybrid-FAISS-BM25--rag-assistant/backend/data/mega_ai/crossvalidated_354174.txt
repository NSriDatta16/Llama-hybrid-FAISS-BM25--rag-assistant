Tune the hyperparameters! Hyperparameters govern the bias-variance tradeoff of your model on that specific data set. This is explained in more detail in Elements of Statistical Learning and many other questions on this site. XGBoost has a number of knobs to turn. A combination of hyperparameters that works well for some problem, or some feature space, might not work well for another. Different features make available different information, so what works well in one instance may not work well in another. https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest//parameter.html
