How to make a div to a input text form?

There is some drawbacks using textarea and input-text as input of text forms. textarea has a little annoying triangle in right-lower corner and input-text is a single-line input. I try to have a input of text like the facebook update input form. The input auto resize after linebreaks. And the element or tag used was . I said "used" because, after they redesigned Facebook, I can't figure-out which tag is used now. There is CSS property that enables the user to edit the text in a div element. I actually copied the CSS property, but now I lost it. Can someone tell me which CSS property it was? I have a weak memory that it began with the -webkit prefix though
