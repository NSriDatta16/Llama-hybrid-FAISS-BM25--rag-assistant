Elements of statistical learning can be little intimidating for beginners. I would recommend reading " Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R ", which can be downloaded for free from here -> http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ It also has worked out examples in R at the end of every chapter. " Machine Learning: An algorithmic Perspective " by Stephen Marsland also covers broader range of topics without going too much into maths.
