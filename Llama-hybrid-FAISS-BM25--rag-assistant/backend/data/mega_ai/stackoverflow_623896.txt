When you refer to corruption, are you talking about RAM or some other storage? Perhaps during transmission over some medium? In any case, when you are dealing with data corruption you are talking about an entire field of computer science that deals with error detection and correction. When you talk about losing a node, the first thing you have to figure out is 'how do I know I've lost a node?', that's error detection. As for the problem of protecting data from corruption, pretty much the only way to do this is with redundancy. The amount of redundancy is determined by what limit you want to put on the degree of corruption you would like to be able to recover from. You can't really protect yourself from this with a clever structure design as you are just as likely to suffer corruption to the critical 'clever' part of your structure :) The ever-wise wikipedia is a good place to start: Error detection and correction
