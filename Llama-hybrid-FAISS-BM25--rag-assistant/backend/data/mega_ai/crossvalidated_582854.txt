Correlating two variables

Im doing a medical research in which i have a cohort of 59 patients. I have data for each one about their blood level of a specific marker and data for each one about how many organs the disease I'm researching has affected. Basically I want to see whether or not the disease extension (how many organs are affected) is correlated with a high value of the said marker in the blood. Would using a spearman correlation be the correct strategy here?
