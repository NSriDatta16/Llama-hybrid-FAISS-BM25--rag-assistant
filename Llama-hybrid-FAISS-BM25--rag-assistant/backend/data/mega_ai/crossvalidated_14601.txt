If your planned comparisons are linearly independent (orthogonal), you can run multiple contrasts without adjusting your alpha level. If your contrasts are not orthogonal, you have to correct for multiple comparisons. You can use Helmert's procedure to generate a list of orthogonal contrasts. Re: Jeromy's comment, I found this tidbit online @ this website : For a priori planned orthogonal contrasts, the conceptual unit for error rate is conventionally taken to be the individual contrast (rather than the family of contrasts in the full set), just as it is taken to be the individual term in multi-factorial ANOVA partitioned into treatment effects and interactions (rather than the full experiment). The family-wise Type-I error must apply, however, if contrasts are used for post hoc comparisons to locate the biggest differences amongst levels of a treatment. The family-wise error rate for m independent tests, each with an individual error rate α, is 1 - (1 - α)m; the family-wise error rate for m orthogonal contrasts is some small amount less than this because their significance tests are not independent (since all use the same error mean square, even though the contrasts are independent since orthogonal). The size of α can be reduced to control the family-wise error rate, though at a cost of substantially diminishing power to detect individual differences. In any case, I'm think this is what the source is referring to when it says your contrasts should be orthogonal. Even if, as Karl pointed out, the source is being conservative at the expense of pragmatism.
