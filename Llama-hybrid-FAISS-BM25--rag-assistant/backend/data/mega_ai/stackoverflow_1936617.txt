What's an elegant and easy way to construct XML from a custom object?

I need to construct an XML transaction of the following format: ALL LETTER 06226 06231 0 4.5 REGULAR true 21-Dec-2009 My thought was to create an object RateV3Request that contains typed properties for each XML property (I assume property is not the correct word here.) I was thinking of creating a "GetXml" function on my object that returns the XML representation of the values in the object instance.I could do all the string concatenation myself, but surely there is a cleaner way. Suggestions? I am using VB.NET
