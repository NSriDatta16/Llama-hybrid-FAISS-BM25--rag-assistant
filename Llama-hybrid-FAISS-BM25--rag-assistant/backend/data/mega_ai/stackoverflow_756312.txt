How can I create a WinForm app that just displays a NotifyIcon?

I am pretty sure I've done this before, but I cannot remember how/where I found out how to do this. I created a new WinForm application then dragged a notify icon onto my designer. I coded my desired functionality for the NotifyIcon's behavior inside the Form1.vb file. I think I remember something about adding a module to the project, and setting the project to launch the aforementioned module instead of the form...but I can't figure out/recall how to keep the functionality I've coded into Form1.vb.
