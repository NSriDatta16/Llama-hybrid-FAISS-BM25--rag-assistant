While it never gives an impossible value for the area, it's certainly no longer unbiased (its expectation will be $\frac{\pi}{4}\, \theta$, about 22% too small on average). Bias isn't necessarily a bad idea, but in this case that's a lot of bias in cases where the estimate was not an issue. For example you might easily have six points in the circle (a reasonably likely number to come up if the circle isn't small - say about half the area or more). The unbiased estimator you started with would estimate the area to be 60, but your scaled down estimator would say it was about 47. Note further that you're much more likely (about 1.4 times as likely) to get 6 points in there when the area is near 60 than when it's near 47. For fewer than 8 points it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to scale it down like that - certainly not that much, though you may be able to reduce MSE if you shrink it a little (I haven't checked this though). For 8+ points falling within the circle, there's a clear argument for not saying the circle is larger than $25\pi$ (you know for sure it isn't) -- and your estimate cannot be worse (cannot be further from $\theta$) for doing so. You would lose unbiasedness by never saying more than $25\pi$ but you'd reduce the variance substantially. (You might like to consider what the MLE of the area would be.) Of course in large samples -- ones large enough for this to be a practical tool -- impossible values will become so rare as to make it essentially a nonissue. I do a lot of simulations, and for me $n=10^4$ when estimating a proportion like this is usually something I see as "too small", except as a rough feasibility check. I often do $10^6$ or $10^7$ simulations for proportions if they're not really close to a boundary - sometimes more.
