No, this can't be done with standard .NET serialization. You'll have to invent your own storage format. For example, include a header with offsets of data chunks: ---------------- --+ ... | ---------------- | ... | | ... | ---------------- | ... ... ----------------- ... So in order to preview data (from any arbitrary position) you'll have to load at most ceil(required-item-count/chunk-size) . This will incur some overhead, but it's much better than loading the whole file.
