Calculating average percentage from a set of pair percentages

I have a series of 7 pairs with each pair adding up to 100%. I now need to average column a and b to end up with a final pair totalling 100%. Where do I start? | | A | B | C | Asus | 74.38%| 25.62%| 100% | HTC | 0% | 100% | 100% | LG | 0% | 100% | 100% | Moto | 25% | 75% | 100% | | | | |Android| ? | ? | 100%
