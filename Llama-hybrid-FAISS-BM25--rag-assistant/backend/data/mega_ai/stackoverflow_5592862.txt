Why not just check the documentation? This is the list of GCC's supported pragmas, sorted into various categories. For example: #pragma GCC optimize ("string"...) This pragma allows you to set global optimization options for functions defined later in the source file. One or more strings can be specified. Each function that is defined after this point will be as if attribute((optimize("STRING"))) was specified for that function. The parenthesis around the options is optional. See Function Attributes, for more information about the optimize attribute and the attribute syntax. The `#pragma GCC optimize' pragma is not implemented in GCC versions earlier than 4.4.
