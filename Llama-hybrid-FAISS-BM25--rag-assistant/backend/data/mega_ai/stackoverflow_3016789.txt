An activity is a user interface for carrying out some task, and is closer to what you might think of as a Form or Window in other frameworks. A View is a self-controlled rectangular section of a window that interaction can occur in, and is a much lower-level representation of UI. It's closer to what you might think of when you hear Control or Widget in a different framework. The visual content of a window is provided by a hierarchy of views, which are objects derived from the base View class. Each and every view controls a rectangular space within the window. A parent view contains and organizes the layout of its children; leaf views, at the bottom of the hierarchy, actually draw in the rectangles they control and respond to user actions. Thus, a view is where an activity's interaction with the user actually takes place. You'll probably want to read Android Fundamentals ; it's a good starting point in the Android documentation.
