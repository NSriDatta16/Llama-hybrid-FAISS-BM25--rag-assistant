For longitudinal count data like this, a popular approach is to fit a generalized linear mixed model . A basic model could include "fixed effects" for starting density class, time and maybe latitude and longitude. You could then include a "random intercept" for each of the 6 locations. This will induce correlation in the observations within the same location. Furthermore, you can use a Negative Binomial model which is a more natural distribution for counts. Poisson distributions would also be possible, though they are vulnerable to overdispersion which is common in most data. All of this can be done using maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Both of these methods provide confidence intervals for your effects of interest and have theoretical backing (unlike procedures such as two-stage least squares). If you are familiar with R, I recommend using the function glmer.nb in the package lme4. Other statistical software should have similar procedures as this is a standard class of models.
