Contest ranking question - how to rank entries in multiple categories?

I'm currently developing a video contest web application using Ruby on Rails. It integrates closely with YouTube, which it uses for submitting videos, comments, average rating, and popularity stats. The application will also count Twitter and (possibly) Facebook mentions, and count the number of times visitors have clicked an "Add This" social network button. Instead of direct voting it will use each video's YouTube rating and social media presence to pick a winner. My question is: What is the fairest method for ranking the entries? My basic idea is to just find each video's ranking in each category separately by sorting the results of an ActiveRecord query, then compute the average of all these numbers and use it as the video's master rank. Then I'd sort all the entries by this rank, with the lowest number coming in first, etc. Is this a fair way to rank the contest entries?
