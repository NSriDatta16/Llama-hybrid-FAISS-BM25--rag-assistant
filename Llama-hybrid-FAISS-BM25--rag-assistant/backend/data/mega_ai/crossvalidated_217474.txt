Is there a way to prevent forecasting negative values with ARIMA (or add constrains) in R?

Currently I'm using the ARIMA provided in R, the training series is a seasonal time series, with some values close to zero in each period, and I find that when the training series have a descending trend, then in the result of the forecast, there will be some negative values. But the time series should be positive on every timestamps, is there a way to add constraints in ARIMA so as to prevent forecasting negative values? If adding constraints is not possible, is there a way to transform the predicted results so as to make them all positive and still capture the tendency?
