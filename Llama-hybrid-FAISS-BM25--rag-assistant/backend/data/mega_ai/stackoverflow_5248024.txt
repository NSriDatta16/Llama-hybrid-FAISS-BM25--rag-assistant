Passing a ref variable is used to be able to change variable that holds the reference. But since you are not changing the DataContext dbase reference in your GetPByRole method, passing it as a ref is useless and would only confuse other developers. Perhaps you misunderstand value types and reference types. Reference types (such as DataContext ) are always passed by reference, passing it around through method calls will not make new copies of the object itself, merely copies of the reference (which is either a 32 or 64 bits value). You are mixing responsibilities here. Your Product class is an entity, but you seem to be implementing all kind of data retrieval methods on it. This will become a big mess very soon. Give every class in your system a single responsibility. The responsibility of the Person class is to be a person. In other words, what you are trying to to is much more suited for repository classes (or even service classes around that). For instance, create a PersonRepository that holds these methods. The PersonRepository will be able to return new Person instances (in fact a repository should just be the interface between your data source and your application and would normally not implement business related query methods). This way you keep your entities free from knowing the data context (which is a very deliberate design decision of the ADO.NET team while developing Entity Framework).
