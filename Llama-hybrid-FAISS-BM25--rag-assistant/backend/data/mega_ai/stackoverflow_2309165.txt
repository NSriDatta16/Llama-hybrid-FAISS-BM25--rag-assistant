Draggable images on 3D surface

I'm creating 3D program in WPF in C#. I'd like to move images which are place on 3D surface. In my case they're situated on square. The problem is when I try to move the image, other images change their sizes. I tried setting contstraints but it seems that the problem is that images and canvas are placed in 3D. Does anybod have an idea how to get rid of this problem ? Part of wpf code: Methods used for moving imgaes: Point p; Image tmpImg; private void Img_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { tmpImg = sender as Image; Point x = e.GetPosition(ImageHolder); if (e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { Canvas.SetLeft(tmpImg, Canvas.GetLeft(tmpImg) + (x.X - p.X)); Canvas.SetTop(tmpImg, Canvas.GetTop(tmpImg) + (x.Y - p.Y)); } p = x; } private void Img_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { tmpImg = sender as Image; tmpImg.CaptureMouse(); p = e.GetPosition(ImageHolder); } private void Img_MouseUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { tmpImg = sender as Image; tmpImg.ReleaseMouseCapture(); }
