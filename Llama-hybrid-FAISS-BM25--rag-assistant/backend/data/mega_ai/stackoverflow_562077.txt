I started about 10 weeks ago teaching myself WPF, and then in the last 2 weeks I have actually written an application in WPF. I came from ASP.NET and I love WPF. I love the XAML markup, it just makes more sense than dragging items over and making sure they are in the right place in a WinForm. The styling is easier in WPF, you can quickly make a border with rounded corners. Using Expression Blend you can design a really nice interface with animation. I developed a WPF app on Vista (home), and XP (work) and they both look really nice. I have been very pleased with WPF and would not go back to WinForms.
