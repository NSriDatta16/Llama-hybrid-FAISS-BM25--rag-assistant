TagPrefix containing StrongKey

I'm debbuging a web application that has a WebSite and a class library containg web controls. My WebSite, at design-time references the assembly with a Project Reference and Visual Studio automatically populates the Toolbox with the controls found in my class library. The problem is : When I drag them to the ASPx designer, Visual Studio automatically creates a TagPrefix ignoring the my class library's strong key. This is a problem for me because when I publish this website, this class library will be the Global Assembly Cache and it won't be found if the TagPrefix doesn't properly reference it. Any idea about how to force visual studio to consider my assembly's strong key when creating the tag prefix? Thanks.
