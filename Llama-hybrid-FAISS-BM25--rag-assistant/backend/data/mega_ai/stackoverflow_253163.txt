@VonC You might find the International Organisation for Standardization's, "Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing," an interesting read. It defines: "Encapsulation: the property that the information contained in an object is accessible only through interactions at the interfaces supported by the object." I tried to make a case for information hiding's being a critical part of this definition here: http://www.edmundkirwan.com/encap/s2.html Regards, Ed.
