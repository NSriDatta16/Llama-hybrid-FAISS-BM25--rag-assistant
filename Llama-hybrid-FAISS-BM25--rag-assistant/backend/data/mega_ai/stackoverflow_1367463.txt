Join xml files with XmlReader

I am joining 3 xml logfiles with LINQ to XML by id, but when my logfiles become too big, LINQ to XML doesn't work anymore, so i have to use XmlReader. But now I am asking myself how to do this? Should i loop through every document for each id, or is there a more simple elegant solution? Anybody?
