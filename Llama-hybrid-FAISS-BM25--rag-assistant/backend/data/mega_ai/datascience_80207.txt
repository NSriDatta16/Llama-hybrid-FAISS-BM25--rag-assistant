Significance of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Data Science

Can someone please explain to me the role of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Object-Oriented Design (OOD) in Data Science? I am from a non-computer science background. Do I need to learn these as well to become a Data Scientist? Also, please tell me if I should be learning Python or R for the same.
