How big is a Level ? Is it possible you're overflowing your stack? Given that there's (apparently) only ever one Game object anyway, perhaps you'd be better off using the static storage class, as in: static Game g; Edit: If you want to force allocation on the heap, I'd advise using std::vector levels; rather than using pointers directly. Oops -- missed it's being tagged C, not C++.
