Rather than using a hand-coded sitemap, create a sitemap handler that will generate the sitemap on the fly. You can create a method in the handler that will grab pages from an existing navigation sitemap, from the database, or even from a hard-coded list of pages. You can create an XmlDocument from the list, and write the InnerXml of the document out to the handler response stream. Then, create a class with a method that will automatically ping search engines with the above handler's URL (like http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ping?sitemap=http://www.mysite.com/sitemap.ashx ). Whever someone adds a new event, call the above method. This will ping Google using your latest sitemap (freshly generated by the above method). You want to make sure that the ping only works if the sitemap has actually been updated. You could use File.SetLastWriteTime on events.aspx in the AddNewEvent handler to signify that the containing page has been updated. Aslo, be careful to make sure there have been no pings for the last hour (as Google guidelines discourage pinging more than once per hour). I actually plan to implement this in the following OSS project: http://cyclemania.codeplex.com . I will let you know once it's done and you can have a look.
