If you use Z-scores you should first be sure there is no outside standard population for converting them to z-scores. For example, children's height and weight are sometimes converted to z-scores, but researchers use the World Health Organization (WHO) dataset to do this, so the computed Z-score result is where each subject in the researcher's datatset would fall on the WHO distribution, if they were a member of that distribution.
