You can do it easier, using repeaters :) however because of the challange i did the following: //Here lays the dragons A small note: 1st you dont need 3 gridViews to order by depid , you can use : SELECT * FROM Emp Order By depid this can Combine both GridwView1 and GridView2, and to design it, just combine the columns from Gridview1 and 2 like Shown in the solution below. The design of GridView1 Solution: WARNING : This Solution is not simple,and definetly not optimized :) The idea is to do the manipulation before binding the data to the GridViews. The solution If your using 2 GridViews (like i recommended above) on page_load, run the above SQL, and fill it in a Dataset (DS1), Create a table (dt) with the data u filled in DS1 Then create a clone DataTable (dt2) then start a loop through the rows of dt1 1st you record the EmpID as CurrentID loop (foreach row in dt1) throughRowDataBound the rows summing the salary from each row untill CurrentID != ReadID Add a row to the Dataset(DS1) with column "EMPID"'s value = "-54321" //this will be used later to identify the irregular rows// , and the salary = Sum make the sum = 0, Make CurrentID = ReadID Continue the loop; then Bind DS1 To gridView1. ON Event: GridView1_RowCreated you check if the Row being Created has the ID "-54321" (using DataRowView) if it does , u Read the sum into a variable, then Clear , add columns as desired, something like : e.Row.Cells.Clear(); TableCell oCell = new TableCell(); e.Row.Cells.Add(oCell); A similar approach can be used to add the extra row for the Dep salary sum :)
