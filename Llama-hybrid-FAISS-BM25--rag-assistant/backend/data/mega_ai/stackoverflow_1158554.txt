You can get very good information from SO WEB SITE Free code coverage tools What is Code Coverage and how do YOU measure it? Code Coverage is a measurement of how many lines/blocks/arcs of your code are executed while the automated tests are running.CC is collected by using a specialized tool to instrument the binaries to add tracing calls and run a full set of automated tests against the instrumented product. A good CC tools will give you not only the percentage of the code that is executed, but also will allow you to drill into the data and see exactly which lines of code were executed during particular test. Code coverage algorithms were first created to address the problem of assessing a source code by looking directly at the source code. Code coverage belongs to the structural testing category because of the assertions made on the internal parts of the program and not on system outputs. Therefore code coverage aims at finding parts of the code that are not worth testing. http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&ObjectType=ART&ObjectId=7580 alt text http://www.codecoveragetools.com/images/stories/software_lifecycle.jpg Its Good for Functional coverage aiming at finding how many functions or procedures were executed. Statement or line coverage which identifies the number of lines in the source code has been executed. Condition coverage or decision coverage answers the question about the number of loop conditions were executed in the program. Path coverage which focuses on finding all possible paths from a given starting point in the code has been executed. Entry and exit coverage which finds how many functions (C/C++, Java) or procedures (Pascal) were executing from the beginning to the end.
