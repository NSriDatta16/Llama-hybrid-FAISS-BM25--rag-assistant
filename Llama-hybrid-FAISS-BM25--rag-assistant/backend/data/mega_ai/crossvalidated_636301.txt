Two common methods are factor analysis and principal component analysis . (My links go to the tag wikis; you can also scan the questions with each tag). Both of these have been discussed here many times and have lots of details, but, briefly, factor analysis attempts to find latent variables in a large set of variables. A latent factor is a variable that cannot be directly measured. PCA is a pure dimensionality reduction method. It attempts to find linear combinations of variables that capture as much of the variance in the original variables as possible. From your question, it seems to me that FA may be more suitable, as you seem to have some idea of latent variables connected to the prefixes of the variables. There is also partial least squares, which is often more useful when your goal is regression. But you say will have a mixed model. I googled PLS for mixed models and it appears that there aren't well-established methods for this.
