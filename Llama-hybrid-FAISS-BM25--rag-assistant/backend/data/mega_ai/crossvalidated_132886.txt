How many components to use in PCA in order to preserve a certain amount of variance?

I want to reduce the dimensionality of my data with PCA, until it preserves $\alpha = 0.99$ of the variance. How do I decide how many eigenvectors I should use? So I'm looking for a function $f(data, \alpha) = k$ in order to use the first $k$ components of the projected data.
