How can I use rsync to backup files changed within a recent period?

Is it possible to specify a time range so that rsync only operates on recently changed files. I'm writing a script to backup recently added files over SSH and rsync seems like an efficient solution. My problem is that my source directories contain a huge backlog of older files which I have no interest in backing up. The only solution I've come across so far is doing a find with ctime to generate a --files-from file. This works, but I have to deal with some old installations with versions of rsync that don't support --files-from. I'm considering generating --include-from patterns in the same way but would love to find something more elegant.
