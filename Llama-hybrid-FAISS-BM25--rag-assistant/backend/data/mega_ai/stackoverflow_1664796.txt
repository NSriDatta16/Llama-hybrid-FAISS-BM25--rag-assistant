How to write inline assembly in gnu pascal?

Since there is not offical reference,I got only one tutorial gpcasm.zip .But when I try to follow the tut and try the inline assembly example on my debian.The gpc was not happy with it. gnu_asm.pas : In procedure 'MyStupidDelay': gnu_asm.pas:3: error : can't find a register in class AREG while reloading asm Here is the code program gnu_asm; Procedure MyStupidDelay(time : integer); Begin Asm("0 : pushl $0xfffff 1 : decl(%%esp) jnz 1b addl $0x4, %%esp decl %%eax jnz 0b" : : "a" (time) : "eax" ); end; begin write("only for test"); end. Another question,are there any other refernece, tutorials, examples on inline assembly in gnu pascal. Thanks.
