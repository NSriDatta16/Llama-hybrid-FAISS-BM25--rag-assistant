What will cause high accuracy but a big loss?

In the question of What is the relationship between the accuracy and the loss in deep learning? , @Jérémy Blain gave a fantastic interpretation of 'relationship' between accuracy and loss: 1 - low accuracy and big loss means you made huge errors on a lot of data 2 - low accuracy but small loss means you made little errors on a lot of data 3 - high accuracy with small loss means you made low errors on a few data (best case) 4 - high accuracy but a big loss, means you made huge errors on a few data. As I understand, 1 - implies bad algorithm 'in most of time' 2 - implies overfitting 3 - is what we want Questions are: 1 Any other reasons caused 1 and 2? 2 what will lead to case 4 : high accuracy but a big loss?
