It looks like you are trying to do an authorization check ( ). Have you checked out any of the existing comprehensive authorization solutions? It might make sense to leverage the effort of others in solving this common problem. This thread on authorization for rails gives some examples. In particular, with CanCan you could include something like this in the method you are trying to protect: authorize! :read, @company Which says "does the current user have permission to see the details of @company".
