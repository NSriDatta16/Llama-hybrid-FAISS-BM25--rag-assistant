jQuery Draggable + Sortable - How to drag and drop between two scrollable lists

I would like to have two lists, Available Items and Selected Items, whereby Available Items are assigned to Selected Items via drag and drop. I require the Selected Items to be sortable, but not the Available Items. The challenge is that both lists can potentially contain a significant number of items, and therefore need to be scrollable. Here is the jQuery I have thus far: $(function() { $( "#available > li" ).draggable({ revert: 'invalid', connectToSortable: '#selected', containment: '#drag_container' }); $( "#selected" ).sortable({ axis: 'y', placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight' }); }); And the corresponding HTML: Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Item 6 Item 9 Item 10 Item 7 Item 8 Item 9 Item 10 Item 11 Item 12 Item 13 Item 14 Item 15 Item 16 Item 17 Item 18 &nbsp; With the scrollable list requirement, however, I can't get the draggable behaviour to work elegantly (see the demo at http://pastehtml.com/view/1bsk6bt.html ). Once the item being dragged enters the Available Items list, it disappears behind the scrollable frame. I've tried the clone helper, and also tried playing around with containing divs, different overflow options, turning off the scroll option in jQuery, but cannot get it to work properly. I'm sure someone out there has accomplished something like what I'm aiming to do here and can save me some time? :) Any help would be greatly appreciated!
