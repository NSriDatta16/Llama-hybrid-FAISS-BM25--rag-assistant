It all depends on if you're going to have a team help you or not. It'll be simpler to start doing it yourself if you have the time if for no other reason than you can work out how you want to proceed without worrying about politics. For a start, any code used as a framework or a library typically needs to be developed to a much higher standard than what you might write for an internal application. This means you need: Sufficient user and developer docuemtnation; Unit tests with decent coverage; A license; Tagged versions in source control; and Released binaries and source code with checksums. Additionally you'll need a method of: Communicating your project status (release notes, goals, etc); and A means to allow people to raise and track issues. Google Code (as just one example) can do pretty much all of this for you. I would also suggest you register the domain name for your project (typically projectname.org for open source). If the one you want is taken already, you may want to change the project name, particularly as there might be cause for confusion.
