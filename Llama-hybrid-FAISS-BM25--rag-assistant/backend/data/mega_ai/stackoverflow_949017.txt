How can I resolve this link error in Visual Studio (LNK2005)?

I keep having linker errors of the following form: libcmtd.dll msvmrtd.dll some element(ex: _mkdir ) already defined... and I don't know how to resolve them. Here is a complete error message: private: __thiscall type_info::type_info(class type_info const &)" (??0type_info@@AAE@ABV0@@Z) already defined in LIBCMTD.lib(typinfo.obj) MSVCRTD.lib(ti_inst.obj) : error LNK2005: "private: class type_info & __thiscall type_info::operator=(class type_info const &)" (??4type_info@@AAEAAV0@ABV0@@Z) already defined in LIBCMTD.lib(typinfo.obj) Can you help me solve this issue?
