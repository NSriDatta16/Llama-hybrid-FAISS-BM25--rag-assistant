As you found out, using a vanilla conv-net will not perform very well if you need to compare the scale of several objects in the image and predict the label for the largest one. To be honest, even for a human (me), it seems quite difficult to tell which of the digits is largestâ€”that is a good baseline to estimate how difficult a task is. There are multiple ways to perform object detection in such binary images. Actually, the most trivial one would be using graph-based approach identifying connected components (assuming pixels of digits are connected and not touching/overlapping). In case the assumptions don't hold, you can try some of the neural network localization approaches, such as object detectors ( Faster RCNN , Single Shot multibox Detector , YOLO ) and compare the predicted bounding boxes by size, or perhaps have a look at Spatial transformer networks .
