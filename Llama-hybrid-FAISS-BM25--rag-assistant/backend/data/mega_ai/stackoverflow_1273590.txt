You may be able to throw something together by using gdk_window_get_root_origin to get the top left corner of the window and gdk_window_get_geometry to get the width and height. Then you could hook a callback into the GDK_BUTTON_PRESS_MASK and check to see if the button press occurs near/on one of the edges of the window. Of course, this seems quite hackish and it really bothers me that I couldn't find some simple way in the documentation for GdkWindow to do this. There is a gdk_window_begin_resize_drag function which really makes me think there's a cleaner way to do this, but I didn't see anything more obvious than my answer.
