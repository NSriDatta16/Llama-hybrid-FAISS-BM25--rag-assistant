Site visitors can enumerage the ids and simply walk through all the different content pages. This shouldn't be possible, of course. I'm not sure why this should be a problem - people can view a list of all the (public, Googlebot-indexed) pages on a website just by typing site:domain.com into Google, and loop through them should they wish. Changing the unique index you use won't change that. But if you really don't want visitors to access your pages directly, a simple quick-fix is to use POST instead of GET.
