You either do a random walk (or not) with symmetric proposal distributions, or use a fixed asymmetric proposal distribution. According to the answer by David Marx under this question : I suppose you could perform a "pseudo" random walk with an asymmetric distribution which would cause the proposals to drift in the opposite direction of the skew (a left skewed distribution would favor proposals toward the right). This is probably why you observed: The only way I've gotten results from the MCMC to match the results from the closed-form solution is to calculate the acceptance probability from the posterior distribution alone, as you would if the proposal distribution were symmetric. And to calculate ppropos in your code, you should write: ppropos = log(ddirichlet(chain[i,1:3], a)) - log(ddirichlet(proposal, a)) with the assumption that the proposal distribution is $Dir(a)$ and fixed.
