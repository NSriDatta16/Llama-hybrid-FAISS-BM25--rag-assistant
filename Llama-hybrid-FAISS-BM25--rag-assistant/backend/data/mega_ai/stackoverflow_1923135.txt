Unfortunately the ItemsControl control does not expose a reference to this element (in fact, I have a feeling that the ItemsControl doesn't even have access to it itself). Using VisualTreeHelper.GetChild() as suggested in the previous post may work, but it will break if the items control is restyled in such a way that causes the items panel do be nested further down. A slightly less fragile (but still far from perfect) way to get a reference is to get the parent of the container for the first child (assuming that your items control contains at least one item) Panel itemsPanel; if (Items.Count == 0) { itemsPanel = null; } else { var firstContainer = ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex(0); itemsPanel = VisualTreeHelper.GetParent(firstContainer) as Panel; } Note: This only works in SL3 and above since it uses the ItemContainerGenerator property (I believe a work around may exist for SL2)
