SQL Server 2008 Management Studio Activity Monitor

I tried to turn on the Activity Monitor using SQL Server 2008 Management Studio (SSMS) through the options window of the application (Tools | Options | Environment | General | At Startup). I restarted SSMS and I am getting the following message: "This operation does not support connections to Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition version 8.00.2249." I need to be able to monitor the processes and activities inside the database since I am investigating a particular application which takes a lot of time in its database data retrieval access and I am thinking it may be due to some locks or some processes. How do I resolve this? Inputs highly appreciated. Thanks.
