Switch statements are bad?

I recently learned that switch statements are bad in OOP, perticularly from "Clean Code"(p37-39) by Robert Martin. But consider this scene: I'm writing a game server, receiving messages from clients, which contain an integer that indicates player's action, such as move, attack, pick item... etc, there will be more than 30 different actions. When I'm writing code to handle these messages, no metter what solutions I think about, it will have to use switch somewhere. What pattern should I use if not switch statement?
