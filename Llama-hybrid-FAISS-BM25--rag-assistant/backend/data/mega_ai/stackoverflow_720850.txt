I feel your pain with some of the organization issues with ASP.NET websites. I've had similar code to yours on several projects. If you have the choice of your frameworks you might look into ASP.NET MVC. This allows you to have clear separation between the View (Html), the Controllers (All actions and business logic) and the Model (database). That way you have zero code in your codebehind files, it all stays nice and neat in controllers.
