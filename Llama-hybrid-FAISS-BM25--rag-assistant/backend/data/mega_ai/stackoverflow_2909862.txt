Slider does not drag in combination with IsMoveToPointEnabled behaviour

I have IsMoveToPointEnabled on for my Slider, so when I click anywhere on the component the selector moves to my mouse. The problem is if I have this option on and click and hold the mouse down to drag the selector the selector doesn't move. Anyone know how to fix this?
