How do I debug a published XBAP file in VS2010?

I need to debug a full-trust application either by specifying a URL or, ideally, from within the web app I am intending to deploy it to. I've tried the following: Running "PresentationHost.exe -embedding" from the command-line, attaching through Visual Studio. The IDE shows that my breakpoints are valid until I actually attempt to load the .xbap file, at which point it shows that there are no symbols loaded. None of my breakpoints are hit. I've tried "mage -cc" before doing this per several recommendations elsewhere. Hard-coded URL in the project's Debug panel then F5. Alternatively, "PresentationHost.exe -embedding -debug" and attach to process then load the .xbap in IE. Both result in the following error when the page appears: System.ArgumentException: URI formats are not supported. at System.IO.Path.NormalizePath(...) at System.IO.FileStream.Init(...) at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(...) at System.Windows.Interop.ApplicationLauncherXappDebug.GetIdFromManifest(...) at System.Windows.Interop.ApplicationLauncherXappDebug.GetApplicationIdentity() at System.Windows.Interop.ApplicationLauncherXappDebug.Initialize() at System.Windows.Interop.DocObjHost.MS.Internal.AppModel.IBrowserHostServices.Run(...)
