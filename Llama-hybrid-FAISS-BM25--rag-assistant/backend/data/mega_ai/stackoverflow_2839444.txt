jQuery is just a list of (very) useful functions, written in JavaScript. You are just using the library without understanding what's behind it and how things work. Most of the time you will only need jQuery for maybe 20%-40% of your code, and the rest will be pure JavaScript, so I encourage you to learn the basics. These are good places to start with: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref http://howtonode.org/what-is-this http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/the-basics-of-object-oriented-javascript/ http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/
