Just from reading your question, it seems to me you are mixing computational performances and statistical inference. The posterior distribution on the parameters does not have to be symmetric, so this is not an indicator of poor MCMC convergence. My advice is to try your code on simulated data (meaning simulated from the very semiparametric Cox model you are estimating) where you know the values of the parameters, in order to check for convergence: posteriors should cover the true values to some extent. And take comfort in the fact that one hour of simulation at worst wastes one hour of the computer life, not of yours! Edited Answer Thank you for providing the tables. They show that the spread is much wider for the corresponding coefficient when using the variable history than when using the variable test. However, I cannot tell from those tables whether or not this is due to more uncertainty in the posterior: are both variables normalised in the same way? If they are, then indeed the posterior distribution is less precise about the coefficient. Which does not mean you should opt for the model involving test rather than history. This requires model comparison. (I also find curious that the 2.5% posterior quantiles on all coefficients are the sames for Model 1. And the 97.5% posterior quantiles on all coefficients are the sames for Model 2. This hints at some high correlation between the covariates or even lack of identifiability...)
