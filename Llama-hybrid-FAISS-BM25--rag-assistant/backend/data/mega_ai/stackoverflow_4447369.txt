Could some explain this TSQL code for me?

I got the following stored procedure, but I am new to T-SQL and not quite sure about its syntax. Could some explain a little to me? Question: What does the #tmp syntax stand for? Where is the c in c.RootCategoryId defined? Here's the code: ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetAllTopCategories] @prewin7 bit AS SELECT * INTO #tmp FROM dbo.fnGetCategories(@prewin7) SELECT c.RootCategoryId CategoryId, c.CategoryName + ' [' + CAST(g.DiagnosticCount AS nvarchar(max)) + ']' CategoryName, @prewin7 as PreWin7 FROM ( SELECT c.RootCategoryId CategoryId, SUM(c.DiagnosticCount) DiagnosticCount FROM #tmp c GROUP BY c.RootCategoryId ) g INNER JOIN #tmp c ON c.CategoryId = g.CategoryId ORDER BY c.CategoryName DROP TABLE #tmp
