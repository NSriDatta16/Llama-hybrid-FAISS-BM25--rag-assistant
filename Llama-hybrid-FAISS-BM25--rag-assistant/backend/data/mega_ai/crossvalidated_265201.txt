What's the difference between using total and percentages when you calculating correlations?

I have simple question, what is the difference when you use total and percentages when calculating correlation ? For example I want to calculate correlation between Europeans born in USA in each state every year (here I have total amount of people, and percentage of people) and average number of people who change work place every year in each state. So when I use total amount, correlation coefficient is lower than when I am using percentages. So my question is which one I should use ? And can I calculate correlation between average and percentages at all ? I hope you understand my question.
