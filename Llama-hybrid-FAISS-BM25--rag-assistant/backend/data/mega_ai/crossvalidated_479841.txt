Why does the accumulated local effects plot look that way?

I read a blog post about machine learning explainability - https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-model-explainability-in-modern-machine-learning-fc0f22c8c29a It shows as an example this accumulated local effects plots (the y axis is bike rentals): In a previous example they showed the partial dependence plots on the same problem: According to the PDP plot until 25 degress as long as the temprature goes up the bike rentals goes up, so why are the values of the ALE there negative? I thought that the ALE plot should be similar to derivative of the PDP (neglecting the fact that only close examples are taken), but it does not look that way. Why does this plot look that way?
