OpenCV 2.2 PCA and EigenFaces

I just wanted to know if the cv::PCA::PCA constructor method in OpenCV 2.2 makes the substraction of the mean, or if I must pass my data already with the mean subtracted. I tested both ways, but when visualizing eigenfaces neither of them are giving me good results but just a black screen. I have no segmentations faults or errors, I just don't get the eigenfaces visualization as in the papers.
