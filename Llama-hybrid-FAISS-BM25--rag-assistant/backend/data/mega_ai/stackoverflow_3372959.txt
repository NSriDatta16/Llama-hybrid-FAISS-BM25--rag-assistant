I posed this question to a friend, and he suggested: When seeing a 1 for the first time, store it as a new shape. Flood fill it to the right, and add those points to the same shape. Any input pixel that is'nt in a shape now is a new shape. Do the same flood fill. On the next input column, flood again from the original shape points. Add new pixels to the corresponding shape If any flood fill does not add any new pixels for two consecutive columns, you have a completed shape. Move on, and try to determine it's dimensions This then leaves us with getting the dimensions for a shape we isolated (like in example 2). For this, we thought up: If the number of leftmost pixels in the shape is below the average number of pixels per column, then the peice is probably rotated. Thus, find the corners by getting the outermost pixels. Use distance formula between all of them. Largest = hypotenuse, others = width or height. Otherwise, this peice is probably perfectly aligned, so the corners are probably just the topleft most pixel, bottom right most pixel, etc What do you all think?
