Reading line X until line Y from file in C++

I have a relatively simple question. Say I have a file but I only want to access line X of the file until line Y, whats the easiest way of doing that? I know I can read in the lines one by one keeping count, until I reach the lines that I actually need, but is there a better more elegant solution? Thanks.
