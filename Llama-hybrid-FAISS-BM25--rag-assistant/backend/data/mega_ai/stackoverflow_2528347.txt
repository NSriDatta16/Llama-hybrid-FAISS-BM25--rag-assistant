Invoke Java via Batch File with Filepath Arguments

I'm having an issue getting files loaded into an app called GCS, by dragging them onto the executable. GCS can be invoked on Windows with a bat file, which goes like this: @echo off start javaw -Xmx256M -jar "GURPS Character Sheet.app/Contents/Resources/Java/GCS.jar" %* If I hard code a filepath in place of the batch argument wildcard (with quotes), it works. If I run the debugger with a filepath argument it works. If I echo % , it gives me the correct filename with quotes around it. If I add quotes around % it still breaks. I have a disconnect here between the batch file and Java, and I'm at a loss. Does anyone recognize this problem? Thanks in advance.
