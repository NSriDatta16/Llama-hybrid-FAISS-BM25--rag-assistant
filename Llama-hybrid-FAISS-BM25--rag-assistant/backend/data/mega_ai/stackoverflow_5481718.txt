pyqt graphicsitem mouse enter event

I am trying to connect to the mouse-enter event of QGraphicsItems that are placed onto a QGraphicsScene and visualized through a QGraphicsView. From what I understand, the method to override for this is dragEnterEvent in a class derived from QGraphicsItem (or one of it's subclasses). My attempt looks like this: class StaPoly(QtGui.QGraphicsPolygonItem): def __init__(self,*args): QtGui.QGraphicsPolygonItem.__init__(self,*args) self.setAcceptDrops(True) def dragEnterEvent(self,event): print "Enter!" ... def draw(self): p = self.parent self.group = QtGui.QGraphicsItemGroup(scene=p.scene) ... for xpix in lons: poly = QtGui.QPolygonF() poly I hope the above snippets make it clear what I am trying to do. Note that the display is generated exactly as I desire, no issue there - however the polygons that get drawn are not responding to the enter-event - I am not seeing any evidence that dragEnterEvent() is being called.
