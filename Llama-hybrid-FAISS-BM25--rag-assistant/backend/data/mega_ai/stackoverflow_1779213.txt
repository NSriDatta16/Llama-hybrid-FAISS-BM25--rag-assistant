Whatever VCS you use, if you choose versioning on demand instead of automatic versioning (to borrow terms from Alex's post), you will have to go through some ceremony to: -create, -rename, -move, -copy, or -delete a file that is under source control. When you create a new file, you have to Add it to source control before you Commit your changes to the repository. When you rename, move, copy, or delete a file under source control, do so with your VCS client. In TortoiseSVN and TortoiseGit, the move and copy operations are done with a right-click-and-drag, whereas the rename and delete operations are available via a right-click. As you can imagine, changing things like the name of a project can be quite the hassle, hence the case for automatic versioning. Ordinary file edits and any changes to files not under source control, do not require you to tell your VCS client about them. Finally, for one-man projects, I prefer git over SVN because SVN requires at least 2 copies of everything: a repository (the "master" copy of the files and history) and a working copy (the copy you do your work on). With git, the repository and working copy are the same thing, which makes my experience simpler.
