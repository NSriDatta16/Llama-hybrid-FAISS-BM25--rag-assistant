Purging Database Records

I'm dealing with having to store some payment card data. In order to be compliant with PCI DSS regulation, we have to purge the data from discs by not just deleting the file from the storage system, but also writing over the bytes with a random sequence of data to make it harder to recover the data. I would like to be able to leverage a database for my storage needs, (for increased concurrency and simpler querying) however I can't find any way to purge individual records in this fashion. Are there any known techniques for accomplishing this?
