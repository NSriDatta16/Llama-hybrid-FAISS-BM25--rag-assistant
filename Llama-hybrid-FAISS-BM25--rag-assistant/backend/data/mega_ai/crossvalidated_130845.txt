I downloaded your data and ran PCA. It came back with 9 components. Note, that the rank of your matrix is 9, not 10. There's got to be some linear dependencies, which you didn't reveal to us. We don't know what are your columns, maybe some columns are totals of subsets of other columns etc. Anyhow, take look at the charts below. The top one shows the series over time, and the bottom shows 9 PCA components. From the top chart you can see that several series seem to be growing, while a few are stationary. The bottom shart shows that only the first PCA component is growing, and it explains 60% of the variation. The others don't seem to be changing much. You can run statistical tests if you wish, but it's pointless in my opinion given the sample size. You won't be able to squeeze out more information than from the plots. There is no sign of structural break. You will not be able to prove it for overall data set. You may try to go after one or two series, based on the domain knowledge, of course. However, I doubt that you'll get anything. None of the PCA components are obviously breaking here.
