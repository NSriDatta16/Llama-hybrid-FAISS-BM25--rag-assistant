MYSQL : writing a query where a column is the result of a boolean expression

I have a table where i have columns such as: deposit_received paperwork_received preferred_physician preferred_physician_phone One of the views that we use this data involves displaying whether there is any of this data missing. I can arrange this trivially in PHP, but I'd rather do it in MySQL (it leverages a framework's sort by feature if I can do it in MySQL. So essentially, I need to write a query that returns: col1 | col2 | ... | (deposit_received == true && paperwork_received == true && preferred_physician != null && preferred_physician_phone != null) I've looked at some of the functions you can use, but I can't wrap my head around it. Thanks in advance! Rob
