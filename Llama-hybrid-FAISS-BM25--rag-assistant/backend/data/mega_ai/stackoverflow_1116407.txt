I use VisualSVN but I heard since v2.0 AnkhSVN is pretty solid, personally for $49 dollars it is a solution I already bought into and has always been stable. Resharper is a must. Aside from those two VS2008 provides everything I need. On VS2005 I use CoolCommands to get some things like 'Open Folder in Explorer' from solution explorer too. I forget... I use Test-Driven.Net plugin to get the right click 'Reflector' and test coverage with NCoverExplorer for the rare times I use it, and the even more rare times when JetBrains implementation of NUnit via their Test runner doesnt work.
