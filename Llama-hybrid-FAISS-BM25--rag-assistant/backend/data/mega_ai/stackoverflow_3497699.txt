CSV to object model mapping

I have a CSV file that I want to read into a List. Here's an example file: Plant,Material,"Density, Lb/ft3",Storage Location FRED,10000477,64.3008,3300 FRED,10000479,62.612,3275 FRED,10000517,90,3550 FRED,10000517,72,3550 FRED,10000532,90,3550 FRED,10000532,72,3550 FRED,10000550,97,3050 I know I can manually read in the CSV file and build the list using a normal StreamReader, but I was wondering if there was a better way, perhaps using LINQ?
