You can't. In desktop Opera, that is. Some custom ("GOGI"-type) developer builds found on http://labs.opera.com might offer the opera:config#UserPrefs|CustomUser-Agent option where you can specify the entire UA string (the builds that were released a while back are rather old by now). Perhaps you'd be better of with the device SDK tools? Have a look at http://dev.opera.com/sdk/
