Actual difference between the statistic results from scipy.stats.ranksums and scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu

So, I have been trying to test if two independent samples come from the distribution, i.e. if they are greater or less than one another. Eventually I found out the Mann Whitney U Test is the appropriate test for me. I came across scipy similar functions called scipy.stats.ranksums and scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu , which reference the same base theory for comparing independent samples. However, I have looked over the entire internet and could not find why the heck these functions provide distinct results, and unfortunately I was not smart enough to reverse engineer one to the other. I would be very pleased if someone could enlighten me with any answer. Example code: from scipy.stats import ranksums,mannwhitneyu rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42) sample1 = rng.normal(0, 1, 100) sample2 = rng.normal(1, 1, 100) print(ranksums(sample1, sample2,alternative='less')) print(mannwhitneyu(sample1,sample2,alternative='less',use_continuity=False)) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- RanksumsResult(statistic=-7.122478605972594, pvalue=5.300160604890462e-13) MannwhitneyuResult(statistic=2085.0, pvalue=5.300160604890462e-13) code for ranksums: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v1.7.1/scipy/stats/stats.py#L7713-L7787 code for mannwhitneyu: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v1.7.1/scipy/stats/_mannwhitneyu.py#L181-L424 EDIT: I am interested in using the statistic result of the Mann Whitney test as a measure of an AUC-ROC for a machine learning project I have been working on. Only the .mannwhitney() function gives me the desired results and looks like .ranksums() outputs a sort of z-score (like pointed in the results). Still, it would be nice to know why is that.
