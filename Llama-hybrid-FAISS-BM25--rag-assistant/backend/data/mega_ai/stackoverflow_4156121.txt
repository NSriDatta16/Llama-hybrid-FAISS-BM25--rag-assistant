how responsive is the iOS screen?

I'm experimenting with my ipad as a music controller, and finding that there's too much latency with touchesBegan events for it to work well as a responsive-feeling percussion controller. Am I doing something wrong, or is this a limitation of the devices. Which factors effect the amount of time that elapses between my finger touching the screen and the touchesBegan event firing?
