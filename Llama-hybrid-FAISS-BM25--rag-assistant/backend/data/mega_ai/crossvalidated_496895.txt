A cox discrete-time model is itself equivalent to a series of conditional logistic regressions (check this and this links). Therefore, if you have only one time point, or one transition, then a standard binary logistic regression is what you want: Select all those that have "a low risk health profile in wave 3" as your sample. Code your dependent variable the "higher risk health profile in wave 4" as 1 (and zero otherwise). Specify and run a logistic regression.
