One assumption of linear regression is independence of errors. If Y1 is a function of neighbors Y2 and Y3, and Y2 is a function of neighbors Y1 and Y3, then the errors will be correlated. It is possible to use generalized linear regression methods to account for the correlation. It would be difficult to randomize at the subject level to treatment groups since subjects are clustered into neighbors. If you define neighborhoods of several students and randomly allocate treatment to neighborhoods, then the model would include treatment and neighborhood effects as well as a subject effect. This will allow testing of whether the treatment has a significant impact on average sharing between neighbors given the effects of the neighborhood and individual.
