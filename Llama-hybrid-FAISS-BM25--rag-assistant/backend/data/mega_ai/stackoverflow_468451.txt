Firefox 3, IE 7, IE 6 Firefox is the most important primarily because it runs on OSX and Windows and has a high market share which means if your site runs on Firefox it will also be available to mac viewers. Follow this closely with IE 7 which is important because of its browser share and being packaged by Windows means anyone with a new windows box will have it. Unfortunately there are people running older versions of windows (anything before 2000) who cannot update from IE 6 to a more modern browser. This ensures there should be for the next while there should be a lower cap of about 10% of people using IE 6. Realistically there are about 20% average who still user IE 6 and so this indicates that even some with modern operating systems have not upgraded. Safari and Chrome come hand in hand as both working off a similar engine which makes them the next logical step for compatibility tests. Because they both use webkit and safari runs on both windows and mac (as the default browser) Safari is more important to test for by a small margin. Chrome is a logical choice because if you get it on Safari it will work on Chrome and it has a pretty strong start in browser stats for being so new. Opera is completely optional unless you decide that you want to develop a website that must be viewable on a Nintendo Wii. Anyone on a computer who can use Opera is most likely savvy enough to also have another browser installed which they can view your site with. Opera uses its own custom parser and it has low browser share and so there isn't a compelling reason to go to lengths if your site shows well on everything except for Opera. The onus is really on them to make their browser work on your site honestly considering the low numbers and the other stronger browsers. Unfortunately IE 6 and IE 7 both require a filter hack to get opacity to work and IE 6 has many incompatibilities and still requires a box model hack when not in strict mode and has float bugs regardless and so following web standards to the letter isn't an option, but wherever possible if you do follow web standards and use conditional IE comments you will most likely have a site that runs cross browser with minimal headache.
