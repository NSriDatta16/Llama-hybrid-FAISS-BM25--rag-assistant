(1) Focus on siblings. Probability all different: First sibling chooses any of the 12 months, second chooses a different month with probability $11/12,$ third chooses non-repeated month with probability $10/12,$ similarly, probability id $9/12$ for the fourth. So $12(11)(10)(9)/12^4 = 0.5729167.$ Probability of at least one repeat: $1 - P(\text{All different})=0.4270833.$ Using R as a calculator: prod(12:9)/12^4 [1] 0.5729167 1- prod(12:9)/12^4 [1] 0.4270833 (2) Focus on months. Probability all months different: Choose 4 different months in ${12 \choose 4}$ different ways. These can be arranged in $4!$ ways. Total ordered ways of choosing $4$ months without restriction is $12^4.$ So $P(\text{All different}) = \frac{4!{12 \choose 4}}{12^4}= 0.5729167,$ as in part (1). factorial(4)*choose(12,4)/12^4 [1] 0.5729167 $P(\text{At least one repeat}) = 1 - 0.5729167 = 0.4270833.$ (3) Approximation by simulation. In R, the code mos = sample(1:12, 4, rep=T) selects four months at random from among 12 (with replacement). We do this a million times. For each sample of four months, code length(unique(mos)) finds the number $X$ of uniquely different months. Thus, the following simulation which approximates $P(\text{At least one repeat}) \approx 0.427 \pm 0.001.$ set.seed(407) x = replicate( 10^6, length(unique(sample(1:12,4,rep=T))) ) table(x)/10^6 x 1 2 3 4 0.000591 0.044351 0.382570 0.572488 mean(x The vector x is a 'logical' vector with a million elements TRUE or FALSE ; its mean is its proportion of TRUE 's. The average number of different birth months is $E(X) \approx 3.527 \pm 0.001.$ The exact probability that all four siblings are born in the same month is $1/12^3 = 0.0005787037,$ approximated here as $0.000591$ (again accurate to about three decimal places). Here is a histogram of the number of the simulated proportions of the numbers of different birth months. The red circle shows the exact value, obtained above by combinatorial methods.
