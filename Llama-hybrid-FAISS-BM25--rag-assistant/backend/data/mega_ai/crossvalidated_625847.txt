Censored Regression model

I am considering the following censored regression model. I have a question about my R code. Then I obtain likelihood function as follow. 0}\qty[log\phi\qty(\frac{y_i-x_i^T\beta}{\sigma_u})-log(\sigma_u)] + \mathbbm{1}{y_i = 0}log\qty[1-\Phi\qty(\frac{x_i^T\beta}{\sigma_u})]] ]" /> Then i obtain log-likelihood function. ##Data Generation################################################# set.seed(123) n 0, y_star, 0) data 0, 1, 0) log_lik I thought it works well, however, the result does not coinside with the results from censReg package. library(quantreg) rq I am very appriciate if you find my error. Thank you in advance. Chat GPT does not understand Censored Reg, so pls help me.
