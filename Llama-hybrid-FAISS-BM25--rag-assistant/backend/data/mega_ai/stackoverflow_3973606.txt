If the variable does not need to be manipulated by any other functions , keep the variable inside a function with var foo; . Otherwise, if it does need to be accessed and read in multiple scopes , keep it outside. But remember that when you keep it outside, it becomes global. That is, unless you wrap everything in a self executing function, which is the best way: (function() { var president='bush'; function blah() { president='reagan'; } function meh() { president= 'carter'; } document.getElementById('reagan').onclick=blah; document.getElementById('carter').onclick=meh; })(); alert( president ) // undefined The above is perfect for a variable accessed by functions defined inside of that scope. Since there are 2 elements i click to set the president, it makes sense to define it outside both functions because they set the same variable. So, If you are not dealing with multiple functions changing the exact same variable, keep them local to the function.
