The only solution I've heard so far (that should work, although I haven't done it yet, comes from Mook in the Mozilla xulrunner IRC channel: create a temporary batch file, writing in the batch file to call and arguments to pass it. then execute the temporary batch file. e.g psuedocode: f = fopen("temp.bat"); fprintf(f, "other.bat 1 2 3 4 5"); fclose(f); exec("temp.bat"); not very elegant but it should work.
