 from candidate assessments in early 2020. While the company maintained no bias resulted from its use of such technology, Parker conceded it "wasn't worth the concern" to keep. Later that September, Hirevue integrated with Microsoft Teams, allowing for interviews to be offered on the Teams platform to its user base. In October, Hirevue acquired AllyO, a chatbot technology startup. In 2022, Anthony Reynolds succeeded Parker as the company's CEO. In May 2023, Hirevue acquired one of its competitors, Modern Hire. On the acquisition, Reynolds stated that both companies "have a fundamental basis or a foundation in science and I/O [industrial-organizational] psychology." At the time, Hirevue had around 700 clients and 400 employees, while Modern Hire had around 450 and 200, respectively. In January 2024, Reynolds stepped down from his position as CEO and was succeeded by Jeremy Friedman. Reception Hirevue's service has received some criticism from interview candidates and AI researchers, particularly for its analysis of "micro-expressions". Commentary on its perceived drawbacks and potential to incite anxiety in interviewees has also been made. In 2015, Fortune writer Katherine Reynolds Lewis called video interviewing through Hirevue and similar companies a "potentially terrifying innovation." Writing for Business Insider, Kevin Feloni opined that Hirevue's strength is also its "potential weakness", stating "the AI learns from the employee pool hiring managers choose to feed it. It can then be customized to remove certain biases, such as vocal tics, but that is also dependent on human judgment." In 2019, The Washington Post writer Drew Harwell called Hirevue "a powerful gatekeeper for some of America's most prominent employers," as well as "pervasive in some industries", adding that the company was "reshaping how companies assess their workforce â€” and how prospective employees prove their worth." Harwell also noted that the company's prominence led to universities making "special efforts to train students on how to look and speak" to generate optimal results. Meanwhile, companies using Hirevue's service have noted their hiring processes shortening by considerable margins. Bloomberg News' Rebecca Greenfield wrote that "with a video interview, human resources staff members only have to review the answers, and can do so on their own schedule, without having to travel for on-campus recruiting," with all this saving money for companies. CNBC's Tonya Riley wrote that Hirevue and similar companies "boast speed as a key for why more and more recruiters are relying on their services." Harwell cited Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the New York-based research center, the AI Now Institute. Whittaker called Hirevue's AI technology a "profoundly disturbing development", as well as "pseudoscience" and a "license to discriminate." Hirevue's staff has commented on these concerns. Larsen has said candidates interviewing through the company's service are "getting the same shot regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, employment gaps, or college attended." Larsen also called criticism such as Whittaker's uninformed, stating that "most AI researchers have a limited understanding" of worker psychology and behavior. Hirevue's industrial psychologist Nathan Mondragon has also stated that "No single customer hires solely on the algorithm. I would never recommend that." Legal challenges In November 2019, the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission alleging that Hirevue's software caused harm to American workers through its collection of biometric data, bias towards those with different genders, races, sexual orientations and "neurological differences", and its failure to meet standards for artificial intelligence systems set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 2023, a Massachusetts resident filed a lawsuit against CVS Health in federal court alleging that the company utilized Hirev
