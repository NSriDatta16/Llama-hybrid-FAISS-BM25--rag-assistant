Entity Framwework-like ORM NOT for .NET

What I really like about Entity framework is its drag and drop way of making up the whole model layer of your application. You select the tables, it joins them and you're done. If you update the database scheda, right click -> update and you're done again. This seems to me miles ahead the competiting ORMs, like the mess of XML (n)Hibernate requires or the hard-to-update Django Models. Without concentrating on the fact that maybe sometimes more control over the mapping process may be good, are there similar one-click (or one-command) solutions for other (mainly open source like python or php) programming languages or frameworks? Thanks
