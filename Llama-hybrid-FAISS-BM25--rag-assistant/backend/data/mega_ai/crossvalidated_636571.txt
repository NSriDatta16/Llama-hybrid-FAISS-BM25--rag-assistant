Interpreting main effects with dummy coded and continuous predictors in regression

I have a logistic regression predicting probability of a 'yes' response given 'condition' (A,B,C,D; dummy coded, with 'A' as the reference level). This will produce estimates for the following: Response ~ Condition Intercept Condition_B Condition_C Condition_D I believe that Condition_B, Condition_C, Condition_D are the comparisons of these conditions against Condition_A. I believe that Condition_A is the intercept. However, how do I interpret the effects when a continuous predictor (IQ) is added to the model? Response ~ Condition+IQ Intercept Condition_B Condition_C Condition_D IQ Are the condition effects (including the intercept) interpreted as the effect when IQ=0? What is 'IQ' here?
