You already defined $\mu_i$, $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ in your simulation: The $\mu_i$ are the group means, so in your example $\mu_1 = 0$, $\mu_2 = 1/3 * \text{Treatment} = .18$, etc. Since the design is balanced, the grand mean is the average of all group means or, in your case, $\mu = Treatment * 6/3 = Treatment/2 = .275$ $\sigma^2$ is the square of the standard deviation in the rnorm statement so that $\sigma^2 = 1$ in your case.
