Cache Managers in Enterprise Library caching Application block

I have been using asp web cache in all my prior application developments. I am looking into Ent. Lib caching application block which seems pretty interesting. However, I have need some clarifications on how the cache managers work? 1- What is the purpose of having multiple cache managers, is it to partition cahing items ? I am used to have only a single cache manager (similar to ent. lib. default cache manager)? 2- Does each cache manager maps to an individual hash table ? or they are all going to be stored in one hash table? 3- If I only use the Null storage option (no backing store) does it make a difference if I use multiple cache managers? Thanks, Robert B.
