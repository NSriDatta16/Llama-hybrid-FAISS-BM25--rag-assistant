Usually, when extending code not under your control (e.g. Foundation), it's traditional to use a prefix or suffix on the method name to avoid these sorts of collisions. Example from Peter Hosey's perform on main thread category : @interface NSObject (PRHPerformOnMainThread) - (id) performOnMainThread_PRH; @end It's not the most beautiful solution, but if you're worried about fragility it's a good idea.
