Have a look at: Kapelner, A. & Bleich, J. bartMachine: Machine Learning with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees Journal of Statistical Software, 2016, 70, 1â€“40 In their appendix, they have a very clear derivation of the MH step in the BART algorithm. Note that they omit the swap step in their algorithm. Also worth mentioning is: Bayesian additive regression trees and the General BART model Statistics in medicine, Wiley Online Library, 2019, 38, 5048-5069 They provide a nice graphical overview of the BART algorithm, which can be very helpful to understand BART in more detail.
