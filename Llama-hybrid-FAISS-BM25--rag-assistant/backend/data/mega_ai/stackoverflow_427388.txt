The alloca function is not deprecated. However, it is not in POSIX and it is also machine- and compiler-dependent. The Linux man-page for alloca notes that "for certain applications, its use can improve efficiency compared to the use of malloc, and in certain cases it can also simplify memory deallocation in applications that use longjmp() or siglongjmp(). Otherwise, its use is discouraged." The manpage also says that "there is no error indication if the stack frame cannot be extended. However, after a failed allocation, the program is likely to receive a SIGSEGV." The performance of malloc was actually mentioned on the Stackoverflow Podcast #36 . (I know this is not a proper answer to your question, but I thought it might be useful anyway.)
