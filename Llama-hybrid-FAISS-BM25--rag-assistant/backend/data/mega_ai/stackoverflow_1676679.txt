ID:s in URI:s are a part of a good UI if you want your users to be able to walk that road. All URI:s are public anyway, it's up to the responding page to handle the request and base the rendering on some kind of authentication. Transactions and otherwise sensitive material could easily be hidden with a salted + hashed string and stored in another column in your database if you wanted to, but if you're still not validating user input (which in web programming clearly could be "navigating through the URI") you're missing the point. As Greg answered , an order number should probably not be low, but the responsibility of that kind of information handling should not lie within the webpage but within the organization's/your stated values (i.e. you would still be printing out the order number on a written receipt so why hide it in the first place?) With the web being as transparent as it is today, it's hard to find another use of it besides the way it's used to shorten URI:s , i.e. Youtube's video pages and the countless URI-shortening services.
