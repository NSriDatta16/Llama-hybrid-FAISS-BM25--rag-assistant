In C# / .NET, it is probably as easy as: using System.Drawing; using System.Drawing.Imaging; using (var tiff = new Bitmap("my_tiff_file.tif")) { tiff.Save("output.jpg", ImageFormat.Jpeg); } If for some reason System.Drawing.Imaging won't read your TIFF files, check out an open-source project called ImageMagick , which will read and write just about any image format imaginable. Worst case scenario you'll need to call ImageMagick's convert.exe via Process.Start() in .NET - not elegant, but it does work.
