Xml Deserialization - Sequence of Mutiple Types

Given the following fragment where links is a sequence of unbounded imagelinks and documentlinks, what should the deserailized class be? http://# http://# http://# Typically, if it was just an array of imagelinks I might have public class Values { public imagelink[] ImageLinks { get; set; } } public class ImageLink { public string Value { get; set; } } But with the above xml I'm stumped. Btw, I have no control over the xml.
