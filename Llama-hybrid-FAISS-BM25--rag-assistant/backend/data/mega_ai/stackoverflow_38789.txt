Web Service Namespace Dynamic Naming

I have a web-service that I will be deploying to dev, staging and production. Along with this will be an ASP.net application that will be deploying separately but also in those three stages. What is the most pragmatic way to change the following line in the web-service to match the current environment? [WebService(Namespace = "http://dev.mycompany.com/MyAppsWebService")] [WebService(Namespace = "http://stage.mycompany.com/MyAppsWebService")] [WebService(Namespace = "http://mycompany.com/MyAppsWebService")]
