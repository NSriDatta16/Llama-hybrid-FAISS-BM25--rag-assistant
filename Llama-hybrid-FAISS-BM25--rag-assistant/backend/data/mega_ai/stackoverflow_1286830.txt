If you by short term mean a month or two I think the answer is yes. How? When I need to make changes to my own code that I haven't touched for perhaps just a few weeks, or to code that somebody else in the team wrote, I feel a lot more confident if there are unit tests and the code coverage is good. If there were no tests I would be more inclined to patch, work-around and generally avoid touching the main algorithm. Do that a couple of times and the code becomes incomprehensible. Scenario: Project meeting Product owner: "We need to make a change to X and add the Y feature. Is it doable?". Team: "It would be better to wait for Joe to come back. He wrote that code." A few weeks later.. Joe: "Sure, it can be done but considering all the testing that went into that module it's not a quick fix". Product owner: "Oh. So.. let's postpone that change for while..." I'm not sure whether I'm answering your question. It really depends on how short the short term is. ;-)
