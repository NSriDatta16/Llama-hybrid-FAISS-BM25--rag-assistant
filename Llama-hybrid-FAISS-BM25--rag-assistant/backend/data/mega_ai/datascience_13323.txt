Minimum number of trees for Random Forest classifier

I am searching for a theoretical or experimental estimation of the lower bound for the number of trees in a Random Forest classifier. I usually test different combinations and select the one that (using cross-validation) provides the median best result. However, I think that there may be a lower bound on the number of trees to use, given $m$ observations and $n$ features, to reduce the variance contribution to the error. Is there some test or reference I may check to correctly tune my classifier?
