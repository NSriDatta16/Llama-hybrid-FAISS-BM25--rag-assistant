Well, first of all, I have a hunch that drag&drop is going to get a lot easier with Surface soon, so I wouldn't spend too much time fretting over an additonal element. But treating this more as a general question - You wouldn't necessarily have to add a visual element just to do the hittest, but hittesting is still going to be the best way to determine if there is a particular element at a given point. The sample you're talking didn't just add the ellipse for hittesting, it was also serving as the background of the 'pod'. So they only wanted to handle the drop when the contact was over that ellipse, because that ellipse defined the boundaries. Another route might be to set the background of your scatterview, and do the hittest against that control. Then, if you wanted to change the boundaries of the 'pod' to something other than a rectangle, you'd want to apply a clipping path to the scatterview.
