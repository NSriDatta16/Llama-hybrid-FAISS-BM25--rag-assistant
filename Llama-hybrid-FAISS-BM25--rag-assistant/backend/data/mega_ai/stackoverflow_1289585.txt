What is apache's maximum url length?

What is the maximum length of a URL in apache? Where is it documented, and is it configurable? I'm implementing an openid identity provider, and would like to know the limitations I'm up against. I know about the 2048 byte path limit on Internet Explorer. That can be handled specially using user agent detection. Other browsers have much higher URL limits. So what I'm interested in is apache server limits when coding an application.
