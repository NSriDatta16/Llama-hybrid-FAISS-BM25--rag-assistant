A suggestion for using fix-effect in panel data with categorical dependent variable in R

Currently, I'm analyzing data of concerts over 30 years which covers 10 rock bands in R. In doing so, I'm planning to run a logistic regression with fix-effects and clustered standard errors like: model where my dependent variable is a dummy variable, and band.name and year (fix-effect part) are factor variables. When I search on google if I'm right, I found some econometricians and statisticians calling this procedure end up in bias so that one should apply conditional logit in the case like this. Can someone kindly give me a comment if the result of my original code is biased and suggest a solution? Thank you.
