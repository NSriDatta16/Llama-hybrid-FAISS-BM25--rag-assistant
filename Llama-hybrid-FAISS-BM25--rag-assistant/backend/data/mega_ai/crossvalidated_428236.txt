You can do whatever you want to simulate data. It's your data. If you have values between 0 and 1, you can choose to treat them as probabilities and generate a Bernoulli (0/1) variable using them. You could do this regardless of how you got those probabilities. That said, the data-generating model does not correspond to a logistic regression model, so attempting to fit a logistic regression model on $X_1$ , $X_2$ , and $X_3$ will not allow you to recover the true model. If you fit a logistic regression model on $e^{X_1+X_2}$ , $X_3$ , and $\epsilon$ , you would recover the true model (note that fitting a logistic regression model on just $e^{X_1+X_2}$ and $X_3$ will not recover the true model because of noncollapsibility).
