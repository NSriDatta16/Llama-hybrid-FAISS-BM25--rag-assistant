How to use CNN for labelling images

I have theorical question that I couldnt decide how to approach. I have tons of grayscaled shape pictures and my goal is seperate these images to good printed and bad printed. For this, I look at roughness of images because some of those is corrupted while printing (e.g I expected triangle shape but I saw some corruption in its edges. So its bad printed). Should I train my model to give each of them spesific label names (like good_printed_triangle, bad_printed_triangle, good_printed_square etc.) or just good and bad is ok? I was thinking about second option but how can CNN find correlation between different shapes, it makes me confuse. I am open for all ideas and thank you in advance.
