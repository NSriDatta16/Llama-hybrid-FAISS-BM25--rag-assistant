Grails beginner problem "Failed to invoke Servlet 2.5"

[UPDATE] Apparently I'm not the only one with this problem - http://grails.1312388.n4.nabble.com/Beginner-ERROR-Failed-to-invoke-Servlet-2-5-getContextPath-method-td2222279.html . It has also appeared on a Windows machine and in the Netbeans IDE on OS X. At this point, the part that has me particularly perplexed, is I can run my Grails apps just fine from within Eclipse, but the second I try to run them from the Terminal they bomb. As far as I can tell, they are both being run from the grails-core directory, so why would it work from within Eclipse but not from the Terminal? [/UPDATE] I'm trying to get Grails set up on a Snow Leopard machine. I followed all the grails.com install directions and am trying to start the application from Grails: A Quick-Start Guide by Dave Klein. I ran grails create-app TekDays with no apparent problems and was able to cd to the TekDays folder, but when I try to run grails run-app I get the following: Welcome to Grails 1.3.1 - http://grails.org/ Licensed under Apache Standard License 2.0 Grails home is set to: /grails Base Directory: /apps/TekDays Resolving dependencies...

Any advice to help me resolve this would be very much appreciated!
