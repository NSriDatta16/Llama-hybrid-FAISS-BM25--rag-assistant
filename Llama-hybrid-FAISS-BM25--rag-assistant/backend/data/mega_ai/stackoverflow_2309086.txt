(moving this from a comment to an answer) It's probably not that you are doing anything wrong, it's probably just that this class is fishy. The $curl = 'c:/...'; // linux line doesn't instill a lot of confidence. This also seems to be reverse-engineering the messenger protocol, which is a very fragile thing to do. There seems to be an official API, which you should be using instead: http://dev.live.com/contacts/
