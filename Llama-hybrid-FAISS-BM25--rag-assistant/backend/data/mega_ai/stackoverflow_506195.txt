Win32 API For Shutting Down Another Process Elegantly?

I'm looking for a way to shutdown a windows app from another. Is there a way to do this? Ideally I'd like something that basically mimics an ALT-F4, or pressing the 'X' in the top right corner or some such. Alternatively, is there an application out there that does this already? tskill is a bit too harsh for what I have in mind.
