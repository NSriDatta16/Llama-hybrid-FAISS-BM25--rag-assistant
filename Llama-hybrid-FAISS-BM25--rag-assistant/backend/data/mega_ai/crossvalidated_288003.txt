How to measure bias variance trade-off

I got these results after fitting a model: In the above picture X axis shows the fitted values and Y axis shows the truth values. We can see bias although I tuned reg_alpha & reg_lambda (i used XGBoost and also tuned learning_rate , n_estimators , max_depth , min_child_weight , gamma=0.1 , etc.) So how to measure bias? Is this small or large bias? Or can we use the model or try tuning the parameters again?
