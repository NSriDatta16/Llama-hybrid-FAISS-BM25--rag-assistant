If the squared residuals/errors of your time series model exhibit autocorrelation, then ARCH effects are present. A quick google search offers a clear definition: A time series exhibiting conditional heteroscedasticity—or autocorrelation in the squared series—is said to have autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) effects. Engle's ARCH test is a Lagrange multiplier test to assess the significance of ARCH effects Source: https://www.mathworks.com/help/econ/engles-arch-test.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com
