In CFA, you must impose some constraint upon each separate factor in order to make the factor model statistically identified. Fixing a loading to 1 is one way. Another is to fix the factor variance to 1. A third, called "effects coding," constrains the average loading per factor to 1 without fixing any loading to a given value. These constraints are often arbitrary and cosmetic, but they can become substantive when a model has across-factor constraints, as when loadings for different factors are constrained to equality. Fixing a loading to 1, or fixing the factor variance to 1, can create problems in multiple group analysis. Fixing a loading can create a problem when trying to determine if measurement invariance holds, because the observed variable with the constrained loading may not itself demonstrate invariance. Fixing factor variance to 1 creates a potential problem simply because this standardization is done within-group rather than across groups. Within-group standardization (dividing by the within-group estimated standard deviation) can conceal differences (or create differences) across groups, because it obscures the uncertainty associated with those estimates. On the other hand, if you are treating your observed variables as ordinal rather than continuous, then the changed nature of the factor model may reduce your options and force you to adopt one method or another.
