stubs, dynamic homepage in cakePHP

I'm working on a site for a client that wants to be able to update modifying their content. The brief was to allow them to edit pages, but not create or delete them. For the site I decided to work with cakePHP, as I've heard good things. First up, a quick explanation of my setup. I've got a single table, called 'contents', in which i'm storing each page's content. The table has a pid, a varchar 'title', a varchar 'slug' and a longtext 'body'. They're all pretty self explanitory, Each page will have it's own row, and body will be a simple HTML dump. I've got two situations that I am having trouble with. Firstly, is setting the homepage. Cake's default is the page based on home.ctp, but that is static. Currently the page I was as the homepage is at localhost/alc/contents/view/2. I understand this is something to do with the routing, but most examples out there give half the solution, when I need every detail :P The second problems is the slugs of the pages. Each page is currently under /contents/view/ id , and i'd like this to be the slug in the database instead. Each time i try to change this (i.e. modify the view link in my index), I get an error rather than the page's content. Any help on this would be appreciated, as there are the two things I cannot seem to grasp properly. Thanks! By the way, you can view the site at http://www.roberttilt.name/web-dev/ALC_proto/
