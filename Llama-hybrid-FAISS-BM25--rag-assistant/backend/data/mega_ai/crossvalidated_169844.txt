Should one use a censored survival model when an event is only observed at death?

A colleague of mine is trying to estimate how neutron radiation exposure changes cancer incidence rates (in mice). He has autopsy data that reports whether a cancer was observed at the time of death, but we do not know what time the cancer first appeared. I argue that he should use a survival analysis with censoring to adjust for the fact that neutron radiation exposure reduces lifespan. But he argues that he can't apply a survival analysis because we don't know when the cancer first appeared, only that it was observed at the autopsy. Instead he thinks we should use a basic logistic regression and ignore lifespan. Who's approach is better?
