Wavemaker is an IDE that uses dojo on the front end, along with ajax and java or else amazon cloud hosting on the backend: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavemaker http://www.wavemaker.com/ Qooxdoo is an alternative to dojo that is more desktop-like and had some designers, but I don't know how up to date they are: http://qooxdoo.org/ and designers: http://qxtransformer.org/ http://qooxdoo-contrib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qooxdoo-contrib/trunk/qooxdoo-contrib/qooxit/ QT Designer is a great visual designer for desktop applications, and this tool can convert the files to javascript: http://code.google.com/p/jsqt/ For mobile development, there is Ext Designer but it costs money: http://www.sencha.com/products/designer/ The most visual studio-like option out there that works in the browser is some framework from china I think called jslinb, it uses its own javascript framework: http://www.linb.net/ See this demo of their IDE for example: http://www.linb.net/VisualJS/UIBuilder.html And if you go with YUI instead of dojo, one IDE-like demo is WireIt: http://neyric.github.com/wireit/
