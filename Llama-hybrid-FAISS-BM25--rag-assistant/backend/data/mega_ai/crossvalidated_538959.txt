If you start with a uniform prior over the support of the parameter, you get the normalized likelihood back as the posterior (I'm going to restrict my attention to cases where the likelihood can be normalized to a density). So if you start with some $\theta$ with support on $(0,1)$ and a likelihood that's proportional to a $B(\alpha,\beta)$ (for some $\alpha$ and $\beta$ say), then the posterior is that same beta distribution ( $B(\alpha,\beta)$ ) back, naturally. [Note that my $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are slightly different from yours. You didn't specify your binomial, doing so would probably simplify the discussion a little, but it's okay as is.] If you replace that uniform prior with a "shorter" contiguous uniform one (i.e. whose support is wholly contained in the first one), you simply get a truncated version of the same $B(\alpha,\beta)$ posterior, where it's truncated to the support of the new prior. The same idea applies to whatever other likelihood you might have. (This is straightforward if you work with indicator notation.)
