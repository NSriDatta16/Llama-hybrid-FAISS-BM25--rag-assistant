Generating samples from Gibbs sampling

I am quite new to sampling. I am doing Gibbs sampling for a Bayesian network. I am aware about the algorithm for the Gibbs sampling but there's one thing I am not able to understand. For example let's assume you have 3 variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$ means you need to generate sample of the form $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. And suppose that all three parameters can take 3 values 0,1 or 2. Now, let's take initial value of the sample as (2,1,1) and compute the $\mathbb P(x_1=0 | x_2=1,x_3=1)$, $\mathbb P(x_1=1 |x_2=1,x_3=1)$ and $\mathbb P(x_1=2 |x_2=1,x_3=1)$. Now, I am selecting the largest probability among these 3 and assigning that value to $x_1$ and using it for the next sample. I want to ask if this method for generating model is correct or I am doing something wrong.
