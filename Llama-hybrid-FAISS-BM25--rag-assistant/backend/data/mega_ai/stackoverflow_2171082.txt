In which order Rails does the DB queries

In Select n objects randomly with condition in Rails Anurag kindly proposed this answer to randomly select n posts with votes >= x Post.all(:conditions => ["votes >= ?", x], :order => "rand()", :limit => n) my concern is that the number of posts that have more than x votes is very big. what is the order the DB apply this criteria to the query? Does it (a) select n posts with votes > x and then randomises it? or (b) select all posts with votes > x and then randomises and then selects the n first posts? (c) other?
