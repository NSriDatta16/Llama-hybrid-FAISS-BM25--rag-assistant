Take a step back, and look at your approach. "I know what I want the answer to be, but I can't find any evidence to support it." Despite the fact that Python is my current first choice language, I am afraid I find myself on the side of your boss! Sorry. I think you should open your mind and consider all the options from the stance of your organisation's best interest, and see if you don't come to a different conclusion about the best language. There are many factors in the choice of language, and how pretty it is is a fairly minor one. The availability of staff is a key one. The cost of retraining, availability of the libraries and meta-tools, performance, etc. etc. Once you have taken into consideration all the different factors (and not just "Oooh! It'd be fun!") and made a balanced assessment (rather than a predetermined answer), you may find that your boss is more willing to listen. p.s. The suggestion to secretly use Python for work code, and leaving the company with a terrible code debt in a language they are not prepared for seems very unprofessional to me.
