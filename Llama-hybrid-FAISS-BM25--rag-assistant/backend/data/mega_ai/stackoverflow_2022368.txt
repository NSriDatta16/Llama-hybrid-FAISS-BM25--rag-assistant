A user's login status is stored using sessions. As far as I can tell from comparing trunk to the 0.96 source, the sessions are committed to a cookie the same way, and auth stores the user ID and backend the same way, so as long as the two apps use the same session storage and are on the same domain, it should work. (Just to be safe, I wouldn't use secure cookies in case the backend logic has changed - I didn't check out that part.) However, 0.96 did not feature pluggable session stores like modern Django does. Probably, to get a current version of Django to work with your 0.96 sessions, you would need to write a session backend for the current Django that connects to the 0.96 database and manipulates the sessions there. I'm not sure how well that would work, though.
