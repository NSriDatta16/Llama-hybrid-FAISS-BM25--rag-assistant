I don't think this should happen; I'd be interested in seeing your code. There are two places to look for the change: the model's fit and predictions, and the production of the ROC curve. For an SVM, I would expect the separating plane to be the same after swapping labels. And then the distance from the plane (which is probably used as the basis for confidence measures in the ROC definition) would just swap sign. A quick test with a nonlinear kernel suggests the same result, but I'm not as sure about it. Assuming the model's rank-ordering hasn't changed, the ROC should just be mirrored along the diagonal $y=1-x$ , and so the AUC shouldn't change.
