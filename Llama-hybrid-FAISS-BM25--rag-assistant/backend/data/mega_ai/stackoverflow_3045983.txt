First, binary files can be opened! Don't be scared of it, you need just the right tools! Being binary data, a text editor is not the right tool of course; a right tool could be a hex editor, or an advanced editor like emacs, or a tool that instead of simply "outputting" bytes in their "hex" representation and letting you alone with your interpretation of the data, knows that particular format and "interprets" the data properly, at some level (e.g. GIMP interprets a PNG file as an image and shows it, a PNG analyser will "decompose" the data inside PNG sections showing telling you the flags in certain bytes, ...etc). In your case, the general answer is that the object file contains your compiled code (and data), plus all extra informations needed by the linker, and eventually more. How these informantions are "organized" and in some case in what the "eventually more" consists, it depends on the specific object format. Some wikipedia links listing some of the possibilities are this , this , this , this ... Each of these may have its tools to analyse the content; e.g. readelf for ELF, objdump for several formats (try objdump -i ) depending on how it was compiled.
