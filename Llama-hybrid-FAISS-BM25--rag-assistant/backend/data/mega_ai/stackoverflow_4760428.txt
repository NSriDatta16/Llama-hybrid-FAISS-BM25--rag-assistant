How can I make Vim's `J` and `gq` commands use one space after a period?

When I use Vim's J command, most lines are joined with a single space for padding. But after a period Vim always uses two spaces. Take the following example: This ends with a comma, but this ends with a period. Join with 'J' and what do you get? For me, the result is: This ends with a comma, but this ends with a period. Join with 'J' and what do you get? One space after the comma, two after the period. Same story if you reformat the paragraph with the gq command. Is there a setting that I can modify to make Vim use only one space after the period?
