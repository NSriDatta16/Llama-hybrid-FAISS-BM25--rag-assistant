Test three-way correlation

I'm working on Gaze in Turns in conversation. The kind of data is illustrated here: df I know that Turns in Dyads (2 ppl talking) are on average longer than Turns in Triads (3 ppl talking). I also know that Gaze durations are longer in Dyads than in Triads: df %>% group_by(N_p) %>% summarise(Turn_dur_mean = mean(Turn_dur), Gaze_dur_mean = mean(Gaze_dur)) # A tibble: 2 Ã— 3 N_p Turn_dur_mean Gaze_dur_mean 1 2 222. 158. 2 3 120 47.5 How can I test the hypothesis that Gazes are shorter in Triads than Dyads because Turns are shorter in Triads than Dyads ? I would think that one step forward toward answering that question might be by computing the porportional duration of Gaze_dur against Turn_dur : df %>% mutate(Gaze_dur_prop = Gaze_dur / Turn_dur) Gaze_dur N_p Turn_dur Gaze_dur_prop 1 25 3 100 0.2500000 2 35 3 120 0.2916667 3 75 3 150 0.5000000 4 55 3 110 0.5000000 5 150 2 200 0.7500000 6 120 2 230 0.5217391 7 170 2 210 0.8095238 8 190 2 250 0.7600000 But to proceed from there (if that's the right first step at all)? What's the appropriate statistical test?
