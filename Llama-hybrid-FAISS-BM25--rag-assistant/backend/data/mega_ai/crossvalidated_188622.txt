Logistic Regression as an adjunct to Survival Analysis

As I understand it, survival analysis was created for situations where, if we followed everyone indefinitely, everyone reaches the "event" (death). Let's say that this isn't one of those situations - not everyone will get to the "event", but time still increases the likelihood that they'll get to the "event". In this situation, is there a better tool to use? Specifically, I was thinking about using logistic regression where the dependent variable is the "event" (yes/no). But I want to include time in the model. I have the unique entry date of each participant and the date when the study stopped collecting data on everyone, and from that I can make a variable for the time that they were in the study. Is there a reason why I can't just include this variable as one of my many independent variables when constructing my logistic regression model? Would that not account for the influence of time (which increases the likelihood of the event, but does not guarantee it by any means)? Is there something I'm missing? It's a solution that seems really obvious but I couldn't find anything on it - so I'm assuming there's a good reason why no one does this. It seems to good to be true because it actually allows me to use the entire data set. Keep in mind that this is still a situation where I will use survival analysis for the short-term analysis, but I'd like to complement it with a "long-view" using something else that doesn't cause me to lose 60% of my data. Thanks for your time and any help you throw my way!
