Digits Localization on Streets View House Numbersm

I am trying to learn a bit of deep learning playing with the Street View House Numbers data set. I have managed to recognize sequences of digits and I'd like now to train a CNN to localize digits and provide boxes coordinates. The problem is that I have the boxes coordinates related to the original image sizes which are always different. I have to resize the images in order to have homogenous input for the NN but I don't know hot to transform the boxes coordinates coherently.
