I do not have MSVS 2010 to look at, so take this with a grain of salt. If the symbols have imp in the name, that means either there's a declspec(dllimport) floating around somewhere, a (possibly embedded in the code) compiler switch forcing A to see B as a DLL or you're linking old stuff and not what's currently being produced by the build process. Was the project you're using imported from an older version of MSVS? I had a similar problem with a poorly managed project that was imported into MSVS 2008 a few years ago... Either way, check A's build environment carefully and make sure you look for pragmas that embed compiler/linker switches.
