A simple solution would be to use something like DropBox. You can see how I use it for my PowerShell Scripts here: http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/?p=1963 You can get a DropBox account with 2GB of free space http://db.tt/1DID1mR . 2GB, in my opinion, is more than enough for simple scripts. There are also other choices in the market. However, I recommend DropBox. The free account supports restoring 30 days old file versions.
