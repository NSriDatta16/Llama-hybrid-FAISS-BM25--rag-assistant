How to know whether enough memory is free to deploy a new application on a Linux machine?

I have got a Linux machine whose memory snapshot (according to /proc/meminfo ) is as follows: MemTotal: 16413388 kB MemFree: 48296 kB Buffers: 193600 kB Cached: 1986448 kB SwapCached: 874512 kB Active: 15034264 kB Inactive: 713672 kB HighTotal: 0 kB HighFree: 0 kB LowTotal: 16413388 kB LowFree: 48296 kB SwapTotal: 8385920 kB SwapFree: 4682408 kB Dirty: 3124 kB Writeback: 0 kB Mapped: 13005560 kB Slab: 257784 kB CommitLimit: 16592612 kB Committed_AS: 59624324 kB PageTables: 233748 kB VmallocTotal: 536870911 kB VmallocUsed: 267064 kB VmallocChunk: 536603555 kB HugePages_Total: 0 HugePages_Free: 0 Hugepagesize: 2048 kB This is a 16 GB-machine, and I have a Java application to deploy on it, which will use 3 JVM instances whose typical combined memory requirement will be close to 1 GB. How can I make sure that it will be safe to deploy the said application without affecting other applications currently running on that machine. Is it possible to find that out from the above memory snapshot? What other statistics may help me to decide that, and how can I collect those statistics?
