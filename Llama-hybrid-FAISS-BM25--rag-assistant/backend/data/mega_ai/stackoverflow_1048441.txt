The Eclipse downloads you mentioned are all good candidates. I use the Ganymede (3.4) version but plan to try Galileo (3.5) soon as it is finished now (thanks @Vinegar ). I have also good experience with the non-free MyEclipse and I'm sure, Netbeans and Intellij have similarly good support for J2EE along with potential JBoss/Seam support. You could test your installment by creating a JSP and check if you get syntax highlight for HTML and java snipplets.
