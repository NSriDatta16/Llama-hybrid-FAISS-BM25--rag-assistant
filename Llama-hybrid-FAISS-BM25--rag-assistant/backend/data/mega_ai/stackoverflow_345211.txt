According to a Google spokesman : "We have very high internal metrics our consumer products have to meet before coming out of beta. Our teams continue to work to improve these products and provide users with an even better experience. We believe beta has a different meaning when applied to applications on the Web, where people expect continual improvements in a product. On the Web, you don't have to wait for the next version to be on the shelf or an update to become available. Improvements are rolled out as they're developed. Rather than the packaged, stagnant software of decades past, we're moving to a world of regular updates and constant feature refinement where applications live in the cloud." Wikipedia defines Beta Version as: A 'beta version' is the first version released outside the organization or community that develops the software, for the purpose of evaluation or real-world black/grey-box testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release. Beta level software generally includes all features, but may also include known issues and bugs of a less serious variety. So this confirms that Google's use of the word is non-standard. I found this Slashdot article, Has Google Redefined Beta? , to be pretty interesting. I think Google borrowed the word for their own ends and it shouldn't be taken at face value with the traditional definition of "Beta". It simply looks better to put "Beta" by your apps name instead of, "We are still constantly adding features to this product".
