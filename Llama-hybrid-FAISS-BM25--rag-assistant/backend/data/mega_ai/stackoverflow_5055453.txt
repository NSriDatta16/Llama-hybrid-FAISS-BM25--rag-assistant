All FFTs will do pretty much the same thing given the same data. The FFT parameters you can vary are the scale factor, the length of the FFT (longer will give you higher frequency resolution, shorter will give you better time response), and (pre)windowing the data, which will cause less "splatter" or spectral leakage of spectral peaks. You can zero-pad an FFT for interpolating smoother looking results. You can average the magnitude results of several successive FFTs to reduce the noise floor. You can also use a scaling function such a log scaling (or log log, e.g. log on both axis) for presenting the FFT magnitude results. The phase of a complex FFT is usually unimportant for any visualization unless you are doing some type of phase vocoder analysis+resynthesis.
