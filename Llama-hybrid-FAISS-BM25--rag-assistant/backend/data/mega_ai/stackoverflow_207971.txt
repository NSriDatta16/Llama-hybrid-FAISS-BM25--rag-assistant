How do I extract a 2D slice from 3D geometry from plane intersection?

Recently our team was facing the task to build the 2D slice between a plane and some set of 3D geometry (set of triangles). Google hasn't been as helpful as we have wanted it to be, so we turn our attention here to see if anyone has encountered this problem with a possible solution. Links are also wanted. Finding the intersection points in itself isn't a hard task, but ensuring triangles being generated correctly with correct corner composition is playing a hard game with us. We simply lack the math/understanding of how triangle construction from an arbirtrary model is done. If you have problems understanding what we're trying to do, imagine this scenario: A bunny model is loaded into the program. Next a "laser" travels across space, cutting the bunny in half. That thin slice that the laser cut is the slice we want to generate. It should be a 2D triangle set. If laser doesn't cut it for you (no pun intended), think knife, plane, anything that slices something across a plane. Thanks in advance.
