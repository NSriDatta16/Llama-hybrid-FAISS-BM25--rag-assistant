Why does the inclusion of an intercept in my logistic regression cause my $R^2$ to decrease dramatically

I am running a logistic regression in order to determine the error rate of an outcome given some covariates. Two of my covariates are indicator flags for the location. When I include an intercept, one of the location flags is dropped which I understand. What I do not understand is that my $R^2$ also drops from around 0.82 to around 0.06. My parameter estimates do not change at all apart from the remaining location flag, and my intercept takes the value of the location flag that was removed. Essentially, $$ logit(Y_i = 1) = \mathbf{\beta X} + \gamma_1i_1 + \gamma_2i_2 $$ has an $R^2$ of around 0.82, while $$ logit(Y_i = 1) = \beta_0 + \mathbf{\beta X} + \gamma_1i_1 $$ has an $R^2$ of around 0.06
