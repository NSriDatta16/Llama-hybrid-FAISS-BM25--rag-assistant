I don't think there's an easy way to do this with simple queries. You could probably do it with a mysql stored procedure, or to save some development time do it in php. If the pool of questions isn't something extremely large, and this isn't something that happens too frequently, you should be ok with the 4 separate queries (one for each q_type), or even with getting the entire question set into php and then playing around with it to get 4 random questions, one in each q_type. With the following (untested) code you'll be getting all questions ordered randomly and loop through them to get the first question for each q_type, then stop. It's not the most elegant solution but, again, for small enough data sets and frequency it should be ok. $questions = array() ; $res = mysql_query('SELECT * FROM questions ORDER BY RAND()') ; while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($res)) { //if we have all 4, stop if (count($questions) == 4) { break ; } $currType = $row['q_type'] ; $currQuestion = $row['questionTitle'] ; if (isset($questions[$currType])) { //already have it, continue to the next continue ; } $questions[$currType] = $currQuestion ; }
