Is the average of residuals zero in a parabolic regression?

This post answers for when you fit your data with a line, but my teacher's notes at university claim that the mean of residuals is zero for all linear (in its parameters) models, such as the parabolic model, while no proof is given for this general case. Wikipedia seems to agree that linear regression is just lines and does not include parabolas (my teacher mixes up linear and linear in its parameters...)
