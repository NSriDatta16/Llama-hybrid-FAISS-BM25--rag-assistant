UISpliviewcontroller in recursive calls fail after a memory warning

Any help is appreciated ! It's several days I'm fighting w/o results. The scenario: I and iPad application have a SplitViewController that shows 2 controllersViews (Root on the left e Detail on the right) The Root allows a recursive navigation (tree that could be several drilldown levels) and I'm calling every time the same controller class (UITableView) pushing always in the controller stack). When the user taps a cell (left side), the detail view (right side) shows the information. Keep in mind that the detail view controller is not always the same class: it means that I'm allocating (and releasing) programmatically several detailView controllers according the kind of information I have to display. Here the fragment: UIViewController *newDetailViewController = [[NSClassFromString(cntrClass) alloc] initWithNibName:cntrXib bundle:nil]; //the detailViewController has been defined in the head section as ItemGenericViewController //each detailViewController is a subclass of ItemGenericViewController detailViewController = newDetailViewController; UINavigationController *nav = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:detailViewController]; // Update the split view controller's view controllers array. NSArray *viewControllers = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:self.navigationController, nav, nil]; self.splitViewController.viewControllers = viewControllers; [nav release]; [viewControllers release]; [detailViewController release]; Everything is working fine until a memory warning arises. From that moment if I try to display a new detailViewcontroller the "connection" in the SplitViewController, between the RootController and the detailController, seems vanished. The result is: nothing appear on the right part of the splitController. In the mean time if I navigate to parent level in the root controller the situation still failing. For your information each time I push in the stack a new RootController instance (left column) I'm releasing the same controller (to save memory as usual) and I suspect, after receiving the memory warning, iOS is trying to free itself memory and my "history" disappear and the related connection, throught the split controller, too. Is a nightmare ;-) Do you have any suggestion ? Thanks Dario
