How to, set-justification-full per line in emacs without messing up on return?

I have two problems in emacs. First. How do I set-justification-full for the whole document? I can do M-X set-justification-full for a region successfully, but I would like to make it work in the whole document. Second. How do I manage not to get lines jumping from one place to another when I have done set-justification-full, and press enter? That is, say I have the following paragraph: %%if normalized beforehand then the rule would be, %%\begin{gather} %%(\hat{y}_{i}^{'} \times \hat{y}_{i+1}^{'}) \cdot \hat{z}_{mst} = 1, \quad then \ \Omega > 1\\ %%(\hat{y}_{i}^{'} \times \hat{y}_{i+1}^{'}) \cdot \hat{z}_{mst} = %%-1,\quad then \ \Omega When I do set-justification-full, it will convert six lines into three lines, that is, what I want to do is a per line justification. Is this possible in emacs? Thank you all very much for your help. Inhaki2006 Sorry about that. The example came without line breaks, what I meant was. %%if normalized beforehand then the rule would be, %%\begin{gather} %%(\hat{y} {i}^{'} \times \hat{y} {i+1}^{'}) \cdot \hat{z} {mst} = 1, \quad then \ \Omega > 1\ %%(\hat{y} {i}^{'} \times \hat{y} {i+1}^{'}) \cdot \hat{z} {mst} = %%-1,\quad then \ \Omega %%\end{gather} Thanks again, I.
