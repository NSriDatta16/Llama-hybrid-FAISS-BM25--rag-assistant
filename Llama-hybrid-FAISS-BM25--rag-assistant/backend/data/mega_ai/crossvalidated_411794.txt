With Helmert coding, each level of the variable is compared to "later" levels of the variable. The weights depend on the number of levels of the variable. If there are L levels then the first comparison is of level vs. $(L-1)$ other levels. The weights are then $(L-1)/L$ for the first level and $-1/L$ for each of the other levels. In your case L = 4 so the weights are .75 and -.25 (3 times). The next comparison has only $L-1$ levels (the first level is no longer part of the comparisons), so now the weights are $(L-2)/(L-1)$ for the first level and $-1/(L-1)$ for the others (in your case, $2/3$ and - $1/3$ . And so on. Why are you using Helmert coding here? As this page notes, Helmert coding and its inverse, difference coding, really only make sense when the variable is ordinal. Clearly, this coding system does not make much sense with our example of race because it is a nominal variable. However, this system is useful when the levels of the categorical variable are ordered in a meaningful way. For example, if we had a categorical variable in which work-related stress was coded as low, medium or high, then comparing the means of the previous levels of the variable would make more sense. Personally, I find them hard to interpret, even in that case. But, you are comparing "White" to the average of the other three groups. Is that what you want?
