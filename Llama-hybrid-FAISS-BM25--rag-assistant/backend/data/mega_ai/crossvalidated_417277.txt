Bayesian Formula for multiple events

I know that Bayesian Formula for A giving B is like this $ p(A | B) = \frac{p(B|A) p(A)}{p(B)}$ In case there are multiple events B C D What will the equation be like in the simplest form of a single event in the probability e.g. $p(A|B) , p(D|A) , p(A|C), etc.$ ? $ p(A | BCD) = \frac{????}{???}$ Edit : I have done further research and found this. and by simplifying this further then $ p(A | BCD) = p(A) \frac{ p(B|A)}{p(B)} \frac{ p(C|A)}{p(C)} \frac{ p(D|A)}{p(D)}$ does this look right?!!!
