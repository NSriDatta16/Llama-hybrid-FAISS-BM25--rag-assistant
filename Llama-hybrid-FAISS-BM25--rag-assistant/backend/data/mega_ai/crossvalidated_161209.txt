What's the meaning of $\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i<n-t$ in SVM? And what's its primal countepart?

Consider the SVM dual, i.e., \begin{align} &\text{maximize} \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i-\frac{1}{2\lambda} \sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j K(x_i,x_j)\cr &\text{subject to, } 0\leq \alpha_i \leq 1 \end{align} where $K$ is the kernel matrix and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter. My questions are: What is the meaning of $\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i$? When this value is equal to $n$, Can we say that model is underfitted? Is it meaningful to add this constraint $\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i with $t$ a parameter, to the above problem? If yes, what is this constraint in the primal?
