jQuery, calling a callback only once after multiple animations

Let's say that I have several animations running at once, and I want to call a function once all of them are finished. With only one animation, it's easy; there's a callback for that. For example : $(".myclass").fadeOut(slow,mycallback); Trouble is, if my selector finds several items, the callback will be called for each of them. A workaround is not too hard; for example : Example $(document).ready(function() { var $mc=$(".myclass"),l=$mc.length; $mc.fadeOut("slow",function(){ if (! --l) $("#target").append(" All done. "); }); }); Paragraph Paragraph Paragraph Paragraph Paragraph Paragraph My question is : is there a better way to do this ?
