So the detectors are different, so the alignment will be slightly wrong, in that pixel (256,512) in image 1 could be a feature represented by pixel (257,513) in image 2. Is that the problem? What about magnification? If the detector is different, couldn't the magnification be slightly different as well? If you mean something like the above, and judging from your screenshot, it shouldn't be too difficult to find the centers of the 4 or 5 areas of highest intensity - normalize the data and go through the entire image looking for blocks of 9 neighboring pixels with the highest average intensity. Note the center pixel of four or five of these features for each image. Then calculate the distance between each set of pixels between the two images. If the distance is 0 for all sets, the two images should be in alignment. If the distance is constant, all you have to do is move one image that distance. If the distance varies, you will need to resize one image until it is constant, and then slide it to match up the features. Then you can average the intensity values of the two images, since they should be in alignment. That's how I would start, anyway.
