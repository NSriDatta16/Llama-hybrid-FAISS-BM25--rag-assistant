I've had good experience using triggers to insert record IDs into staging tables. We then created a set of SSIS packages and SQL Agent jobs poll the staging tables and take appropriate action based on the contents of the staging table. This made it possible to implement custom. Since we were moving data between an OLTP system and a warehouse, it made a lot of sense - records don't always line up row for row.
