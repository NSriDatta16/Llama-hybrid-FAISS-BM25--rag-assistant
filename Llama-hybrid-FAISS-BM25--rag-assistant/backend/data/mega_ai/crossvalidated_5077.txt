Hit and run MCMC

I'm trying to implement the hit and run MCMC algorithm, but I'm having a bit of trouble understanding how to go about it. The general idea, is as follows: To generate a proposal jump in MH, we: Generate a direction $d$ from a distribution on the surface of the unit sphere $\mathcal{O}$ Generate a signed distance $\lambda$ along the constrained space. However, I have no idea of how I should go about implementing this in R (or any other language). Does anyone have a snippet of code that would point me in the right direction? BTW, I not that interested in a library that does this method, I want to try and code it up myself. Many thanks.
