How to deal with dependencies in shared libraries, unix

I have created a dynamic(.so) library which bundles some functionality for a storage backend that I need. As it is, it offers a known interface and provides backends for things like memcached, mysql, sqlite... etc. Now my problem is that my shared library depends on libmemcached, on libsqlite3, on libmysqlclient.. etc., and I don't know how to pack it since clients that only want sqlite wouldn't need to have libmemcached installed. I've been thinking on splitting it on different libraries but it seems like I'll end up with almost 20 .so libraries and I don't like that idea. Any alternative?
