I would prefer it as a URI to the browser's executable file. From your comments, I assume that you want this information when the user visits your site with his / her web browser. If so, the answer is that the information is not available unless you can convince the user to install a trusted browser plugin / addon or run a trusted applet. The reason is that it would be a security breach for an untrusted web page to be able to get this information. It reveals information about the user's personal preferences, and potentially makes it easier for hackers to target the user's browser and compromise his / her machine. The best you can do is look at the HTTP request's UserAgent header. This may be inaccurate, but that is the user's perogative.
