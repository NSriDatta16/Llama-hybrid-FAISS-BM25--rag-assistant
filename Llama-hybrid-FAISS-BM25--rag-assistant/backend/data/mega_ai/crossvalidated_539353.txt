How do I deal with ties when using rank-based normalizing transforms, e.g. Blom?

I would like to transform heavily skewed data with range (-Inf, Inf) and heavily zero-inflated into a form suitable for using GLMs for significance testing. Zero-inflation precludes the effective use of standard blom-family transforms (e.g. Blom, Elfving, etc) because they require data not to have ties. It occurs to me that I can randomly break ties and fit an ensemble of glms on the resulting sampled datasets, and then average the significance result. Therefore, I have two questions: Is there any theory on normalizing copula transforms for continuous data with ties? I can't find anything? Does this bootstrap-driven correction make sense to folks? Would it lose statistical power? Someone has proposed that I run a Wilcoxon test. That doesn't work for me for two reasons: I need to run some multivariate fits and Wilcoxon will heavily extrapolate the significance test by excluding 0s from ranks, which is roughly 2/3 of the measurements (yes, I know, the data sucks, but it's the data) There's a modified wilcoxon test that addresses this problem but I can't find an implementation (Pratt, J. W. (1959). Remarks on Zeros and Ties in the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Procedures. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 54(287), 655â€“667. doi:10.1080/01621459.1959.10501526) Thanks in advance!
