One moment when things clicked for me was reading "Test-Driven Development, by Example", by Kent Beck. The whole first part of the book is a walk-through of Beck designing a piece of functionality, step by step. I found it very helpful because you see the process happen in an organic way - starting with very few classes, which evolve over time. I think starting with patterns is not necessarily a good idea. Design patterns are great, but I find that why they are useful becomes apparent only after having done it wrong on a real-life project first, and gained a sense for what works and what doesn't in OO.
