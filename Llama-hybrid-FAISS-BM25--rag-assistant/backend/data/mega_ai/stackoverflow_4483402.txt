While I don't always do Test-Driven Development (write tests before implementing the class), I do always write tests after I implement the code. Even some days after. At least I try to follow a path coverage strategy (that is, every route flow from the beginning to the method up to when it returns). Also for unexpected parameter values. This is useful for enhancing your confidence of correct behaviour of your functions, also when you change the code. Quite always I find unexpected behaviors or little bugs :) So it works
