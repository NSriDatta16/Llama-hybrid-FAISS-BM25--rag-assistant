How do Markov Chain Chatbots work?

I was thinking of creating a chatbot using something like markov chains, but I'm not entirely sure how to get it to work. From what I understand, you create a table from data with a given word and then words which follow. Is it possible to attach any sort of probability or counter while training the bot? Is that even a good idea? The second part of the problem is with keywords. Assuming I can already identify keywords from user input, how do I generate a sentence which uses that keyword? I don't always want to start the sentence with the keyword, so how do I seed the markov chain?
