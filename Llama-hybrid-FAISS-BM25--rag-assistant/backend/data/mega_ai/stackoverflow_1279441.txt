First of all - the suggestions in this article are not for html pages - they are specifically for the Mozilla UI - XUL , so it may be best practice for XUL, but not for html. Applying the CSS on an average HTML page is one of the quickest things than happen while loading the page. Also, the article may suggest the fastest way to apply css rules, but at what cost? For example, they suggest not having more than one class per rule: BAD - .treecell.indented { } GOOD - .treecell-indented { } That is almost outrageous . It may lead to quicker CSS, but who cares? Assuming you already have .treecell and .indented , following these suggestions leads to complicated logic , harder maintenance, duplicated css rules, harder JavaScript (which costs a lot more that CSS), etc. They suggest not using the full richness of CSS selectors and replacing these selectors with flat classes, which is a shame.
