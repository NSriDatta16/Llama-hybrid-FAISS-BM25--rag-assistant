You should be able to do this with jsp fragments . I believe it will not be the extremely elegant solution you would appreciate, but it does allow the execution of the expression to be deferred until inside the tag. Edit: You could check out the variable with the "name-given" setting. (I will readily admit I did something like what you're trying to do about 2 years ago. I have not touched it since. I remember I thought it was quite arcane)
