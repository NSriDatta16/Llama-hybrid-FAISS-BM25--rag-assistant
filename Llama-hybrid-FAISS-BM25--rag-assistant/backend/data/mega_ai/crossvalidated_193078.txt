Positive serial correlation

Blows are the pictures from my course lecture. The lecture states only the second picture shows a positive serial correlation, and the first picture requires time to be added as a predictor while second picture requires to be moved to time series modeling. I'm a little bit confused. Why it is not Positive serial correlation in the first picture or why we can't move it to time series modeling as well? How to tell there is "positive serial correlation" among the error terms?
