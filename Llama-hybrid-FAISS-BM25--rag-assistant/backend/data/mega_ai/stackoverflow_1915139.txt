In general: if you practice Scrum (or any other agile methodology), you should follow the time-boxing principle and avoid extending/delaying your sprint. In particular: code coverage metric alone is not enough to estimate the test/readiness status of your application. More sophisticated combination of metrics should be used (refer to books on software testing).
