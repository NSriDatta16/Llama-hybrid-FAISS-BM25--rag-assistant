enum DragonHandled { DHSuccess, DHKing, DHNoKing }; inline DragonHandled askForKing() { if (callTheKing()) return DHKing; else return DHNoKing; } DragonHandled handleDragon() { if (dragonSlayer.on_vacation()) { cout Except for a function that returns an actual signed number , I would not return int . If the result has a meaning, define that meaning properly (that is: an enum ). A function does something, and whatever it does, should be visible in its name. So there should be a verb in a function's name ( handle dragon() , call TheKing() ). monsters isn't a verb, it isn't something you can do. If I see an identifier monsters , I'd think it's a container for monsters. Checking if(x == true) is just useless noise, since if(x) is terser, simpler and just as true.
