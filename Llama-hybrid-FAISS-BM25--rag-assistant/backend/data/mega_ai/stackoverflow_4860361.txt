Hardware solution You should really benefit from using a solid state drive (SSD). These are a lot faster than traditional hard disk drives, because they don't have any hardware components that need to spin and move around. Software solution Are these files under your control, or are they coming from an external system? If you're in control, I'd suggest you use a database to store the information. If a database is too much of a hassle for you, try to store the information in a single file and read from that. If the isn't fragmented too much, you'll have much better performance compared to having millions of small files.
