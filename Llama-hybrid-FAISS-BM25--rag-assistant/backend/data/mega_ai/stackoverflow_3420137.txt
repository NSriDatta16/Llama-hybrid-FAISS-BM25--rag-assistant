Well, I haven't tried this, but I did find a link (wasn't easy to find) that supposedly shows how to do this: http://msmvps.com/blogs/angelhernandez/archive/2008/10/04/retrieving-file-path-from-isolatedstorage.aspx Basically the key line of code appears to be: fileName = isoStore.GetType.GetField("m_RootDir",Reflection.BindingFlags.NonPublic or Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance).GetValue(isoStore).ToString I'm not sure if any special permissions have to be set to get this to work. Ok, also found a related stackoverflow: Can I get a path for a IsolatedStorage file and read it from external applications?
