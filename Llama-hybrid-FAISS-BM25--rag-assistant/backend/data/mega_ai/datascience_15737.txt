Handling time series data with gaps

I am working on a dataset with physical measurements taken daily (weight, bmi, etc...) and I am working through the process to graphically represent it. I think it is worth noting that every day has a corresponding row, but if no measurements were taken, the values are the same as the day before. Here is an example of the trend I am trying to manage: Date, Weight, BMI 1/1/2016, 155.1, 21.9 1/2/2016, 155.1, 21.9 1/3/2016, 155.1, 21.9 --continued for several weeks-- 3/1/2016, 170.2, 25.0 3/2/2016, 170.1, 25.0 edit: I should clarify that these repeated values are how the data is put together for missing values. The days that are repeated are days when no measurement was taken If the value stays the same for an extended period, should there be a gap in any graphical representation? Should I keep the numbers as they were (155.1 & 21.9) until the next measurement was taken, or should the numbers increase over that time to "bridge the gap" - meaning they would increase by the difference in measurements divided by the number of days? It feels like I should be increasing the value over time to account for what would happen in reality, but I don't know if this would have negative implications on the data.
