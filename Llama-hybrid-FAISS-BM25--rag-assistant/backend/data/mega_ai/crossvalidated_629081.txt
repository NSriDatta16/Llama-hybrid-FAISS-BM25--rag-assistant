Why do my random effects estimates not match the data?

I'm running a logistic regression model in R using glmer() from lme4. I only want to get the random effects estimates, so I have an intercept-only model with just the random effect. The model is of the probability of subjects (which each have one observation, and are within a location, which is the random effect) getting an illness. Obviously I have the raw data to hand and can see the actual occurrences of illness within each location. After running the model, I used ranef() to extract the location random effects and converted them to odds and then probabilities. They are different - have a lower variance/SD/range - from the actual "probabilities" for each location in the raw data. Perhaps I misunderstood how to interpret these random effects estimates, or how to convert them to probabilities, or maybe there is an issue with the model? To be clear, I exponentiated each of the random effects intercept values, then converted them to probabilities with the usual formula odds/(1+odds) . I also considered that the random effects estimates might not be the actual intercepts for groups but either the difference from the fixed intercept or odds ratios, but the probabilities from these calculations are even further away from reality.
