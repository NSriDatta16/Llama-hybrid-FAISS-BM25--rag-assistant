If you 'pre-compile' the web site using the aspnet_compiler.exe tool (or using the Publish button in Visual Studio) without compiling it as "updatable" (meaning that all ASPX and FS files have to be compiled into DLLs) then I think you'll need just: FSharp.Core.dll (contains the core F# libraries, lists, tuples, etc.) possibly FSharp.PowerPack.dll (as Robert mentioned) Other DLLs from the F# installation shouldn't be needed for the runtime. If you want to compile the Web application on the server (using the F# CodeDOM) (i.e. deploy it as an updatable web site), then you'll need to install F# on the server and you'll need the rights to spawn "fsc.exe" (so that doesn't look like a case for shared server).
