Which Data Science book gives complete guideline to data science?

There are many books in the stores on data science. Is there any book that gives complete guideline to data science? Like separately talks about python (not R), statistics, math, data Visualization software etc. Overall, I need to have a book that talks about complete guideline to data science in any field, or important fields like business, commerce etc.
