Is there a way to know when the initial sample is not representative of the population? The bootstrap cannot detect bias. Bias is a sampling problem which would have to be detected by some other tests. For example in the simple problem above - would you expect that the distribution of averages is a normal distribution but you found the distribution of average fractions is skewed or bumpy - then would you suspect anomaly in the original sample? Common sense suggests you look for indications of a problem.
