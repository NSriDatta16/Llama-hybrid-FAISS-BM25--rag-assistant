Discretization of a continuous distribution

I have two variation of the same problem. A) Assume you sample $m$ points, $x_1,x_2,...x_m$, drawn i.i.d from a continuous distribution of a random variable $X$. We reorder the points so $x_1 This provides a granularization of the continuous random variable $X$ to a discrete RV $X'$. I'm interested in obtaining bounds on the expected value of $$|E(X)-E(X')|$$ as a function of the number of points $m$. If it is possible to obtain bounds on $$\Pr\left(|E(X)-E(X')|>\delta \right)$$ this would be great. Any tip would be helpful! B) A similar version of the problem is when there are $n$ i.i.d samples drawn from a distribution of a random variable $X$. We denote the empirical average as $ $. A subset of $m$ points are selected from the set of $n$ samples. We have $n\gg m\gg 1$. The weights of each point $x_i$, $i=1..n$ is the number of points (from the set of $n$ initial points) in the interval $[(x_{i-1}+x_i)/2,(x_{i}+x_{i+1})/2]$. As before, I'm interested in $$| - |$$ as a function of $m$ and $n$. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
