From having some experience with VAEs and tabular data, I can give you some lines of potential improvements: Do you do the reconstruction and regression tasks together ? I would imagine that you have a few (or just 1) linear layers on the output of your encoder for the regression task ? What is your loss, have you tried weighing its different components and optimizing the weights ? I imagine your loss to be $$w_1 * L_{KLD} + w_2 * L_{Reconstruction} + w_3 * L_{Regression}$$ The noise introduced in the reparametrization trick is often too strong for the model and it fails to produce a valid embedding, you should try decreasing it (having it as an hyper-parameter is ideal). Finally try to implement your model with a simple dense architecture to make sure that problem comes from the VAE architecture and not somewhere else. And by the way, it is normal for the KLD to increase to some extent. But it should not keep increasing indefinitely and should stabilize.
