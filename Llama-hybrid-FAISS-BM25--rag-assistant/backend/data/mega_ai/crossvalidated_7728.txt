The kinds of approaches ashaw discusses can lead to a relatively more systematic methodology. But I also think that by systematic you mean algorithmic. Here data mining tools may fill a gap. For one, there's the chi-squared automated interaction detection (CHAID) procedure built into SPSS's Decision Tree module; it can, according to rules set by the user, collapse ordinal or nominal categories of predictor variables when they show similar values on the outcome variable (whether it's continuous or nominal). These rules might depend on the size of the groups being collapsed or being created by collapsing, or on the p -values of related statistical tests. I believe some classification and regression tree (CART) programs can do the same things. Other respondents should be able to speak about similar functions performed by neural network or other applications provided through various data mining packages.
