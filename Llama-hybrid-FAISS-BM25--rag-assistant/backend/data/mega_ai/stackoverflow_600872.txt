There are so many possibilities, but the most pragmatic has to be XML There are decent XML libraries for nearly every development platform Most platforms allow object graph serialisation with a couple of lines of code, so XML is painless to implement Most platforms have an in memory and/or streaming reader, so you can handle really large files without too much memory usage Most platform provide an XSLT tranformer, so you can move files from one format to another, even from XML to non XML There are indexing extension for XML to handle really large files too XML has XSD's to validate the format before you attempt to read it XML is capable of representing any simple or complex object If you are worried about file size, just zip the final XML. This technique is used in Microsoft Office etc XML is still human readable XML is a common standard
