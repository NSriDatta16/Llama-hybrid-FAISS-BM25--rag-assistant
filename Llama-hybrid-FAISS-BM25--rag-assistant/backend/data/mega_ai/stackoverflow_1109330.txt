How to assign multiple values to an Open or Fixed-size array?

I want to do the following,but I get errors: procedure JumpToCodeCave(CurrentLocation:DWORD;Destination:Pointer;out_JmpBack:Pointer); var calc:DWORD; jmppatch:Array[0..3] of byte absolute calc; Buffer:Array[0..9] of byte; begin calc := (Cardinal(Destination) - $5)-(CurrentLocation + $4); Buffer := [$90,$90,$90,$90,$E9,jmppatch,$90]; // Buffer should look like this: 0x90,0x90,0x90,0xE9,jmppatch[0],jmppatch[1],jmppatch[2],jmppatch[3],0x90 The function calculates the value that should be written to jump from one address(current) to another address(CodeCave).The result is converted into bytes and written into the process,but I can't put the bytes in the Buffer like I did above. I'm sorry for the stupid question,but I have forgotten Delphi after I began my education with C#.
