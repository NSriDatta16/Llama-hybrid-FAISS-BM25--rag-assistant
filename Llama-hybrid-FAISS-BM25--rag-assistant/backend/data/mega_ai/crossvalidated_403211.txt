A variational autoencoder is based on variational inference. The zero covariance is an assumption, mean-field variational family , which makes optimization easier, since the latent variables are independent. Check chapter 2.3 of this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00670 They also briefly dive into other families: One way to expand the family is to add dependencies between the variables (Saul and Jordan, 1996; Barber and Wiegerinck, 1999); this is called structured variational inference.
