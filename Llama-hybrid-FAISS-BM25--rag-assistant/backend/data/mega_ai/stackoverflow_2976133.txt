PHP Magento SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from urlpath

I am trying to create a soap client by passing a url that is hosted on my local machine, my dev environment and I keep getting this error. I use to be able to make this call and it worked just fine. Basically all I am doing is this $client = new SoapClient(' http://virtual.website.com:81/api/?wsdl '); If I go to the url in a browser it comes up, so I know it is the right location. On the Magento forums there are some similar posts but I don't know that this is a Magento specific problem. Everything they mention as a solution I already have. They say to edit the hosts file for example 127.0.0.1 website.com I already have this since it is setup as a virtual host. Here is the error in my error_log [Fri Jun 04 12:30:37 2010] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP Fatal error: SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from 'http://virtual.website.com:81/api/soap/?wsdl' : XML declaration allowed only at the start of the document\n in /usr/local/sites/virtual.website.com/www/CUSTOMSCRIPTS/removeProductImages.php on line 6 [Fri Jun 04 12:30:37 2010] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP Stack trace: [Fri Jun 04 12:30:37 2010] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP 1. {main}() /usr/local/sites/virtual.website.com/www/CUSTOMSCRIPTS/removeProductImages.php:0 [Fri Jun 04 12:30:37 2010] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP 2.
