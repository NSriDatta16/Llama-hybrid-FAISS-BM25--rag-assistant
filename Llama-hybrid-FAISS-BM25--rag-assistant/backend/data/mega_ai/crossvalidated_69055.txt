I am the original author of the getSummary.mer function. The reported $p$-values should only be used as a quick check. If I recall, I actually only included the $p$-values to make it work within the framework provided by memisc . But this should really be provided with an appropriate warning to the user, and I will contact the package maintainer to see about getting this added. My advice is to follow that provided by Doug Bates: MCMC is the safe bet (assuming others don't have better options).
