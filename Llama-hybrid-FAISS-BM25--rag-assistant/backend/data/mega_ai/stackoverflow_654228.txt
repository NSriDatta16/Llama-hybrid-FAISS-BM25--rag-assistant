I think it all goes around what level of focus and resource you intend to commit to this project. If this is a project that you'll focus on solely for the next few years, then programming it yourself makes best sense, but if this is just one of many projects that you're busy with then I'd recommend trying something like Magento. I was faced with a similar situation and chose Magento and that decision has been ratified many times over since then. Granted, there is a learning curve at the beginning, but you cannot compare the power of community developed projects against one you'll develop sporadically yourself. There have been a constant stream of improvements to the software, including iPhone-friendly shopping interfaces and ajax interaction, all stuff that I just would not have had time to get to. Anyway, that's just my 30c worth. Regarding which language to use if coding yourself, I think this is a purely personal decision and our responses can only be subjective. But, since, you ask: I started web programming with ASP, but gave PHP a try over 7 years ago and have loved every minute of it.
