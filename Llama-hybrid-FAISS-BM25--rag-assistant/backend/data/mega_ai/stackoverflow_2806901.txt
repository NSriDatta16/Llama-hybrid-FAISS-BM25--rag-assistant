I hit this one too when starting with JDBC - it seemed to fly in the face of what I understood about databases and ACID guarantees. Before you begin, be sure that your MySQL storage engine supports transactions. MyISAM doesn't support transactions, but InnoDB does. Then be sure to disable JDBC autoCommit - Connection.setAutoCommit(false) , or the JDBC will run each statement as a separate trasaction. The commit will be an all or nothing affair - there will be no partial changes. Then you run your various update statements, and finally call Connection.commit() to commit the transaction. See the Sun Tutorial for more details about JDBC transactions. Using a batch does not change the ACID guarantees - you're either transacted or you're not! - batching is more about collecting multiple statements together for improved performance.
