How to interpret the result of logistic fit with poly()

Here are two examples of binomial model fitting. In the second example, the independent variable is modeled using poly() as a second order polynomial. How do I interpret these 2 results? Why someone would want to use the poly(2) ? This would be overfitting in the context of logistic regression, right? I understand that for the linear models, like lm(y ~ x + I(x^2)) , the second order is used to check whether the more complex model provides better fits to our data, vis-a-vis minimizing the residuals, but logistic regression has no residuals (error terms). The poly(,2) depicts completely different picture about survival of M/F across age. library(vcdExtra) library(ggplot2) require(gridExtra) data(Donner, package="vcdExtra") head(Donner) # separate linear fits on age for M/F g1
