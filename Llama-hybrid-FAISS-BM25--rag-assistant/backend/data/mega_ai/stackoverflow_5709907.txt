How to add space between lines within a single paragraph with Reportlab

I have a block of text that is dynamically pulled from a database and is placed in a PDF before being served to a user. The text is being placed onto a lined background, much like notepad paper. I want to space the text so that only one line of text is between each background line. I was able to use the following code to create a vertical spacing between paragraphs (used to generate another part of the PDF). style = getSampleStyleSheet()['Normal'] style.fontName = 'Helvetica' style.spaceAfter = 15 style.alignment = TA_JUSTIFY story = [Paragraph(choice.value,style) for choice in chain(context['question1'].itervalues(),context['question2'].itervalues())] generated_file = StringIO() frame1 = Frame(50,100,245,240, showBoundary=0) frame2 = Frame(320,100,245,240, showBoundary=0) page_template = PageTemplate(frames=[frame1,frame2]) doc = BaseDocTemplate(generated_file,pageTemplates=[page_template]) doc.build(story) However, this won't work here because I have only a single, large paragraph.
