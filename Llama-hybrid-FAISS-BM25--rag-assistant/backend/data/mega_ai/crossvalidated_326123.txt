Deriving variance of VAR(1)

I am reading Cochrane's (p.35) book on Time series and I'm a bit rusty on my linear algebra so I was hoping someone could help me derive the variance of a VAR process. Consider a VAR(1): $x_{t} = Ax_{t-1} + Cw_{t}$ where $C = [\sigma_{\epsilon} \quad0 \quad \sigma_{\epsilon}]'$ and $E(w_{t}w_{t}') = I$ Then he says the forecast error variances are $x_{t+1} - E_{t}(x_{t+1}) = Cw_{t+1} \implies var_{t}(x_{t+1}) = CC'$ $x_{t+2} - E_{t}(x_{t+2}) = Cw_{t+2} +ACw_{t+1} \implies var_{t}(x_{t+2}) = CC' + ACC'A'$ I am able to follow up until the $\implies var_{t}(x_{})$ part. But I don't understand how/why he introduces the transpose of $C,A$ .
