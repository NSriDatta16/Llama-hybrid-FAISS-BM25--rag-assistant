Drag Drop images into EXTJS TreePanel and TreeNode

I have an ExtJs TreePanel in which i've set the enableDrop as true and set the property ddGroup to one of the groups. I have this another ExtJs view from where i need to drag and drop the images. And i know that ddGroup defined for this is media However the drag and drop never happens. This is my code snippet: var treePanel = new Ext.tree.TreePanel({ "id": "myTree", "lines": true, "animate": true, "enableDrop": true, "enableDrag": false, "ddGroup": "media", "containerScroll": true, "autoScroll": true, "split": true, "stateful": true, "renderTo": "treeStruc", "loader": //my loader, "root": new Ext.tree.AsyncTreeNode(treeRootConfig), "dropConfig": { "ddGroup": 'media' }, "listeners": { "nodedrop": function(e) { //do the check } } }); Is there anything else that needs to be done? Thanks.
