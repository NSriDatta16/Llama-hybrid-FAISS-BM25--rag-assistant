As @RichardHardy points out, normality of the errors is not necessary for estimated IRFs. The IRFs are functions of the estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals and of the VAR slope coefficients, both of which can be shown to follow asymptotic normal distributions under weaker conditions than normality (e.g., finite fourth moments and symmetric error distributions). Hence, by the delta method, one may establish that the IRF estimates also are asymptotically normal. That said, if the errors are normal, the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the impulse response estimator simplifies. Depending on the software you use, it may be the case that this simplification is assumed, so that it would also be necessary that normality is satisfied for inference (e.g., confidence bands) to be asymptotically valid. Detailed discussion of these issues is for example provided in LÃ¼tkepohl, New Introduction To Multiple Time Series Analysis . See in particular Proposition 3.6 and the subsequent Remark 4.
