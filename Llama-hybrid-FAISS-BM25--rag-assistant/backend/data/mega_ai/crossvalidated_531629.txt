I think your second interpretation is closer to the mark. In particular, when we think about instrumental variables we should think about the underlying structural assumptions that the IV procedure makes. Let's summarize this relationship as a DAG , In the above picture, $X$ is the instrument, $Y$ the explanatory variable of interest, $Z$ the outcome, and $U$ the unobserved confounding variable. The idea is that we can use the exogeneity in $X$ to induce exogenous variation in $Y$ that could explain $Z$ . So when we consider asymptotic arguments and thereby allow our sample to grow we operate under the framework that we can keep drawing from $(X,Y,Z)$ and exploit the covariation that we find. So if $X$ is rainfall we are essentially assuming we are sampling from the population of rainfall. That population distribution is fixed but we only observe some realization of it on the day. So the sampling distribution may not be the same as the population distribution and may vary. As you said, we could think of this as saying that we are seeing the same day repeat over and over again and observing the amount of rainfall and the population of responses. In fact, this kind of counterfactual is exactly what we need to identify some causal effect. The thing is we need to rely on this DGP for identification. Since exclusion cannot be tested in-sample (it is a property of the population) we need to hope that the DAG above correctly summarizes the joint relationships. Now looking at the DGP we can see that for the identification argument discussed in the last paragraph to hold it is important that the exclusion restriction holds for the population distribution. That is, we can't have an edge connecting $X$ and $Z$ that does not travel through $Y$ . That is, we need that exclusion holds for the population of rainfall. Some unrelated thoughts: Also, this is unrelated to your question but this a great reason why rainfall is not a great instrument. Essentially, it is somewhat unclear what the population really is. Also, there is good reason to believe that the effect that is being captured (the effect induced by the exogeneity of rainfall) is not really a relevant effect for any kind of policymaking. This is because, just as with the population issue, it is difficult to know what the counterfactuals we are comparing actually are. There is a really great discussion of this in Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) .
