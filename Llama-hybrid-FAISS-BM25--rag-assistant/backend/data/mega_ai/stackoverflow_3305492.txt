Have a look at http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/GSG/ImplementinganA2SRequest.html for starters? This doesn't use REST though. The ItemLookup API call should be the one you need with a ResponseGroup of ItemAttributes . You'll need to get set up with access keys - see http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/GSG/GettinganAWSAccessKeyID.html for that. Not sure if there are any Android-specific issues that you should be aware of
