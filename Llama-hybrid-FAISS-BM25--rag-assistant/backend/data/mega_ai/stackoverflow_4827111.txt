In git trees, a file mode of 1600000 indicates that an entry, activesupport/lib/active_support/vendor/i18n-0.0.1 in this case, is a submodule. Submodules are stored in trees as the object name (i.e. the SHA1sum) of the commit that the submodule should be at, and that's the value you're seeing in the output. What fast-export is outputting is sufficient for fast-import to reconstruct the tree such that git submodule update --init in the new repository will initialize and update the submodule to the right version. I'm afraid I'm not sure if there's an equivalent concept in your traget SCM to git's submodules.
