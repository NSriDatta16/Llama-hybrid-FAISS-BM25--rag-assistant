How to add SAN storage support to your application?

I want to add San Storage support in my application. Is there a standard protocol that I can use to communicate with all san storage devices like EMC Centera, Hitachi, NetApp or do I have to use library specific to each vendor? In a nutshell i'd like to save data on device and read it back. I know these devices can be mounted as drives or published as network shares but do we have an open API level access to it? Have any of you added such support to your application if so how?
