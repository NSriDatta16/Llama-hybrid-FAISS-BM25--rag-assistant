Templates for setters and getters

I am not familiar with templates, but I wonder, if it is possible to use them for setter and getter methods. For example in this situation: double exmlClass::getA(void) const { return a_; } void exmlClass::setA(const double& a) { a_ = a; } double exmlClass::getB(void) const { return b_; } As you can see, methods are almost the same, except they refer to another private variables (a_, b_, c_). Is there a more elegant way to write those functions or it is common practice to do like above in such situations? And if its common to use templates, I would appreciate example how you would use them in code above. Another question I would ask is how should getters and setters be properly declared. Is it good coding style? double getA(void) const; void setA(const double& a); double getB(void) const; void setB(const double& b); double getC(void) const; void setC(const double& c); I mean should getters be always const and setters take as argument reference to an object, rather than copy it, which would be probably a little bit slower?
