Like others above, I'd do it by implementing a web service rather than fiddling with SSH. You're right that the SSH solution is inelegant. The obvious answer for what to build your Python web application on top of: Django. If you want to use something lighter, look at a microframework like Flask . For data interchange, JSON is your best bet -- supported by both Python and PHP now. http://docs.python.org/library/json.html http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php
