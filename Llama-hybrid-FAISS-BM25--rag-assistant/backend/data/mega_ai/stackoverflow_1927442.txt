You cannot escape non-printing characters such as NULL because there's no equivalent escape character defined for them. You cannot represent it unless you have HEX or Base64 encoded fragments. So you could either Base64 encode the string or make sure it does not contain non-printing characters. string fromOutside = "\0"; string base64Encoded = Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(fromOutside)); XAttribute a = new XAttribute("id", base64Encoded);
