There's a whole range of statistics for studying how ecological communities of species change across gradients, which use dissimilarity matrices as the response variable. It sounds like you could make use of these to assess your hypotheses. It sounds like you're already using the R package vegan - check out some of the other functions - e.g. rca , cca , envfit , adonis . There are a few nice vignettes available for the package that would be worth reading. It seems to me like your data is equivalent to that used in the examples, but instead of "site" you have "animal", and instead of "species" you have "food".
