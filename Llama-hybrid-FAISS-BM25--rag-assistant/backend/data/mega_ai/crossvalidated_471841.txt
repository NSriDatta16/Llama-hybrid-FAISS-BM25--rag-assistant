Can we do residual analysis for random forest classification model that gives out probability instead of class label?

My colleague introduced me to this idea that we can do residual analysis for random forest classification problem that spits out probabilities instead of the class label for a binary classification problem. This claim has surprised me. I am under the assumption that residual analysis can only be done for a regression problem. I cannot find relevant literature to rebuttal the arguments of my co-worker. May I know if anyone of you has come across this idea before, or you have a proof for why this claim might be wrong. In addition, will a residual plot have any meaning in this regard?
