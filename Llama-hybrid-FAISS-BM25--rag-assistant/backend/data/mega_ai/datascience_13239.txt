There are many algorithms that can be used to perform classifications ( many to the point that it is difficult to mention all of them ) I suggest you to have a look at this http://dlib.net/ml_guide.svg Making the decision which algorithm to use is a function of the problem you are working with, mainly: 1. The number of classes 2. The number of samples 3. The variations within classes and similarities between classes 4. Data imbalance 5. The dimension of your feature And many other parameters In general, CNN is very popular for two reasons: They can lead to high performance in very challenging problems and they are general solutions in the context that you need to understand their architectures the strategies and tricks to perform training only, after that you do not need to change anything , no parameters to play with .
