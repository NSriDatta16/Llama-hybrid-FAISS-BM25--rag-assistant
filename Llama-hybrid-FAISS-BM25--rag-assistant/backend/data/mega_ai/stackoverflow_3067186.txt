Are you using HTML and JavaScript for anything other than embedding the SWF? If not, you can create a Flex project from Flash Builder (at least that was the way in Flex Builder 3 - I don't know if they've changed it) and mark output format as AIR to start with. The easiest way would be to add the main Sprite of your AS project as a child to the rawChildren of the WindowedApplication class of the AIR from the creationComplete event handler. It is hard to say more without knowing what type of project you're talking about.
