If you don't have labeled data (telling whether it belongs to class "normal" or "anamoly"), you will have to use a cluster analysis - for grouping the objects. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm and requires you to have data that has classes. Same goes for decision trees. Look at this with respect to validating unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
