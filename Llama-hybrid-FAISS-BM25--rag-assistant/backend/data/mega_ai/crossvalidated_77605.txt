PCA on a heterogenous correlation matrix better than MCA?

I have a questionnaire of 80 questions that I need to do dimension reduction on. About half the questions are ordinal (Likert-style questions), and the other half are qualitative/nominal. I've been given a suggestion to perform Multiple Correspondence Analysis on the dataset, but I was wondering, would it be methodologically sound to perform PCA based on a heterogeneous correlation matrix that contains polychoric and polyserial correlations (as produced by the hetcor() function in John Fox's 'polycor' R package). This makes sense to me, as PCA is basically a mathematical technique for calculating loadings and eigenvalues based on correlations.
