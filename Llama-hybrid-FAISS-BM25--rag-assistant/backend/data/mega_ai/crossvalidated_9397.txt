Converting a continuous variable into categorical may be a bad idea, but may be a good idea as well, this depends on the problem. When the relationships of the variable can be best described using thresholds, categorisation may be one of the best options. You wrote that in different categories of X1 the correlation between Y and X2 is very different. This is a clear indication of a non-linear relationship between Y, X1 and X2. Thus multiple linear regression is probably not the best method to use here. In any case I suggest you to visualize your data (maybe using a circles plot , or coloured scatterplot ). You may continue with machine learning, or modelling methods that suit what you know about your data.
