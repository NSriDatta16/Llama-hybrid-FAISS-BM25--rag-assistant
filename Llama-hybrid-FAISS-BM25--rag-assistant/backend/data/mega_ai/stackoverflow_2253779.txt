Learning Apache POI for Java

I'm trying to learn Apache POI for Java quickly (for manipulating Excel). I've been googling for tutorials, but so far all I've found is short, 2-paragraph explanations followed by a code sample. I wanted to find something a bit more comprehensive, that is concise but walks through it in a structured, complete, and understandable way. Anyone know of any good tutorials? Does Apache POI have any decent documentation...? I couldn't seem to find any on their site.
