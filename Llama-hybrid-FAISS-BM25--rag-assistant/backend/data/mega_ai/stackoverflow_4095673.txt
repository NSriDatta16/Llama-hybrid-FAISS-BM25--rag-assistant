Here is an option: your PopulateFrom method should not take a specific file type, instead it should take a FileStream or MemoryStream , after all a file is simply a stream of bytes, it is the organisation of those bytes that makes each file type unique. Additionally, you may want to implement a method similar to this: bool CanProcess(FileStream myFile) that way you can query each provider in a generic way and it will tell you if it can process that particular file. Doing it this way will allow you to implement more file types and more providers without having to extend your interface or mess with the existing providers. Check out the Provider pattern to see if it helps.
