That's not an issue with R.matlab, but with something else. I see that it says "loading required package: R.matlab" , so the command came from somewhere else. > library(R.matlab) Loading required package: R.oo Loading required package: R.methodsS3 R.methodsS3 v1.2.1 (2010-09-18) successfully loaded. See ?R.methodsS3 for help. R.oo v1.7.5 (2011-02-01) successfully loaded. See ?R.oo for help. R.matlab v1.3.7 (2011-02-01) successfully loaded. See ?R.matlab for help. On Windows 7, R 2.12.1. Please provide the full detail of the command you used that loaded R.matlab. And you might want to post this on the R-help list or R-devel list, this seems to be a bug of some kind. It's always a good idea to put the package maintainer in cc, so they know.
