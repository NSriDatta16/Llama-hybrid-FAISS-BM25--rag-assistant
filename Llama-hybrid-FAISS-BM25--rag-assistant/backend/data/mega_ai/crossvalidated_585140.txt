I guess your time series have some kind of seasonality, since it is a product which is probably sold more often during some periods of the year or month? A way to tell more about the trend is using models that decompose the signal accordingly. One popular option is Facebook's Prophet . It gives you change point detection and trend uncertainty out of the box. But it really depends on the amount and quality of data you have. I would use the output of Prophet more as a metric to get a good estimation of the trend uncertainty and approximate direction. Another way would be to analyse the changepoints by yourself with the ruptures library. You can choose from various approaches to divide your time series into pieces and calculate individual trends. Depending on the distribution of trend slopes and piece lengths you could estimate a future trend uncertainty interval on your own. For example an interval between the mean and median of the trend slopes weighted by its length? Maybe not the answer you were hoping for, but hopefully a direction to follow ...
