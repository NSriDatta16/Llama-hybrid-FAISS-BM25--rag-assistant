its worth also looking at the training errors. basically I disagree with your analysis. if logistic regression etc are all giving the same results it would suggest that the 'best model' is a very simple one (that all models can fit equally well - eg basically linear). So then the question might be why is the best model a simple model?: It might suggest that your variables are not very predictive. Its of course hard to analyse without knowing the data.
