How does the XOR neural net work?

I'm new to neural nets, and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of weights and whatnot. I've been staring at a diagram of the XOR neural network for an hour, and I genuinely have no idea what I'm looking at. I just can't figure out how it works. Can someone explain how the four possible cases work here? I've tried walking through a simple example like (1,1), but I don't even have a basic grasp of how this is supposed to work. I've watch a bunch of tutorials on this, but I'm just totally lost on this simple example. Clearly misunderstanding something, would be awesome to get a simple explanation of how XOR works.
