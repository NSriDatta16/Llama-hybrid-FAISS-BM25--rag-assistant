What are areas where you can program artificial intelligence?

Welcome! I very enjoyed programming artificial intelligence in my studies - neural networks, expert machines and other. But in work I develop mainly web applications. And now I think about returning to such programming, maybe in hobby, or maybe in work. Are there areas where AI is commonly used in applications development and programmer with such skills can search work? Or maybe I can sold some ideas to my boss and use AI to extend some of our applications. What are you experience and ideas with using AI in applications?
