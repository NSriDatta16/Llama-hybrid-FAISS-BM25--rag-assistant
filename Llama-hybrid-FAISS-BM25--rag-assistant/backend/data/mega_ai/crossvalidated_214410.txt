Learning from clicks on Ads

I need to build an algorithm that predicts the number of clicks a facebook ad would get in the next 7 days. Based on the given requirements, I prepared a dataset consisting of the following information for each ad: Landing page : The URL that a user is redirected to upon clicking the ad. Bid term (“keywords”) : The query for which this ad should be displayed Title : The ad title, shown to the user. Body : The text description of the ad. Display URL : The URL shown to the user at the bottom of the ad. Clicks : The number of times the ad has been clicked Views : The number of times the ad has been seen Should I go about implementing this using logistic regression considering the features that I already have or you would recommend any other model?
