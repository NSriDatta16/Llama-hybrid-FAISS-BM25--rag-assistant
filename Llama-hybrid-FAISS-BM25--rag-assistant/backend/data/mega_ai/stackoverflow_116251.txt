I use the built in functions of jQuery for the actual detection: jQuery.each(jQuery.browser, function(i, val) {}); As for organization, that would depend on your application. I think putting this in an initialization code and then using the detection where you need it would be best. I still have issues where I have to detect Explorer on occasion. For example, when using jQuery, I have found that the parent() and next() functions will sometimes have different meanings in Explorer compared to Firefox.
