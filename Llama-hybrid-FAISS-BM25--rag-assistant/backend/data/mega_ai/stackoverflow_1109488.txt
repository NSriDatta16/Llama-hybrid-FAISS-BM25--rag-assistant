A whitelist is the safest solution. You mentioned in a comment about pasting from Word. Don't count on knowing all of Word's HTML elements, it often comes back with crap like for paragraphs (which generally only work as expected in Internet Explorer). You may be able to find most of these but there could easily be some dangerous tags, perhaps an tag or something. By the way, there really aren't that many HTML tags. The W3.org index of elements will help you.
