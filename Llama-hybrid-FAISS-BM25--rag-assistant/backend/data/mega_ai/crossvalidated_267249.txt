How do you interpret an arithmetic mean without knowing the underlying distribution?

Looking at Google Analytics, I can't help but think that the summary stats which present averages have the potential to be very misleading (and probably are, in practice). For some of these summary stats, there doesn't appear to be an easy way to determine the distribution of the numbers underlying the data. For other stats, there's apparently no way to determine the underlying distribution. It's clear enough that the underlying distributions for some of these stats are likely to be non-Gaussian. So I'd like to know - if you have "average" summary stats without knowing the distribution of the underlying numbers, how do you interpret or derive meaning from them?
