I always have my IDE on the right monitor, with all the editor windows and tools there. That leaves the left monitor for the programs to debug, my email client, wasting time on SO, and other stuff. You can have editor windows side-by-side even in older versions of VS by using vertical tab groups. This still works in VS2010 and allows you to rearrange them by dragging them between tab groups. Sometimes I put the output and stack windows on the left monitor, below the debugged program, in order to have more screen real estate for looking at the code.
