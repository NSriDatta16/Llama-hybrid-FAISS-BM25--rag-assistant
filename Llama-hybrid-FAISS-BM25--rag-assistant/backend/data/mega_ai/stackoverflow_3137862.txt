ASP.NET events symbol (yellow lightning bolt) missing

I created a new C# ASP.NET Web Application project in .NET 3.5 Then I dragged a button in my form. In the property window the events symbol (yellow lightning bolt) does not show. When I double click the box next to 'OnClientClick' in the properties Window no default event handler is created. When I double click the button in design view no event handler is created either. Any ideas on how I can get the events symbol and the automatic generation of a default event handler?
