jqueryui drag element multiple times

how can set up drag and drop to allow dragging of one element multiple times i have made something like this http://jsfiddle.net/28SMv/3/ but after draging an item from red to blue the element loses its "draggability" and i cant drag it once more and more. adding revert:true to draggable seems to work but then i need to remove helper:'clone' cant use them at the same time
