NSObjectController confusion binding to a class property. Help!

I'm teaching myself cocoa and enjoying the experience most of the time. I have been struggling all day with a simple problem that google has let me down on. I have read the Cocoa Bindings Program Topics and think I grok it but still can't solve my issue. I have a very simple class called MTSong that has various properties. I have used @synthesize to create getter/setters and can use KVC to change properties. i.e in my app controller the following works: mySong = [[MTSong alloc]init]; [mySong setValue:@"2" forKey:@"version"]; In case I am doing something noddy in my class code MTSong.h is: #import @interface MTSong : NSObject { NSNumber *version; NSString *name; } @property(readwrite, assign) NSNumber *version; @property(readwrite, assign) NSString *name; @end and MTSong.m is: #import "MTSong.h" @implementation MTSong - (id)init { [super init]; return self; } - (void)dealloc { [super dealloc]; } @synthesize version; @synthesize name; @end In Interface Builder I have a label (NSTextField) that I want to update whenever I use KVC to change the version of the song. I do the following: Drag NSObjectController object into the doc window and in the Inspector->Attributes I set: Mode: Class Class Name: MTSong Add a key called version and another called name Go to Inspector->Bindings->Controller Content Bind To: File's Owner (Not sure this is right...) Model Key Path: version Select the cell of the label and go to Inspector Bind to: Object Controller Controller Key: mySong Model Key Path: version I have attempted changing the Model Key Path in step 2 to "mySong" which makes more sense but the compiler complains. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Scott Update Post Comments I wasn't exposing mySong property so have changed my AppController.h to be: #import @class MTSong; @interface AppController : NSObject { IBOutlet NSButton *start; IBOutlet NSTextField *tf; MTSong *mySong; } -(IBAction)convertFile:(id)sender; @end I suspect File's owner was wrong as I am not using a document based application and I need to bind to the AppController, so step 2 is now: Go to Inspector->Bindings->Controller Content Bind To: App Controller Model Key Path: mySong I needed to change 3. to Select the cell of the label and go to Inspector Bind to: Object Controller Controller Key: selection Model Key Path: version All compiles and is playing nice!
