As Matt said, you do not have mediation because the third requirement of the causal steps approach is not met. I would encourage you to explore alternative options to the causal steps approach. It's quite possible you're getting a Type II error (since the M -> DV relationship was significant before it was entered into the mediation model). You should look into a bootstrapping method; this will increase your power. The attached reference below may be helpful to you. Hayes, A. F. (2009).
