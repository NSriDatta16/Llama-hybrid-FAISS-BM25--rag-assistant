In fact, RuleFit does excessive pruning on a random forest. It tries to find a set of rules generated by random forest to obtain accuracy as close as possible to the accuracy of random forest while reducing the number of rules tremendously. Finally, it builds a model consisting of simple and short rules which are extracted from random forest and builds a comprehensive and understandable model from random forest which is a black box model. How ? It builds a linear model from random forest rules and using an optimization method (Lasso) finds a sparse weight vector that determines which rules are the most important ones. At the end few rules have non-zero weights and the rest of the rules are removed from the ensemble. There are also similar methods with the same aim such as NodeHarvest , but RuleFit has better performance.
