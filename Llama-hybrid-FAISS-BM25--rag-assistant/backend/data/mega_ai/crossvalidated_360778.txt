Generally even if you are not sure of the statistical association between the data, then it is hard for DL to discover anything new. https://www.quora.com/How-important-is-statistics-to-deep-learning http://blog.shakirm.com/ml-series/a-statistical-view-of-deep-learning/ Garbage in garbage out. But if the pattern is simple enough then it is always possible discover the simple pattern unsupervised. The degree of difficulty will correspond with the amount of data to discover the correlation, generally.
