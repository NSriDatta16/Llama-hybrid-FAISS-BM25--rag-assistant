Based on your example, it seems like there is a correlation between F1 and F2-- note that F2 seems to follow the movement of F1. I cannot confirm if practically we won't have this situation. Talking about Random walk theory, by definition, is any time series that follows random walk properties, that is, it is not stationary; its variance increases over time and covariance changes along the time. If your F1 has these properties then it is considered to be a random walk. Visually, you also can check this with acf function in R. Thanks Tim for pointing out that I should describe the relationship as correlation , and not causality
