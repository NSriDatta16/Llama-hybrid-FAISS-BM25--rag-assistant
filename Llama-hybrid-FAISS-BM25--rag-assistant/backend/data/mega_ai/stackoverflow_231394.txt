You just do it the way you'd normally generate an HTML page, except it is not wrapped in HTML HEAD or BODY tags. It's just the HTML fragment that will be added to your page. Everything you "echo" becomes part of the output. You can do it is pieces or all on one go, it doesn't matter because it call gets sent to the browser as "the response" as one chunk anyways.
