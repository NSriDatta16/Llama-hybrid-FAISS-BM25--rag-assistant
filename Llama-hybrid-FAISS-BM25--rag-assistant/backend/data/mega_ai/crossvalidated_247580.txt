If I understand correctly your problem the best approach approach is to fit the following model with the parameters $I_0$, d, F, $\lambda$, f. You adopt a prior on $\lambda$, $f$ that is given by the current measurements that you have: $ \lambda \sim N(\lambda_0, \sigma_\lambda^2) $ $ f \sim N(f_0, \sigma_f^2) $ And then you have a Gaussian likelihood on the rings intensities. $ I_i|r_i ~ \sim N(\frac{I_0}{1+F sin(\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda}\frac{f}{f^2+r_i^2})}, e_i^2) $ where $I_i$ are the measurements of the intensity at the radius $r_i$ and uncertainty $e_i$. Than you can MCMC sample the posterior. The 1D marginal posteriors on d and F will properly reflect the uncertainty on f, $\lambda$.
