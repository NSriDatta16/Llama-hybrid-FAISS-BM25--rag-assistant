SharpPcap handles packet capturing in the same manner as Wireshark, so you can set filters to limit the packet being captured to a specific port the same way in SharpPcap as you can in wireshark. Except, SharpPcap will be a much lighter weight option vs wireshark. Download the SharpPcap source tree and look at the Example05.SetFilter. To narrow down the results so you capture only the packets you want to see you'll need to employ a few filters. Pcap uses a common language across all applications that use it do specify the filters to set. Capture programs that use winpcap (windows) or libpcap (*nix) include, sharppcap, wireshark, pcap.net, winpcap, libpcap, tcpdump, etc... For a great resource on how to use pcap filters see this link . Here are the filters you need: ether host ehost port port Where the ehost is the MAC address of the computer sending/receiving the packets and the port is the port you want to monitor. So the full filter string would be. SetFilter("ether host ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff and port 60"); The MAC and port here are for illustration purposes only, you'd obviously change them with the values that pertain to your specific setup. This, used in the SetFilter example will simply print out a line of info with the time of when the packet was captured to the command line every time a packet is captured and meets the criteria if your filter. If you want more detailed info about the packet, such as info from the headers or the packet's payload, you'll need to parse the incoming raw packet. Be sure to ask for help on the sourceforge project's forum if you need some tips on how to do this. The project developers are very active and always willing to help.
