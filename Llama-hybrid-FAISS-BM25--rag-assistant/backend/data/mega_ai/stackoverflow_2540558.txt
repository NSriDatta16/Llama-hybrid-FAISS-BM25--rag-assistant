I wouldn't recommend using the onXXX-handlers (like onClick) directly as this will replace any previouly attached handler. This can actually change/destroy behavior of the page. If you are working with a web page which is not under your control you better use attachEvent : (tmp as IHTMLElement2).attachEvent('onclick', callbackProcedureDisp); And don't forget to detach with detachEvent : (tmp as IHTMLElement2).detachEvent('onclick', callbackProcedureDisp); Attention: it is possible to attach the same handler multiple times. In this case your handler would also be called multiple times. If you are only interested in onclick you could just add one handler to the root element and don't have to travel through all elements. MSDN states the event bubbles, so you could just attach one event handler to the document element and check the srcElement member of the IHTMLEventObj every time the event fires.
