I suppose that you might be able to adjust the size of the data being read, even though the storage format is completely different. So, if your image is 24-bit, you can possibly use a 32-bit or 64-bit (if 64-bit compiled) datatype and keep packing the data in two variables of these types from both images and compare the two for equality. This might speed stuff up a bit :)
