Need Advice, Classification Problem in Python: Should I use Decision tree, Random Forests, or Logistic Regression?

Overview The data set I am working with considers a team that annually plays a 5-game home schedule. My goal is to identify the fans that are most likely to defect for the upcoming season, meaning not renew their season pass. This is my Y variable. Description of Dataset The dataset contains 2 sheets. The first sheet has 17 x variables that influence whether or not someone will likely defect. (i.e., price of ticket, whether or not they used their ticket for games 1-5, age, income, and so on). This sheet is data taken from the previous year, so I also have the actual Y values (those who did and did not renew their season pass for the previous season) The second sheet is where I will make my predictions for the upcoming season on whether or not someone will renew their season pass. The X variables are updated and already given for this current year. All I need to do is used the given data and predict the Y variable (whether someone will renew their season pass or default) Suggestions Wanted I need advice on which classification method would provide me with the highest accuracy. These are the three models I know, so please only suggest one of the three: Decision tree, Random Forests, or Logistic Regression?
