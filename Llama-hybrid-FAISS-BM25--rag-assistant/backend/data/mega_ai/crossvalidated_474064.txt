How to multiply a likelihood by a prior?

I'm trying to wrap my brain about computations in bayesian stats. The concept of multiplying a prior by a likelihood is a bit confusing to me, especially in a continuous case. As an example, suppose I believe that heights of men in the US are truly distributed as ~N(mu=5.5,sigma=1). And my prior belief is that they are distributed as ~N(mu=5,sigma=1). Using a pdf function, I can compute the likelihood of seeing each observation given the parameter as follows (python code): First, samples from the true distribution. import numpy as np ## loc = mu, scale = sigma, sample size = size heights = np.random.normal(loc=5.5,scale=1,size=1000) Then the likelihood def pdf(data, mean=5, variance=1): den = (np.sqrt(2*np.pi*variance)) num = np.exp(-(np.square(data - mean)/(2*variance))) return num/den likelihoods = [pdf(obs) for obs in heights] Let's look at the first 10 heights and their likelihoods: [(5.426044952743029, 0.36432983407060887), (5.7354234636458585, 0.30441530694083374), (2.6187512313984795, 0.02342125390815794), (4.048376000047023, 0.25366706186458265), (5.654522163377861, 0.3220211139284403), (5.051880755747615, 0.3984057424429508), (6.038515919083698, 0.2326555628191281), (6.220977020106613, 0.1893172736081514), (4.557736652986651, 0.3617734950544695), (5.601408005492896, 0.33294288249916787)] Now...I'm confused on how I multiply this finite set of likelihoods with a continuous prior distribution. What actually is happening?
