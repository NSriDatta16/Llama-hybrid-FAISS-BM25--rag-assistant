Google analytics-style custom report builder UI

I'm looking for a reporting engine/UI that can be integrated into a product, which has a UI along the lines of Google Analytics' Custom Reports builder. Is anyone aware of such a thing? The data is in our case is not page views/visitors/etc, but is similar in nature, in that there are limited entities or types of data, but each entity has many attributes/columns and many different ways of aggregating data (or in GA-style speak, metrics and dimensions). The analytics-style UI is very intuitive and allows many reports to be created in powerful ways, without having to know SQL. I have preference for a web-based tool (seeing that it is 2010 and this is a web app -- I mention only because it seems the vast majority of reporting tools still have only a non-web-based creation tool). Example UI screenshot: alt text http://gregmaclellan.com/analytics-custom-search.png you can drag metrics from the sidebar into the dotted rectangles - these become the columns (and determine the underlying entities used for the data) You can select dimensions to add grouping
