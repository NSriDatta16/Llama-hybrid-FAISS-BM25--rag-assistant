Instead of using median values, etc., I would highly recommend looking at the missRanger package (currently in development on Github) or the R package missForest). Both of these packages use random forests to first impute your data using a method similar to multiple imputation via chained equations (MICE). This would be the appropriate imputation method to use as it corresponds closely to your actual analysis model. You can then use all your data without having to worry about dropping individual rows due to missing observations. In addition, the imputed values will be far more realistic than simply selecting medians or modes. You can use just one filled-in imputed data set for your analyses, but the best way to incorporate uncertainty over missing values is to run multiple runs of these imputation methods, and then estimate your model on each of the resulting datasets (i.e., multiple imputation) and then combine the estimates using Rubin's rules (see R package mitools).
