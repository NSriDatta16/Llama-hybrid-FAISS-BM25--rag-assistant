I did some researching on fmt:formatNumber ... I think using - is causing some weird problem because , is the only safe grouping separator. Based on the documentation, it seems like you can comment special character using single quotes, but I don't think it applies in your case. So, here's my workaround:- ${fn:replace(result, ",", "-")} This works for me. Basically, I use commas instead of dashes, then use the replace function to convert it back to dashes... not quite an elegant solution.
