The question shouldn't be can you but should you. Yes you can. No you shouldn't. Instead of using a tool designed to manage source diffs for binary storage, instead get an artifact repository manager like Nexus to manage the binaries. Repository managers have tons of features designed especially to host, share, promote, secure binaries that you don't find in a typical scm. For example an scm has no capability to appropriately deal with maven snapshots. If you want more information about why you should use a repository manager, take a look at the documents here .
