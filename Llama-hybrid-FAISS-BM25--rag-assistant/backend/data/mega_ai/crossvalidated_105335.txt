You would instead compare the values in your group (i.e. for which the condition exists) with the values not in your group (i.e. have two sets with no days in common), but you can't ignore the time structure and pretend you have independence. Returns may tend to be relatively uncorrelated (mostly, more or less), but even if that's the case you can't ignore the heteroskedasticity (the time-structure that people use ARCH and GARCH for). One approach might be to fit some model to the data that describes such anticipated features of the data and which includes a mean-level predictor which is 1 or 0 to indicate that grouping relating to what you want to check for I mentioned in the first paragraph - everything in the condition vs not in the condition) and make your comparison that way (by testing whether the coefficient for that dummy was different from 0).
