simulating two correlated lognormal AR(1) time series

I'd like to simulate 2 correlated lognormal AR1 time series. I have already found this post which is the answer for 2 Normal AR1 time series How to simulate two correlated AR(1) time series? I've found the rlnorm.rplus function from the composition package which allows to do the same as the rmvnorm function but for lognormale times series. I did some trial to combine information from the post mentioned with the rlnorm.rplus function but I've been unsuccessful. Is someone able to show me how I should proceed ?
