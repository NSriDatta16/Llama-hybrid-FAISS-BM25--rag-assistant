How to convert sequence of words in to numbers which are input to RNN/LSTM?

I am watching online videos and tutorials about use of RNN/LSTM for NLP but none of them explain how to convert the sequences of words into digitized input to the neural networks? I am looking for intuitive understanding but answers with python code are also welcome. For example, how do I input; "grass is green and sun is hot" to my RNN/LSTM?
