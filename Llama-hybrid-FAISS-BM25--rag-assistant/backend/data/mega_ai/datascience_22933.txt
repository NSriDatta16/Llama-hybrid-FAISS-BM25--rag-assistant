The error measure in the loss function is a 'statistical distance'; in contrast to the popular and preliminary understanding of distance between two vectors in Euclidean space. With 'statistical distance' we are attempting to map the 'dis-similarity' between estimated model and optimal model to Euclidean space. There is no constricting rule regarding the formulation of this 'statistical distance', but if the choice is appropriate then a progressive reduction in this 'distance' during optimization translates to a progressively improving model estimation. Consequently, the choice of 'statistical distance' or error measure is related to the underlying data distribution. In fact, there are several well defined distance/error measures for different classes of statistical distributions. It is advisable to select the error measure based on the distribution of the data in hand. It just so happens that the Gaussian distribution is ubiquitous, and consequently its associated distance measure, the L2-norm is the most popular error measure. However, this is not a rule and there exist real world data for which an 'efficient'* optimization implementation would adopt a different error measure than the L2-norm. Consider the set of Bregman divergences . The canonical representation of this divergence measure is the L2-norm (squared error). It also includes relative entropy (Kullback-Liebler divergence), generalized Euclidean distance (Mahalanobis metric), and Itakura-Saito function. You can read more about it in this paper on Functional Bregman Divergence and Bayesian Estimation of Distributions . Take-away: The L2-norm has an interesting set of properties which makes it a popular choice for error measure (other answers here have mentioned some of these, sufficient to the scope of this question), and the squared error will be the appropriate choice most of the time. Nevertheless, when the data distribution requires it, there are alternate error measures to choose from, and the choice depends in large part on the formulation of the optimization routine. *The 'appropriate' error measure would make the loss function convex for the optimization, which is very helpful, as opposed to some other error measure where the loss function is non-convex and thereby notoriously difficult.
