In general, it's best to use system instead of backticks because: system encourages the caller to check the return code of the command. system allows "indirect object" notation, which is more secure and adds flexibility. Backticks are culturally tied to shell scripting, which might not be common among readers of the code. Backticks use minimal syntax for what can be a heavy command. One reason users might be temped to use backticks instead of system is to hide STDOUT from the user. This is more easily and flexibly accomplished by redirecting the STDOUT stream: my $cmd = 'command > /dev/null'; system($cmd) == 0 or die "system $cmd failed: $?" Further, getting rid of STDERR is easily accomplished: my $cmd = 'command 2> error_file.txt > /dev/null'; In situations where it makes sense to use backticks, I prefer to use the qx{} in order to emphasize that there is a heavy-weight command occurring. On the other hand, having Another Way to Do It can really help. Sometimes you just need to see what a command prints to STDOUT. Backticks, when used as in shell scripts are just the right tool for the job.
