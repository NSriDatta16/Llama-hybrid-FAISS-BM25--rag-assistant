Why does my Perl program complain "Can't locate URI.pm in @INC"?

I'm new to Perl. I get the following error when I run a script: Can't locate URI.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/local/packages/perl_remote/5.6.1/lib/5.6.1/i86pc-solaris /usr/local/packages/perl_remote/5.6.1/lib/5.6.1 /usr/local/packages/perl_remote/5.6.1/lib/site_perl/5.6.1/i86pc-solaris /usr/local/packages/perl_remote/5.6.1/lib/site_perl/5.6.1 /usr/local/packages/perl_remote/5.6.1/lib/site_perl .) at (eval 2) line 3.

BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at txotf_0_install.pl line 35. What could be the possible reasons of this and how do I get the script to work. Any help will be appreciated.
