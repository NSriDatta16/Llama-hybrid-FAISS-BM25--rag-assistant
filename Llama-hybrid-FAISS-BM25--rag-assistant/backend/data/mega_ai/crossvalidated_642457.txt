How to approach dataset splitting for building time-series models?

Suppose I have 100 observations of time series data $x_1,...,x_{100}$ , and that I want to split the data into a train set, a validation set, and a test set. I know that the train set must have smaller indices than the validation set and test set, but I am torn about how to handle the validation and test sets. To illustrate, suppose that my train set is $x_1,...,x_{80}$ . Option 1: Let my validation set have smaller indices than my test set, e.g. give indices 81-90 to the validation set and indices 91-100 to the test set. But in this case, the test set is "further away" from the training data, and I would expect this to underestimate performance. Option 2: I could position the test set before the validation set, in which case the problem is the opposite, where hyperparameters are chosen based on performance on data that is "far away" from the training data. For some reason, this sounds a bit better than option 1. Option 3: I could have my validation and test sets alternate observations, so the odd indices could go to the validation set while the even indices could go to the test set. This sounds nice, but there would probably be a lot of correlation between validation and test set, and I don't think the performance on the test set would still be an unbiased estimator, which would partially defeat the purpose of having a separate test set. Is one of these three approaches clearly better than the others? Is there a better 4th option?
