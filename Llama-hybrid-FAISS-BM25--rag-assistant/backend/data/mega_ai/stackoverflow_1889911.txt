Wordpress theme problems

I've been making a wordpress theme recently and just now some of the code just stopped working. The post formatting disappeared and now I just have a paragraph with text inside it for each post! Here's the php code for the post: "> " rel="bookmark"> Not Found Sorry, but you are looking for something that isn't here. This is all the code in the index.php file in the theme folder. I have some metadata of the post on the left side of the post and the actual post on the right side. This is what is outputs to the page. (This is only what is inside the #content div. There was too much for me to post everything.) This is some random text that’s added just for effect. Thanks for the consideration. This is some random text that’s added just for effect.
