1. A Bayesian approach: You could model your changing intercept as a stochastic process $\{C_t\}$ . A natural assumption for modeling stochastic process $\{C_t\}$ is that it's a Markov process , that the past is independent of the future given the present. Since you don't directly observe $C_t$ , this would be a hidden Markov model . You would update beliefs $C_t$ from the data using recursive Bayesian estimation (also known as a Bayesian filter). Every period you observe the vector $\begin{bmatrix} X_t \\ Y_t \end{bmatrix}$ . Using Bayes rule , you combine (i) your prior beliefs about the distribution of $C_{t-1}$ (and how $C_t$ evolves) with (ii) your observed vector at time $t$ to obtain the posterior, the new beliefs about the distribution of $C_t$ . Some common approaches to Bayesian filtering are: Assume normality all over the place and use the Kalman filter . Take a more flexible, numerical/simulation approach and use a particle filter . Bayesian filtering might look overwhelming the first time you see it, but it's conceptually quite intuitive once you get into it. The whole idea is just to recursively apply Bayes Rule. The tricky part (IMHO) is keeping track of all the variables, not getting lost in the algebra, and not making simple mistakes. 2. Other ideas: Something else you might want to look up are statistical tests for a structural break . Does intercept $c$ come from linear regression? You could estimate $c$ based upon some rolling window of the past $T$ time periods. It's a bit ad-hoc for an observation last period to get the same weight as an observation T periods ago while an observation T+1 periods ago gets 0 weight, but rolling windows can work reasonably well in practice.
