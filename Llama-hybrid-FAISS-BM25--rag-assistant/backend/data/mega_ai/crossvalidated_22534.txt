This seems pretty unsurprising to me. In your model, the ICC can be interpreted as the proportion of the variance not explained by covariates that is due to variation between classes. If instead of using "proportion of fully prejudiced respondents in the class", you used " average level of prejudice within each class" as a covariate, this would certainly reduce the ICC to zero, as this covariate explains all the variation between classes by definition. So if "proportion of fully prejudiced respondents in the class" is strongly correlated with "average level of prejudice within each class", as you might well expect, it's not surprising that it also reduces the ICC to zero.
