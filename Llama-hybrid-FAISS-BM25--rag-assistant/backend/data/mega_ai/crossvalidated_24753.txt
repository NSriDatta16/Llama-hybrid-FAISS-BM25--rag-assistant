Interpreting Granger causality test's results

I'm trying to educate myself on Granger Causality. I've read the posts on this site and several good articles online. I also came across a very helpful tool, the Bivariate Granger Causality - Free Statistics Calculator , that allows you to enter your time series and calculate the Granger Stats. Below, is the output from the sample data included on the site. I have also taken a crack at interpreting the results. My Questions: Is my interpretation directionally correct? What key insights have I overlooked? Also what is the meaning and interpretation of the CCF charts? (I'm assuming CCF is cross correlation.) Here are the results and plots that I have interpreted: Summary of computational transaction Raw Input view raw input (R code) Raw Output view raw output of R engine Computing time 2 seconds R Server 'Herman Ole Andreas Wold' @ wold.wessa.net Granger Causality Test: Y = f(X) Model Res.DF Diff.

DF F p-value Complete model 356 Reduced model 357 -1 0.0929541667364279 0.760632773377753 My interpretation: Test was based upon 357 data points and was performed with a lag value of 1 The p-value of 0.0000294 means I can reject the null hypothesis that x does not cause y for the Y = f(x). The p-value of .76 allows me to accept the null for X = f(Y) The fact that first hypothesis was rejected and second accepted is a good thing I'm a little rusty on my F-test so I don't really have anything to say on this for now. I'm also not sure how to interpret the CCF graph. I really appreciate it if any of you who are well versed with Granger-causality could let me know if I'm interpeting this correctly and also fill in some of the blanks. Thanks for your help.
