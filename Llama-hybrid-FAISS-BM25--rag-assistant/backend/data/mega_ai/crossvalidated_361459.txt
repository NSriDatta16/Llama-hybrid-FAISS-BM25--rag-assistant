You could consider formulating a Bayesian model (e.g. a Bayesian logistic regression - if you somehow know subtree marginal distributions, you could use a suitable likelihood for that). You can then encapsulate you beliefs that you appear to have into priors for the model and fit the model to the data with observed values. This would allow you to (multiple) impute the missing values based on the posterior predictive distribution.
