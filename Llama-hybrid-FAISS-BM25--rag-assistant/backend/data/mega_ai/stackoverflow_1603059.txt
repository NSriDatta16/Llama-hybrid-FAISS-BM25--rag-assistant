I don't know of any existing ones, but it should be too hard to catch most of these with a set of regular expressions in a custom validation. Improper capitalization is a hard one to catch because of proper names and acronyms. before_validation :filter_lameness def filter_lameness # reduce exclamation marks content.gsub!(/![!1]+/, "!") # Proper capitalization. content.gsub!(/(\.\s*[a-z])/, $1.upcase) # capital starts sentence content.gsub!(/([A-Z]{5,})/, $1.capitalize) # lowercases all but first letter in a string of capitals. Minimum length 5. # etc... return true # needed in case the last gsub matches nothing, otherwise validation returns nil and will fail end Personally I'd be tempted to keep track of users' infractions to the style guide and pin them with demerit badges after enough offenses, for public humliation.
