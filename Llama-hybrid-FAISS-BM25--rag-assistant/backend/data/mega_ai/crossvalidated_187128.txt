Any binary classification approach will do. In this category support vector machines usually perform quite well, even without a lot of data. Given the low input dimensionality (10), you can likely benefit from nonlinear kernel functions, such as the RBF kernel. An important step in machine learning is optimizing hyperparameters ($C$ and $\gamma$ for an SVM with RBF kernel). For that task you could use software like Optunity . You wouldn't need to change algorithm unless you plan to get a significant amount of additional features or huge amounts of data.
