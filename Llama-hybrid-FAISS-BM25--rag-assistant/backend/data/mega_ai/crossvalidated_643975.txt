Mixed model realized value of random variable

In Andrew Gelman's book "Data Analysis using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models" , page number 258 group $j$ random intercepts $\alpha_j$ is estimated based on this expression $$\alpha_j = \frac{n_j/\sigma_y^2} {n_j/\sigma_y^2 + 1/\sigma_{\alpha}^2} (\hat{y_j} - X_j{\beta}) + \frac{1/\sigma_{\alpha}^2} {n_j/\sigma_y^2 + 1/\sigma_{\alpha}^2} {\mu_{\alpha}}$$ Here $n_j$ number of measurements in each group $j$ $σ_y$ represents variability within groups $σ_α$ represent variability between groups $\mu_α$ represents unconditional average of y What is the implication of including group variable ( Study Site ID ) as both fixed effects and random effects vs just random effects. I like to understand the difference in the context of the expression for $\alpha_j$ mentioned above. Thanks in advance for any advice.
