You can create two sets s1 and s2, containing all words from first and second paragraph respectively, and intersect them: s1.retainAll(s2) . Sounds easy enough. update Works for me Set s1 = new HashSet (Arrays.asList("abc xyz 123".split("\\s"))); Set s2 = new HashSet (Arrays.asList("xyz 000 111".split("\\s"))); s1.retainAll(s2); System.out.println(s1.size()); Don't forget to remove empty word from both sets.
