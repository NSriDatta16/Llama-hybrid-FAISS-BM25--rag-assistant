Not all implementations of List allow for elements to be null. An example is RoleList::add(role) that throws an exception when adding a Null value. This documentation prepares you for such an encounter, encouraging you to check the documentation of whatever list you're working with to see if it's a concern, or to err on the side of caution if you are unable to check it. Tracking down NPE's is not fun. Knowing documentation (provided good documentation exists) can save a lot of headaches.
