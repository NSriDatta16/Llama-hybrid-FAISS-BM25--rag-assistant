Does there a non-linear SVM exist?

SVM is a linear classifier. But some articles talk about non-linear SVM that is quite contradictory. A "non-linear SVM" can perform non-linear classification over a dataset that is not linearly separable. What we do is increase the dimension of the dataset to make it linearly separable and present it to SVM. So the SVM remained linear and we format the dataset to feed it to the SVM classifier. Is my concept wrong somewhere?
