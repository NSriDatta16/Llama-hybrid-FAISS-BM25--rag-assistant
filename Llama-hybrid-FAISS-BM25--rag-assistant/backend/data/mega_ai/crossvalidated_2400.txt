Grünwald and Dawid's paper Game theory, maximum entropy, minimum discrepancy and robust Bayesian decision theory discuss generalisations of the traditional notion of entropy. Given a loss, its associated entropy function is the mapping from a distribution to the minimal achievable expected loss for that distribution. The usual entropy function is the generalised entropy associated with the log loss. Other choices of losses yield different entropy such as the Rényi entropy.
