It is really hard to plot more than 3 dimensions. Maybe you can afford visualise a fourth dimension if one of those is time, so the end result is a video. In practice it makes sense to use a dimensionality reduction technique. For example PCA, or just eigendecomposition. Using these or many of the similar techniques you project the $n$ dimensions to 2 or 3 that can be handled by humans. The trade off is that depending on your data that projection may be really bad and hide what's really going on with the data. There are ways to assess the quality of these visualisations. For example by checking out the relative values of the first two or three eigenvalues compared to the rest of the them.
