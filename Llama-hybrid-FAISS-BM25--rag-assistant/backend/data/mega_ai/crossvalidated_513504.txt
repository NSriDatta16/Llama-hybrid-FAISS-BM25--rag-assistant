Test for heterogeneity of data in regression

I am running regression where it is suggested in the literature heterogeneity may occur. We have customers who come back more than one time (every time they come back we are rated again). I am running models where these multiple cases exist (the dependent variable will be income and separately employment the former a linear model and the latter a logistic regression). I have been looking for a test of heterogeneity, but other than meta-analysis (which I am not doing) I have not found one. Note that I don't care about the standard errors being influenced by the heterogeneity if that matters. I have the entire population. But in this case it has been suggested that the heterogeneity might bias the calculated effect size (the slopes).
