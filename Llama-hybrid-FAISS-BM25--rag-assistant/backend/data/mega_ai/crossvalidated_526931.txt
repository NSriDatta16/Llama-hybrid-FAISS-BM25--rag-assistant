How to get the 3-digit SIC code from Datastream and merge ISIC to SIC?

When trying to replicate a paper, I faced the problem in merging two datasets. When merging an ISIC-related dataset ( dataset A ) to a SIC-related Datastream dataset ( Dataset B ), I faced a problem with the three-digit SIC code. A paper shows how to match these two datasets: Export data used to construct Export market leniency laws measure comes from CEPII TradeProd Database that has bilateral trade flows for more than 200 countries at ISIC industry level over 1980-2006. We match them to the three-digit SIC and average over the respective values within the three-digit SIC in case multiple three-digit ISIC codes match to three-digit SIC codes. I have two questions as below: 1> How to get the 3-digit SIC from Datastream. Thompson Reuter described that item WC07023 is SIC Code 3, but when looking at this, I saw mainly 4-digit code. I show a part of my dataset B as below As can be seen, in column WC07023 , even column WC07022 (SIC Code 2), we have 4-digit codes rather than three. And this is the ISIC 3-digit code from the dataset A 2> And could you explain to me the author's approach based on this sentence, it is quite ambiguous to me: We match them to the three-digit SIC and average over the respective values within the three-digit SIC in case multiple three-digit ISIC codes match to three-digit SIC codes.
