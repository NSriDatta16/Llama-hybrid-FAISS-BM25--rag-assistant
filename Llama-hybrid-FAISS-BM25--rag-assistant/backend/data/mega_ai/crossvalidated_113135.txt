Normalized likelihoods

AIC (BIC) model selection methods are widely used. These methods can select non-nested models unlike likelihood ratio type selection that requires model to be nested. The AIC has definition $\text{AIC}=-2\text{log}L+2V$ where $L$ is the likelihood of the model and $V$ is the effective number of paramters in that model. Take for instance making a decision whether to use a binary or an ordinal logistic regression model. You receive the response variable in an ordinal form with labels say $1,2,3 $. But it is required from you to predict observations with label $\{1,2\}$ as one group and observations with label $3$ as another. Therefore you have two ways to go 1)Group the data into two groups with labels $0$ for observation with labels $\{1,2\}$ and $1$ for for observations with label $3$ and use a binary logistic model. 2)Use the original $3$ labels $1,2,3$ in an ordinal logistic regression model and end up using the boundary from your ordinal model that separates observations with labels $2$ from observations with labels $3$. Since it is an ordinal model it will automatically be the boundary that separates group $\{1,2\}$ from group $3$ I will represent the two scenarios with plots. Blue and red lines are boundaries from an ordinal model, black line is the boundary from a binary model. Black points are labelled with 1, red points 2 and blue points 3. Therefore as described above I am either using the blue line when I choose to use an ordinal model or the black line when I choose to use the binary model. Using the AIC to choose either the binary or the ordinal model is possible. But the two models differ in two things. 1) Likelihood scale 2) Parameter scale. Is there a normalization that can be done so that the two models can be compared in terms of their AICs?
