Scoring races + ranking index, with Bayesian approach

Challenge: Is this the best approach for scoring multicompetitor races? How do I account for both uncertain prior & uncertain evidence when scoring? Case: athletes getting scores in each race, relative to their performance. Athletes also getting ranking index based on their X best scores within the ranking period. That is, two scoring processes. Idea: Using a Bayesian approach for both scoring processes, like this: w ∗ R + (1 − w) ∗ C Process 1 (scoring a race) Estimate estStandardPerformance (the estimated performance that would give a score of 100%), based on known parameters (such as distance). Calculate predicted performance for each athlete, based on their (weighted) index. predPerformance = estStandardPerformance / Index . Compare the difference between actual performance and predicted performance for each athlete and take the average, k = avg(actualPerformance / predPerformance) . The average difference = k , a correction factor that is applied to estStandardPerformance to get a more correct StandardPerformance (by taking into account all unknown factors that affect the performances on race day). StandardPerformance = estStandardPerformance * k Calculate estimated score for each athlete: estScore = standardPerformance / racePerformance Score = w * estScore + (1 - w) * avgEstScores (where avgEstScores is the mean of all athletes' estScore and w = v / (v + m) , with v being the total number of athletes in the race and m a constant, that I would probably set to around 0.5-1). #6 is the Bayesian-style equation that basically gives lower scores the fewer the athletes. BUT, since predicted performance in #2 is based on each athlete's Index (which is not a point estimate, but a Probability Density Function, PDF), how do I take both uncertainties into account when scoring ? That is, there are degrees of uncertainty both for predictedPerformance (depending on each runner's Index PDF) as well as for Score (with more athletes = higher certainty). Process 2 (index based on scores) Using the same formula as in #4 above, we can calculate Index for an athlete from their best X scores in the ranking period. Index = w * meanScore + (1 - w) * meanAll (where meanScore is the mean of the athlete's best X scores, and meanAll is the mean of ALL athletes' Index. w is again v / (v / M) , where v now is the number of races the athlete has (up to a maximum of X) and m is another constant, in this case around 0.05. And then Index should not be a Point Estimate, but a Probability Density Function (higher uncertainty with fewer ranked races). How can I calculate this uncertainty, in order to take that into account in future race scoring processes ? Summary I think this approach would work pretty well, by giving lower scores and index when certainty is less. My main challenge is how to account for the double uncertainty factors in the first process of scoring a race and particularly the Index uncertainty . Input welcome!
