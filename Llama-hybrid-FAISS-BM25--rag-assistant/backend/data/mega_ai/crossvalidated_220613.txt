Interpreting the direction of an interaction effect in Binary Logistic Regression

I have reviewed prior posts in the forum and can't seem to find an answer to a problem I am having with interpreting an interaction: The goal: interpret the direction of the interaction term. Variables: I have two continuous predictors (heart rate [HR] and pupil dilatation [PD]), predicting a dichotomous outcome (diagnosis of conduct disorder - no=0, yes=1) I am controlling for age and gender. Results: The interaction between HR and PD is significant, the beta is positive (suggesting a positive interaction - as HR increases so does PD). And my odds ratio is above 1 (3.1) so I interpret the odds ratio as meaning an increase in both HR and PD elevates the likelihood of being diagnosed with conduct disorder. Here's the catch; I am not sure if I am looking at this correctly. I have been told that the positive interaction could indicate HR and PD are both negative resulting in a positive interaction also. Therefore, how do I find out if the positive interaction means it is high HR and high PD or if it is low HR and low PD ? My closing thoughts are that the odds ratio may help explain this but I am not entirely sure if this is accurate. I am open to suggestions, and would love to have some feedback on how to interpret this interaction term in regards to the direction of effect. Many thanks in advance
