What is Teacher Helping technique?

I read this paper, but I am having trouble understanding what Teacher Helping technique (page 3) is in context of RNN. Can someone explain to me what it is? Please assume I don't have much experience in statistics. I'll be glad if this explanation would be as simple as possible (I'll be even more grateful for some example).
