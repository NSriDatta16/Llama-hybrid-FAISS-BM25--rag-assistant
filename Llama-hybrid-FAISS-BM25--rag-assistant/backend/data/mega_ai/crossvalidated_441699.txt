Yes, there are. Goodfellow's GAN tutorial lists a taxonomy of such methods. Some example approaches that fall into Maximum Likelihood category: autoregressive methods. Use $p_{\theta}(x) = \prod_{i} p(x_i|(x_j)_{j . Example: Pixel-Recurrent NN. variational methods. Use $p_{\theta}(x) = \int p(x|z) p(z) dz$ Where $p(x|z)$ is learnable, prior distribution on latent variables $p(z)$ is something simple (Gaussian for example) Example: variational autoencoder. flow models. These are like nonlinear Independent component analysis. If you want more, just google 'deep generative models' - there are several courses on these methods, for example from Stanford.
