First, when you hear that it's good to keep controller code to a minimum, this mainly refers to keeping each action method as thin as possible (put logic instead into business classes, not into Views and ViewModels.) It seems you're doing this, which is great. As for having "too many" action methods, this is a judgment call. It could actually be a sign of good organization, that you're having each action focus on one thing. Also, maybe you're using actions specifically for use with RenderAction? And, it could just be the nature of your solution that there are many things to do relating to your Controller's theme. So, my guess is that you're probably fine. However, to make sure, on note paper break out the controller into 2 or 3 controllers, and sketch out how your stories would work moving from action to action. And if you find that your workflow works with more controllers, you should break it out. Especially if you're going to be adding to this functionality later. The sooner your break it out the better.
