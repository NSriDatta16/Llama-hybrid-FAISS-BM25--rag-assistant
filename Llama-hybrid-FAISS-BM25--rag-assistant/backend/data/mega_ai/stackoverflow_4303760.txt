You cannot manipulate image directly with Javascript other than resizing them (and this is technivally done with CSS, not Javascript...). The best solution would be to use RaphaÃ«l ; it will allow you to ratate, but also drag and drop, and it is also built using JQuery. Of course you could alternately use different image states and use them as "sprites" for your rotated rectangles, however you will not play extensibility there. (GD is a bad design, don't use that.)
