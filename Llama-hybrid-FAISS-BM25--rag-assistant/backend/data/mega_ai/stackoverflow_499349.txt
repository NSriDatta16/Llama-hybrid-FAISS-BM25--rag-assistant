It's not clear to me how this will do what you want. Consider this trival 3D case: 001 ------ 101 |\ |\ | \ | \ | 011 ------ 111 | | | | | | | | 000 -|---- 100 | \ | \ | \ | \ | 010 ------ 110 which can be "Hilbertized" by the following path: 001 -----> 101 \ \ \ \ 011 111 ^ | | | 000 | 100 | \ | \ | \ | \ V 010 110 into the 1D order: 000 -> 010 -> 011 -> 001 -> 101 -> 111 -> 110 -> 100 Here's the nasty bit. Consider the list of pairs and 1D distances below: 000 : 100 -> 7 010 : 110 -> 5 011 : 111 -> 3 001 : 101 -> 1 In all cases, the left- and right-hand values are the same 3D distance from each other (+/- 1 in the first position), which seem to imply similar "spatial locality". But linearizing by any choice of dimensional ordering (y, then z, then z, in the above example) breaks that locality. Another way of saying this is that taking a starting point and ordering the remaining points by their distance from that starting point will provide significantly different results. Taking 000 as the start, for example: 1D ordering : distance 3D ordering : distance ---------------------- ---------------------- 010 : 1 001,010,100 : 1 011,101,110 : sqrt(2) 111 : sqrt(3) 011 : 2 001 : 3 101 : 4 111 : 5 110 : 6 100 : 7 This effect grows exponentially with the number of dimensions (assuming that each dimension has the same "size").
