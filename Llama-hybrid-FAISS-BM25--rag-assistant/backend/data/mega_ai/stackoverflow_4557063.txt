The car demo you're talking about was using something called Molehill, which is the code-name for Adobe's upcoming 3D expansion for Flash. It's not available anywhere yet, it's in very early pre-release. That's different from Adobe AIR for Android, which is a packager for AIR application to allow them to run on Android Devices. Adobe also offers AIR for iPhone, which allows you to package your AIR applications to run on iOS devices. There are two schools of thought on mobile application development. One says, learn the native code style. If you want an Android app, learn the Java APIs. If you want an iPhone app, learn the Objective C APIs. There are advantages to this approach. However, if you're more interested in creating stuff using the Flash toolbox (which lets you build really powerful things really quickly), AIR for mobile devices is worth considering. Not only to get to use Flash for your development, but you can deploy to multiple endpoints from the same codebase. This is a huge advantage moving forward, though it's not quite as simple as "check the box for iphone" vs "check the box for android." If your son wants to get into programming, Java is a perfectly good way to do it but as a professional Flash developer I'm happy to encourage him to dive into AIR, as you suggest here. The best resources are going to be at Adobe's site, but I do know that Lee Brimelow has a LOT of great Flash tutorials at gotoandlearn.com - I'm pretty sure he has one that will step you through creating an AIR for Android app, publishing it and sending it to the Android Marketplace. All in about 20 minutes. Worth a look! This website seems to have a LOT of resources for AIR for Android, including various case studies: http://blogs.adobe.com/air/2010/04/adobe_air_applications_for_and.html
