Binary regression accuracy vs model fit in R

I ran two logistic regression models, one with a dataset including outliers and one without outliers, with multiple predictors. I checked each model's fit with the le Cessie – van Houwelingen – Copas – Hosmer unweighted sum of squares test for global goodness of fit from the rms package in R (following advice here ). model1 For the model with outliers the p value was close to 0, indicating a lack of fit. For the model without outliers p value was 0.52, indicating that my model was not incorrect. I then ran 10-fold cross validation for both models with DAAG package and was surprised to get identical (poor) accuracy results for both = 0.56 cv10 I thought that the model created using the dataset without outliers, having a much better fit, will give me higher accuracy. Am I missing something here? I will be grateful for your help.
