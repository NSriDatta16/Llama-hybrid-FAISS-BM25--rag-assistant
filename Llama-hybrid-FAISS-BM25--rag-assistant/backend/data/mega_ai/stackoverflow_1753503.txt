HTTP does allow caching of the response to a POST request. From RFC2616 , section 9.5; Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However, the 303 (See Other) response can be used to direct the user agent to retrieve a cacheable resource. This means that if a POST response includes Cache-Control or Expires (or, given a strict reading of section 13, even a validator like Last-Modified or ETag), the response can be used to satisfy future GET requests. 1 Since the POST is not sending a no-cache , the default is the response won't be cached. It only needs to send a cache policy if you want the response of the post to be cacheable.
