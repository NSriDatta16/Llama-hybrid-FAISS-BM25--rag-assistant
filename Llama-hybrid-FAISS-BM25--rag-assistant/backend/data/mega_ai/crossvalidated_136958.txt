Calculation of VaR of a time series using a GARCH(1,1) ARMA(1,1) model

Please, I've been stuck all the weekend in this problem, does someone know how find the Value at Risk $10$ days ahead (for example) using a GARCH( $1,1$ ) ARMA( $1,1$ ) Model. Remark: If it is easier to write the answer in some programing language (like R), go ahead. Thank you very much again
