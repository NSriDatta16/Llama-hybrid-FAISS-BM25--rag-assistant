Python webbrowser.open() - setting new=0 to open in the same browser window doesn't work

Given this python code: import webbrowser webbrowser.open("http://slashdot.org",new=0) webbrowser.open("http://cnn.com",new=0) I would expect a browser to open up, load the first website, then load the second website in the same window . However, it opens up in a new window (or new tab depending on which browser I'm using). Tried on Mac OSX with Safari, Firefox and Chrome and on Ubuntue with Firefox. I'm inclined to believe that new=0 isn't honored. Am I just missing something? tia,
