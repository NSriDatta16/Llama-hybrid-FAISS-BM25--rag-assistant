Bayesian Information Criterion - Non-physical model selection

Following the work of Bai & Perron (1998) and others in detecting structural changes in time series, I am trying to select the breakpoints by using the Bayesian Information Criterion. Basically, the response $y$ is modelled as a sequence of $n$ segments (linear regression), $n$ being unknown as well as the breakpoint locations. One compute the sum of squared recursive residuals of $y$ for all the segments [i, j]. Then for each assumption regarding the number of breakpoints (1, 2, 3...), the optimal locations of the breakpoints is computed (minimizing the sum of the sum of squared recursive residuals of each segment). Finally, the optimal model is selected (by minimizing the BIC) among the potential candidates with 0, 1, 2, 3 ... breakpoints. As I am working with remote sensed data, the time series are noisy and irregular. It happens that some decompositions may not be realistic (meaning that it cannot model the actual phenology) and that the above algorithm chooses a bad model. I am able to determine if a model is physically possible using the following metrics and their combinations: the gap between two segments (it could make sense having only positive gaps), the slopes of the segments, the length of the segments, etc. I thought that I could add a phenological penalty term to the triangular "sum of squared recursive residuals" matrix in order to guide the search of the best model with $k$ breakpoints towards one that is phenelogically possible. However this does not seem mathematically rigorous as the BIC needs the likelihood of my model. What could be the best formulation for this problem?
