To what extent will results change when fitting random forest structurally vs in batch?

I am facing a problem where I am not sure how to apply the random forest algorithm. Suppose my target variable is $Y$ and I have some $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$ as predictors. I am applying the random forest algorithm to this data set resulting in $\hat{Y}$ . I rewritten my problem and target variable to: For target variable $\frac{Y}{Z}$ and predictors $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$ . I apply a random forest to this retrieving estimated variable $\hat{\frac{Y}{Z}}$ . For target variable $Z$ and the same predictors $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$ . I again apply the random forest and obtain $\hat{Z}$ . If I optimize both random forests in 1 and 2, to what extend will the result of $\hat{Z} * \hat{\frac{Y}{Z}}$ differ from $\hat{Y}$ , from the first formulation? Which approach would be the best and is there any literature for this?
