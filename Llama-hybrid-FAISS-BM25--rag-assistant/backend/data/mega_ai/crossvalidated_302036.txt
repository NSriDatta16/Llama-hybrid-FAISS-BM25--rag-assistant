Why not just try a logistic regression? Just think what the presence of a disaster might affect. An obvious guess would be change in raw scores between before-disaster and after-disaster years. As you don't know the exact date of the disaster you will probably just have to take the absolute change from grade 1 to grade 6 as this new factor and treat it as your independent.
