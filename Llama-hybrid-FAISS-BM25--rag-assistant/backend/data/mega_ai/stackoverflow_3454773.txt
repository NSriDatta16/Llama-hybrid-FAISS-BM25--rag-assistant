I'd recommend against directly manipulating the select unless it's absolutely necessary and you know exactly what's going on behind the scenes in your version of Magento. The following syntax should handle the tricky parts for you $c = Mage::getModel('customer/customer') ->getCollection() ->addAttributeToFilter(array( array('attribute'=>'updated_at','from'=>'2010-05-12','to'=>'2010-05-30'), array('attribute'=>'created_at','from'=>'2010-05-12','to'=>'2010-05-13') )); var_dump( (string) $c->getSelect()); var_dump(count($c)); all you'll need to do is drop in the date ranges you want.
