For future reference, in Visual Studio you can try placing the cursor in the method name (for example, WriteLine) and press F1 to pull up help on that context. Digging around should then find you String.Format() in this case, with lots of helpful information. Note that highlighting a selection (for example, double-clicking or doing a drag-select) and hitting F1 only does a non-context string search (which tends to suck at finding anything helpful), so make sure you just position the cursor anywhere inside the word without highlighting it. This is also helpful for documentation on classes and other types.
