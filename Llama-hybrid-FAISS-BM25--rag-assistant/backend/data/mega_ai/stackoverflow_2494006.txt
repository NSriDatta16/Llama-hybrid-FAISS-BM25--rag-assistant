No, it has nothing to do with [Serializable] . The way polymorphism works is the other way around. You can only upcast ( (ParentClass)childObject; ) through the hierarchy and not downcast ( (ChildClass)parentObject ). For instance: //This is correct FireResult result = new FireResult(); FireGridUnit unit = result; //This just does not seem right FireGridUnit unit = new FireGridUnit(); FireResult result = unit; EDIT: Think of inheritance the following way. All FireResults are FireGridUnits, as such, you can convert FireResults to FireGridUnits. However, not all FireGridUnits are FireResult because, you could have a third class that inherits from FireGridUnit. As such, you can not convert ALL FireGridUnits to a FireResult.
