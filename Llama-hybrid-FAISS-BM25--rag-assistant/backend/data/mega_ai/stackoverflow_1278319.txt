One thing that you could do is look at recent transfers of similar(1) players. Say all transfers within 2-5 game weeks of similar players and then take the average (or median or some other calculated value) of their sale price. (1) You will have to define similiar in some way, i.e a defender with +-10 in defence, +-3 in passing and +-2 years of age. More factors give more precise results.
