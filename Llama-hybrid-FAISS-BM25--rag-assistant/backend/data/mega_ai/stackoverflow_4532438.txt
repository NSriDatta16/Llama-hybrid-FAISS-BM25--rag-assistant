There's a good discussion on this in the comments on this post . I think the following one puts it nicely: This irked me somewhat when I first walked up to Ruby. It was a remnant of my static type brainwashing. Three things mitigate against this being a real problem. 1. The warning. You could argue it should be an exception, but in reality, how would that be any different in the case where some other programmer silently caught the exception? Which brings me to number 2) Don't work with morons. Only morons silently catch exceptions and continue and only morons change constant values used in that way. Which brings me to 3) Neither of us is a moron, so you'll be happy to know that anecdotally this has never happened to me. It's really because constants stand out in Ruby anyway, what with their upcase, and how often are you likely to have a constant as an L-value in your code? To directly answer your question, I wouldn't do anything to get rid of the warning. Just take the warning as just that, a warning, and move on.
