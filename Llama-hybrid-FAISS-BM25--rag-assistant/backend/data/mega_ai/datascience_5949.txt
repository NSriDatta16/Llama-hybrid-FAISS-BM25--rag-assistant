Feature selection is a very well established field in Machine Learning. The objective of feature selection algorithms is to select a subset of your feature set in order to maximize your system's prediction performance. There are two kind of feature selection approaches: Filter methods : filter methods select features without taking into consideration any specific prediction algorithm. They are based in applying different kinds of measures (like mutual information or correlation) in order to evaluate the relative information that a feature or a set of features can provide about the output variable. Filter methods are faster than wrapping methods, but do not perform as well as wrapping methods. Wrapper methods : these methods evaluate features or sets of features by using a specific classification/regression algorithm. I'd suggest to read one of the seminal papers in the feature selection field as a starting point in order to get to know the basics: Guyon, Isabelle; Elisseeff, Andr√© (2003).
