There exist several clustering methods designed for this scenario. For example CASH which uses the Hough transform (a popular technique to detect lines in 2d) in multiple variates. But also 4C clustering and a few more. Check the related work of these authors, I doubt that I know all of it, as I don't have any data that would exhibit such nice and clear correlations as yours... The basic idea of some of the methods is this: take all neighbors within a distance threshold, then compute PCA on this subset. Neighbors along the principal axes are then kept. You may need to use a robust PCA here, though.
