Help with using variables as ordered factors/how to read lme4 output

I am quite new to R and also to LME statistics and would greatly appreciate any help. I am trying to figure out whether I have changed the variables in my study accordingly, and how to read the results I got from an lme using package lme4. My data look like: Subject Age sex Session Match Learned Average.Rating 1 20 2 1 1 Target 4.4 1 20 2 2 1 Target 3.3 1 20 2 3 1 Target 3.3 1 20 2 4 1 Target 3.1 1 20 2 5 1 Target 2.0 1 20 2 1 1 Control 3.0 I wanted to use an lme as over the Session variable there was a high attrition rate and I didn't want to have to discount entire individuals (as you would have to for a standard repeated measures ANOVA) but rather discount specific data points. Firstly I changed my Subject variable to a factor, my Learned condition to a 2 level factor ('control' and 'target'), and Session to an ordered factor as this is time over the course of weeks (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). #changing subject to factor MatchedData$Subject I would like to know whether changing Session from an integer to an ordered factor makes sense - as it is a time course over weeks where a subject can't possibly do Session 1 before Session 2, etc. A figure of my data: Below is my model, which assumes a random intercept for every Subject , and also a random slope - the effect of time ( Session ). What I am interested in is the effect of Session and Learned on Average.Rating . m.allsess My summary(m.allsess) looks like this Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood ['lmerMod'] Formula: Average.Rating ~ Session * Learned + (1 + Session | Subject) Data: MatchedData AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 750.4 852.9 -349.2 698.4 356 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.4520 -0.6333 -0.1035 0.6021 4.3905 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

I believe the L, Q, C, and ^4 are giving me fits for a linear, quadratic, cubic, etc. models, but are these necessary? What would I report when writing this up for a journal article? I am used to ANOVA output which gives you main effects of each of your variables of interest ( Learned and Session ) but the interaction term. When I use anova(m.allsess) I get something like what I am looking for but I am not sure that this is an appropriate way to look at the lme results. Analysis of Variance Table Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Session 4 46.856 11.7139 43.5232 Learned 1 3.807 3.8067 14.1437 Session:Learned 4 2.216 0.5540 2.0585 I have also tried to look at the results with the Anova(m.allsess) function, using type 3 sums of squares as I am interested in whether there is an interaction term. See below: Analysis of Deviance Table (Type III Wald chisquare tests) Response: Average.Rating Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) (Intercept) 617.1297 1 I have also ran the above model with Session as an integer and I get results which I am much more accustomed to, when using the summary() function. Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood ['lmerMod'] Formula: Average.Rating ~ Session * Learned + (1 + Session | Subject) Data: MatchedData AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 753.0 784.6 -368.5 737.0 374 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.9964 -0.6378 -0.0560 0.6187 4.3088 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Any help with my above questions would be extremely appreciated.
