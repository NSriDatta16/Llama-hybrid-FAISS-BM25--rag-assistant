Java Tools for combining runtime execution with coverage

Are there any free tools for Java (preferably Eclipse) that can give metrics on both how frequently code is executed (based on a recorded run) and do a side by side with coverage? I'm not sure if there is already a metric for measuring this but it seems it would be an interesting one to see.
