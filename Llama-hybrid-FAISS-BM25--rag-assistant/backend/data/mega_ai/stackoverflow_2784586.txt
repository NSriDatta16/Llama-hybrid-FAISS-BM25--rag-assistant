An unhandled exception of type 'System.StackOverflowException' occurred in mscorlib.dll

Ok the thing is that I am using asp.net mvc with linq to sql. I have a scenario where there are two tables group and features with many to many relationship with the third table groupfeatures. I have drag and drop all three table in the dbml file. The thing is that it runs fine with group but when I call the Feature things the above error occured and the compilers stops at this line in ((())). public partial class EgovtDataContext : System.Data.Linq.DataContext { private static System.Data.Linq.Mapping.MappingSource mappingSource = new AttributeMappingSource(); #region Extensibility Method Definitions partial void OnCreated(); partial void InsertGroup(Group instance); partial void UpdateGroup(Group instance); partial void DeleteGroup(Group instance); partial void InsertFeature(Feature instance); partial void UpdateFeature(Feature instance); partial void DeleteFeature(Feature instance); partial void InsertGroupFeature(GroupFeature instance); partial void UpdateGroupFeature(GroupFeature instance); partial void DeleteGroupFeature(GroupFeature instance); #endregion (((public EgovtDataContext() : base(global::System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["egovtsConnectionString"].ConnectionString, mappingSource)))) The code in both the controller Group and features file is ditto copied. Note the group things are working, the features things are not. FeaturesRepository.cs public IQueryable FindAllFeatures() { return db.Features; } FeaturesController.cs FeaturesRepository FeatureRepository = new FeaturesRepository(); public ActionResult Index() { var Feature = FeatureRepository.FindAllFeatures(); return View(Feature); } So what could be wrong?
