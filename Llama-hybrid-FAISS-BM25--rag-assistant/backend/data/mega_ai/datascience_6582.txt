I do like Berkeley course on Data Science, will give a good foundation and taste for Data Science, After moved to udacity and coursera and many more resources. So if you have Programming skills than will need math and stat and a lot of visualization. Also will be great to get used to IPython because is essential to see every step(visualize)how it perform instead writing a whole script and test after (anaconda is easy to install and work with). Course is listed bellow: bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1267848/wiki also the stat i find good free course from SAS: Statistics 1: Introduction to ANOVA, Regression, and Logistic Regression support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?ctry=us&id=1979 Starting with ML will recommend: www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python on left side is also for Excel using Pivot tables and R. DataCamp has released the tutorial on how to use R. Once you complete this steps than more competitions in gaining experience are on kaggle (recently released one for San Francisco Crime Classification) and ultimately amazing video tutorials from www.dataschool.io hope it helps ...
