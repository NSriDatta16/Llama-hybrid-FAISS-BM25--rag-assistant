How to get markers after calling drive directions in Google Maps API?

I just started working using Google Maps API yesterday, and trying to set up drive directions to my map. My problem is: when I call the function load, // [...] gdir = new GDirections(map, directionsPanel); // [...] gdir.load("from: " + fromAddress + " to: " + toAddress); it returns a map whose markers are not draggable. So, I need to make them draggable in order to recalculate the directions, but I can't get the markers objects. Someone knows how can I do it?
