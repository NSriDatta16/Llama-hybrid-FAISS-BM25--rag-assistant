Streaming uploaded files directly into a database table

I have several applications that allow users to upload attachments that are stored inside a database table. This has worked fine for several years because it was initially intended for smallish image files, but now they want to upload very large files (~80MB). This is causing the server to run out of memory (and the upload to fail) because, in order to write the binary data to a database, I am loading the entire content into a byte array. Many, if not most, online examples for file uploads use this method (see http://www.aspnettutorials.com/tutorials/database/Save-Img-ToDB-Csharp.aspx as an example). Now, the question is, can I somehow stream the binary content to the database instead of loading the entire content into a byte array and then setting the byte array as a parameterized value? Switching to file-based instead of database-based storage would be a big deal at this point...
