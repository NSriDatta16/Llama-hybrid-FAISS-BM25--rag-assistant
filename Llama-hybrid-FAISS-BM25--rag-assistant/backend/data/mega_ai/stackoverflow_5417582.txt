Bash shell script to glob files in several directories, add to an archive and remove original file

I am trying to write a bash script that does the following: Enumerates through list of files in a directory, that match a specified pattern Creates a tar file containing the matching files Removes (i.e. deletes) the matched files from their source directories To keep things simple, I intend to use a hard coded list of directories and file patterns This is what I have come up with so far: #!/bin/bash filenames[0]='/home/user1/*.foo' filenames[1]='/some/otherpath/*.fbar' for f in ${filenames[@]} do echo "$f" done However, I am unusure on how to proceed from this point onward. Specifically, I need help on: How to glob the files matching the pattern $f How to add the ENTIRE list of matching files (i.e. from all directories) to a tar file in one go Regarding deleting the files, I am thinking of simply iterating through the ENTIRE list obtained in step 2 above, and 'rm' the actual file - is there a better/quicker/more elegant way? PS: I am running this on Ubuntu 10.0.4 LTS
