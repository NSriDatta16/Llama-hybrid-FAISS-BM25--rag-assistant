I'm quite new to Java EE so anything would be of help, the whole project works in the Java EE in uni. I'm surprised to find the option -javaagent:toplink/jlib/toplink-essentials-agent.jar in the startup line. It looks like you're using JDeveloper, I wonder if JDeveloper is doing that. If you don't use JPA in your code, a quick way to work around the issue would be to just remove this option from the startup script. This won't solve the real problem (which is that the toplink jar is missing or not found) but well, if you don't use JPA... Moreover, I don't do JDeveloper :) I am using JDeveloper :). I'm doing persistence in uni, I think I might need it. Thanks :) Well, WebLogic is a Java EE container and does provide a JPA implementation (Oracle WebLogic 10.3 ships with EclipseLink 1.0 if I'm not wrong). I still believe that the Toplink stuff is added by some settings of JDeveloper, you don't need it unless you really want to use TopLink instead of EclipseLink. But that would be the complicated way.
