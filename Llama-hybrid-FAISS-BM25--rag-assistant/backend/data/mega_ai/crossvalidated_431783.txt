Interpreting Pearson vs Spearman correlations

(Disclaimer: I'm a programmer, not a statistician. I'm learning about this stuff in a Data Science course. Consider me technically savvy and statistically clueless.) The data and plots here are part of an ongoing project. This piece of the project asks: "what can you do with statistics?" I'm asking: "Is there a correlation between various variables"? My data (Oxygen v Chlorophyll in the samples) plots like this: As Chlorophyll + Photosynthesis produces O2, I figured I'd see if the data shows a correlation. Here's my output: Covariance matrix: [[53.26027301 2.13119576] [ 2.13119576 1.03124445]] Pearsons correlation: 0.288 Spearmans correlation: -0.101 Both Pearsons and Spearmans show a weak correlation, but in opposite directions. What, if anything, can I take away from this?
