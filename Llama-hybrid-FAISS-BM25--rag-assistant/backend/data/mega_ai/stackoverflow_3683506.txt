Something like this should work (if the default/empty/unused value of the fields is Null ): SET @percValue=25; UPDATE leads SET usagePercent = IF(Name IS NOT NULL, @percValue, 0) + IF(Age IS NOT NULL, @percValue, 0) + IF(Designation IS NOT NULL, @percValue, 0) + IF(Address IS NOT NULL, @percValue, 0); You'll have to change percValue according to the number of columns you have. Edit: Adapted solution of RSGanesh: UPDATE leads SET usagePercent = ( IF(Name IS NOT NULL, 1, 0) + IF(Age IS NOT NULL, 1, 0) + IF(Designation IS NOT NULL, 1, 0) + IF(Address IS NOT NULL, 1, 0) ) / 4 * 100;
