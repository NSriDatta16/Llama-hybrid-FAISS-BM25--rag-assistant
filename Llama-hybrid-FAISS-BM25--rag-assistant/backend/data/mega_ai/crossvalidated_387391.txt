If your concern is testing whether or not a judge makes a certain type of decision more than the other judge makes that type of decision, a series of chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests may be your best bet. However you might have to organize your data a bit before you can immediately apply this. You could start by creating a contingency table for each judge and test, following the advice here , with rows describing each decision and columns for both the observed number of times that decision was made for the judge, and the expected number of times for that decision (i.e. probability of making that decision at random * the number of decisions made total), as well as the same columns for times that decision was not made. We then could compute a chi-square test statistic by summing up (observed - expected)^2 / total for each decision. The resulting test would tell us whether or not for that group of tests the judge was more likely to make that decision than random. if the number of decisions is small, you could also use Fisher's exact test here. You could also extend this to groups of decisions for each judge and look into whether certain judges are more likely than not to make certain categories of decisions.
