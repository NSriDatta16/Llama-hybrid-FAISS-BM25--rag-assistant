My experience is that continuous testing within the IDE can become unwieldy and distracting, so I prefer to use something like CruiseControl to do this kind of testing. One tool I have found very useful is EclEmma , which gives you a very fast coverage turnaround for your units, helping you to decide when you have finished testing a particular area of the code.
