How to construct an ARMA model MA 1 in excel?

All, I understand how to construct an AR1 ARMA model in excel, which is taking the time series and lagging it by 1 period then constructing a regression model (minus the first period) of that but I don't know how to create an MA 1 ARMA model in excel. Can anyone share a simple example of how to do it?
