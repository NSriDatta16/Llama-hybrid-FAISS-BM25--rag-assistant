Regularized bayesian logistic regression in JAGS

There are several math-heavy papers that describe the Bayesian Lasso, but I want tested, correct JAGS code that I can use. Could someone post sample BUGS / JAGS code that implements regularized logistic regression? Any scheme (L1, L2, Elasticnet) would be great, but Lasso is preferred. I also wonder if there are interesting alternative implementation strategies.
