How to cancel an asynchronous call?

How to cancel an asynchronous call? The .NET APM doesn't seem to support this operation. I have the following loop in my code which spawns multiple threads on the ThreadPool. When I click a button on my UI, I would like these threads (or asynchronous calls) to end. foreach (var sku in skus) { loadSku.BeginInvoke(... } Is there any elegant solution other than creating a global "Cancel flag" and having the asynchronous methods to look for it?
