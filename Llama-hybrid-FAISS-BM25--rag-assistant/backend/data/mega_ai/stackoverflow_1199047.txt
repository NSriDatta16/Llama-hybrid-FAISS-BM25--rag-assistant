Something like EJB wiring in Spring for non EJB's

I've noticed recently that spring can wire up my ejb's for me if I annotate the ejb with @Interceptors(SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor.class). I've never actually done this so don't know the details. I was wondering, is there a way to get this to work with other kinds of beans, for example, @WebService annotated ones as well. At the moment in my web service classes (because the application server manages them) I have to load the dependencies from the BeanFactory and would thus prefer to have them autowired. I know I could use the @Configurable annotation but am not particularly keen to have to specify and agent on the VM. Is this possible?
