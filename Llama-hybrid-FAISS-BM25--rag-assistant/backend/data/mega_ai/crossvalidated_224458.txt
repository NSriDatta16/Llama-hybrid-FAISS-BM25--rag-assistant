ln transformed data: how to report lme results in original units

I conducted an experiment to observe the effect a repeated treatment had on the concentration of protein in a set of samples. I have no formal training in statistics. My goal is to report how much protein is lost per treatment, and to condense this into a prediction for how much one might expect to lose at any given treatment. I thought a linear mixed model would be an appropriate method to use, and created a model in R using the lme function of the nlme package (ver 3.1-118). Problem: to meet model assumptions I transformed data by ln. I do not understand what the results mean in terms of my units of interest (pg/mL - protein concentration). My code (should be plug and play): # packages library(nlme) library(ggplot2) # data vectors Sample The 'assumption tests' show that data violate model assumptions of linearity and normality. This can also be seen in the graph, the first treatment clearly has a greater effect than subsequent treatments. The data is playing hardball. Transform it by ln: # mixed model ln mod2 Great, assumption tests suggest data are now model compatible. As I understand it, the coefficient -0.232904 describes the slope of the difference between treatments, and is my model's prediction of the effect of any given treatment event based on the data. However, the coefficient should be exponentiated to transform it back into the original unit (pg/mL). 2.718281828^-0.232904 = 0.7922 This does not look even nearly sensible, and clearly I misunderstand something. Presumably one can treat 0.7922 as a negative value, but the average effect of treatment is manifestly not -0.7922 pg/mL. I would gratefully appreciate your time and help in explaining where I am going wrong. It would also be great to know how to get an output showing the coefficient between each consecutive treatment. Cheers
