.NET compact framework - "offline webservices" support

I have a Win Mobile 6.0 .NET CF application that uses a reference to a WebService in order to call web methods on it. In normal situations where the device is in WLAN coverage, the web methods can be executed synchronously by the device. The issue is when the device goes off-line (no WIFI or GPRS coverage). I want that the application can still operate but need to "buffer" web method calls so that all operations are stored locally and if the device goes online again, all pending web requests are executed on WebService. Is there any generic solutions for that in .NET CF? Or do I have to implement it manually? The only think I can think of now is to extract the interface of WebService manually and implement custom implementation of it which checks whether WebService is available and in that case refer all web method call to the WebService proxy. If WebService is not available (no Internet connection etc), then my custom implementation is called which stores are WebMethod calls locally (ie in a local file). Does .NET CF support some sort of transaction mechanism from WCF? Thanks Dominik
