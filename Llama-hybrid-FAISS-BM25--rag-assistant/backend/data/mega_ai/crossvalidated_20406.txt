The right thing to do after a logistic regression is to check whether your classification performance suffers from high bias or from high variance. That will tell you if you are underfitting or overfitting, respectively. If you have a high variance problem, you'll want to regularize your regression. If you have a high bias problem, you'll want to add more features, such as binary interactions. Remember to evaluate on a separate validation set, not on training data. Precision and recall are great measures to use even for logistic regression. You may want to combine them into an F-score so that you have a single metric to optimize. See Andrew Ng's lectures at ml-class.com for further information on logistic regression, regularization, bias, and variance.
