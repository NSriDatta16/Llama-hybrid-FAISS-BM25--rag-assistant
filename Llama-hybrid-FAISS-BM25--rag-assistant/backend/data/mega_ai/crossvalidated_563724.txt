Loosely speaking, supervised learning means that you have labels for the data (all the clustering and regression), while unsupervised learning that you don't (e.g. clustering). Bayesian inference is just another way of thinking of the models, parameters, and estimating them. So there is Bayesian linear regression , ridge regression , logistic regression , you can use Bayesian estimation for parameters of neural networks, etc. All those are supervised learning algorithms. There are also clustering (unsupervised) Bayesian models. So Bayesian inference has nothing to do with supervised/unsupervised classification of algorithms.
