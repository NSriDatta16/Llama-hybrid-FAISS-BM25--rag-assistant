find string of N 1-bits in a bit-array

As the title sais I want to find a successive run of n one-bits in a bit-array of variable size (M). The usual use-case is N I do this operation a lot in an innerloop on an embedded device. Writing a trivial implementation is easy but not fast enough for my taste (e.g. brute force search until a solution is found). I wonder if anyone has a more elegant solution in his bag of tricks.
