It seems clear from the histograms that the distributions for smokers and non-smokers are different. The former is distinctly bimodal and the latter may be consistent with normal (Shapiro-Wilk P-value 20%). However, the means and medians seem similar. Digitized data from histograms. I digitized the histograms to give 63 integer values for non-smokers and 42 for smokers v.n = 14:25; f.n = c(3,4,3,10,4,9,11,8,4,3,2,2) non = rep(v.n, f.n); non [1] 14 14 14 15 15 15 15 16 16 16 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 [21] 18 18 18 18 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 [41] 20 20 20 20 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 21 22 22 22 22 23 23 23 24 [61] 24 25 25 v.s = c(13,15:23,25,26,29); f.s = c(1,4,7,2,5,1,3,2,3,4,7,2,1) smo = rep(v.s, f.s); smo [1] 13 15 15 15 15 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 17 17 18 18 18 18 18 19 [21] 20 20 20 21 21 22 22 22 23 23 23 23 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 26 [41] 26 29 Maybe my work is imperfect, but summaries are similar to the ones you provide: summary(non) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 14.00 17.00 19.00 19.14 21.00 25.00 summary(smo) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 13.0 16.0 20.0 20.1 23.0 29.0 As anticipated, a two-sample Wilcoxon test shows no difference (P-value 0.32). Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. The first thing to try might be a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to see if the two empirical CDFs differ. This test detects no significant difference. ks.test(non, smo) Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test data: non and smo D = 0.23016, p-value = 0.1385 alternative hypothesis: two-sided Warning message: In ks.test(non, smo) : cannot compute exact p-value with ties This result is not surprising because sample sizes are small, so the power to detect a difference may be small, and we can't get an exact P-value because there are many tied values among and between samples. Significant permutation test. However, the interquartile ranges (IQRs) of the two samples seem remarkably different. IQR(non); IQR(smo) [1] 4 [1] 7 A permutation test using differences in IQR's as metric, does show that the times to fall asleep are more diverse for smokers than for non-smokers. The 105 subjects were randomly assigned to non-smoking and smoking groups 100,000 times. At each iteration $d$ = IQR(non) - IQR(smo) was computed. Overall, these differences averaged very nearly 0, compared to the observed difference of $-3.$ Among 100,00 iterations, there were 36 uniquely different values of $d.$ The P-value of the permutation test is below 1%. So it seems that smokers require significantly more-variable lengths of time (as measured by IQR) to go to sleep than do non-smokers. set.seed(403) # for reproducibility all = c(non, smo) m = 10^5; d = numeric(m); d.obs=IQR(non)-IQR(smo) for(i in 1:m) { prm = sample(all) d[i] = IQR(prm[1:42]) - IQR(prm[43:105]) } mean(d
