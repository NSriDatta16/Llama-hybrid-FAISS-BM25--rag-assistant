Not a solution for the MS bug (which possibly uses Windows File Search underneath, which would be terrible for your results...), but a solution as a workaround, which gives you some extra leverage and control over the results: var files = from file in Directory.EnumerateFiles(path, "*", SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly) where (new FileInfo(file)).Name.StartsWith("2010") && (new FileInfo(file)).Extension == "xml" select dir;
