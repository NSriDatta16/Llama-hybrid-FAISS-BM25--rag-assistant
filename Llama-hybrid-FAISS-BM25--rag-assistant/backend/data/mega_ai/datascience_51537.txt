Machine learning tasks classification

I am trying to be precise in definitions. We can solve regression, classification, clusterisation, dimensionality reduction, visualization, feature extraction tasks. But also there are supervised, unsupervised, ..., tasks of ML. I see that regression is a part of the supervised learning. Are there any other particular tasks? How to make the word "tasks" more clear?
