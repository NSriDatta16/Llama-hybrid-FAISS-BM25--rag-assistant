"Linear" can mean many things, and is not exclusively employed in a formal manner. PCA is not often defined as a function in the formal sense, and therefore it is not expected to fulfill the requirements of a linear function when described as such. It is more often described, as you said, as a procedure, and sometimes an algorithm (although I don't like this last option). It is often said to be linear in an informal, not well-defined way. PCA can be considered linear, for instance, in the following sense. It belongs to a family of methods that consider that each variable $X_i$ can be approximated by a function $$ X_i \approx f_Y(\alpha) $$ where $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^k$ and $Y$ is a set of $k$ variables with some desirable property. In the case of PCA, $Y$ is a set of independent variables that can be reduced in cardinality with minimal loss in approximation accuracy in a specific sense. Those are desirable properties in numerous settings. Now, for PCA, each $f_i$ is restricted to the form $$ f_Y(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_{i}Y_i $$ that is, a linear combination of the variables in $Y$. Given this restriction, it offers a procedure to find the optimal (in some sense) values of $Y$ and the $\alpha_{ij}$'s. That is, PCA only considers linear functions as plausible hypotheses. In this sense, I think it can be legitimately described as "linear".
