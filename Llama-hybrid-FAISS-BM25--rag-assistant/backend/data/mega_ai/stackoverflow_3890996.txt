Definately a subjective question, but i'd say JQuery has become one of the standard client libraries for .net. Especially MVC as they play very nicely together. You have JsonResults that just seem to mesh so nicely with JQuery in asp.net MVC. They syntax is very elegant, and most .net shops have adopted it unless they have a lot of legacy code. I would recommend moving forward with it ESPECIALLY if you already know it.
