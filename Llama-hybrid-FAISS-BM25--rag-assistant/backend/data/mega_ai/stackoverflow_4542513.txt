To clarify and apply details to Mayra's comment, here are more detailed instructions for noobs like me 8^P I did have to set my application settings to "allow unknown sources" I connected my phone to my computer. After XP opened the connection as an USB mass storage device, I could simply copy my .apk file to the SD card (which will be the drive name loaded against the USB mass storage device). I went into the file, phone file app on the phone and selected the app.apk file and install. Pretty simple. As Mayra mentioned the debug tools, I didn't have to do anything as this seems to be the default setting. When I attached my phone to the PC, it gave me an option to turn off debug, but I ignored it. Everything worked out fine!
