In absence of a uniformly most powerful test, are hypothesis tests subjective?

We know that uniformly most powerful tests don’t always exist for composite alternative hypotheses. When they don’t, how can we justify the choice of test, e.g., the choice of test-statistic in a hypothesis test? I suppose it could still be based on power considerations, i.e., we could choose tests that maximise the power for particular choices of alternative hypothesis within the composite model? Is this a subjective choice? Are there connections to subjectivity in Bayesian statistical approaches? Should we perform sensitivity checks to check the dependence of our result on our choice of test?
