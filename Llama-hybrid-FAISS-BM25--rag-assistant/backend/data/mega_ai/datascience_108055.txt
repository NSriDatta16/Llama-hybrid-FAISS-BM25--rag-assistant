XGBoost Regression Prediction

I trained an XGBoost Regression model that tries to predict the number of conversions that a campaign provides. Independent variables are monthly dummy, location dummy, and 4 columns of campaign rules (numerical). Total of 6 columns of ind. variables. I trained the model. Now I am trying to predict a given campaign's performance using this model. My aim is to input the rules, month and location of a new campaign, and get the amount of conversions that XGBoost predicts. Do you know how can I implement this kind of prediction in Python? Thanks
