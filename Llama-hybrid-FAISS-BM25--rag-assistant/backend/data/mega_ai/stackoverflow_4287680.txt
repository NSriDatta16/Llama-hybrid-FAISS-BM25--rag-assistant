I dug out how I did it. This works for leopard and older: It's a cocoa app wrapper for shell commands. For snow leopard you can do it directly for apple scripts. xcode -> new project... -> Application -> Cocoa Application (right pane) NIB Files -> (right click) Add -> New File -> Cocoa -> Objective C class -> "runScript.m" modify runScript.h (right pane): #import Cocoa/Cocoa.h // add gt and lt (does not show here) @interface runScript : NSObject {} -(IBAction)runHello:(id)sender; @end modify runScript.m: #import "runScript.h" @implementation runScript -(IBAction)runHello:(id)sender { NSTask *script=[[NSTask alloc] init]; [script setLaunchPath:@"~/Desktop/hello.app/Contents/MacOS/hello"]; [script launch]; } NIB Files -> MainMenu.xib (doubleclick opens interface builder) interface builder -> tools -> library (objects-page) -> library-cocoa-"objects & controllers" -> Object (drag and drob this blue cube to Main Menu.xib window) select Object (that you just added) -> interface builder -> tools -> identity inspector -> class -> select runScript from drop down (this is the object c class you created in 2) MainMenu.xib -> (double click) MainMenu -> (delete extra + ) rename "file-> new" to file->runHello right click runHello -> drag and drop the circle next to "Actions: runHello" to Run Script -> runHello (in MainMenu.xib) In Mainmenu.xib window: right click "File's owner" -> drag And Drop circle next to dockMenu to MainMenu Go back to xcode -> build -> build and go -> save all Now the program in dock should have "file->runHello" item when right clicked. You can delete the window in "Mainmenu.xib". Also NSTask can excecute all shell commands, not just scripts. In Snow Leopard there is an "applescript IBAction". And you can change "Cocoa Application" to "Applescript application". br, Juha
