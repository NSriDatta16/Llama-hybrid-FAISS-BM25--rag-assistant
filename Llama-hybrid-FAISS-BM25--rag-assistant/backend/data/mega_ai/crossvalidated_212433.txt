You don't specify the "error" distribution, you specify the conditional distribution of the response. When you type the name of the family (such as binomial ) that specifies the conditional distribution to be binomial, and that implies the variance function (e.g. in the case of the binomial it is $\mu(1-\mu)$ ). If you choose a different family you get a different variance function (for Poisson it's $\mu$ , for Gamma it's $\mu^2$ , for Gaussian it's constant, for inverse Gaussian its $\mu^3$ , and so on). [For some cases (e.g. logistic regression) you can take a latent-variable approach to the GLM - and in that case, you might possibly regard the distribution of the latent variable as a form of "error distribution".] The link function determines how the mean ( $\mu$ ) and the linear predictor ( $\eta=X\beta$ ) are related. Specifically, if $\eta=g(\mu)$ then $g$ is called the link function. You can find tables of the variance functions and the canonical link functions (which have some convenient properties) for commonly-used members of the exponential class in many standard books as well as all over the place on the internet. Here's a small one: \begin{array}{lcll} \textit{Family} & \textit{ Variance fn } & \textit{Canonical link function } & \textit{Other common links } \\ \hline \text{Gaussian} & \text{constant} &\:\:\:\: \mu\qquad\qquad \text{(identity)} & \\ \text{Binomial} &\: \mu(1-\mu) & \log(\frac{\mu}{1-\mu})\;\qquad \:\:\:\,\text{(logit)} & \text{probit, cloglog} \\ \text{Poisson} &\: \mu &\: \log(\mu)\qquad\qquad\:\:\, \text{(log)} & \text{identity} \\ \text{Gamma} &\: \mu^2 &\:\: 1/\mu\quad\:\:\:\qquad \text{(inverse)} & \log \\ \text{Inverse Gaussian} &\: \mu^3 &\:\: 1/\mu^2 & \log \end{array} (R implements these in fairly typical fashion, and in the cases mentioned above will use the canonical link if you don't specify one)
