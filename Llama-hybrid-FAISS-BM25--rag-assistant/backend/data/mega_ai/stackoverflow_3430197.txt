Remote form with A tag submit in Rails 3

I have a remote form with hand-made buttons using tags. I'm using data-remote=true in the form tag, but I don't know how to use the link tag to post the form data in a form submit. When I use data-remote with data-method, it creates a remote call with empty parameters, so I don't call the submit() function to my form. My form is: and my link tag under the form tags are: it creates a remote call with empty POST parameters: it doesn't send any POST information, only the header: How can I call elegant the submit() method of the form? I guess I don't need to create javascript hacks to make it work. Do I?
