Well its not supported and not encouraged, but depending on your situation you might be able to edit TObject to record creation and destruction - since all objects are TObject this might do the trick. However modifying the VCL is really really frowned upon, so I wonder could you use a Helper object (available since 2006 I think) to do the same thing. Write to another list etc with details of each object created.
