jQuery conflicts when iframe used to insert web form

I am having to iframe a form into a development site. The form will be hosted on the same domain but i am not able to edit any of the contens of the document that contains the form. My issue is that the document that contains the form is using a very old version of jQuery and was wondering if this is going to cause conflicts with the vaersion (latest) on the parent site.
