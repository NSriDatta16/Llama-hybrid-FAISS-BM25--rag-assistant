Set a variable if undefined in JavaScript

I know that I can test for a JavaScript variable and then define it if it is undefined , but is there not some way of saying var setVariable = localStorage.getItem('value') || 0; seems like a much clearer way, and I'm pretty sure I've seen this in other languages.
