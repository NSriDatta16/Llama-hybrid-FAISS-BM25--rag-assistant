One way to look at it is to view it as the difference between going camping with a camper van and going camping with a fifth-wheel trailer and an F-350 to haul it with. If Dave and Betty have a camper van (Excel), it comes with everything they need for an occasional trip to the beach for the weekend, and a "good-enough" 4-cylinder engine (VBA) to get them there and back. But maybe Bubba wants to be viewed as a serious Camper. He'll want lots more flexibility to camp anywhere he wants to go, any time of the year, and take anything and anyone and anything he wants along, including the boat and the dog. So he'll buy the F-350 (Visual Studio), and a hitch that will pull campers, boats, skidoos, and horses, and the bed hardware for the fifth wheel - just in case. And he loves to spend time in the garage setting everything up to work together nicely. C#/.Net is great for all that. Every size winch and refrigeration unit you'll ever need or want will fit right in. And they can tow the camper van along for local wheels.
