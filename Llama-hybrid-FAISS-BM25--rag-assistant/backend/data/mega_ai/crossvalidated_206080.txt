Along with the other suggestions, a Gompertz growth curve would also fit this data. Here's what Wikipedia has to say about it: A Gompertz curve or Gompertz function, named after Benjamin Gompertz, is a sigmoid function. It is a type of mathematical model for a time series, where growth is slowest at the start and end of a time period. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function ) The key is the sigmoid function. Here's the formula for $y$ as a function of $t$: $$y(t)=a \exp[-b\exp(-ct)],$$ where $a$ is an asymptote, since $\lim_{t \to \infty} a \exp[-b \exp(-ct)]= a \exp(0)=a$; $b>0$ sets the displacement along the $x$-axis (translates the graph to the left or right) $c > 0$ sets the growth rate ($y$ scaling). Here $\exp(1) = e$ is Euler's Number $2.71828...$.
