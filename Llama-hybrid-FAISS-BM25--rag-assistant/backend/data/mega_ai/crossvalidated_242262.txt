Can we use Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to simulate tennis-match outcomes, given the probability of winning any given point for each player?

To make the example very simple, let's say that we are given: P(player 1 winning any point) = 0.75 P(player 2 winning any point) = 0.25 and also, to simplify, let's assume that these values remain fixed, regardless of who is serving etc. Now it would be very straightforward to perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the P(player 1 winning the match). We would simply simulate a tennis match, using the given probability values to decide who wins each point. We then simulate thousands of tennis matches to get the estimate required. Now, would it at all be possible to somehow use MCMC to do this instead and converge faster to the required estimate? I am mildly familiar with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Most articles explaining MCMC talk about the application of estimating parameter values θ from the observed data D i.e. P(θ|D) I am having difficulty figuring out what would be θ and what would be D in this example. It seems that the probability values we are given (0.75 and 0.25) are already the parameter values θ. Am I right in thinking so? Is MCMC not appropriate for this problem?
