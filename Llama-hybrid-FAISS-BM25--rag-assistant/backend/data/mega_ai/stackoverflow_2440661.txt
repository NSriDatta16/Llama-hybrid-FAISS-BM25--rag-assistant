How I can check @font-face is exists in user browser? Well I suppose you could rummage around in document.styleSheets looking to see if @font-face rules have been parsed into FONT_FACE_RULE Rule objects. (With necessary object-sniffing fallback for IE's different stylesheet model.) But it's not really a good idea, and it's probably not the right question. Maybe the browser supports @font-face , but not the particular font format(s) you've used (TTF/OTF/EOT/WOFF). Maybe the browser/user-stylesheet is set up to override or ignore the rule. Maybe the font just couldn't be fetched from network. Maybe the browser doesn't support embedding, but the user just happened to have the font you wanted installed anyway. A better question is, “has my special font been used?”. Whilst there's no direct way to query that, you can generally tell by looking at the offsetWidth of an inline element containing text in your target font, and comparing it to the width of another span of text set in the font it will fall back to. Unless you're unlucky enough to have picked a fallback font with near-identical metrics, chances are the results will be different. eg. something like: function haveFont(face) { var span= $(' jilf:.,! ')[0]; document.body.appendChild(span); span.style.fontFamily= 'monospace'; var width0= span.offsetWidth; span.style.fontFamily= '"'+face+'", monospace'; var width1= span.offsetWidth; document.body.removeChild(span); return span.offsetWidth!==width; } window.onload= function() { if (!haveFont('My Embedded Font Bold Extranice')) { replaceHeadingsWithImages(); } }
