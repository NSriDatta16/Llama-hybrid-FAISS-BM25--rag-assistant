XGBoost Algorithm: Impact of Scaling Instance Weights

Does scaling the instance weights impact the XGBoost ML Model training? The instance weights determine the importance of each data point during the training process. The XGBoost ML Model uses instance weights to multiply gradients in the learning process. I am reviewing the literature and can not find any relevant paper.
