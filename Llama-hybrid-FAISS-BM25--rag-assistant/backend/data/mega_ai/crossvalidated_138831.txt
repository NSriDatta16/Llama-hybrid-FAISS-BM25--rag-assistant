Analysis of insane factorial designs

I'm seriously thinking of doing the following experiment in the field of attention research. In this particular area there are some factors of importance that appear to modify participants' response times and error rates depending on the unique combinations of the factors. Previous research looked at 2 or 3 factors combined, but never the 5 most important ones all at the same time. For kicks I tried to design an experiment that would do this and ended up with a 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 4 design.The factors will all be categorical and the dependent variables most likely response time and error rate. If I generate 20-ish trials per factor combination I'll need about 2000-odd trials per participant. This is quite a lot but I don't think it's unreasonable if spaced over a couple of days and presentations are randomized. I've done thousands of these in a day during the pilot phase of another similar study. If I can find 10-15 people to torture for two or three days (taking fatigue into account) would this be feasible? I know it would be an absolute nightmare to analyse the data using factorial ANOVA's and this might be the reason why people avoid doing this. Multilevel models would probably be a bit better but I don't know enough about them to know if this would be a bad idea. Has anyone ever tried an experiment like this or analysed data from an experiment like this?. I've seen some 3 x 3 x 3 factorial designs in the filed, but never have I encountered anything this...uhm...enthusiastic. Are there any statistical techniques that would be able to handle something like this?
