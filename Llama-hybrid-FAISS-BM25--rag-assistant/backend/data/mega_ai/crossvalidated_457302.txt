The best epoch has a higher valdation score compared to training score

Model : 3D CNN regularized with autoencoder Data : 3D MRI image data, 804 Training Set(Data Augmentation applied, 78 -> 804), 12 Valdiation Set(no aug), 12 Test Set(no aug). In general the epoch of highest val score is selected, but in the above result the best epoch has a higher validation score compared to training score. In this case, is it okay to select the 2nd epoch?
