A really simple of example of why it's important to think of consistency, which I don't think gets enough attention, is that of an over-simplified model. As a theoretical example, suppose you wanted to fit a linear regression model on some data, in which the true effects were actually non-linear. Then your predictions cannot be consistent for the true mean for all combinations of covariates, while a more flexible may be able to. In otherwords, the simplified model will have shortcomings which cannot be overcome by using more data.
