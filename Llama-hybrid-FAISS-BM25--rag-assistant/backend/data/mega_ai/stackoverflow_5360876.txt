Sort a list of Person objects using Linq

I need a query on sorting list of objects based on the category of property of the objects. I need the groups to be in an order other than the usual alphabetical order which I have seen in many other samples. I am using an example I took from elsewhere. How can I generate a list of Person objects based on HomeProvince but in terms of this ordering: Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia. The ordering within each group does not matter. Person[] people = new Person[] { new Person() { FirstName = "Tony", LastName = "Montana", Age = 39, HomeProvince = "Ontario" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Bill", LastName = "Smith", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Ontario" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Doe", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Alberta" }, new Person() { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Alberta" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Alex", LastName = "DeLarge", Age = 19, HomeProvince = "British Columbia" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Travis", LastName = "Bickle", Age = 42, HomeProvince = "Quebec" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Ferris", LastName = "Beuller", Age = 17, HomeProvince = "Manitoba" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Maggie", LastName = "May", Age = 23, HomeProvince = "Ontario" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Mickey", LastName = "Mouse", Age = 93, HomeProvince = "Alberta" }, new Person() { FirstName = "Frank", LastName = "Darabont", Age = 49, HomeProvince = "Ontario" } };
