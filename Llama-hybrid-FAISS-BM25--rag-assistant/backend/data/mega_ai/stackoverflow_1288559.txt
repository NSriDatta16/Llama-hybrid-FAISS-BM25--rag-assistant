gl_FragCoord is screen coordinates, so you'd need to have information about the screen size and such to produce it based on the Position. The fake_frag_coord you've produced will correspond to a point in the screen in normalized device coordinates I think (-1 to 1). So if you were to multiply by half the screen's size in a particular dimension, and then add that size, you'd get actual screen pixels.
