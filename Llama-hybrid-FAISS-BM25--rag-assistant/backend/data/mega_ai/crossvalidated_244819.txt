How to determine membership relation from word2vec embedding

Assume I have a trained word2vec embedding, given two words, it's easy to determine the similarity between the two words. However how do I know one word "belong to" another word's category? For example, I have the embeddings of "apple", "city", "fruit". Definitely "apple" should belong to "fruit" category, but not in reverse . "city" and "fruit" does not belong to each other. Now that I got two embedding vectors from unknown words: ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$, how do I determine the degree that ${\bf u}$ belongs to ${\bf v}$? Alternatively, is there a different word embedding model/algorithm that can support this kind of inference?
