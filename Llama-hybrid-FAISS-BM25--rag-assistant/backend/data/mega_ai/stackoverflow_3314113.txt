PHP - What is a good way to produce a short alphanumeric string from a long md5 hash?

This is for the purpose of having a nice short URL which refers to an md5 hash in a database. I would like to convert something like this: a7d2cd9e0e09bebb6a520af48205ced1 into something like this: hW9lM5f27 Those both contain about the same amount of information. The method doesn't have to be direct and reversible but that would be nice (more flexible). At the least I would want a randomly generated string with the hex hash as the seed so it is reproducible. I'm sure there are many possible answers, I am curious to see how people would do it in an elegant way. Oh, this doesn't have to have perfect 1:1 correspondence with the original hash but that would be a bonus (I guess I already implied that with the reversibility criteria). And I would like to avoid collisions if possible. EDIT I realized my initial calculations were totally wrong (thanks to the people answering here but it took me awhile to clue in) and you can't really reduce the string length very much by throwing in all the lower case and uppercase letters into the mix. So I guess I will want something that doesn't directly convert from hex to base 62.
