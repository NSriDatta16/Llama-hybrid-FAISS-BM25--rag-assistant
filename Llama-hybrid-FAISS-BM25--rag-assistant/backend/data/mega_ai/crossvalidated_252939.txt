In your case, you want to know if the coefficients are equal to $0$. A model where the coefficients are $0$ is the same as a model that does not include those variables. Thus, you can perform a nested model test of a reduced model without those variables versus a full model that includes all the variables. In a linear model context, that is called an $F$-change test, or $R^2$-change test, because you can compute the test value from the $F$ (or $R^2$) statistics from the two models (it is also sometimes called a 'multiple partial $F$ test, and by a dozen other names). I show a version of the formula here: Testing for moderation with continuous vs. categorical moderators . In a non-linear context (e.g., a logistic regression model), a likelihood ratio test can be used. More generally, testing multiple parameters at the same time is called a simultaneous test or a chunk test. Concretely, to do this in R you would do something like: m.full = lm(Y~X1+X2+X3+X4) m.reduced = lm(Y~X2+X4) anova(m.reduced, m.full)
