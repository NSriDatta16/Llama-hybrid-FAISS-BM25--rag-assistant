getSession returns a session object that can be used for persistent storage across requests. It already uses cookies to persist the session ID between requests. You don't need to get the session ID and store it separately in another cookie. If you want to associate data with the user in the DB, either associate it with the session ID (eg, include the ID in the entity and look it up by ID) if you want it to be scoped to just the current session, or associate it with the user ID. Unless you have a really, really compelling reason to invent your own user management, though, you really should be using the built in Google Accounts or OpenID support. You're not doing your users a service by forcing them to create yet another account for your site.
