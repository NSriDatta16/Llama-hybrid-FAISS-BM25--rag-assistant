Could I say that the posterior probability is conditional on the prior?

I know that by the Bayesian formula p(θ|y) = p(y|θ) x p(θ) / p(y) and understand that p(θ|y) is the probability of the parameter conditional on the data. Could I say that this probability p(θ|y) is also conditional on the prior? If not is there a way to express the posterior conditional on the prior?
