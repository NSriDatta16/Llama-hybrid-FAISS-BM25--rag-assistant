Where to get the "latest" ASP .NET Preview DLL and Script

I have been trying to download the ASP .NET AJAX Futures but I can only see old versions of the DLL via sample tutorials from other websites. I need the DLL to use the Drag and Drop feature according to these tutorials. I know the tutorial is already old but I was wondering if they are still supported? (Microsoft.Web.Preview.dll, PreviewDragDrop.js) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc135985.aspx#S1 http://www.aspfree.com/c/a/ASP.NET/Drag-and-Drop-Programming-in-Microsoft-ASP-NET-AJAX/ http://aspalliance.com/1300_Custom_Client_Side_Drag_and_Drop_Behavior_in_ASPNET_AJAX.9 I was wondering why the preview and CTP is not available in the official website of ASP.NET AJAX? http://download.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=AjaxControlToolkit&DownloadId=93514&FileTime=129030372855470000&Build=15987 I did find a question that says to download the 2007 CTP. But it is 2 years old. Is this the latest? http://forums.asp.net/t/1380745.aspx
