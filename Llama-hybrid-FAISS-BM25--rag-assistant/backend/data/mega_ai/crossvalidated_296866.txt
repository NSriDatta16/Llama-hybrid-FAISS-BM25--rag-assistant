To first give an intuition, what about using the discrete case in finite sample to illustrate that $\text{E}(1/X)\neq 1/\text{E}(X)$ (putting aside cases such as $\text{E}(X)=0$) ? In finite sample, using the term average for expectation is not that abusive, thus if one has on the one hand $\text{E}(X) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$ and one has on the other hand $\text{E}(1/X) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N 1/X_i$ it becomes obvious that, with $N>1$, $\text{E}(1/X) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N 1/X_i \neq \frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i} = 1/\text{E}(X)$ Which leads to say that, basically, $\text{E}(1/X)\neq 1/\text{E}(X)$ since the inverse of the (discrete) sum is not the (discrete) sum of inverses. Analogously in the asymptotic $0$-centered continuous case, one has $\text{E}(1/X)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{f(x)}{x} dx \neq 1/\int_{-\infty}^\infty xf(x) dx = 1/\text{E}(X)$.
