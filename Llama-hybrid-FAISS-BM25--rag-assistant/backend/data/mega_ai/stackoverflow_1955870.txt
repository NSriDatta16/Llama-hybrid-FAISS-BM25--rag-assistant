I recommend the following introduction article on Apple's Mac Dev Center: Communicate with Objects - #Notifications Update : I pointed the link to to relevant anchor (Notifications). The problem in your code sample is, that you call a class method (those with a +), but you implement an instance method (-). So a simple fix would be, to get the (shared)instance of your AppController (probably self in your code) and send it the addAccount: message. But I encourage you to read the article first. Maybe you can solve your problem by sending a notification ( NSNotification ) from your view to your controller. Update: Another interesting read for you might be this SO question regarding the difference between class methods and instance methods .
