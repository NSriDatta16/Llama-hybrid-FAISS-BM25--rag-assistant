you might use a scheduler to move backups after a certain amount of time after the backup started with a batch file. If I remember correctly there's a hack to enable the sql server to back up on remote storage, but I don't think a hack is the way to go. Surely the best possibility may be to use an external backup tool which supports the use of agents. They control when the backup starts and take care of the files to move around. Sascha
