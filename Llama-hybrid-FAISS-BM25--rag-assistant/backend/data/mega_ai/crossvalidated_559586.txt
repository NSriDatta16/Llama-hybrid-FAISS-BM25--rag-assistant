What are the best algorithms to predict a continuous target where I only have binary attributes?

Hello, I am new to machine learning and have a project where the dataset consists of binary attributes and the target("Pawpularity") has a continuous value. I was wondering if you could advise me what are the best algorithms to use to train and try to predict this target?
