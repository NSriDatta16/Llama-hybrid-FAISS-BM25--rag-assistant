With the source code of Windows CE 6 you get the BootPart library source code. The location for the source is WINCE600\PUBLIC\COMMON\OAK\DRIVERS\ETHDBG\BOOTPART . Inside Bootpart.cpp you can find the function BP_OpenPartition that opens/creates a new partition. It basically adds information to the MBR. The above solution is a bit low level. Here is a way to do it through Win32 API (taken from here ): Call OpenStore to get a handle to the store Dismount the store using DismountStore FindFirstPartition /FindNextPartition will iterate over existing partitions and DeletePartition will delete those that can be deleted. GetStoreInfo will get you the number of sectors available for creating a new partition ( (STOREINFO.snBiggestPartCreatable ) Use CreatePartition to create the partition. All the pointers to the functions and more information about the storage manager can be found here: Storage Manager Reference You can see that the links I provided indicate that the functions work on both Windows Mobile 6 and Windows CE 6. Non of the functions are new functionality so they should also work with Windows CE 5.
