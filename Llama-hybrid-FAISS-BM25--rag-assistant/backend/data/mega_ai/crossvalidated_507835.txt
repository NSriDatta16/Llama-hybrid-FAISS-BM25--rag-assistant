How to calculate confidence intervals for logistic regression predictions? How does `statsmodels` do it in `summary_frame`?

I am fitting a logistic regression in Python's statsmodels and want a confidence interval for the predicted probabilities. This has been easy to get using prediction.summary_frame , but how is statsmodels calculating those values? For instance, are they Wald confidence intervals? I think I would prefer likelihood ratio intervals. (Then again, I want likelihood ratio intervals because they are preferred to Wald intervals when it comes to estimating the logistic regression parameters. Perhaps this is a non-issue when it comes to the predictions.)
