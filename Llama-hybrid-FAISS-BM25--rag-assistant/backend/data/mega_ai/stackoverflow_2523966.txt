Setting X-UA-Compatible to IE=EmulateIE8 will make the upcoming IE9 behave like IE8. Initially, this may be what you want. If you're not in a position to fully test against IE9 when it comes out (sometime next year, I presume), it may help should the organization upgrade to IE9 immediately. When you've fully tested everything, and want the application to work in IE9's native mode, you'll be a little bit stuck. You could set X-UA-Compatible to IE=IE9, and IE9 will work fine, but what does that mean to IE8? That's all speculative though. Right now, it won't harm anything. If you need to make changes to handle later versions of IE9, you can do that later.
