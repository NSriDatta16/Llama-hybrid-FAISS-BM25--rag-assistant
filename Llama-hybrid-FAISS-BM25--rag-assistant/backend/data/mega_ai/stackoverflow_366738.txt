In SQL Server 2000 BLOB support is not good enough and you should definitively store files directly on disk. In SQL Server 2008 support for storing files in the database is supposed to be a lot better. I have never tried it as we had already built our application to store files on disk. But I think I would still recommend to store files on disk as it provides more flexibility in terms of storage; you can easily back it up and move files around. Also it reduces the size of the database which likely will make it faster. So store the path in your database and the actual files in the file system.
