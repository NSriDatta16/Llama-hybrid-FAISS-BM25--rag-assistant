RIA Services RIA services will certainly take the burden off you for all the WCF plumbing. It has a few minor flaws (lack of certain data types), but there are workarounds for most problems. The validation model (using attribute decoration and custom validators) is very strong and a great place to hang business rules. RIA coexists happily with ASP.Net, so that is another plus. Behind the scenes it is just another WCF service. We are happily using RIA services with MVVM and Prism. ADO.Net EF model This is a tried and tested feature rich model. The only problems I have found related to many-to-many relationships. Again there are workarounds. DAL As RIA change sets are managed for you on anything, including POCO , this is the area that will need the most attention. It is considered "bad" to expose your EF model directly to RIA and that will certainly not insulate you from data changes. I can't specifically recommend any one pattern yet (still experimenting), but make sure your choice is compatible with IQueryable. The paging feature and appending to Linq queries for server-side execution are features you do not want to lose!
