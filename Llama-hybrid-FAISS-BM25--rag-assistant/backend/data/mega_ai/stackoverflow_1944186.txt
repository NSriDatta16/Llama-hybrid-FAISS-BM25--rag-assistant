The jQuery documentation for jQuery.browser shows the following warning. (Emphasis is mine.) Because $.browser uses navigator.userAgent to determine the platform, it is vulnerable to spoofing by the user or misrepresentation by the browser itself. It is always best to avoid browser-specific code entirely where possible. Instead of relying on $.browser it's better to use libraries like Modernizr . The documentation page also says: This property was removed in jQuery 1.9 and is available only through the jQuery.migrate plugin. Please try to use feature detection instead. Even jQuery.support , which was suggested from the old documentation has the following warning. (Emphasis is mine.) A collection of properties that represent the presence of different browser features or bugs. Intended for jQuery's internal use ; specific properties may be removed when they are no longer needed internally to improve page startup performance. For your own project's feature-detection needs, we strongly recommend the use of an external library such as Modernizr instead of dependency on properties in jQuery.support . The previous documentation for jQuery.support reported the following properties and values. $.support.boxmodel is false in IE 6, and 7. $.support.cssFloat is false for IE 6, 7 and 8; it is true in IE 9. $.support.leadingWhitespace is false for IE 6, 7, and 8. $.support.objectAll is currently false for IE 6, 7, and 8.
