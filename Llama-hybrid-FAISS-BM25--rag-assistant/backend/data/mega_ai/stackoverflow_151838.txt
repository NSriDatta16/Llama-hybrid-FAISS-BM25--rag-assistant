I agree with the other posts that you need to be very careful here about your requirements. Location can become a tricky issue and this is why GIS systems are so complicted. If you are sure you just need a basic heirarchy structure, I have the following suggestions: I support the previous comment that root level items should not have themselves as the parent. Root level items should have a null value for the parent. Always be careful about putting data into a field that has no meaning (i.e. "special" value to represent no data). This practice is rarely necessarily and way overused in the devleoper community. Consider XPath / XML. This is Something to consider for bother recording the heirarchy structure, and for processing / parsing the data at retrieval. If you are using MSSQL Server, the XPath expressions in select statements are perfect for tasks such as returning the full location/heirarchy path of a record as the code is simple and the results are fast.
