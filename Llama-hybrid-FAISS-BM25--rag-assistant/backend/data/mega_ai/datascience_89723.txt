how to do incremental deep learning on data stream that can adapt to constantly generated data points?

I am currently trying to learn a deep learning model on a data stream, which constantly generate new data points over time. The goal is to generate a real-time DL model that can well adapt to newly generated data while does not affect the prediction for old data too much. I am wondering if anyone know what might be the best way to do this "incremental deep learning on data stream"? Any information would be much appreciated, thank you!
