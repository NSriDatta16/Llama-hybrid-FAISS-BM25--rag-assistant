It is literally mostly implemented via the FFT, but it is usually derived with the aid of the DFT. The idea is that much of the statistical properties of the periodogram can be obtained in this way (e.g., you would like not only to know where the peak is but also the significance of that peak!). If it is or not directly the FFT depends on the algorithm; the "classical" periodogram is 'just" the FFT, but it is not only noisy, but also has other serious problems (see the paper from Scargle that I cite below). The most used form of the periodogram is the Lomb-Scargle (LS) Periodogram (Scargle, 1989; in this paper in fact Scargle does a critique to the "classical" periodogram; it is a MUST READ if you are trying to detect the period of a time series!). You can look at a fast implementation of it in this paper of Press & Rybicki (1989) (if you get lost, you can also look at the explicit implementation in the Numerical Recipes ). I should also add that there are generalizations of the LS Periodogram that account for floating means of the sinusoid, or for unequal variances among the points . The implementation is straightforward once you read the papers that I just gave ;-).
