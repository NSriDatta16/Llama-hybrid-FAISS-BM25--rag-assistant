Storing pictures in MySQL - Smart?

I know this is an age old question, and usually you can't get a simple answer. However, I'm in the situation where I might need 20gb of storage for pictures on a collaborative web app I'm creating using ASP.NET MVC, but my web host doesn't give me more than 4gb of storage. However - I have unlimited space on my MySQL DB, so I'm seriously considering using the longblob or something in the MySQL DB as storage - can anyone give me a couple of reasons why not go this way? The alternative would be a very expensive host, or a possibly equally expensive solution with cloud storage (I'm thinking Amazon S3 or something). Thanks!
