One inelegant but effective approach would be to have two columns in your table, one a varchar big enough to cover your majority of cases, and another of a CLOB/TEXT type to store the freakishly large ones. When inserting/updating, you can get the size of your string, and store it in the appropriate column. Like I say, not pretty, but it would give you the performance of varchar for the majority case, without breaking when you have larger values.
