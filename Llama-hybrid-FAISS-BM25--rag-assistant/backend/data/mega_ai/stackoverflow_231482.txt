This will involve updating the 'position' property of AwesomeDragon. However, the moment I do this AwesomeDragonImmuneToFire will take off as well. Maybe I misunderstand but I am not sure why you think the AwesomeDragonImmuneToFire will take off as well. If they are two distinct objects and position is a property of the objects then each instance (dragon) will have their own position. Changing the position of one dragon should not affect the position of the other.
