Would Servlet 3 annotations enable secret backdoor access?

I hope people don't mind me asking a question which is slightly future gazing. Please forgive me if my understanding is incorrect (and please put me right!). Servlet 3 introduces several new annotations including: @WebServlet @WebFilter @WebListener and also a something called web-fragment.xml . These all seem to be aimed at making it possible to deploy servlets, filters and listeners without having to edit web.xml. Does that mean that if I included a JAR file from an unscrupulous provider that they could surface servlets, filters and listeners in my web applications without my knowledge?
