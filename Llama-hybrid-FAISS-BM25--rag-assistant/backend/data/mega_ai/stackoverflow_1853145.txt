I'd argue that in general, this paragraph is on the right track for 99% of cases: On the other hand, if the comments for DisplayKitten() explicitly refer to three slashes followed by three backslashes, this seems to go against the spirit of encapsulation and could become erroneous if DisplayWhiskers() is later changed. How DisplayKitten() calls DisplayWhiskers(), and even the fact that it calls it, is probably an implementation detail. There are cases where this is not true. Sometimes you have a "convenience function" whose job is to just call another function in a particular way. In those cases it may make sense to intentionally break the encapsulation in your documentation. These cases are the exception to the rule, however.
