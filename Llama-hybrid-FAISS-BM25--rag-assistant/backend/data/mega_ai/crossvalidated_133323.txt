To BIN or not to BIN a continuous data to get a Fragment Size Distribution?

I have a data set in excel of almost 6000 entries (quantitative and continuous => P(X=x)=0, I mean the possible values for my continuous random variable X are uncountably many). Each point will represent a particle with a determined surface area. A total of 5168 enclaves with a large variability of size (area) ranging from 2.00x10^-3 to 7,98x10^2 mm2. With an increment=0,0002 , calculated in excel by =1/COUNT(A:A) (A=column with the values of surface area). I need to determine the Fragment Size Distribution (FSD), and present it as Cumulative Frequencies , on log-log plots, where the slope of the linear point arrangement is the value I need to get (Fractal Dimension of the FSD). Since I'm a beginner in statistics, and I have read that it's not necessary (nor recommended?) to bin continuous data, I wonder if there any good way to do this, without binning my data? I have tried the following: I tried calculating the Cumulative frequencies by binning (in an empirical way), with different bin width and the value of my slope changed with every new value. I applied Freedman-Diaconis Rule trying to “bin” my data: Applying log scale for the y-axis: Freedman-Diaconis Rule: Gives high number of bins, distribution positively skewed, but the distribution does not show much information, since many of the latest classes have no population. I plotted the Cumulative Normal Distribution (on excel), as well as the CDF (Cumulative DIstribution Function), then I applied log-log, but I didn't get a linear point arrangement. Is there a problem with my data? I tried it again using just part of the data, but it didn't work either. If I don't bin my data what is the correct way to proceed with my data set to determine the Fragment Size Distribution (FSD), as Cumulative Frequencies ? Probably this hasn't much sense since my statistical knowledge is very basic, but I really hope you could understand and could help me out here.
