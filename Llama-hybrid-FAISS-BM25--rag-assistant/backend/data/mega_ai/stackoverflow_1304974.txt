Set Authorization header using PHP and curl

We're using Commission Junction's REST service, which requires we sent an API key in the Authorization header. We set the header like this: $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt_array($ch, array( // set url, timeouts, encoding headers etc. CURLOPT_URL => 'https://....', // ... )); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array( 'Authorization: ' . CJ_API_KEY, 'User-Agent: ' . OUR_USER_AGENT )); $response = curl_exec($ch); $info = curl_getinfo($ch); The problem is that the Authorization header isn't sent (we debugged this by using a local url and doing a var_export($_SERVER) which shows a User-Agent header is set, but not the Authorization header.) If we change the header name to X-Authorization , it gets sent - but this hasn't helped us as the service specifically requires the Authorization header. How do we get PHP + cURL to send an arbitrary Authorization header?
