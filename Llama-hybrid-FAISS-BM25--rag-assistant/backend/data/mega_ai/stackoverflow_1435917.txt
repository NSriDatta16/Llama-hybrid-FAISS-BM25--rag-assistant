The simplest solution to this I've found is to use a helper to accumulate Javascript fragments to be included at the page body while rendering other page elements. Then, you can include jQuery first, followed by any deferred literal Javascript fragments. It does require maintaining some extra state during page generation, which can complicate your rendering pipeline just a bit. However, it allows you to get deferred Javascript inclusion, without requiring complex DOM manipulation after the page is loaded to pick out any existing references to jQuery.
