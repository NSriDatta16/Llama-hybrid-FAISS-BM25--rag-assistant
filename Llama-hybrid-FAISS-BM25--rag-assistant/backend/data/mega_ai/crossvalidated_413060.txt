A real world example of policy are the house rules that Black Jack dealers adhere to. The dealer is the agent. The rules, which describe when the dealer can and cannot play cards, are the policy. The state is defined by the cards the dealer and the player(s) have. The possible actions include whether to play a card or not. The reward is winning or losing the hand. This link talks about black jack from the dealer's perspective and some of the rules they play by. Dealer's perspective There are two points to using continuous functions. One is that this is a way to manage continuous domains. If your potential actions are continuous, trying to discretize it will make RL unusable for that problem. The second is that using continuous functions allows the application of powerful mathematical tools such as gradient descent. The point isn't that the features in the probability functions are related to each other on some n-dimensional surface. The point is that a surface that fits the probability function lends itself to analysis and use better then a table of numbers would.
