I wouldn't be worried about your ANSI-SQL (setting the database compatibility level should take care of most of that), but there are a few big features you may have used that aren't available in SQL 2000 (there are many more, but these are the ones I've seen that are most popular): Common Table Expressions (CTE) - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190766.aspx TRY...CATCH blocks CLR-integrated stored procs Also, though you shouldn't be, any selections directly from system tables (objects that begin with "sys" or are in the "sys." schema) may have changed dramatically between SQL 2000 and 2005+, so I'd see if you're selecting from any of those: SELECT * FROM syscomments --I know, using a sys table to figure it out :) WHERE text like '%sys%' Also, it's worth noting that while extended support is available for a hefty fee, Microsoft has officially ended mainstream support for SQL 2000, and will end extended support in the near future. This leaves your client (and you) without any updates from Microsoft in the case of security patches, bugs, or anything else you discover. I'd strongly encourage them ot upgrade to a newer version (at least 2005), though I suspect you've already been down that road.
