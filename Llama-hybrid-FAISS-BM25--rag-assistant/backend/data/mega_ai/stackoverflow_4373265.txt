How can I delete seed data in SpecFlow

This may have already been brought up, a stupid question perhaps. Anyway, I have been looking into SpecFlow and wondering how I can delete my seed data for the feature. This seed data are shared across different scenarios. Is there an elegant way of doing this? Perhaps the ability to inject an event when testRunner.OnFeatureEnd() in invoked?
