I'd prefer not to overload it that way personally because vectors don't normally have an overloaded left shift operator - it's not really it's idiom ;-) I'd probably return a reference from AddChar instead like so: ExtendedVector& AddChar(const std::string& str) { container.push_back(str); return *this; } so you can then do container.AddChar("First").AddChar("Second"); which isn't really much bigger than bitshift operators. (also see Logan's comment about passing strings in by reference instead of by value).
