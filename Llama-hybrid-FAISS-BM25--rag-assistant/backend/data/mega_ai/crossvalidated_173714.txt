When to use bayesian methods and when to use frequentist methods

So, I'm diving into learning statistics. I'm finally starting to intuitively grasp the difference between bayesianism and frequentism. I understand that both are neither wrong nor right. To further my understanding of the two, my question is: What are some examples where a frequntist methods are better, and what are some examples where baysian methods are better? (preferably in the context of science)
