You can draw directly to an Image by calling Graphics.FromImage . You can draw a Control to a Bitmap by calling Control.DrawToBitmap By the way, the correct way to draw to a control is to handle its Paint event and draw to e.Graphics in it. If you draw a control using CreateGraphics , it will be erased when the control is redrawn (eg, if you drag a window over it pre-Vista)
