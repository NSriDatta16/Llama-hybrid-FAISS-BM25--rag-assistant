Please help a newbie with time series prediction

I am a software developer but trying to figure out if I can learn a pattern in a time series data. My time series data contains two columns. Car number plates and daily indication if they passed a toll bridge. For example number_plate_1, 14, 15, 20, 25 ... number_plate_2, 8, 19, 24, 25, 49 ... Where [14, 15, 49 etc] are days from a set date and they go all they way to 10,000. There are definitely weekly / month cycles and I need to forecast the next day that a car is most likely to pass the bridge (given its history). Any idea about where to start would be greatly appreciated. I know I lack statistical skills but if you could get me a starting thread, I will try to unravel it with my best. Thank you very much.
