Thanks all, as the data are little in size, but the underlying tables will change, I think that I'll go the HttpCache way: I need actually a way to reduce db access, even if the data are changing (so that's the reason to not using a direct Sql dependency as suggested by @Bloodhound). I'll make some stress test before going public, I think. Thanks again all.
