Different Spring config files for different builds

In Spring application, I set up app-security.xml to controll all the security issues. However, the production will use SSO, where as on local machine I would like the plain old user authentification. I also have two local machines - for one, the project is built by IntelliJ Idea, and for another - by Ant, producing a WAR. Production system will be built using Ant. How do I organize my project so it would be possible to develop conveniently and also be able to build a production-like system?
