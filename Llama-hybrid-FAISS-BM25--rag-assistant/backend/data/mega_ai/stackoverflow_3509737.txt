Pragmatically speaking, why the assumption that pylint (or any lint) should be silent? Given a bias between false positives and false negatives, lints should prefer the former. It seems to me that because Pylint expresses its results as a score that people assume it should be maximized, but there is no prize for "winning". On the other hand, the construct it is complaining about is certainly ugly. I understand that the server_api is simplified for our convenience, but do you really need to muck about with the module namespace? From your client code it appears that the current_count method name is hard coded, why not in the server?
