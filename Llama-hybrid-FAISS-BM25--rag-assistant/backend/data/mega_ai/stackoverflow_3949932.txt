OpenMP has the advantages of being cross platform, and simpler for some operations. It handles threading in a different manner, in that it gives you higher level threading options, such as parallelization of loops, such as: #pragma omp parallel for for (i = 0; i If this interests you, and if C++ is an option, I'd also recommend Threading Building Blocks . Pthreads is a lower level API for generating threads and synchronization explicitly. In that respect, it provides more control.
