I just did it other way, without binding This will be a permanent link http://calciusorin.com/SilverlightDiagrams/ I decided to manually update all lines on shape Location or Size changed private void basicShape_BasicShapeLocationSizeChangedEvent(BasicShape sender) { foreach (CustomLine customLine in lines) { if (customLine.StartFromShape(sender)) { Point point = sender.GetLinePoint(customLine.GetStartSide()); customLine.SetStartPoint(point); } if (customLine.EndInShape(sender)) { Point point = sender.GetLinePoint(customLine.GetEndSide()); customLine.SetEndPoint(point); } } } I am sure that the Binding solution is more elegant. Anyone interested in my solution, with SL Controls that can be resized, connected with lines, just contact me.
