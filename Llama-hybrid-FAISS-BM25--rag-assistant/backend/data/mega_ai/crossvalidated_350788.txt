How many missing values in a dataset can Xgboost handle?

I have a dataset with a lot of missing values in the columns. I dropped all columns containing more than 70% of missing values. I'm considering using Xgboost for my prediction because it can handle missing values in the training phase. However the question is how many missing values can be in a column/row until the prediction with Xgboost is inaccurate? Is there a rule of thumb or is this threshold specific to the characteristics of the dataset?
