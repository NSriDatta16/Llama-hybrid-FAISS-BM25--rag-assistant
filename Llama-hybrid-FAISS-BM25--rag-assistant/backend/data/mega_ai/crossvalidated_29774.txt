About any regression method can do the job from what I can see. How good it will work depends very much on the data (Is the data too hard for a linear model? Are there too little samples for a neural network?) and your desire to understand what is going on (a neural network cannot tell you much, a Bayesian network can, but finding the structure is non trivial).
