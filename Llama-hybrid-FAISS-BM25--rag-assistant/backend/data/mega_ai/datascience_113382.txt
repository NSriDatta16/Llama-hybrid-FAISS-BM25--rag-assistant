Scoring unsupervised data

Given the features and details of a house listed for selling, i'd wish to calculate a score based on the accuracy, completeness, genuineness and authenticity provided by the owner.According to me, this is a regression problem (Please correct me if wrong, i am new in this domain). So, we'd need a labelled data for training. But, we don't have any score for the existing data. I am currently thinking about generating scores for a certain number of observations(lets say 1000) manually. And feed this dataset into a Deep Neural Network. Suggest alternative solutions and improvements.
