Specific examples of vSphere SDK for .NET

The vSphere SDK for .NET developers pdf has a sample that describes how to connect to Vcenter and perform operations such as power-off, reboot etc. I need specific examples for changing VM configuration such as disk, memory, CPU etc as well as migration through Storage VMotion and cloning. The vSphere PowerCLI admin guide has specific examples to the above using command line in Powershell but there are no corresponding examples in C#. Has anyone attempted these operations in C#?
