What does "large sparse" and "small dense" means?

In a paper I'm reading today it's written : For a fixed parameter count, we discover that large sparse WaveRNNs significantly outperform small dense WaveRNNs and that this relationship holds up to high level of sparsity greater than 96 %. What does it all mean ? Does it have something to do with the number of layers ?
