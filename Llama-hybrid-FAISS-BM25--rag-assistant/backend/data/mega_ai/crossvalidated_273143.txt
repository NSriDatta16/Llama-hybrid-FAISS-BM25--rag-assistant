The intuition breaks down into three parts: Positive Correlation. This is expected in most time series, since many things tend to be relatively smooth in how they change and things that change them tend to also change relatively smoothly. For example, think of the temperature in a particular city over the course of a year. Temperatures in July (in the northern hemisphere) are more likely to be above the average, and will tend to be more like each other than to be like temperatures in December. Negative Correlation. This is less common in the real world, since it implies that if something was above average last time, it will tend to be below average this time. This can happen in a situation where there is a control of some sort that compensates -- and perhaps over-compensates. For example, if you eat a huge meal at lunch, you might well eat a much smaller meal at dinner because you're so full. Zero correlation. What happened last time doesn't affect what happens this time. Think a roulette wheel, or "random noise". It's not like temperature: even if you live in a place that talks about how often the weather changes, you will rarely have an extremely hot day followed by an extremely cold day, with no clue which it might be. It's not like negative correlation, either. Of course, the serial correlation value is continuously variable from -1 to 1. You can have a small positive correlation or a large one, so my three examples are more to illustrate what it means rather than saying it will firmly fall into one category or another. In the case of your panel data, the common factor is an individual, as you say. And a particular aspect of an individual will tend to be similar (or different) to that aspect of themselves from time period to time period rather than randomly changing. This applies to an individual time series. As Michael Chernick points out in his comment, panel data consists of several time series -- each tracking a different aspect of the individuals -- and each of these time series will tend to be autocorrelated, but there need not be any particular correlation between them.
