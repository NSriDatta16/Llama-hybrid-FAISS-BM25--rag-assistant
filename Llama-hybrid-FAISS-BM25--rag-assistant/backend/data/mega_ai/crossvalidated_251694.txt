Below outlines an approach (see also: Combining several Likert items from a Likert scale into one variable ) +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+ | | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | CGI | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+ | P1 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 0 | . | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+ | P2 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+ | PN | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+ Map the responses to a numeric range, e.g. [0,4]. Organize your data, for example, as in the table above ($Q_1$ - $Q7$ are the questions, $P_1$ - $P_N$ are participant responses). To get an expected value for each question, $\bar{Q}_i$, average over the rows. The root mean square deviation will give you a single value for each participant - call it Care Giving Interface ($CGI$). $$CGI_N = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^7(\bar{Q}_i - Q_i)^2}{7}}$$
