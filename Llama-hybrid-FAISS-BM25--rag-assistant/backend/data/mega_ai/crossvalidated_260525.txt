Ignoring the horrendous notation where, for example, in $$a^{2}=\cdots=(a^2 + b c, a b + b d)$$ the $a^2$ on the left means something quite different from the $a^2$ on the right, what this question seems to be asking is the following: Given a two-state Markov process with state transition matrix $p$, let $X_n, n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ denote a Bernoulli random that has value $1$ if the process is in State $0$ on Day $n$. Given that $X_0 = 1$, that is, the process is in State $0$ on Day $0$, what is the average number of times that the process is in State $0$ during Days $1$-$3$? That is, what is the (conditional) expected value of $X_1+X_2+X_3$ conditioned on $X_0 = 1$? The linearity of expectation tells us that $$E[X_1+X_2+X_3\mid X_0 = 1] = E[X_1\mid X_0 = 1] + E[X_2\mid X_0 = 1] + E[X_3\mid X_0 = 1]$$ The OP has already calculated $P(X_n = 1\mid X_0 = 1]$ for $n=1, 2, 3.$ I have not checked these calculations for accuracy, but will simply point out that the expectations $E[X_n\mid X_0 = 1]$ are trivial to calculate once we know the values of $P(X_n = 1\mid X_0 = 1]$ for $n=1, 2, 3.$
