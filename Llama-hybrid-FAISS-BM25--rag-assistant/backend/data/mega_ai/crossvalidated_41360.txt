The key document you need is the GUM (Guide to the Uncertainty in Measurement) - JCGM 100:2008 (GUM 1995 with minor corrections) Bureau International de Poids et Mesures /guides/gum which gives the full (international standard) details about how to assess the performance of one measure against a reference (your reference will already have an assessible uncertainty). The US NIST documents are based directly on this as well. The GUM allows you to make your choice about assessment method, but then requires you provide an error term for any assumptions, such as the belief that the two instruments have no offset. You will have both systematic terms, and random terms. The systematic terms are usually the greater error, and are commonly under assessed (look at the early 1900's estimates for the speed of light and their error bars - which didn't overlap!). Because you only have one reference part, all you can do, so far, is assess the relative sizes of the two random errors of measurement (including local systematic variation such as temperature, operator, time of day..) At the end you would be able to state an error and a coverage factor for your new readings over some range of validity.
