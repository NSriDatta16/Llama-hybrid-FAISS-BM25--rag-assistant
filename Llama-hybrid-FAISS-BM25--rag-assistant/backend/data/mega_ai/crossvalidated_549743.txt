I coined the term pseudoreplication for a class of statistical errors in the late 1970s not realizing it had occasionally been used in the past (CJ MCCarthy 1969)for completely different concepts or practices. The wikipedia article (which I had no role in) is focused on my first paper on the topic but is unclear, out of date and reflects unawareness of a large body of post-1984 papers on the topic. Below is a list of my own on the topic. I can send a pdfs; just contact me at hurlbert@sdsu.edu. I suggest the 2009 paper as an introduction to this literature. Hurlbert, S.H. 1990.
