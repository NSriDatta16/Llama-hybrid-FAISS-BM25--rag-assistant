cocoa objective-c for os x : get volume mount point from path

I would like to find the mount point of a volume for a given NSString path. Though I'm a beginner in Cocoa and objective-C, I'm trying to do this "elegantly", ie. using one of the provided class, rather than making an external shell call or listing mounted filesystems and finding which one the path belongs to. I did find NSWorkspace and getFileSystemInfoForPath, but it does not mention the mount point. Can anybody help ? thanks
