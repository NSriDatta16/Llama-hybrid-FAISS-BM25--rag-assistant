algorithm challenge: merging date range

I'm facing an interesting problem: I have several date ranges that can overlap each of them has a name Is it possible to "des-overlap" theses ranges? That is, to generate: a new set of ranges where none overlaps the others each of this new range has a list of corresponding names Maybe I can make this a bit more graphical. This is what I have first: a |------------------------------| b |-------------------| c |-----------------| This is what I would like to obtain: |------|---------|-------|-----|-----| a a,c a,b,c a,b b I found a solution that kind of works, but which is not elegant: I transform each range (from, to) into a list of days (d1, d2, d3, etc.) I group names by day I aggregate groups that contain the same names to recreate ranges Can you think of a better solution? I'm working with C# but any language independent idea would be much appreciated. Thanks!
