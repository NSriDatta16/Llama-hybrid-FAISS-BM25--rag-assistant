Interrupted Time Series Analysis with multiple Intervention timepoints

I was wondering if it is possible to do a interrupted time series analysis with an intervention that is introduced and removed at specific intervals throughout the time-series. All of the literature I am reading is saying that for a time-series analysis the assumption is that without the intervention the dependant variable will remain unchanged in the post-intervention compared to the pre-intervention. However, my issue is that the intervention is introduced during a specific time period at set intervals only where it is expected to impact the dependant variable, then removed, and then introduced and removed again (and so on) . Is the interrupted time series analysis appropriate for this type of study design? I've attached a picture for clarification. please let me know if I need to explain further
