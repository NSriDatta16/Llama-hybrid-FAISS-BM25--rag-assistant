This is a warning from a Managed Debugging Assistant, the docs are here . While it is a warning, it is not one that you should ignore if it happens during an event callback. It is most typically a threading problem, the thread that owned a COM object has exited. Or called CoUnitialize() to tear down its apartment. Same thing, an exiting thread calls CoUnitialize(). There is little in your question that really helps coming up with a decent diagnostic for it. Do consider the possibility that this 3rd party COM component might have something to do with it, like raising the event on another thread. The Debug + Windows + Threads window should help with that. And pay attention to the Output window, it shows thread termination notifications.
