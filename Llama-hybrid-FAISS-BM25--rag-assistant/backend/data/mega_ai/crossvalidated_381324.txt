Time Series Prediction using multiple variables

My Dataset looks like Question: How can i predict 2018 weeks 13 to 18 using data of 2018 weeks 1 to 12 for Max temp, Min temp, Rain, Humidity, Wind Speed. Should I predict first Min temp, Rain, Humi, Wind Spd using each variables own history. OR I should use multivariate time series and predict all variables
