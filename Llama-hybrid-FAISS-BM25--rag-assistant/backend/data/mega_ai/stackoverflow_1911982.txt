I think one of the best things you can do is dig in and understand, really understand how things work. In the arena of web development, we are typically isolated from the details of TCP, packets, transports, protocols, etc... But sometimes, it is so isolated, that we forget to learn how it works, and as a result, stick ourselves in a little box. I've been programming PHP professionally for nearly 10 years. I've never used an MVC framework. I've always separated user interface from application logic from database access. We don't need a bunch of "patterns". We need true understanding of the problem, and the vision to create an elegant solution, re-using other work as much as possible. So I guess I am suggesting that you switch your focus from trying to make your application fit into a pattern, and re-consider the logic needed to successfully complete your application. Many times, it is very simple, but we tend to over-complicate it. Throw off the handcuffs of MVC and patterns... (and then watch me get downvoted for ranting against the status quo). Good luck with everything. And by the way, you will learn far more about programming in 4 years of doing it , than 4 years of college . Not to say you should or should not go to college, but just be aware that in many cases, you already know more than your professors will about real-world programming.
