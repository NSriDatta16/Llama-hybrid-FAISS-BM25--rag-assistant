Modeling a dataset where some the existence of some features are dependent on other features

Given a dataset of series of events, structured roughly as follows: series_id | number of events | average # days between events | average # days between most recent 5 events 0 2 5 1 1 2 3 8 3 6 6.7 6 Some features only make sense when other features have certain values (like average # of days between most recent 5 events should only have a value when the number of events is >= 5) -- how should the data be modified so I can still model it with traditional techniques like logistic regression, where all the values have to be non-empty? Traditionally, I'm aware that NaN values would be filled with the median or some other generic statistic, but it doesn't seem to make sense here. Filling it with 0 seems problematic as well, since e.g. an average # of days between events actually being 0 has a specific meaning, whereas the lack of a value might almost be an important feature in itself.
