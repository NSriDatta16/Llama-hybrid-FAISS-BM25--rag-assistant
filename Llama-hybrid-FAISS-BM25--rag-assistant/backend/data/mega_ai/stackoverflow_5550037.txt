You might want to check out the following article http://www.barebonescoder.com/2010/04/ibatis-net-stored-procedures-return-values/ on how to retrieve return values. I've used it in QueryForObject and Insert scenarios where the last statement is a return statement in the stored procedure. Pay particular attention to the class attribute on the "parameterMap" element. It's a lot prettier than the answer above and I believe it's more inline with the way IBatis.Net was intended to be used.
