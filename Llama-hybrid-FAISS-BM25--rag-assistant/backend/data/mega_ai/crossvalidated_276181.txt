There is the usual bias-variance tradeoff. Bayesian inference assuming M-closed case [1,2], has a smaller variance [3] but in the case of model misspecification the bias grows faster [4]. It is also possible to do Bayesian inference assuming M-open case [1,2], which has a higher variance [3] but in the case of model misspecification the bias is smaller [4]. Dicussions of ths bias-variance tradeoff between Bayesian M-closed and M-open cases appear also in some of the references included in the references below, but there is clearly need for more.
