Need help with Feature Engineering

I'm new to data science, and am working on projects to develop my skills. I'm currently working on the Loan Prediction practice competition offered by Analytics Vidhya.The goal is to build a predictive model that will determine whether a loan will be approved or not. So far, my models (logistic regression, random forest) do not perform any better than simply using the applicant's credit history as a predictor. I've read through the provided tutorial (I don't have high enough rep to include all the links): https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-python-scratch-2/ which details the same results. The tutorial mentions that feature engineering will be important for this (and most) projects. I've found a few other resources for feature engineering ( http://data-informed.com/how-to-improve-machine-learning-tricks-and-tips-for-feature-engineering/ and http://adataanalyst.com/machine-learning/comprehensive-guide-feature-engineering/ ) being the most helpful) but I'm still unable to build a model with higher accuracy. The variables included in the data set are: Variable Description ------------- ----------------- Loan_ID Unique Loan ID Gender Male/ Female Married Applicant married (Y/N) Dependents Number of dependents Education Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate) Self_Employed Self employed (Y/N) ApplicantIncome Applicant income CoapplicantIncome Coapplicant income LoanAmount Loan amount in thousands Loan_Amount_Term Term of loan in months Credit_History credit history meets guidelines Property_Area Urban/Semi Urban/Rural Loan_Status Loan approved (Y/N) I've first multiplied LoanAmount by 1000, to have the value in dollars. I've tried creating the following new features: TotalIncome = ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome Monthly_Payment = LoanAmount / Loan_Amount_Term Payment_Ratio = Monthly_Payment / TotalIncome household_size = the number of people in the household, derived from marital status and number of dependents I also found that many of the continuous variables (LoanAmount, TotalIncome, Payment_Ratio) are right-skewed and have transformed them by taking the log. None of these changes have had any effect. It seems that no matter what variables I include in my model, it will not achieve better accuracy than the model that only considers Credit_History. Are there any obvious features I've overlooked? What should I try next?
