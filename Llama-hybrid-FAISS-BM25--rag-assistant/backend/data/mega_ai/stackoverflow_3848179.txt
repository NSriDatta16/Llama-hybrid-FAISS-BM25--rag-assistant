This is just a guess. But my guess is that one reason the the View and the Controller end up more tightly coupled in Mac/iPhone implementations is that if you decouple the interaction control and the presentation too much, the likelyhood that you end up with an uglier and less intuitive feeling interface increases. Whereas more tight coupling encourages the developer into making the the control of the model more closely fit subtile differences in user behavior given their perceptual response to the view presentation. You end up with more UI optimal but less portable code. Value judgements required.
