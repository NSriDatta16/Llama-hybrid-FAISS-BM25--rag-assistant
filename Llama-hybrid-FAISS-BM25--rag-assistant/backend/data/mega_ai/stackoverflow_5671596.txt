You're going to have to wrap the "content" in a (or some other block element): content Link And don't use href="#" for these sorts of links, href="javascript:void(0)" is a better choice that causes fewer problems; the void(0) approach also means that you don't need return false in your click handler to keep the browser from trying to interpret an empty fragment. Back to our regularly scheduled program. Then, your showContent becomes quite simple: function showContent(e) { $(e).prev('div').show(); } A better way is to use jQuery to bind the click handler: content Link And then: $('#example a').click(function() { $(this).prev('div').show(); });
