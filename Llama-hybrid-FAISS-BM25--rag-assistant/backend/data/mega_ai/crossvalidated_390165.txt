How do ConvNets self-organise to have a hierarchical segmentation of higher- and lower-level features?

As far as I know, each layer of a convolutional neural network used for image classification specializes in recognizing a different part of an image. At earlier stages in the network, more rudimentary operations take place (how many edges are in the picture?), whereas, at later stages, layers deal with higher-level features (is that a wheel of a car?). While it appeals to people's intuition that a hierarchy like this would emerge, I fail to see the explicit underlying principles of this self-organization. So, how do the respective layers of a neural network organize themselves in a hierarchy?
