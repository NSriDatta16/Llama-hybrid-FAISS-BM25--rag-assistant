it depends on the standard deviation that you're observing. say you ask group 1 and group 2 a yes/no question: if 100% of group one answered "yes" and 100% of group two answered "no" then you aren't going to need more than fifteen respondents in each group to conclude that group one is statistically significantly different from group two. if, however, 45% of group one answered "yes" and 50% of group two answered "yes" then you are going to need much more sample to detect a statistically significant difference. to get an idea of what sample size you need to detect a statistically significant result, perhaps try punching some numbers in the "average, two sample" power calculator here: https://www.dssresearch.com/KnowledgeCenter/toolkitcalculators/statisticalpowercalculators.aspx
