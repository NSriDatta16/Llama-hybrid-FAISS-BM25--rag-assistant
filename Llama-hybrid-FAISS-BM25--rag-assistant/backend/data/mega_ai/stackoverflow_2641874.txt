Refer to your compiler manuals. most compilers provide extensions letting you fix the alignment of members Are you restricting yourself to those compilers and a mutually compatible #pragma align style? If so, the safety is dictated by their specification. In the interest of portability, you are possibly better off ditching #pragma align and relying on your ABI, which may provide a "reasonable" standard for compliance of all compilers of your platform. As the C and C++ standards allow any deterministic struct layout methodology, they're essentially irrelevant.
