So, by using javascript to load jQuery, you're loading the file asynchronously. Your code will begin to load jQuery and then move on to call your document.ready code, which will fail because jQuery hasn't finished loading or began executing. When you use two includes it is loading each file so by the time the second file gets executed, the first has already been executed, and thats why it works. You really need to set up a callback so that once jQuery is done loading, it will do the document ready tasks as well as run any other code which requires jQuery.
