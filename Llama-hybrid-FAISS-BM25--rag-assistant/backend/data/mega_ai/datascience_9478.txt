First of all, I would think that plot is useful. The classes do seen fairly separable in that space. A first pass option for visualization should be PCA, though as pointed out in other answers, it will consider only linear combinations of features. If you want to visualize the separability of the classes in the context of how well your classifier is doing, the plot you made is a good option. It shows that while there is some confusion (for green in particular), you could fairly easily group each class on that plot. If instead you want to visualize the natural separability of the classes, PCA or a low-dimensional autoencoder is the way to go. The difference is that if what you care about is the former, it's a good thing that your representation is optimized to separate the classes. If you care about the latter, the unsupervised nature of autoencoders is more appropriate.
