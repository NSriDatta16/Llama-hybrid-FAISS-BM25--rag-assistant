Russian Document Corpus for Search Engine

I'm working on a cross language information retrieval that takes queries in english and searches documents in Russian. To evaluate this system it would be nice to have a collection of russian documents to search through. Does anyone out there know of a collection of documents I can search or websites from which I can easily scrape together a bunch of russian documents (aside from wikipedia)? Documents can be about anything though it would be nice if they were in some specific area of human knowledge (CS, architecture, engineering, art, literature analysis, whatever...)
