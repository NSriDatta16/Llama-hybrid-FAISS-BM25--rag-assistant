Let's represent these angles with points on the circumference of the circle. Can we assume that all these points fall on the same half of the circle? (Otherwise, there is no obvious way to define the "average angle". Think of two points on the diameter, e.g. 0 deg and 180 deg --- is the average 90 deg or 270 deg? What happens when we have 3 or more evenly spread out points?) With this assumption, we pick an arbitrary point on that semicircle as the "origin", and measure the given set of angles with respect to this origin (call this the "relative angle"). Note that the relative angle has an absolute value strictly less than 180 deg. Finally, take the mean of these relative angles to get the desired average angle (relative to our origin of course).
