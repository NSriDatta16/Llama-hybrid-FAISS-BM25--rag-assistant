Phone browsers cache pages just like desktop browsers do. Before you spend too much time looking into the problem, make sure it's not a caching issue. Clear the cache on your phone and visit the URL again. Since the CSS loads correctly after a refresh, I wouldn't be surprised if this solved everything. Also, you mention in your question that it's better to have a separate domain altogether. I say not necessarily. There are many reasons why you would only want to have 1 domain for every platform. @media queries and responsive web design can go great ways. If you are interested in the subject, you should definitely check out this article from A list apart. It could give you an idea of what the possibilities are. EDIT: If it still doesn't work (which it doesn't seem to) then perhaps you should test your user agent code. Instead of loading your style.css style for everyone, remove that statement, and make it conditional to a browser not being android : Remove the css line from your html : And then in your javascript : var normalCss = document.createElement(' '); var mobileCss = document.createElement(' '); if(userAgent.search("Android")>=0){ document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(mobileCss); } else { document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(normalCss); } Clear your cache and test it. Does it load a css the first time or does it load a page without styles? If it doesn't load the first time, this might mean that the javascript code isn't run on time. How are you calling it? Is it in the head section? Are you using jQuery with $(document).ready or something like that?
