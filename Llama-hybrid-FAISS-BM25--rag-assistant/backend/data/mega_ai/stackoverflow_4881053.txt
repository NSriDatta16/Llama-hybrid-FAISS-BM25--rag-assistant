The compiler is pretty helpful, it tells you what line you have an error on, and what the error is. The first error is on line 12 and tells you that you've assigned an array reference to something that's not an array, you should change double grade = new double[numberofTests]; to double grade[] = new double[numberofTests]; The next one, on line 25 is similar. The next 3 errors are because of the two previous ones since you declared grade as just a double but later on try to use it as an array. The error on line 39 Testscore.java:39: cannot find symbol symbol : class InvalidTestScore Means that the compiler cannot find your InvalidTestScore class - where is it ? You should compiler that class as well. The error on line 46 is that system.out.println should be System.out.println (capital S in System) The error on line 59 says that there is no variable named average You can define it as the result of the expression you have there, so just change average = startgrade/grade.length; to double average = startgrade/grade.length;
