The most recommended is the one that best suites your needs? I would say Views Slideshow is the best approach. It leverages Views effectively, has minimal requirements, and is built pluggable--you can use a number of modules that build on it to create different affects. But if your design goals and that point doesn't move you in a direction, a little empirical review of module health is a great way to make a selection. Featured Content Slider : 1,048 active sites. Views Cycle : 2,077 active sites. Views Slideshow : 28,982 active sites. There are other metrics to check, like how recently and how often there are CVS commits, how many issues are in the queue, and what is the ratio of open/closed issues. And so on. You want a module that will do the job, stay current, and have enough interested people in the community to be sure that someone will want to step up if the current maintainer decides to go work with Django for a while.
