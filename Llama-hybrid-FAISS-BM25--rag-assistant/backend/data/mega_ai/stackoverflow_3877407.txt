Setting bounds for UIActionSheet?

I have a UIActionSheet and would like to adjust (increase) its width to accommodate the text of the buttons that it contains. The width of these buttons is determined at runtime and could change during runtime. I have mucked around with [[actionSheet superview] superview] to get the containing UIPopoverView, but changing its frame doesn't yield desired results. And, mostly, this just seems an extremely fragile way to go. I tried [actionSheet sizeToFit] without any noticeable effect. So, I am hoping that I have overlooked some obvious method for adjusting the size of the UIActionSheet/UIPopoverView. Thanks.
