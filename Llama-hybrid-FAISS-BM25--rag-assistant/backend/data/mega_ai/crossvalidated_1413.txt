Mixed regression models and custom link functions in R?

It seems like the current revision of lmer does not allow for custom link functions. If one needs to fit a logistic linear mixed effect model with a custom link function what options are available in R? If none - what options are available in other statistics/programming packages? Are there conceptual reasons lmer does not have custom link functions, or are the constraints purely pragmatic/programmatic?
