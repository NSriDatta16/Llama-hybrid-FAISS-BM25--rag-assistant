Is it possible to let the iPhone system time run faster for a moment?

Maybe this can solve out the ugly delay with touchesBegan: to touchesMoved:. It is caused artifically by iPhone OS to check if the user really wants to move. In some situations the finger must be tracked without delay, otherwise it just looks ugly. You see that everywhere through iPhone OS. Sliders, Scroll Views. Maybe accelerating the system time makes the delay smaller.
