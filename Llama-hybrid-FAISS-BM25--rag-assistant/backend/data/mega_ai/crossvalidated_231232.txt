Is there a way to use weakly informative default prior distributions for multinominal regression models?

Following Gelman et al. 2008, we can use e.g. in the case of complete separation, weakly informative prior distributions to estimate a bayesian logistic regression. However I wonder, whether there is a way to do something similar for a multinominal regression (I have 3 outcomes). It would be awesome if there is something implemented for stata or r. Thanks in advance.
