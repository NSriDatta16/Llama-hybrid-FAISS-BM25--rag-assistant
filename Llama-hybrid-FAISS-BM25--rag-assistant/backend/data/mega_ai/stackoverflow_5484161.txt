JDialog dispose and repainting problem

In a jnlp application, we create a modal popup extends from javax.swing.JDialog, and call dispose() to hide the dialog whenever necessary. However, sometimes the final client get repainting problem. The dialog doesn't really disappear, and its parent window look messy. I couldn't reproduce, but it happen many times on final client PC. I guess there are 2 possible reasons: There is a thread in our application update the cursor directly. However, I can't prove this thread is the root cause of the issue. Periodically, we have another process highly use the CPU in a few seconds. I tried to load the CPU, but I couldn't reproduce the issue too. Any advice for me in this case? Thanks!
