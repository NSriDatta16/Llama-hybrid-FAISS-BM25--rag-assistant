handling persistent storage and cold boots with ce 4.2

I have spent all Friday and Saturday on this and I am running out of ideas; I have a project where I need to run sql ce and .net2.0 on a symbol 8146 device running windows ce4.2 (windows mobile 2003) along with the symbol libraries that are needed for my application. When the device is cold-booted everything in the user partition is deleted. In the past I have used the symbol memcapture utility to solve this, but this time it says there is not enough space on the device. The problem is that the 8146 only has a little over 7 MB of non-volitial storage and I need to restore 10-12 MB woth of data (so far) Has anybody else ran into this and solved it? I am thinking I need to write a small app that runs when the device boots and checks status of everything, then if needed copies stuff from a compact flash card back into main memory. I do not know how to programaitcly access the CF card however so I am sort of stumped. There is also two apps from symbol that sound like they may help: regmerge.dll and copyfiles - they only run on a cold boot. There is only 10.2 megabytes of stuff that needs to persist, I know I can solve this somehow! I will call symbol tech support Monday morning and post whatever solution (if any) I come up with here as well. Any thoughts in the mean time? Thanks, Joe Update: I have ordered a CF card overnight for it and Motorola has opened up a case - I should have something more Tuesday.
