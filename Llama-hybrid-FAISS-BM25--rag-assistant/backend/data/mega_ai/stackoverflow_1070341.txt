-1 for clinging to an antiquated license-restriction policy that is a poor practice in general. Hardware dongles and "device detection" are SO 1990. People own more than one computer. They buy new computers. They upgrade their computers. Computers break, resulting in replacement of motherboards or network cards. All of these, given your design, will result in honest, paying customers being locked out of what they've paid for and will have to call you for support to "reset" their activation. And each time you do so, your overhead will increase by, very likely, more than the actual cost of a license. I'm not suggesting you give up and just send your app off to the torrentverse, but you should think more creatively about how to allow customers the freedom to use what they paid for, keep your support costs low, and discourage pirates. One creative solution would be to cache the user's settings on your server , keyed by their serial number, and synchronize them every time the application starts and is connected to the Net. This will allow a user to install the app on, say, both a laptop and desktop, and will actually be a value-add for customers because their settings are synchronized between devices. But it actively discourages users from sharing their license key, since doing so would mean they would be sharing their settings with every pirate user, or that they would have to remember to stay disconnected from the Interwebs when they open or close the app.
