Interpreting logit coefficients that have been converted to probability

Let's say I run the following specification: fit The resulting coefficient on treatment is .290. I would like to convert this to probability, so I run the following function: logit2prob > 0.5719961 I am interpreting this to mean that individuals in the treatment condition are 57.1% more likely to do (outcome) than individuals in the control condition. But this seems highly unusual. Is this "%" interpretation consistent with the probability conversion? Furthermore, I have been given advice to never convert logit coefficients to probabilities, and to instead compute average marginal effects. Doing so yields the following: >margins(fit) treatment 0.007139 Why does this appear so small relative to the .57 probability estimate above? Is it because marginal effects are interpreted in terms of percentage points , and not percent? What is the most appropriate way to interpret this effect?
