This is a typical MSIE error message when a download is been provided over HTTPS (SSL) while the response headers are been set to disable the browser cache via no-cache . This issue is not related to JSF. You need to relax the response headers which have influence on the browser cache. It should not contain the no-cache instruction. You could set it to public , private or no-store . response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "public"); response.setHeader("Pragma", "public"); See also MS KB Q316431 . Additionally, if you happen to run on WebSphere Application Server, then add the below header as well in order to prevent it from overriding the Cache-Control header afterwards: response.setHeader("CookiesConfigureNoCache", "false"); See also IE cannot download files over SSL served by WebSphere .
