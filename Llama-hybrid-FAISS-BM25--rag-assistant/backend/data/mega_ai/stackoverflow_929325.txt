SQL should not be formatting, period. It's a relational algebra for extracting (when using SELECT ) data from the database. Getting the DBMS to format the data for you is the wrong thing to do, and that should be left to your own code (outside the DBMS). The DBMS is generally under enough load as it is without having to do your presentation work for you. It's also optimized for data retrieval, not presentation. I know DBAs that would call for my immediate execution if I tried to do something like that :-)
