How do I display new products AUTOMATICALLY on the Magento home-page?

I need to display 3 or so new products automatically on the Magento home-page. This means the administrator should NOT have to mark the product as new using the 'New from Date' and 'New to Date' attributes in the 'General' tab. I know how to create a separate category containing new products automatically (http://www.tridian.com/developer-blog/adding-new-arrivals-to-magento/), but how do I display them on the home page?
