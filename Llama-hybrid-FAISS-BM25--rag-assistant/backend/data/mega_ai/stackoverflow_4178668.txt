One thing that favors WS over RMI is that WS works over HTTP port 80/443 which are normally not blocked at firewalls , can work behind NAT etc. RMI has a much complex underlying network protocol which requires you to open up RMI ports, and also might not work if the client is NATTED. Secondly with RMI you are limiting your slef to JAVA-JAVA communication, while with Webservies there is no such limitation. It is much easier to debug Webservices over the wire as the data is SOAP/HTTP , which can be easily captured via sniffing tools for debugging. I don't know of an easy way to do this over RMI. Besides RMI is really very old and hasn't received much attention for last few years. It was big back in the days when CORBA was big , and both RMI CORBA are really antiquated technologies. The best option is REST style Webservices.
