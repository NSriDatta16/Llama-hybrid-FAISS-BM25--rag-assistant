What is the difference between mixed-effects modelling in the RStan and lme4 packages?

I've recently begun running some multilevel/hierarchical models. Initially I was using rstan / rstanarm , but then switched to the lme4 package. Is the difference between these two packages only in the use of Bayesian priors (as in rstan ) or not, as in lme4 ?
