I really like PyQt bindings for Qt library. What is PyQt? Qt itself is a very nice framework - rich, powerfull, elegant (for my taste, at least). And PyQt does a very nice job of exposing that functionality to a scripting environment. Plus, there is a very nice book about PyQt development - Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt - working through it helped me a lot.
