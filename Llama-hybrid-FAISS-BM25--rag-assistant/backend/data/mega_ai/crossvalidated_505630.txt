To answer my own question: The average precision from Pascal VOC 2012/computing mAP COCO-Style for no detections would be $0$ . Further the first recall-precision pair used in computing the area under the curve is always $(0,1)$ , and the last value is always $(1, 0)$ , where according to the formula we compute (for no detections) $(1-0)*0 = 0$ , so this works with the formula. I think my issue was only using recall/precision pairs obtained from my model results, and missing the initial and last points stated above.
