C++ INCLUDE Rule : Use forward declaration when possible . B only uses references or pointers to A. Use forward declaration then : you don't need to include . This will in turn speed a little bit the compilation. B derives from A or B explicitely (or implicitely) uses objects of class A. You then need to include Source: http://www-subatech.in2p3.fr/~photons/subatech/soft/carnac/CPP-INC-1.shtml For avoiding multiple inclusion of header files you should include a guard, to prevent the compiler from reading the definitions more that once: #ifndef EMCQUEUE_HH #define EMCQUEUE_HH // rest of header file ... // definition code here... #endif See Industrial Strength C++ Chapter Two: Organizing the code.
