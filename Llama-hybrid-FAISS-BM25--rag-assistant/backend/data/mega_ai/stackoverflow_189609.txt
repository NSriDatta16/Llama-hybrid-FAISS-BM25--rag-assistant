Another product that can handle this elegantly is SmartAssembly, at SmartAssembly.com . This product will, in addition to merging all dependencies into a single DLL, (optionally) obfuscate your code, remove extra meta-data to reduce the resulting file size, and can also actually optimize the IL to increase runtime performance. There is also some kind of global exception handling/reporting feature it adds to your software (if desired) that could be useful. I believe it also has a command-line API so you can make it part of your build process.
