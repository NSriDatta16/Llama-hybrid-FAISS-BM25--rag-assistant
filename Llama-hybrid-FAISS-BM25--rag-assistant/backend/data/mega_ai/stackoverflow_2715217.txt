Typically there are only 2 reasons realloc will fail Not enough contiguous memory to satsify the request Memory corruption Even though there is enough overall memory in your program to satisfy the request there may not be enough contiguous memory to do so due to fragmentation. The best way to determine this is to use a tool that can report on contiguous blocks to determine if one is available to satisfy your request. I believe one of the tools in the sysinternals package does so.
