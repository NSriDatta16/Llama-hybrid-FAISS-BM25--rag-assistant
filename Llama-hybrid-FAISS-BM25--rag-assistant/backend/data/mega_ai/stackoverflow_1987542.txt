libSVM automated labeller script

Is there any script that would transform a tab delimited data file into libSVM data format? For an example my unlabelled data: -1 9.45 1.44 8.90 -1 8.12 7.11 8.90 -1 8.11 6.12 8.78 and I would like to append each value with a label: -1 1:9.45 2:1.44 3:8.90 -1 1:8.12 2:7.11 3:8.90 -1 1:8.11 2:6.12 3:8.78 I believe this can be done using sed or awk but I just don't have a clue how to do it. Thanks!
