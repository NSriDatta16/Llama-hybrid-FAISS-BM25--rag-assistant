Local PCA : non-linear data $X$ is partitioned into Q (piece-wise linear) regions and usual PCA is applied to each region separately. See Dimension Reduction by Local Principal Component Analysis , Kambhatla and Leen, 1997 Kernel PCA : see comments from usÎµr11852 Moving Window PCA (MWPCA) : usual PCA is computed on first $n$ observations (window of size $n$), then new observation is added and the oldest is deleted (if data is indexed by time), this slides the window along data by one element. PCA is recomputed. The window can shift 1 observation at a time or more. Thus, local PCA is a special case of MWPCA with window shifting $n$ observations at once. See Process Monitoring Approach Using Fast Moving Window PCA , Wang, Iwing, and Kruger, 2005. Rolling PCA , dynamic PCA, time-dependent PCA, etc. are just different names of MWPCA
