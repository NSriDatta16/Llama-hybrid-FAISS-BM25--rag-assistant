Overview of selection method for p-order of AR($p$) model

I would like to get an overview over the most common methods for estimating the lag order of an AR($p$) process. The common literature states: Akaike information criterion (AIC) Bayesian information criterion (BIC) Hannanâ€“Quinn information criterion (HQC) Akaike's final prediction error (FPE) criterion Criterion autoregressive transfer function (CAT) %of Parzen. Minimum description length (MDL) Resiudal variance (RV) method I kindly ask to refer to other methods and maybe highlight their advantages compared to AIC or BIC.
