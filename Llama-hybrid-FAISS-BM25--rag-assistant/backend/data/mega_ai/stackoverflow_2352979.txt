Use a jQuery Edit in Place plugin. Make sure you have a database table with a row for each paragraph (could also be an XML file or some other means of storing structured data) When rendering your pages, make each has a class 'editable' When the user requesting the page is an admin, do a $(document).ready(function() { $('p.editable').editable(...); }); When the admin edits text, submit it to an action like this: public JSONResult Edit(int id, string content){ /* Update content / / Return new text from database (in case something went wrong, the data won't have changed - you could return a JSON datastructure signaling an error */ return Json(newcontent); } Insert the new content in the paragraph.
