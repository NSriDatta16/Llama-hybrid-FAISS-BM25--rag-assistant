What do you have in the Expires, and Cache-Control HTTP Response headers? It looks like you may be telling IE to expire or to not cache the document. IE uses the cache for downloads unlike other browsers. And is it HTTPS? There are more conditions for HTTPS, like the "Do not save encrypted pages to disk" option (i.e. it'll need to be checked to prevent the download manager from using the cache and following the cache control directives). If you're using pragma:no-cache (you shouldn't) that will need removing too.
