Code sign error with Xcode 3.2

I had a fully working build environment before upgrading to iPhone OS 3.1 and Xcode 3.2. Now when I try to do a build, I get the following: Code Sign error: Provisioning profile 'FooApp test' specifies the Application Identifier 'no.fooapp.iphoneapp' which doesn't match the current setting 'TGECMYZ3VK.no.fooapp.iphoneapp' The problem is that Xcode somehow manages to think that the "FooApp Test" provisioning profile specifies the Application Identifier "no.fooapp.iphoneapp", but this is not the case. In the Organizer (and in the iPhone developer portal website) the app identifier is correctly seen as 'TGECMYZ3VK.no.fooapp.iphoneapp'. Also, when setting the provisioning profile in the build options at the project level, Xcode correctly identifies the app identifier, but when I go to the target, I'm unable to select any valid provisioning profile. What could be causing this problem? Update: I've tried to create a new provisioning profile, but still no luck. I also tried simply changing the app identified in Info.plist to just "no.fooapp.iphoneapp". The build succeeds, but now I get an error from the Organizer: The executable was signed with invalid entitlements. The entitlements specified in your application's Code Signing Entitlements file do not match those specified in your provisioning profile. (0xE8008016). This seems reasonable, as the provisioning profile still has the "TGECMYZ3VK.no.fooapp.iphoneapp" application identifier. I also double checked that all certiicates are valid in the Keychain. So my question is how I can get Xcode to see the correct application identifier? UPDATE: As noted below, what seems to fix the problem is deleting all provisioning profiles, certificates, etc., making new certificates / profiles and installing them again. If anyone has any other solutions, they would be welcome. :)
