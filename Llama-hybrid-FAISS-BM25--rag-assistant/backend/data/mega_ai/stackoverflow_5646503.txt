I wrote it first as comment, but then I realized, I think it is more appropriate as an answer You can use some Information retrieval system (like Apache Lucene in Java) and use it to index the URLs as documents. then, after indexing - you can iterate over the queries, and search for each of them, the result will be the matching URLs. PROS: * searching will not require iterating over all the URl's for each query. * if you will later need intersection or union of substring/queries - the library gives you this functionality CONS: *indexing will take a while... *you might need some extra space on RAM/disk for the index. I think it's a method worth exploring, maybe the time consumed while indexing worth the gain of searching.
