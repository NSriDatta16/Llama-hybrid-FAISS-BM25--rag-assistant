Help with Points between rounds in objective-c

I am new to objective-c and am having trouble figuring out a way to store points for multiple players in my game. I have 4 characters in my game that are all objects from the same class. 1 is controlled by the user and the other 3 are controlled by the computer. Each level in my game consists of 3 races. I need a way to keep track of each characters finish place for each round so that at the end of the 3 races, I can award points to the user depending on which place they came in. Can anyone offer a suggestion? Would a NSDictionary accomplish this? I kind of have a very rough understanding of NSDictionary but wasn't sure if I could filter out each player's data to get just their data. In my mind, I think I need somewhere to store this data so then I can get the average of their finishes to compare to the other players.
