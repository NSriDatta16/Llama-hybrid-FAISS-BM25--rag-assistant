They used to, a long time ago, although that was typical only for C compilers. The first one I used worked that way, a long time ago. Not unusual for ones that generated code for unusual hardware and operating systems, they saved the cost of writing the object file generator and leveraged existing linkers. Modern compilers don't bother with the extra step of generating machine code as text and running an assembler afterward, they generate the machine code directly in binary form. The compile speed advantage is fairly significant, text isn't cheap. The option to generate it in textual form from binary is pretty simple to implement.
