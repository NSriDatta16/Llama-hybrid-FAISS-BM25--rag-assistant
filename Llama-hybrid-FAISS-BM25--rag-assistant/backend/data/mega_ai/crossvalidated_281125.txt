You need to justify that exchangeability is reasonable. I.e. that a-priori you cannot know whether the value of the parameter on which you have the random effect (e.g. the intercept) would be higher or lower for certain units (e.g. subjects) compared to others. In terms of analyses, predictive checks would make sense to me. I.e. if you simulate, do you get near-nominal coverage of prediction intervals?
