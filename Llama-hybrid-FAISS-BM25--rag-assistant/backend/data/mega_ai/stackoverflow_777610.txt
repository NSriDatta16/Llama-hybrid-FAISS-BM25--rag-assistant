Assuming the poster wants to pack a large integer as a binary string, i.e. not use one byte of storage per digit in the number. One way of doing this seems to be: import marshal a = 47L print marshal.dumps(a) This prints: 'l\x01\x00\x00\x00/\x00' I can't say that I understand how to interpret these bits, right now ...
