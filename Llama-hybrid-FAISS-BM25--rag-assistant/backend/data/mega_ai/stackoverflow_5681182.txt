Session is used by some of our controls, for example by XtraCharts, to store the image generated on the server. However, all such controls are able to store the corresponding information, not only in the Session. For the details, please refer to the Binary Storage Configuration topic. Also, the ASPxSpellChecker stores a custom dictionary in a Session. This is implemented to provide a unique dictionary for every user. Nothing else related to using Session in our ASP.NET controls comes to mind.
