Google Maps style scrolling anyone?

I am looking for some JavaScript plugin (preferably jQuery) to be able to scroll through an image, in the same way that Google Maps works. I can make the image draggable but then I see the whole image while dragging even if the parent div is overflow:hidden . Any help would be greatly appreciated!
