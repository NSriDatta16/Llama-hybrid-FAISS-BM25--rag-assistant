Class densities w/ SVM (LibSVM)

I have a question regarding number of class samples for training and testing with an SVM. For my situation, my training and testing samples both have the same number of class 1 and class 2 representatives. These are very unequal. Typically for training I have # class 1 = 300 and # class 2 = 3000. Similarly for testing I have # class 1 around 300 and # class 2 around 3000. I've looked into taking a subset of class 2 samples for training in order to make the balance equal. Yet, I've found that my classifier best performs when leaving the training data untouched. I'm wondering if this makes sense to anyone else, simply because my testing sample classes are similar to my training. I should note, I'm using the signed distance from the hyperplane in order to create ROCs and that's how I'm judging classifier performance.
