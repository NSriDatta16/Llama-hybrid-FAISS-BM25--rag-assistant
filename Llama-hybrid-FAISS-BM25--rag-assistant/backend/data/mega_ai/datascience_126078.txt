Given this model is predicting the closing price using the opening price and RSI as features - the high R-Squared does indicate that the model is adept at predicting the closing price based on values of the opening price and RSI in the test set. However, if there were suddenly a random shock - such as a stock price opening at an expected range but then there was a sudden dip/climb in price - then this model would be rendered ineffective. Putting aside this model for a moment - attempting to predict future stock prices in the first instance is fraught with error. The reason is that stock price is a stochastic time series - i.e. there is a high degree of inherent randomness in the time series which makes prediction very difficult. Let's consider the issue for seasonality as one example. Here is a time series with a defined seasonal lag of 7 days, which can then be used for predictive purposes with a forecasting model such as ARIMA. Now, let's have a look at the autocorrelation for the adjusted closing price in your example. We observe a high degree of autocorrelation across lags but no inherent seasonal pattern. However, this strong correlation between lags doesn't always hold - a sudden change in stock price would render any previous correlations irrelevant. Therefore, the model looks like it has predictive power on paper, which is evidenced by a low RMSE of 4.94 relative to the mean value of 450.04 in the test set. However, the model is in effect predicting past values of itself (given that opening price is normally quite close to that of closing) - predictive error is likely to increase greatly when this is not the case. Depending on what your goal is, you might consider a probability-based model to determine value at risk, such as a Monte Carlo simulation. This involves calculating the daily returns for the stock and then generating a simulation based on the mean and standard deviation. The aim of this would not be to predict future prices per se, but rather to analyse what could be the expected return, as well as expected maximum downside/upside. Disclaimer: None of the above is meant as investment or financial advice of any sort. The answer is simply intended to discuss the application of data science principles given the data posed in the question.
