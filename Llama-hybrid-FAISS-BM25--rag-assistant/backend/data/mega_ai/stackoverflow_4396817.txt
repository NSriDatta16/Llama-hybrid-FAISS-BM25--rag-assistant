the feature you need is termed aggregate in C/C++. By searching "aggregate c++",you'll find a lot of information detailing the whys and hows. 1- Wouldn't things break if I add a method to the category struct? Not necessary unless the method influences the underlying C++ memory layout. For example, a plain function does not matter, but a virtual function will because it's likely laid out before the class members. 2- What would the best way be to initialize this POD struct (category) in a more c99 compliant way? using constructors as the other responders suggest. 3- Is there anything I should pay attention to in the context of the code above? It may involve redundant copies depending how you design you constructor. but it only matters if you often you need the initialization and you really care about the performance.
