I re-read your question and sorry for not thinking of asking first: do you have to parse the form back to XML? Is it possible to serialize your data to JSON, pass it up to the server, de-serialize and make the web request? The JSON format is much "lighter" than XML and you serialize and de-serialize with a library such as JSON.Net . This should eliminate some of your processing overhead. With respects to the web service you call, is the data new on each request? Is there anyway of requesting less data or storing portions of the data and refreshing periodically? Potentially you could run a messaging server such as MSMQ and refresh your data on a scheduled basis and then only request what you need once you have the user specific data. 30 seconds is 30 seconds. I keep thinking about the data - you say you have over 200 fields. I am unclear as to whether you have to perform queries or calculations. If you have numerous records, have you considered a different type of schema that might make your retrievals faster? Can you pull static lookups into a shared memory so you don't have to hit the disk?
