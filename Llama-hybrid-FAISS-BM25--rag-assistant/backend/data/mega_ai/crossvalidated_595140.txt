+1 to Richard's answer . A few additions: First off, as Richard notes, you are using the full training set to estimate the autoregression coefficients, which is what AutoReg does. In forecasting , you would only use the last 22 (or whatever your order is) observations together with the estimated coefficients. This is completely standard autoregressive modeling, which is a subset of the more general autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) class of models. You can read all about this in this excellent online textbook . Importantly, if your goal is actual forecasting, it makes a lot more sense to use an automated ARIMA modeler . This will decide on the optimal AR order, but also on the number of differences and the MA order, and estimate the coefficients. Any decent auto-ARIMA modeler will likely end up with far fewer than 22 lags. (Seasonality may come in, depending on what prices you are modeling. If this makes sense to you, be sure to allow seasonality.) See this thread and this one .
