As Jon has already stated, you can't tell a thread: "please stop now" and expect the thread to obey. Thread.Abort will not tell it to stop, will simply "unplug" it. :) What I did in the past was add a series of "if (wehavetostop)" within the thread's code and if the user pressed a "cancel" I put wehavetostop == true. It's not too elegant and in some cases it may be "hard" to put the "if" checks, specially if your thread runs a "long" operation that you can't divide. If you are trying to establish a network connection (and it's taking time) and you really think that an "abnormal" termination of the thread wouldn't cause any corrupting state, you may use it, but remember that you cannot trust the state of things that were involved in that thread.
