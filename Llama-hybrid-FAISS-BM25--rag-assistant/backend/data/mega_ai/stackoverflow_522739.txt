Another point: people sometimes manually edit URLs, in order to go up the directory tree. So they might try to load a page like http://site.com/a/b , get a "Not found" error, and then try http://site.com/a or http://site.com . Of course, if your URLs aren't based on an actual directory tree, this may not work. But you can still try to support it. Some browsers even encourage this, like IE with its error messages, and Safari with a menu that appears when you right-click the page title.
