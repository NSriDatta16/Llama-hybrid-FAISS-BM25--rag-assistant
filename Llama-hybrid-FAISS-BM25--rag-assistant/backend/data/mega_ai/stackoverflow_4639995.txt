The 'KEY' line is simply telling MySQL that the table should have an index on the 'last_active' field. Foreign keys in MySQL are defined using via ' FOREIGN KEY ', although this definition is not honoured unless you're using InnoDB as the storage engine. For more information (I'd recommend a read to be honest), you should take a look at the full CREATE TABLE syntax page.
