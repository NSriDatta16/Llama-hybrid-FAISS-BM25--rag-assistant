You can compute variance with the same cost as the averages. Simply put you have to use an on-line version of algorithm for computing variance. It is crystal clear explained on an article of John D. Cook . I used myself this online computing for a regression tree - split numeric method where I use an online computation of variance . I used to compute 2 running statistics, one starting from left and another one starting from right. It is possible to do that in a single step, I considered however that multiplication by a constant, gives also linear time and that does not bother me. For more information you can take a look on Wikipedia also.
