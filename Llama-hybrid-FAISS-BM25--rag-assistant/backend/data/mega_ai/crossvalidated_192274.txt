As I understand the NFL theorem, the only way a model can out-perform the general model, is by using predefined knowledge / structure, relevant to the problem. These prior assumptions, will cause the specialized model to perform worst on average on other subsets that aren't its specialty. This is not entirely accurate, but just to use your example: A model for classifying Arabic documents can perform better than the general language classification model, but it will have worse performance on English, French, Spanish, Hebrew, etc. than the general model.
