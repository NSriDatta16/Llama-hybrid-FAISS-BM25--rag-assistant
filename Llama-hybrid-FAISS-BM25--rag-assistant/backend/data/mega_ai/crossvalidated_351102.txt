The interpretation depends on context, but there are some common contexts in which this comes up. The statement is often used in Bayesian analysis to stress the fact that we would ideally like the posterior distribution in the analysis to be robust to prior assumptions, so that the effect of the data "dominates" the posterior. More generally, the quote usually means that we want our statistical model to conform to the structure of the data, rather than forcing the data into an interpretation that is a non-verifiable structural assumption of the model. The particular quote you are referring to is supplemented by the additional quotation: "The model must follow the data, not the other way around" (translated from Benzécri J (1973) L’Analyse des Données. Tome II: L’Analyse des Correspondances. Dunod, p. 6). Benzécri argued that statistical models should extract structure from the data, rather than imposing structure. He regarded the use of exploratory graphical methods as very important to allow the analyst to "let the data speak".
