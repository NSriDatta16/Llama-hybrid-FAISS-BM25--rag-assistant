I have read that you cannot instantiate a Dialog using MyApplication.this or getApplicationContext Correct. The Application context is not especially useful for constructing UIs. I have thought of making a new activity to compensate for this but would rather have it be an AlertDialog. An AlertDialog is impossible in this case. For starters, only an activity can open a dialog, and none of your activities may be running (e.g., crash in a background service) and valid (e.g., you had one, but it's the one that crashed). EDIT: Fixed previous paragraph to clear up confusion
