The only constant cost of plugins is the cost of downloading them, i.e. the bigger they are, the slower your page loads. However, most plugins I've seen—and JQuery itself—are tiny, or small enough that it doesn't really matter. In the end what matters is how you use them and what sort of initialization on load they do. Without a list, nobody can really tell you. You'll just have to pay attention as you build the pages, and be careful about what you do. It's really easy to write some JQuery that modifies a ton of DOM elements in tight loops without realizing it. Watch out for that. Build your site, and verify through measurement.
