Think that both ways will work. You can also use "git archive master | tar -C c:/temp/BLAH -x" and "git archive live-site | ssh live-site 'tar -C /var/www -x'". Keeping separate repositories may be useful, but "push inside another push-related hook" looks tricky and I expect it to be slow. Sort of long chain that will be slow and fragile. May be live site updates should be manually triggered after testing the "testing" version?
