Confusions about Pesaran & Timmermann test (2009 version)

I am learning about Pesaran Timmermann test (2009) for directional accuracy and I have troubles understanding its formula. Here I use notation and arrangement used in Pönkä (2017): $$PT=(T-1)(S^{-1}_{yy,w}S_{y\hat{y},w}S^{-1}_{\hat{y}\hat{y},w}S_{\hat{y}y,w}) \sim {\chi}^2_1, $$ $$S_{yy,w}=(T-1)^{-1}Y'M_wY, $$ $$S_{\hat{y}\hat{y},w}=(T-1)^{-1}\hat{Y}'M_w\hat{Y}, $$ $$S_{\hat{y}y,w}=(T-1)^{-1}\hat{Y}'M_wY,$$ $$S_{y\hat{y},w}=(T-1)^{-1}Y'M_w\hat{Y}, $$ $$M_w=I_{T-1}-W(W'W)^{-1}W', $$ $$W=(\tau_{T-1},Y_{-1},\hat{Y}_{-1}),$$ From what I understand the series $Y$ and $\hat{Y}$ are column vectors of 0 and 1. First is generated by change in actual values $\Delta a=a_t-a_{t-1}$ , and it takes zero when $\Delta a\leqslant0$ and one otherwise. Similar for $\hat{Y}$ but with forecast $\Delta f=f_t-f_{t-1}$ and if $\Delta f\leqslant0$ zero, if not - one. Is this correct? I am browsing couple of sources and I get more and more confused with many different explanations. Can anyone familiar with this tests confirm whether I understand it correctly? Secondly, I am also quite confused when it comes to meaning of each part of the test formula. According to my source (and the others i saw) it goes like this: $T$ is the number of observations (sometimes its called $n$ ) $Y=(y_2,...,y_T)'$ and $\hat{Y}=(\hat{y}_2,...,\hat{y}_T)'$ are two series series of one and zeros generated by deltas above ( $Y$ by actual( $a$ ) values and $\hat{Y}$ by forecasts( $f$ )) and $'$ means they are column vectors. Assuming I am right with those deltas, it makes sense that index starts from $2$ because first observation is always "lost" (calculating difference between time series and its lag). In last formula of matrix $W$ , $Y_{-1}=(y_1,...,y_{T-1})$ and $\hat{Y}_{-1}=(\hat{y}_1,...,\hat{y}_{T-1})$ . What does those two vector represents? How do I calculate them? Here index starts with $1$ and end with $T-1$ which is really confusing. The $\tau_{T-1}$ is $(T-1)x1$ vector of ones (self explanatory). Last thing that I am not certain is $I_{T-1}$ in $M_w$ part. Usually $I$ stands for indicator function, but if I am correct here is suppose to be a vector(?). I red Pesaran and Timmermann (2009) paper but I am still not sure whether I fully understand it. I will edit this post if more info is required. References: Pönkä, H. (2017). Predicting the direction of US stock markets using industry returns. Empirical Economics, 52(4), 1451-1480. Pesaran, M.
