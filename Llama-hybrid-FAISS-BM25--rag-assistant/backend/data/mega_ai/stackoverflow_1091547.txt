Ideally you should spend as little time as possible writing tests, which means your code should be testable using simple and straight forward unit tests, and you achieve that by trying to reduce Cyclomatic complexity of your code. So try to concentrate on writing code that requires as few unit tests as possible, simple clean cone with low Cyclomatic complexity. There isn't a standard time ration of how much time should be spent writing tests or code, the only measure is test coverage, if your code is simple your unit tests will also be simple and require less of them therefore less time spent writing unit tests will be spent.
