Bob Mc is correct. Pay extra attention to his second point - this isn't the case in C#. What you need to do is force Nothing to a nullable DateTime by casting it as follows: gauge.LastCalibrationDate = If(String.IsNullOrEmpty(LastCalibrationDateTextBox.Text), CType(Nothing, DateTime?), DateTime.Parse(LastCalibrationDateTextBox.Text)) Here is a snippet to demonstrate: Dim myDate As DateTime? ' try with the empty string, then try with DateTime.Now.ToString ' Dim input = "" myDate = If(String.IsNullOrEmpty(input), CType(Nothing, DateTime?), DateTime.Parse(input)) Console.WriteLine(myDate) Instead of casting you can also declare a new nullable: New Nullable(Of DateTime) or New DateTime?() . The latter format looks a little odd but it's valid.
