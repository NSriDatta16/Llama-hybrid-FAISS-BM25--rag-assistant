Estimating largest eigenvalue of $N_{d\gg 1}(0,\Sigma)$ from small data

I am trying to estimate the largest eigenvalue of some $d$ -dimensional normal distribution $N_d(0,\Sigma)$ from the sample data $$X_1, \ldots, X_N \sim_{iid} N(0,\Sigma)$$ where $N$ is much smaller than $d$ , say $N = 20$ and $d=2000$ . (Recall that PCA works nicely for $N$ much larger than $d$ , but may not work in my case [1].) There's no assumption on the real-valued covariance matrix $\Sigma$ . However, by performing PCA anyways, our observation shows that the eigenvalues seem to decay log-linearly. Question How do we estimate the largest eigenvalue? Pointers to any analysis are appreciated too, for example, an analysis that quantifies how bad the estimation is by running PCA on this setting anyways. Footnote [1] However, a quick experiment in python actually suggests that this approach is stable enough! I still need a formal analysis though.
