Given your clarification, I would say you can perfectly do posterior sampling with MCMC with an interpolated model. Obviously, you have to be aware that your posterior is then conditioned on your interpolated version of your model. If this interpolation includes some differences with respect to the original model (induced by the interpolation), you are including them in the inference. Apart from this caveat, I think you are safe.
