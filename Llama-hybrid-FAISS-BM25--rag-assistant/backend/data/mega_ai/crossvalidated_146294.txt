What is misclassification rate? How do we calculate it?

I'm doing logistic regression on Boston data with a column high.medv (yes/no) which indicates if the median house pricing given by column medv is either more than 25 or not. Below is my code for logistic regression. train_boston_new = train_boston train_boston_new$high.medv 25] Now I'm required to use the misclassification rate as the measure of error for the two cases: using lstat as the predictor, and using all predictors except high.medv and medv. I read the ISL book by Hastie, Tibshirani and did search but not clear on what misclassification rate is and how it is calculated?
