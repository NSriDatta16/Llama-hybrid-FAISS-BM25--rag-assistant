Assuming the lag is the DEPENDENT variable: The first difference of a time series is defined by: $$ \Delta Y_t = Y_t-LY_t=Y_t-Y_{t-1} $$ This means when the lag $L$ or order $i$ is applied, you get an $i^{th}$ order lag of the random variable $Y$. The purpose of this $i^{th}$ differenced series is to remove a time-varying mean. The new series will have a mean that is constant across time period $T$. Intuitively, it gives a simple way to control for historical factors that could directly impact your dependent variable at the current time period $t$. By this, you should be able to intuit your way through and realize that lead is just the converse to this (Assuming you have full data).
