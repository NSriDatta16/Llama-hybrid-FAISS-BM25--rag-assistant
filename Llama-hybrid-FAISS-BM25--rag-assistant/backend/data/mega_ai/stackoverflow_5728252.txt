Posterous API, new post with special characters in title

I'm writing a script to drag all of my images from TwitPic to Posterous but I'm having problems with the some of the characters in the title, here's an example: "My awesome title --> some more text" So when I run the title through urlencode() it appears on the Posterous site as My awesome title --&gt; some more text , if I don't run it through the urlencode() anything after the > is stripped, as you'd expect. I've also tried to use htmlspecialchars() and similar with little success, if I email or use the web interface to enter a post any special characters are displayed properly. I just want my title to match that of the TwitPic image title... but I cannot seem to get it to work. Cheers, Ben
