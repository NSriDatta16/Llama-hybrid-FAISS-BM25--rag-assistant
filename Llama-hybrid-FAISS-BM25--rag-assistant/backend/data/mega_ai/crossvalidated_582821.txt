Time series analysis if it is predictable or not

I have two types of time series, stationary time series dataset and non stationary time series dataset. Now I need to know if these two series predictable or not. I read about the models of predictability and the measure of predictability like mean ,RMSE,... But really I am very confuse because I do not know how to know if the series is predictable or not.
