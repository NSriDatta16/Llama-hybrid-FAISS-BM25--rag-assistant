Can I release an object (created in a method) in another method (without retaining) in objective C?

Can i release an object (created in a method) in another method (without retaining) in objective C ? My code is as follows -(NSMutableDictionary *)returnningMyMutableDictionary{ NSMutableDictionary *myDict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]; [myDict setObject:@"My Name" forKey:@"name"]; [myDict setObject:@"99" forKey:@"age"]; return myDict; } -(void)mainmethod{ NSMutableDictionary *dict = [self returnningMyMutableDictionary]; NSLog(@"dict %@",dict); dict = nil; [dict release]; } Q1) Is it good practice to release the returning dictionary in "mainmethod" ? Q2) When i run the application in instrument , i am getting leak in following portion. [myDict setObject:@"My Name" forKey:@"name"]; How to avoid memory leak here ? Please help me..Thanks in advance for your help..
