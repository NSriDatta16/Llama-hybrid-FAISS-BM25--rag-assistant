ComboBox in UltraGrid

I have to do some maintenance on an old VB.NET application (Visual Studio 2003) that uses Infragistics NetAdvantage 2006. I need to add a column to an existing UltraGrid control. This new column must act like a ComboBox, allowing the selection from a list of values. I added the new column, and set the Style to DropDownValidate. I created a ValueList and assigned it to the new column. At run-time I don't get the expected results. What am I missing?
