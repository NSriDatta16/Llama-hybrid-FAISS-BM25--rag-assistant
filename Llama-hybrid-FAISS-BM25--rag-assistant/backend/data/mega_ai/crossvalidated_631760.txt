DiD is aplicable for RCT but note that it’s a causal inference method originally developed for contexts where RCT isn’t possible. Fundamentally, DiD accepts that there is imbalance at the start of an observation period (pre-start period in RCT context) but crucially that the treatment group mean and control group mean are increasing/decreasing at the same, uniform weight. This is the basis of the counterfactual. (What would the treatment group have done in the absence of treatment exposure?) If you’re executing an RCT and have the ability to randomize, you might be able to eliminate imbalance between groups to some arbitrary, negligible level. But for DiD to be helpful, you need to ensure that both group means are changing at negligible different rates (over time.) Taking change in mean over time into account when randomizing can help ensure that you meet theoretical requirements necessary to leverage DiD. Remember, you won’t observe how the Treatment group mean changes over time in the absence of treatment exposure, this is only observed for the control group group. So DiD assumes that the treatment group mean changes at the observed control group rate. By including change in mean over time in randomization, DiD could be very a good fit for you even if imbalance between group means is pronounced.
