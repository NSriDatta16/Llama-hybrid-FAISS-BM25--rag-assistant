Why is it that you are not using XmlSerialization. All you would need to do it to create a memory stream, and call its dot Save method; and then you can at any moment reload the data. For instance you have a class called Canvas. Go on something like Canvas.AddControls(controlTypes.Label, "This is text on a label", 20, 97, Tahoma, 7.5, Regular, -778225617); Please see the simplest XmlSerializer sample. If you do not want your files to be xml typed? Use Binary Serialization. See this . Something like: public static void Save(object obj) { using (System.IO.MemoryStream stream = new System.IO.MemoryStream()) { // Serialize an object into the storage referenced by 'stream' object. System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter formatter = new System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter(); // Serialize multiple objects into the stream formatter.Serialize(stream, obj); // If you want to put the stream into Array of byte use below code // byte[] buffer = stream.ToArray(); } }
