Try changing your SQL to something like the following: SELECT a.column1, a.column2, ... FROM addresses a LEFT JOIN contacts c ON c.id = a.contact_id LEFT JOIN organizations o ON o.id = a.organization_id GROUP BY a.column1, a.column2, ... ORDER BY c.last_name, c.first_name, o.name LIMIT 0, 24 I've found GROUP BY to be much faster than DISTINCT in general, though I don't why that would be.
