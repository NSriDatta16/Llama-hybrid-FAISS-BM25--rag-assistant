Does it exist an Bayesian "version" of the Theil-Sen estimator?

From what I read the Theil-Sen estimator seems to be a really cool estimator; robust and easy to understand. Would it be possible to device (or does it already exists) a Bayesian "version" of the Theil-Sen estimator so that you provide a prior for the slope and get a probability density back instead of just a point estimate? How would such an estimator look/work?
