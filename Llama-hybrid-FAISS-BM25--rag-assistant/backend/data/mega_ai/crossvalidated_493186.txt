Is masking needed for prediction in LSTM keras

I am trying to do sentence generator using 50D word embedding. If my training sentence is " hello my name is abc " here max words is 5. So my first training x is [0,0,0,0,hello] and target is [my] second x would be [0,0,0,hello,my] target is [name] and so on... To generate given sentence should I give [hello] or with padding [0,0,0,0,hello] ?
