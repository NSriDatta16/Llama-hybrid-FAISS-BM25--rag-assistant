Installing multiple directx sdk versions

I have some DirectX applications I developed in college using DirectX August 2007 SDK. I would like to have August 2007 and the latest SDK installed so I can port my application to the newest framework. Does anyone have experience with having multiple frameworks installed, or is it discouraged? Thanks
