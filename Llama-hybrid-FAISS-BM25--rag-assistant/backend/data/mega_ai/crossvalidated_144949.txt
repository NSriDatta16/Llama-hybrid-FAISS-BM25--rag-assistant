Try reading the documentation . It states: A typical predictor has the form response ~ terms where response is the (numeric) response vector and terms is a series of terms which specifies a linear predictor for response. For binomial and quasibinomial families the response can also be specified as a factor (when the first level denotes failure and all others success) or as a two-column matrix with the columns giving the numbers of successes and failures . You can find an example in King's R logistic regression tutorial here under Logistic Regression: One Numerical Predictor .
