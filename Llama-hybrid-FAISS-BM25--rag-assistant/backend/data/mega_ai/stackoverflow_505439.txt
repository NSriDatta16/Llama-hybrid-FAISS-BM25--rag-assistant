Is JSON used only for JavaScript?

I am storing a JSON string in the database that represents a set of properties. In the code behind, I export it and use it for some custom logic. Essentially, I am using it only as a storage mechanism. I understand XML is better suited for this, but I read that JSON is faster and preferred. Is it a good practice to use JSON if the intention is not to use the string on the client side?
