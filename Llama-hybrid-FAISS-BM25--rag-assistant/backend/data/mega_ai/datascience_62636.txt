Logistic regression is used for a binary response (two categories). Here are some things that you may consider doing: 1) If your target variables is normally distributed use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and manually choose cutoffs for your categories (i.e. 0-25 = 1, 26-50 = 2, 51-75 = 3, 76-100 = 4, or similar) 2) Otherwise, you should consider multinomial logistic regression. Here is a great summary of multinomial logistic regression in R: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/multinomial-logistic-regression/
