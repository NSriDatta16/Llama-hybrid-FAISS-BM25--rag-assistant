Why is my interaction term significantly negative when its constituents are both significantly positive?

So I'm conducting a logistic regression model with 'voted_trump'(1=voted for trump, 0=didn't vote for trump) as my dependent variable. My hypothesis is that opposition to political correctness ('OPC', a 1-4 ordinal scale) predicts a greater likeliness of having voted for Trump, net of all controls. This expected relationship remains significant until I add an index of conservative talk-radio consumption (where 0=no consumption, 5=listens to 5 conservative radio programs) to the model. In case it's relevant, I should note that its inclusion also trimmed the number of observations from 2400->1400. The unique effect of conservative radio on voting for Trump, however, was also insignificant. I thus constructed and tested an OPCxCR interaction term to determine their joint effects. In the end, both constituent terms became significantly positive while the OPCxCR interaction was significantly negative. Not sure how to interpret this, so would appreciate some input. Thanks in advance!
