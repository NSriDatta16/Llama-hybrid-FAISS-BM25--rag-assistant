Your take seems to be correct except for this bit: yet in both approaches, I am still estimating the same quantity (i.e. increase odds relative to some change in variable when all other variables are equal). In the "simple" approach, you do not condition on variables other than gender (and thus you do not ensure the other variables stay fixed when going from one gender to the other; there may be confounding), while in the logistic regression approach, you do. No wonder the two approaches yield different results.
