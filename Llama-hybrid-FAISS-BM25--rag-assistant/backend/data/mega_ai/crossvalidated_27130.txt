The most elegant solution I can think of is a mixture of Gaussians model, in which you have k Gaussians corresponding to your signal (with a prior encouraging their variances to be reasonably small), and 1 diffuse Gaussian capturing the outliers ("diffuse" means huge variance), where you specify the prior proportion of outliers (e.g. 1%) in a Dirichlet prior. If you don't want to do EM, you may consider using k-means as a warm-start, and then optimize iteratively, where the slow step is the optimization of the discrete cluster assignments. But if the (co)variances of the signal Gaussians are approximately equal, this means that most reassignments will be to/from neighboring clusters, or to/from the outlier cluster.
