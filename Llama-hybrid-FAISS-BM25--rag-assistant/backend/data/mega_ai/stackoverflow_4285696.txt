Pcap library for C# odd problem

I'm currently using the PCAP C# library and making no changes from the received packet. The problem is illustrated in the following image. http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/6549/wtfisthisshitx.jpg The left side is Wireshark (The correct version of the captured packet) and the right is my capture using the Pcapсфз library. The c2s do not belong. Has anyone else seen this before? The code I'm using to receive the packets is almost 100% like the example posted on their website.
