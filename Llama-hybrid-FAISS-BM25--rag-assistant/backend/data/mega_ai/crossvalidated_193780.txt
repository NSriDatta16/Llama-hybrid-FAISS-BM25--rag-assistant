How much noise for denoising autoencoder

I was looking at the denoising autoencoder architecture. It seems that the way it works is that it takes corrupted input and tries to restore it using the error between the uncorrupted and corrupted input. However, how much noise is optimal for an autoencoder? Because if there is too much noise then the autoencoder is just gonna be learning random stuff and if there is too little, it becomes useless. Thank you
