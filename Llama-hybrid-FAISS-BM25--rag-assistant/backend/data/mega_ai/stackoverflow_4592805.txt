I found the problem. It was me. There was a silly bug in focus management. It caused the focus to be rapidly (immediately) transferred to text box B and then back to text box A immediately after "event X". And though it only happened once, it was enough to wreak havoc in the textboxes till the end of their lives. Why the special effects? It turns out that Windows hates two rapid consecutive manipulations with UI elements. I once had a similarly weird bug when I tried to move a control by setting its origin and its size in two different steps. The control would behave very randomly after this. Only when I moved it properly - in one step - the weirdness stopped. Thanks for your attention and sorry for bothering.
