ExternalInterface.call("window.location.host.toString")

I wrote a flex application that get the host string from the browser using this code ExternalInterface.call("window.location.host.toString") This line of code work prefectally to get the host string in both Firefox and Opera. However, when using IE, the returned string is always 'null'. I need to get such information from the browser. I know that there is a work around by defining a javascript function that get such string and calling that function from the application. However, my application require getting such information from a native source. I was wondering if anyone had the same problem and managed to solve it, or if someone has any idea why I always get null in IE, but not when using Firefox and Opera Edit 1: Here is the HTML code for embedding the generated SWF file. Maybe this is useful to spot a mistake the id, classid, and the allowScriptAccess are set as shown Any idea? Edit 2: for Lior Cohen The Flex file is the example used in your first link. The sub-directory history contains history.js, history.css, and historyFrame.html. The HTML page that include the generated SWF file is like this However, this is still not working as expected. Edit 3: I have spotted the problem, however, I cannot fix it. The problem has to do with the javascript engine of IE and not the ExternalInterface nor the object and embed HTML tags. What I am doing in my case is write the object and embed tags into a div created using javascript and this div is appended to the end of the body using the DOM methods. However, such approach make the InternalInterface always return null in IE (but not in Firefox nor in Opera). var swfDiv = document.createElement('div'); swfDiv.innerHTML = ' '; document.body.appendChild(swfDiv); I tried to use document.write to append the HTML content, which made it work perfectly in IE, however, document.write wrote over the entire page (removing old content), which is something I don't want. document.write(' '); Any idea how to fix this? Thanks
