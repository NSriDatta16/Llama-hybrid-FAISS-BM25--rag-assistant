Is it always appropriate to use SMOTE in an imbalanced multiclass dataset?

Is it good practice to always use SMOTE and random undersampling in an imbalanced multiclass dataset or are there exceptions? In context, I am using a traditional machine learning model (SVC) for multiclass text classification, and not a neural network. And what sampling strategies are the most common (e.g. average of all classes, oversample to the majority class)? Here is the class distribution for the data in the project I'm currently working on for reference
