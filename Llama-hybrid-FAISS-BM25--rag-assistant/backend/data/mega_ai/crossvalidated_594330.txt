How to do Causal Inference for Observational Data [Supply Cain]?

Problem statement: Understand what factors impact the different operational times in a supply chain warehouse operation. I have observational data (past 1 year) which contains number of orders, packages, products, time taken to push out a product out of warehouse etc. I want to create a model to understand which factors 'causes' the increase/decrease in time taken to push out a product out of warehouse. I also want to understand by how much magnitude do those factors impact the time taken. I tried using a predictive approach where my predictor variables were # of orders, # of products shipped etc. and my response variable was time taken to push out a product. I trained a random forest on this and used SHAP values to infer which factor is most important and what factors plays important part in causing the time to increase or decrease. However, I feel that this approach is not correct since I did not model causal part in it. I came across a python library for causal inference - 'dowhy' but unable to understand how to identify confounder variables in my use case. Can anyone help?
