Time lag between correlated signals

What options are there for finding out what the time lag is for different time series? I'm looking at market data here - for example, if sugar does bad in a year, it's likely that soda might be hit the next year. I've come across cross-correlation, but am not sure how to go about using it. Are there any libraries that perform fast cross-correlation if that is the only way to go?
