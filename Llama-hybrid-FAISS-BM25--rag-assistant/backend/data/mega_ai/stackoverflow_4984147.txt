Magento - show price range of simple products

Is it possible in Magento to show the price range of simple products as opposed to the price set for the main configurable product. For example, say we have a t shirt, configurable by size and each with a different price. It doesnt make sense to show a fixed price on the catalog page does it? I would expect to see something similar to Prices from Â£3.99. Does anyone know if this is possible without any custom modification.
