What model to fit to a time series data with abnormal fluctuation?

The plot of the time series data I have: I can not understand how should I model this kind of dataset. Try: To estimate the deterministic part of the time series, I have fitted a cubic spline. Then to check for seasonality, I have plotted periodogram to the residual after removing the part explained by the cubic spline, though I do not find any significant spikes in the periodogram. But the process is not still stationary. [I have used ADF test and KPSS test in R to check for stationarity]. Another try: I have done the same thing after making a log transformation. If you suggest a new model to fit the dataset, also kindly provide the way of estimating the parameters associated with your model.
