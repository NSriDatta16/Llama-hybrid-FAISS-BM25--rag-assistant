How to diagnose clustering results

I am running clustering on text messages using different feature extraction approaches and algorithms. Most of my data is unannotated but a small part of it annotated based on the type of message: "complaint", "greeting". My objective is to use the annotated part of my data to determine the best approach for clustering the unannotated part of my data. To do this I cluster the annotated data and measure the clustering quality using the Adjusted Rand Score. The average score I obtained was quite low: around 0.10 with K-Means and close to 0 with DBSCAN. Are there any good practices when it comes to diagnosing clustering outcomes?
