If you would like to test your tests automatically than JUnit is not a good option. How you would like to ensure that your "special test" will be invoked always as last after all other tests? (I don't say it is not possible but it is against JUnit model/philosophy saying test cases should be independent of each other). If by any chance you will decide to do this one of the possibilities is to generate Cobertura code coverage report and parse it to find if all getters were covered during the tests. Possibly there is also a way to intercat with Cobertura through some API instead of depending on output report files. Example algorithm: run regular test suite run Cobertura run special test case
