this timing function performance link discusses your exact problem, specifically this paragraph: The problem is that according to MSDN the resolution of the DateTime.Now function is 10+ milliseconds, and we need to call it twice! So that would introduce a 20+ ms swing in your runtime measurement. As our function calls are often likely to be a lot quicker to return than this 20ms window this isnâ€™t good enough. EDIT: It kind of sounds like the second DateTime.Now is being called at a different time than when the stopwatch method concludes.
