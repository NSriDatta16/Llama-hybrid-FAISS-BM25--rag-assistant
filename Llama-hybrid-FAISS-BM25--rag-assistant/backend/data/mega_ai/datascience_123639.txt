Kernel SHAP loss function

I'm a beginner at data science and currently learning for XAI using Kernel SHAP method. After reading the official paper, I've found this formula to implement Kernel SHAP : (I'm aware there are shap library, but I want to learn it first by understanding the paper) I understand most of it, except for g(z'). What is g(z')? and how it can give a "value" or help the loss function. I'm really sorry if what I'm asking is a foolish question, but I'm just clueless about this. (I would appreciate it if you can give me a simple example) Thank you!
