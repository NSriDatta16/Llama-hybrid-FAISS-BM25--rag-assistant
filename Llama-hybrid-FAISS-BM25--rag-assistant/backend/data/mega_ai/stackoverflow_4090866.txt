I wonder if Visual Studio isn't correctly detaching from your running ASP.NET process. I'm not sure how you're 'stopping the app', but try doing so by clicking the 'Debug' menu and selecting 'Terminate All.' If this does the trick for you, you can make the command a little more accessible by adding it to your toolbar (right click the VS toolbar, select 'Customize...', select the Commands tab and select Category = Debug and then drag the 'Terminate All' command to one of your toolbars).
