Just an opinion... instead of including code to execute in the global space and depending on another global variable being defined, include your file wherever and have the code inside header.php be organized into appropriate functions. Then where you want the output from header.php, call the appropriate function with the $logged as an argument. This will help make your code more cohesive and easier to test (as in unit tests).
