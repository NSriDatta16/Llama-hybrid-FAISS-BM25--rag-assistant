One-class svm with given true positive rate

Is it always possible to find a one-class SVM with given true positive rate (TPR)? I used 1-D grid search with cross-validation to find the width parameter of RBF kernel with .90 TPR. The closest model I found has average .79 TPR using cross-validation. I am not talking about the prediction on unseen data yet; just the cross-validation performance. Using the code below I find bestcv = 0.79 but I want a one-class SVM with near 0.9 bestcv! % Each row of X contains a signals (has N rows), Row vector labs is % vector of N ones, '-s 2' means one-class SVM, '-t 2' means RBF kernel % which g is its parameter of. '-v 5' means use 5-fold cross-validation. libsvm-3.22 syntax bestdif = inf; tpr = 0.9; for log2g = -50:.125:10 cmd = ['-t 2 -s 2 -g ' num2str(2^log2g) ' -v ' 5]; cv = svmtrain(labs, X, cmd); dif = abs(cv-tpr); if dif bestdif = dif; bestg = 2^log2g; bestcv = cv; end end
