Of course then I will lose any information regarding the influence of each covariate to the model, but let's say I'm not interested in this information You're saying additional samples decrease power, but if you aren't interested in interpretation then why are you interested in ameliorating this problem? Additionally, your function is not one to one. This means there exist two points in your transform's domain which map to the same point in the image. Imagine there is a genuine relationship between predictors (say x1 increase the risk of outcome and x2 decreases the risk). Your transform completely destroy information in the data because (1,0) gets the same transformed value as (0,1) and the model can no longer detect the relationships. In any case, what it appears you're doing is combining data to make a composite score of sorts. Things like this are typically done via PCA which has the added benefit of giving you the composite score with maximum variance. If you insist on dimensionality reduction techniques, I would start there.
