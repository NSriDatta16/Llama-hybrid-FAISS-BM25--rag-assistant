Does PCA help if we have two positively correlated variables in training set but the same variables are negatively correlated in the test set?

Let's say we have a linear model: y = beta + pc1 + x3 + x4 'pc1' is a principal component of x1 and x2 which have a high positive correlation(in the training data). Would this model still be valid if the test data has a high but negative correlation between x1 and x2?
