There's no problem with your code, it's just that a paragraph or div tag can't receive focus . Focus can only be given to things you can interact with, such as links, input elements, textareas, etc. To scroll the window to this newly added element, you can use a plugin such as ScrollTo . On a side note, your code could be simplified a bit: var html = " New paragraph "; $("#content").append(html); $("#newP p").focus(); var html = " New paragraph "; $(html) .appendTo('#content') .focus() // or scrollTo(), now... ;
