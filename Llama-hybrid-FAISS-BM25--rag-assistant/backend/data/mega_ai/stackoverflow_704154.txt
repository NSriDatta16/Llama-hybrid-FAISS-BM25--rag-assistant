In production environments, animators use specialized tools such as Autodesk's 3DS Max to generate keyframed animations of 3D models. For each animation for each model, the animator constructs a number of poses for the model called the keyframes , which are then exported out into the game's data format. The game then loads these keyframes, and to animate the model at a particular time, it picks the two nearest keyframes and interpolates between them to give a smooth animation, even with a small number of keyframes. Animated models are typically constructed with a bone hierarchy. There is a root bone, which controls the model's location and orientation within the game world. All of the other bones are defined relative to some parent bone to create a tree. Each vertex of the model is tied to a particular bone, so the model can be controlled with a much smaller number of parameters: the relative positions, orientations, and scales of each bone. Smooth skinning is a technique used to improve the quality of animations. With smooth skinning, a vertex is not tied to just one bone, but it can be tied to multiple bones (usually a hard limit, such as 4, is set; vertices rarely need more than 3) with corresponding weights. This makes the animator's job harder, since he has to do a lot more work with vertices near joints, but the result is a much smoother animation with less distortion around the joints. Alternatively, some games use procedural animation , whereby the animation data is constructed at runtime. The bone positions and orientations are computed according to some algorithm, such as inverse kinematics or ragdoll physics . Other options are of course available, but they must be coded by programmers. Instead of procedurally animating the bones and using forward kinematics to determine the locations of all of the model's vertices, another option is to just procedurally generate the position of each vertex on its own. This allows for more complex animations that aren't bound by bone hierarchies, but of course it's much more complicated and much harder to do well.
