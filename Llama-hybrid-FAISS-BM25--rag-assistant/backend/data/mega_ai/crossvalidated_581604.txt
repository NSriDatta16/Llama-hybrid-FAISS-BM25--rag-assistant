Choosing the right average method

The following tables shows the wall clock times of some programs. So, A means the time for one configuration and B means the time for another configuration. I also have written the ration of B/A which shows B takes less time than A. A B B/A M1 1 1 1 M2 4 2 0.5 M3 35 9 0.257 M4 298 67 0.224 M5 18 6 0.333 M6 6 3 0.5 Now, I want to find the average of reductions. I can do that with three different ways: 1- Arithmetic mean of B/A = 0.469218068 Since B/A is a ratio, I don't think this is a good way to measure the average. 2- Harmonic mean of B/A = 0.367272358 That makes sense because harmonic means is used for ratios. 3- Finding the arithmetic means of A and B separately and then dividing AVG(B) to AVG(A). AVG(A) = 60.33333333 AVG(B) = 14.66666667 AVG(B)/AVG(A) = 0.243093923 My question is, which of second and third methods are preferred and makes more sense?
