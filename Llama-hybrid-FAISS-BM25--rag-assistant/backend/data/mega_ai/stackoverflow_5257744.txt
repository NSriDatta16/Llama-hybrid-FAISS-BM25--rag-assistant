Can a clicktag-enabled Flash ad be presented without an ad server?

I am new to the world of online advertising and know almost nothing about developing Flash. I run a WordPress website for a local magazine, and they recently acquired an advertiser who wants to advertise with Flash on our website. (All ads up until now have been images, animated or otherwise, which I surrounded with a hyperlink.) I assumed that presenting the Flash ad was as simple as embedding the HTML that referenced the .swf file, but although the ad would load, clicking on it produced no result. I contacted the advertiser to tell them their link wasn't working, but they asked what our 'clicktag' requirements were. Confused, I did some Googling, and learned what a clicktag is. After an hour or so of researching on Google, Wikipedia, and StackOverflow, I'm a little confused about what I need to set up to present this ad. Assuming the advertiser built their SWF properly (which, now that I've made them check it, I assume they did), is it simply a matter of presenting the ad through an ad server that supports clicktag? Or is there a way of presenting it without an ad server? We do not have an an ad server, and the second question is: if we need one, which ad network would be a good fit for us? (Our website is relatively small â€” only about 200 visits a day).
