Refactoring away labeled loops

After I was convinced that labeled breaks/continues are a total "nono" over here , I need help to remove the label out of my code. I have a square matrix and a vector that has the same length. The vector has already some values in it an depending on the values in the matrix the vector is changed in the loop. I hope, the code-fragment is basically understandableâ€¦ vectorLoop: for( int idx = 0; idx Please convince me, that there is a more readable/better version without the labels.
