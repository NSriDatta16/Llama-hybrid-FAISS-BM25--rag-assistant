Regression Analysis for Customer satisfaction

I want to see how Customer satisfaction is related to the following variables (survey metrics): Average response time, Drop off Rate, Click through rate, Number of Active users etc, Number of surveys filled in person etc. , so all numeric fields basically. I have come across different methods; linear regression, Logistic regression etc but not sure which to use. These predictor variables are correlated, for example the higher the Click through rate, the lower the average response time, and the lower the Drop off rate. Also could I please get an approximation of how many training observations would generally be needed for such a model, I know it depends on the data but whats considered the bare minimum? Please help me pick the right approach, thanks!
