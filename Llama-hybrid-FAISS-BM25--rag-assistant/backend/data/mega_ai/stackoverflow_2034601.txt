You can use regular expressions, i don't know ruby but the code should be almost exactly as my example: Regex.Replace("this is an example @AlbertEin", "(? [@#])(? \\w{1,}[^ ])", " ${type}${nick} "); This example would return this is an example @AlbertEin If you run it on .NET The regex (? [@#])(? \\w{1,}[^ ]) means, capture and name it TYPE the text that starts with @ or #, and then capture and name it NAME the text that follows that contains at least one text character until you fin a white space.
