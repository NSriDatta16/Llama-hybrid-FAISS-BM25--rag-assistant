CSS Line-Height Guide

I remember reading a style guide explaining what the proper line-height should be for each element. I can't find it on google. I would appreciate it if anyone could link me to such a guide, or perhaps explain it in an answer. Thanks! Edit: SORRY, please let me clarify. I'm not asking about how to use CSS to set line-heights, but what the recommended line-heights are for various elements. eg headers, paragraph text, etc. Thanks!
