Cox proportional hazard, entire population as reference

In R when I use coxph the first factor is automatically picked as the reference group: df And I can obtain HR and CI for treatment B and C, relative to treatment A. How can I get HR, lower95, upper95 for all 3 treatments relative to the entire cohort (average survival)?
