Why isn't os.walk recognising my variable name?

I've written the following in TextWrangler: directory = raw_input("See contents of: ") for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory): print root, dirs, files Unfortunately, when I run it in terminal and assign the directory path by typing or dragging a folder in from the dock nothing happens. Not even an error message. On the other hand when I enter the following in TextWrangler then run the program in Terminal, it works fine. for root, dirs, files in os.walk("/Users/paulpatterson/Documents/Python"): print root, dirs, files My question then, why is os.walk not accepting a path in the form of a variable. The book that I'm using suggests it should, as do most of the examples I've seen on the net whilst trying to sort this out.
