Those SELECT DISTINCTs are going to be one disadvantage. You're going to find it slow to build a list of tags, not just in the case of building an index to link (which you could work around by fragment caching, I suppose) but also for auto-complete. I'd say the more significant disadvantage is that if you're using an in-application search solution (e.g. Xapian) you'll either need to index the Taggings table, which is likely to create some odd results, or not index tags at all, which might defeat the point of tags, depending on how you're using them. None of which is to say you absolutely shouldn't do this, of course; skipping the extra join is going to make some things a lot faster. It's smart of you to look at the cost and decide if it's worth it.
