Android video stream capture for AR

I would like to be able to capture the video from an android phone camera, and then process this video. Processing involves adding a layer of AR to the live stream. Is this possible on android? Pretty sure it should be. I have looked at the android site [ http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/index.html] but this seems to be concerned with video capture and storage. I would like to be able to play with the video pre-storage. Thanks,
