In order to store KeyValuePairs without much fuss on the local machine, I'd consider using IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings dictionary collection. Here's an example of that: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc221360(VS.95).aspx If you'd like to store a BitmapImage to IsoStore, I'd suggest using a Image Encoder of sorts in conjunction with WriteableBitmap. Placing your BitmapImage (via an Image control) in a WriteableBitmap will give you access to each individual pixel. Using a PngEncoder you can save an actual image file for that image. Jeff prosise has a sample of that here: http://www.wintellect.com/CS/blogs/jprosise/archive/2009/07/17/fun-with-savefiledialog-and-writeablebitmap.aspx
