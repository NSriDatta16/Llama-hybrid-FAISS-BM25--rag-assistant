You will almost certainly want to check some of the literature on GIS data structures, especially ways of modelling networks. Routes are usually made up of a number of sub-routes and so on down until you get to a road segment from one junction to another. What your proposed storage scheme omits entirely is any notions of connectivity between segments and sub-routes. There's a lot of good work in Open GIS for data standards -- I'm not familiar with it but it is probably a good place to start Googling. I guess you might be intending to model each different route as a different polyline -- but if you are how will you deal with routes which are coincident over some sub-route ?
