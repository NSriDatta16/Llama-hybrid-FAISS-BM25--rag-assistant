To me this depends on the size of your tree and the type of a query you want to run. From what I can tell you have two data items. MyId and MyParent. If you created a simply table with just those two things you could ask and answer who are my children and who are my parents. If you wanted to build a complete tree for intensive analysis, I would query all data and them build the tree myself. The database acting only as information storage at this point. If my tree was large or took more than a half a second to create I would maintain it on my server and make it accessible with ajax calls to the client. This works best if the tree is static for all clients. If the tree is dynamic I would insist that the client waits while the data is retrieved from the server and the tree is built locally. This will increase usage speed. If you provided more information on what you ment when you said "split the tree" I might be able to offer a better opinion. But in general I have not found an ideal tree in a database. However OLAP might have such a tool that I don't know about.
