T-test with replicate measurements, how to quantify error in the measurements?

I want to compare two tools, A and B. I use tool A to measure 10 very different objects, making 5 repeated measurements for each object so I can record an accurate value. I also do this with tool B. Now I have some options: Average each 5 replicate measurements and do a single paired t-test. But there must be some error in each measurement set (5 replicate), so how do I account for this error? Do a separate t-test for each object. Let's say I can only reject the null hypothesis for some objects but not others. (And I don't know what aspect of the specific object affects the result.) How would I aggregate the result to get an overall comparison of A vs B? Do an ANOVA test. But in this case I only care about two categories, I don't know if ANOVA is appropriate.
