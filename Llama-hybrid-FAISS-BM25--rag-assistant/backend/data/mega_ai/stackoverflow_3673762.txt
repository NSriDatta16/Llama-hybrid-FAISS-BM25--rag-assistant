Well, there really isn't anything wrong with the code you have here. I've set up a jsfiddle to test it, and it works fine. The only problem, and it shouldn't affect whether the submit event is captured by the event handler, is that the HTML fragment you're trying to insert after the button is invalid - you've got your opening and closing tags mixed up. This is the code I have after that minor edit: jQuery(function($) { $("form.follow-form").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).find('i').addClass('active'); $.post('/ajax_html_echo/', { followID: $(this).find('input').val() }, function() { $(e.currentTarget).find('button').hide().after(' Following! '); }); }); }); Other than that, it works fine - that is, assuming you want the following span to display no matter what the outcome of the ajax request is.
