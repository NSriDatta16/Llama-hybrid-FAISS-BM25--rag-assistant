I found out what it was! Linq to SQL will put the [DataMember()] attribute on the Child Records, But NOT the Parents. I had to add the [DataMember()] attribute under the association . The Down Side is this is a Manual Entry to the context.designer.cs which will get overwritten if the dbml is changed :-( [Association(Name="CustomerStatus_Customer", Storage="_CustomerStatus", ThisKey="CustomerStatusId", OtherKey="CustomerStatusId", IsForeignKey=true)] [DataMember()] public CustomerStatus CustomerStatus { get { return this._CustomerStatus.Entity; } set { ... } }
