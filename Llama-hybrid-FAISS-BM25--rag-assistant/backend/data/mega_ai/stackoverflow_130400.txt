All your LINQ querys should be in a business logic class , no change from older methodologies like ADO. If you are a purist you should always return List(of T) from your methods in the business class, in fact, the datacontext should only be visible to the business classes. Then you can manipulate the list in the user interface. If you are a pragmatist , you can return a IQueryable object and make some manipulations in the user interface.
