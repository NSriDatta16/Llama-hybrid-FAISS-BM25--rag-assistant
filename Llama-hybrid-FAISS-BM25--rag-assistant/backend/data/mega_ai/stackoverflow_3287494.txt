How to install WinPCAP from within my MSI installer?

I am developing a product that will use WinPCAP for ethernet packet capturing. Is it possible to install WinPCAP from my own MSI or it must be installed seperately ? If it is possible to install it from my own MSI, can someone let me know how ? I also have to support silent installation.
