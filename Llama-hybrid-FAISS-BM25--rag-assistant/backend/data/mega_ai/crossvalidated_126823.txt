The difference between a stochastic process and a time series is somewhat like the difference between a cat on a keyboard and an answer on Stack Exchange: Cats on keyboards can produce answers, but cats on keyboards are not answers. Furthermore, not every answer is produced by a cat on a keyboard. A time series can be understood as a collection of time-value–data-point pairs. A stochastic process on the other hand is a mathematical model or a mathematical description of a distribution of time series¹. Some time series are a realisation of stochastic processes (of either kind). Or, from another point of view: I can use a stochastic process as a model to generate a time series. Furthermore, time series can also be generated in other ways: They can be the result of observations and are thus generated by reality. While I can model reality as a stochastic process (I could also say that I regard reality as a stochastic process), reality is not a stochastic process in the same way that the interior of a box is not a set of points (though we often regard the two equivalent in modelling contexts). They can be generated by deterministic processes. Now, strictly speaking, we could (and arguably should) define stochastic processes and deterministic processes in a way that the latter are special cases of the former, but we very rarely make use of this and speaking of deterministic processes as special cases of stochastic processes may cause some confusion – you could compare it to calling $x=2$ a system of non-linear equations. ¹ If it is a discrete-time stochastic process. Continuous-time stochastic process are distributions of functions rather than time series.
