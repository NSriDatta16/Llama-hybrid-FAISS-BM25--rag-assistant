categorical data normalization in SVM Classification

I have a set of features (contineous + categorical)...I have converted the different categories to numerical, for example (object1, object2, object3) = (1,2,3)..etc. and ran SVM... I obtain high SVM performance in this way. Are the results I obtained considered wrong since I have not binarized the categorical data as it is advised frequenly.
