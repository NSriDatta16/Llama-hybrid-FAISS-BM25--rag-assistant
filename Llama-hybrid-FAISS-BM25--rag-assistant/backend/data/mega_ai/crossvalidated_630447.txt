Logistic regression and survival analysis are different statistical methods designed to answer different types of questions. The fact that you're getting different results is not surprising, as these methods assess relationships between variables in different ways. Logistic regression is used to model the probability of an event occurring at any point during the study period. It does not take into account the time to the event. Survival analysis, on the other hand, handles time-to-event data. It accounts for both the occurrence of the event and the time at which the event occurs. This is particularly important when the risk of the event changes over time.
