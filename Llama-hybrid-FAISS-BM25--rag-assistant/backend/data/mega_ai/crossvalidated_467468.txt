That is a large topic, and the quality of the approximation must be studied, generally, on a case-by-case basis. That's why simulation is a useful approach. So the best way to answer your question is by an example, which you can adapt for your data and models. So I will simulate, in R , some data for a logistic regression, and I will simulate binomial responses from the null model, that is, all regression parameters (except the intercept) assumed to be zero. Then I fit the logistic model, calculate the deviance, repeat many times, and plot the histogram, with the chi-square approximation overlaid. For my case the result is (based on 10000 replications) which looks rather good. A qqplot could also be useful: This looks like a very good fit. Maybe some clumpiness (discreteness), but no systematic deviations. But also, the far tail is poorly represented, to check quality of fit there, maybe a larger simulation. You can modify the code below for your experiments: set.seed(7*11*13) # My public seed X
