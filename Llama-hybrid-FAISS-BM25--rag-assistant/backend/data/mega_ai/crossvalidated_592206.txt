Normalize data for non-negative distribution conditional sampling

Normalizing data is helpful in most MCMC cases. Most of the times the suggested normalization is z-score. But what happens when I want to normalize data, which then I sample from a non-negative distribution ? E.g. let's say I model x = [263.1, 348.4, 362.0, 395.7, 479.2, 974.4] to come from an Exponential distribution: x[i] ~ Exponential(Î») . Obviously here if we use z-score ( $\frac{x-\bar{x}}{\sigma}$ ), the Exponential sampling will error. I was thinking something like $\frac{x-min(x)}{\sigma}$ , but I am wondering if there is already a suggested way to normalize the x vector for such cases ?
