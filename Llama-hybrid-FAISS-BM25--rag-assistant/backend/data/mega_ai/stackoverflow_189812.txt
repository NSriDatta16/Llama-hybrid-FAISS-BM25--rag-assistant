I'll add another vote to "practice makes perfect" but with a slight admendment: perfect practice makes perfect - a related saying is "practice makes permanent" so in other words make sure that what you're practicing is good coding habits that cut down on mistakes: unit testing readable code formatting useful variable names source control for revision history and so on. I also highly reccommend taking a look at good open source projects and seeing how they organize and manage the code. Good examples are even more important to learn from than seeing other people's mistakes :-)
