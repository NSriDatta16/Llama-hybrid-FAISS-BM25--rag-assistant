In terms of enhancing your app, here are some things I personally like: Dropshadow ... Creates the effect of depth on your application, ensure a global lighting direction otherwise, it is difficult to maintain a good general effect. Scaling ... When transitioning from one state to another, the use of scaling draws attention to the control/screen Easing ... Whenever there is movement in the screen, the movement should be eased from start to finish. Shine ... For rollovers, I like a subtle shine to a control, this can be achieved by moving a subtle gradient across the control. These are just a few effects ... I think it's import to note that effects can ruin an app as quickly as it can make one, so you want to make sure that the effects you use compliment your application. From a UX perspective, my advice is that any interaction from the user should be exaggerated. For example, rollover effects, highlighting click interactions, etc. So in conclusion: Use effects to highlight user interaction Ensure that effects are used in appropriate places Keep the effects subtle Avoid excessive use of effects Hope that helps!
