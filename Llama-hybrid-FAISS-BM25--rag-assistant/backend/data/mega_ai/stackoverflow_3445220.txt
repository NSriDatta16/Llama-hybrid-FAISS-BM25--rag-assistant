Have you considered just creating a custom web control. I have created a quick one which accepts an array [,] and just simply outputs the contents of the array in a div with p's around each array value. Its simple, lightweight and you will have complete control of the output. Here are the step you need to implement: Add a new project to your web application and make sure you referent System.web. Maybe call the project WebControls. Add the following C# code to a new class file you can add to the project. CUSTOM CONTROL CODE: using System.ComponentModel; using System.Web.UI; using System.Web.UI.WebControls; namespace WebControls { [ToolboxData(" ")] public class ArrayDisplayControl : WebControl { protected override HtmlTextWriterTag TagKey { get { return HtmlTextWriterTag.Div; } } public string[,] DataSource { get { return (string[,])ViewState["DataSource"]; } set { ViewState["DataSource"] = value; } } protected override void RenderContents(HtmlTextWriter output) { output.WriteBeginTag("div"); for (int i = 0; i Now all you have to do is ref your newly added project to your web application. properties --> add reference - select projects and then the name of the new project. Ok all thats left is to add a decleration to the top of you asp.net page so you can reference the custom control like the following: Now reference the control in you html like the following: Ok so last step is to bind the control to some data in the code behind - something like the following: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { string[,] data = new string[2, 2] { { "Mike", "Amy" }, { "Mary", "Albert" } }; ctlArrayDisplay.DataSource = data; ctlArrayDisplay.DataBind(); } And here is the output after running: Mike Amy Mary Albert Hope this help you out of your jam. Enjoy!
