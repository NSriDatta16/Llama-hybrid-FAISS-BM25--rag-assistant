I too am learning Clojure and loving it. But at this stage of my development, the Groovy version was easier to understand. What I like about Clojure though is reading the code and having the "Aha!" experience when you finally "get" what is going on. What I really enjoy is the similar experience that happens a few minutes later when you realize all of the ways the code could be applied to other types of data with no changes to the code. I've lost count of the number of times I've worked through some numerical code in Clojure and then, a little while later, thought of how that same code could be used with strings, symbols, widgets, ... The analogy I use is about learning colors. Remember when you were introduced to the color red? You understood it pretty quickly -- there's all this red stuff in the world. Then you heard the term magenta and were lost for a while. But again, after a little more exposure, you understood the concept and had a much more specific way to describe a particular color. You have to internalize the concept, hold a bit more information in your head, but you end up with something more powerful and concise.
