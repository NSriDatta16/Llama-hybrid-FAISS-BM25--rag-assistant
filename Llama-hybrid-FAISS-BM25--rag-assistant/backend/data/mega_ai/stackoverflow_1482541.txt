A few comments: As written, your code doesn't support "any base", only bases up to 17 (an odd place to stop). strchr() can return NULL . You should never assume that it won't, especially when you're feeding it direct user input. Lowercase letters are nice, and you should support them. Simply convert the relevant character to uppercase with toupper() , and then you can recognize both a and A as hexidecimal 10. In the interest of coding practices, I would suggest creating a function to perform the relevant conversion, rather than doing all the dirty work in main() . If you're doing this as a learning exercise, ignore this paragraph, but you appear to essentially be rewriting the standard library function strtol() , which converts a string to a long for arbitrary bases. It's pretty nice, actually, and has some functionality that you could incorporate into your code if you wanted.
