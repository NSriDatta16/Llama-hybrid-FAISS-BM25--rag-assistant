apache2 and mysqldump causing massive load average spike

I've got a problem that's causing me some headaches and I could use some ideas on how to investigate/fix it. Setup: I'm running a Rails app (Apache2 w/ Passenger) on server A (Rails.A) I'm running the master DB on a dedicated DB server B (DB.B) I'm running a slave DB on server A (DB.A) with standard MySQL replication (just for backup purposes) Rails.A is reading/writing to DB.B Problem: When running a mysqldump on DB.A, the load average on A skyrockets because Apache appears to spin off tonnes of processes. This really doesn't make sense to me as DB.A isn't even used by Rails.A. I can completely shutdown DB.A and Rails.A works just fine. I've even tried running the mysqldump with "ionice -c2 -n6", with no change. Thoughts?
