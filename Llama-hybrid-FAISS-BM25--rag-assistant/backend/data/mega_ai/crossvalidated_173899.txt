I am not sure what you mean by "does 0-1 loss function analogy extend to more general cases?" As you noted, depending on your loss function, you can find a different point estimate that maximizes your posterior. For e.g., if you care about least-squares error, you would pick the posterior distribution's mean. For absolute value loss, you pick the median. Here is a doc that outlines proofs for all these http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~ajyu/Teaching/Tutorials/bayes_dt.pdf . However, note that the full information for decision making is contained in the distribution in the spirit of true Bayesian thinking.
