Dynamic Links in jQuery Mobile lose formatting

I'm trying to use jQuery Mobile for a mobile website (after trying and ditching jQTouch) and I think this is going to work beautifully. However, I've run into a formatting issue when hyperlinking to a second page. I have a main index.php page which contains all of the static information I'm wanting to display. I'll have two links that will make SQL calls into a database for the information -- for these, I'm taking the code out of the index.php and calling a separate page: ucd.php. This second page load a dynamic listing that drills down into the database until they select the car they're looking for. My problem is when you're linked from the index page to ucd.php, the CSS formatting of the page is gone. If I load ucd.php on it's own, it formats properly. If I go index->ucd.php->list selection, index is formatted, ucd.php is NOT formatted, 1st dynamic list option IS formatted. One thing I did notice is, when ucd.php is called, it changes the URL in the address bar to "http://localhost/#ucd.php" -- not "http://localhost/ucd.php". From what I've read on the jQuery Mobile site, it does this to keep the history properly in the hash. Should that cause any formatting problems? (for space reasons, all pages start w/ and have the proper script loadings done. jQuery Touch 1.0a2, jQuery 1.4.4) index.php: Car Dealership Search New Cars Search Used Cars Service/Parts Info Find Us Call Us @ 888-867-5309 Hours of Operation Thanks for visiting us! I'm only pasting the outputted HTML code from the .php page ucd.php: Used Cars Chevrolet Chrysler Dodge Ford GMC Honda Hyundai Infiniti Jeep Lincoln Nissan Toyota Volkswagen Thanks! Thanks in advance for any help, Josh Hogan
