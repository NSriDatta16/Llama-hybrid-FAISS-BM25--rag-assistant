The issue with using OLS to model panel data is that one is not accounting for fixed and random effects. Fixed Effects: Effects that are independent of random disturbances, e.g. observations independent of time. Random Effects: Effects that include random disturbances. Firstly, you should use the Hausman test to determine whether fixed or random effects are present in your model. If you are using R, this can be done with phtest. More information can be found here . As an example, suppose we wish to determine the presence of fixed or random effects using the gasoline dataset in plm : > library(plm) Loading required package: Formula > > data("Gasoline", package = "plm") > form wi re phtest(wi, re) Hausman Test data: form chisq = 302.8, df = 3, p-value Given that the p-value is less than 0.05, this indicates that the null hypothesis of random effects is rejected - indicating that fixed effects are present in the model. Two regressions are then run accounting for both fixed and random effects: > summary(plmwithin) Oneway (individual) effect Within Model Call: plm(formula = form, data = Gasoline, model = "within") Balanced Panel: n = 18, T = 19, N = 342 Residuals: Min. 1st Qu.

Had a standard OLS model been run, then random effects may have been accounted for when the Hausman test is indicating that a fixed effects model better describes the relationships between these variables. In this regard, an OLS regression is likely to be ineffective with panel data, as the differences between fixed and random effects are not being accounted for.
