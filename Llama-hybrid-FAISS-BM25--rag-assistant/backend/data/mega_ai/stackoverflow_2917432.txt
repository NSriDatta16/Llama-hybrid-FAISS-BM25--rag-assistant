Order of insertion does not in the end always control order in the table. Tables are ordered by their clustered index, if they have one. If they do not have one, then the order is technically undefined, although it is probably safe in many cases to assume that they're ordered in insertion order this doesn't mean they'll stay that way. Lacking a specific ordering the DB engine is free to reorder as it sees fit to optimize retrieval. If you want to control order on disk, the single best way is to properly define your clustered index. Always.
