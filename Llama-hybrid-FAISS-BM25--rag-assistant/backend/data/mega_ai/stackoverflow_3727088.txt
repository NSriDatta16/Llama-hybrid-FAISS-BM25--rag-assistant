Instead of using the session variable to only allow them to access the current step, allow them to access the current or previous steps. Sort of a "how far you can go" flag. Now, add links to the previous steps, like a breadcrumb trail. Finally, use a lookup in the persistent store (db, session, xml, bag of holding, etc.) for the data already entered for that form. Create a blank set of form data, overwrite it with anything found in the persistent store, then overwrite it with anything from the form scope itself. Something like: populate = structNew(); // this is the data to populate your form with on load populate.someValue = ""; structappend(populate, dataFromStorage); structappend(populate, form); // from things submitted from the form scope, in case validation fails Now, if someone hits the same form step twice, they will see (in order of precedence) the values they submitted, but which didn't pass validation, values from the persistent data store, and then an empty form.
