Ordering records with e.g. drag& drop, how does that look in a clean way?

I have no clue how to achieve this, I tried for hours now. I implemented a drag&drop of a list and now I want to save the change of the order in my db. I think for this is an order field needed which stores an int. But the problem is: how should I populate this field? E.g. I want to do an operation like "insert a new list item after item at position 2", i would define a value higher than that of position 2 and lower than that of position three. But this is limited somehow. An idea was to write new order values for each record when changing one to keep a clean order value. But that seems odd because it is slow as hell. How do good systems solve this problem?
