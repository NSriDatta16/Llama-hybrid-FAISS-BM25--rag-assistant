I found a method that does just this (a decision tree, where the leafs contain a linear-regression instead of an average value). They are called model trees [1] and an example is the M5P[2] algorithm of weka. In M5P a linear regression is at each leaf. Edit: I found another package/model that does something similar and seems to give very good results for my datasets: cubist. An implementation in R is given by the cubist package [3]. Cubist adds boosting ensembling to M5P and what it calls 'instance based corrections'. [1]: Torgo, L. Functional models for regression tree leaves.
