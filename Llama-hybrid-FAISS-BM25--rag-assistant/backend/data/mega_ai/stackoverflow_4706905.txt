A basic algorithm is to split it up into three parts and first solve each separately: Iterate over the characters with a for loop. Write a function to determine if a character is a vowel. Change a character in a string to another character. However this simplified algorithm strictly speaking doesn't always work. Before solving this task you should try to learn a little about what a vowel is. For example in English the following letters almost always produce vowel sounds: a, e, i, o, u. The letter y often produces a vowel (e.g. in "myth" or "happy"), but not always. There are also other letters that produce vowel sounds more rarely. You should also also know that almost all teachers (and probably more than half of professional programmers) believe that there only five vowels - a, e, i, o and u. As such I'd advise you to keep it simple and use the five vowel interpretation in order to avoid being marked down. But write a note in the source code that you are aware that there are some letters that are incorrectly classified and that you have chosen not to fix it, so that you at least have proven that you are aware of the issue. In my opinion this is a terrible question to set for beginner level students as it either requires the student to less time on programming and more time on learning about the intricacies and inconsistencies of the English language. Or else it encourages coding without fully understand the domain. A better example would be: Replace the letters: a,e,i,o,u with x A,E,I,O,U with X It would be a good idea to put your interpretation of the question in your solution to ensure that there is no misunderstanding.
