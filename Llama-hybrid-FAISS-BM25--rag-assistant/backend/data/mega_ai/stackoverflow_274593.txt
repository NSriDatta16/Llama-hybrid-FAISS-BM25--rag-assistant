I'm not going to directly answer your question for a simple reason: I hate the lines of code metric. No matter what you're trying to measure it's very hard to do worse than LOC; Pretty much any other metric you care to think of is going to be better. In particular, you seem to want measure the complexity of your code. Overall cyclometric complexity (also called McCabe's complexity) is much better metric for this. Routines with a high cyclometric complexity are the routines you want to focus your attention on. It's these routines that are difficult to test, rotten to the core with bugs and hard to maintain. There are many tools that measure this sort of complexity. A quick Google search on your favourite language will find dozens of tools that do this sort of complexity.
