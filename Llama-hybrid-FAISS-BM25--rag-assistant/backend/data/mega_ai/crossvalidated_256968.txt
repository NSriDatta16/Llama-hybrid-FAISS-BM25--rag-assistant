Think of the inclusion/exclusion of a variable in your model as a random variable. The posterior distribution of this variable is obtained (probably) by some MCMC sampling scheme. The PIP is the mean of the posterior. You can think of it as a measure of how likely it is that this variable is included in the true model. It is not model averaging. In model averaging you want to compute some summary measure and treat the models as a sort of nuisance parameter that you want to integrate out. So BMA gives you summary measures of interest that take all models into account. PIP is a value for each variable that indicates how likely it is to be included in the true model.
