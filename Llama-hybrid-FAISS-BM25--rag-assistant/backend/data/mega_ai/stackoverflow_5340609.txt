What you want is a space-filling-curce for example a Z-Curce or a Hilbert-Curve. A space-filling-curve sub-divide the plane into smaller tiles and reduce the complexity of 2-Dimensions into 1-Dimension in a way that each tile get's a new order. What might interessting for your problem is that the Hilber-Curve traverse the plane not in binary order but it use a gray code so that every tile is different in 1-Bit from the other tiles. That makes it easy to decide whether the user has clicked this or that object.
