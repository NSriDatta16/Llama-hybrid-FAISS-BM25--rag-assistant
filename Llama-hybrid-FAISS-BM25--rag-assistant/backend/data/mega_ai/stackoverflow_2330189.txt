What is the phpdoc syntax to link $this to a specific class in Aptana?

I'm working on Magento templates, but this issue would apply to any template loading system. As these templates are loaded by the template engine there's no way for the IDE (in this case Aptana) to know what object type $this is. Potentially it could more than one object as a single template could be loaded by multiple objects, but ignoring this, what would the correct phpdoc syntax be to specify a specific class for the $this object?
