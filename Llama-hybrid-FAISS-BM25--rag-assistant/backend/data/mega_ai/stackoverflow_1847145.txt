You do know what http://localhost actually points to? It points to the web server which is running at localhost at port 80. Localhost == 127.0.0.1 == local machine. As Webstart aka JNLP apps runs at the client machine, it will try to connect the web server at the same (local) machine. You don't want to do that. Change the URL to point to the actual web server at the server machine where your webapp runs and where JNLP is to be downloaded from.
