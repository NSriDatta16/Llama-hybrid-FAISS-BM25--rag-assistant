I would try this route: Create an XML Map data source like: (we'll call it "entriesMap.xsd") In a new Excel worksheet: Open the "XML Source" pane (Data-->XML-->XML Source) Select the "XML Maps..." button in the XML Source pane Select the "Add..." button Select and open the XML Map file (change filetype *.xsd: our's is entriesMap.xsd) Drag the map elements (StartDate, Total, etc) to their own cols or drag the top element all at once Goto Data-->XML-->Import... Select your XML data file Not sure if I have the xsd file right, but I believe if you go this route it will work.
