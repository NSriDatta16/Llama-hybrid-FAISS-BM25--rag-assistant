Optuna Median Pruner n_warmup_steps

For Gradient Boosting Models such as XGBOOST and LGBM does n_warmup_steps in optuna.pruners.MedianPruner refer to the minimum number of folds evaluated before pruning is triggered? I.e. if number of CV folds equals 5 then n_warmup_steps=1 means pruning only takes place after at least one 2/5 folds is evaluated (since it starts counting at 0)?
