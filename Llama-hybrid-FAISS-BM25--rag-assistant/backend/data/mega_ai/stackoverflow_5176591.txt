A setter doesn't just set a property in response to state changing, it also restores the property to its previous value when the state changes back. There's no "changes back" with event triggers, so using setters with them would be like pushing something onto a stack that never gets popped. I think a much better question, under the circumstances, is "why isn't there an IsDragOver property?"
