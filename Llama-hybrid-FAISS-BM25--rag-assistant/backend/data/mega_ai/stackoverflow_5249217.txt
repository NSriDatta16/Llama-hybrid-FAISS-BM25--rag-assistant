Premier, I followed the Fragments example on the Android Developers Blog to create a "backwards" compatible app using Fragments. In the article there is a brief mention of the Main activity that uses a layout with fragments. The code for this activity is not interesting; it just calls setContentView() with the given layout: What should be mentioned here is that this activity must derive from FragmentActivity and not Activity class. This threw me off for a while. Good luck
