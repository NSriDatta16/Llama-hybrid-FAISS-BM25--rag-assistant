Start here for authoritative information from the Push Notification Service Programming Guide . You might also search here on Stack Overflow , and on Google . If you can explain in more detail what, exactly, you're looking for help with, we can help with more specific information. If your plan is to have someone configure alarms on some web site (or desktop app, or whatever), and the use push to send a notification to the device when the alarm "goes off", I encourage you to reconsider that. Push is an unreliable medium (in the same sense as UDP): no guarantees are made as to when, or whether, the notifications will be delivered. It is not something you should depend on to happen at a particular time. It does not get you around the prohibition on background processes on iPhone. That said, you can certainly try. The Programming Guide I linked above will get you started. There are definitely many APNS tutorials on the web. And if you have specific questions, this site can certainly help. But right now, you're asking, essentially, "how do I write my app?" That's a pretty broad scope for a Q&A site like this.
