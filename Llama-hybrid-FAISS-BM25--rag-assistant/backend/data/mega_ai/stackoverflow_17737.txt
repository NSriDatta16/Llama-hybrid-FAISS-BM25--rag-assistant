I don't want to discourage you from trying linux. But in this context it should be pointed out, that Linux is not completely posix compliant! Wikipedia has a list of fully posix compliant operating systems From that list, Solaris is probably the best to get started. But anyway - for most of your posix-needs Linux should be the best choice (especially for beginners!)
