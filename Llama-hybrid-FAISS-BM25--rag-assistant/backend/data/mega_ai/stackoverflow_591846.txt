Inline statesments work just like the sproc, except you create the string with the @param statements embedded in the string. You should just have to pull in your update and insert statement in your sproc. You then have to create the parameter links. If you want to have this drag and drop, insert the update statement into the wizard. The worst case scenario is adding the parameter mappings. So, the drag and drop does not really offer much here.
