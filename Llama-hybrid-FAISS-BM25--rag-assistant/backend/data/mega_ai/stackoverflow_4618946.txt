Embedding the database is probably your best bet. You can use an .mdb, or SQLite or similiar. If your using .mdb, just create a template .mdb, then make it a resource of the project. Then you can copy it to the destination and modify it from there. I would use SQLite, as its open source, and then you don't have to mess with changing the connection string because you'll just be using the program's install directory to store it.
