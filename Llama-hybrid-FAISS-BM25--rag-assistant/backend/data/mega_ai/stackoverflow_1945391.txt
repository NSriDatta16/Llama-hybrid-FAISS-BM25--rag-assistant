To be fair, the code above is very explicit. Apart from implementing it as a hierarchy of objects, you could go nuts and do something like storage_method = backup.procedure.storage_name.upcase records = eval("Backup::Record::#{storage_method}.all :conditions => {:trigger => trigger}" I'm not suggesting that this is actually correct but hopefully it illustrates my point that concise code isn't always better than explicit code. Ruby can be just as dangerous as C :-)
