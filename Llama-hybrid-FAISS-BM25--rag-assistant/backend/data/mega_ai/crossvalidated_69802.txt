Reverse PCA with nonsquare matrix

I am working with PCA to do dimensionality reduction to a set of data. I have 1600 data points with 36 variables and I want to have a matrix with a new data set with 6 principal components. I managed to do it in matlab, so I have: xtrain (normalized) and I write: coeff=pca(xtrain,'NumComponents',6) which gives me a matrix So far so good. Now I want to know how to reverse the process. If I'm given a data set of how do I use the coeff matrix to pass it to a "n x 36" representation? I would like to do this in matlab but a simple explanation can help me.
