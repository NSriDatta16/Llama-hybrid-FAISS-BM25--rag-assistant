Unable to read SMS from the Nokia phone using GSMComm

I'm implementing a project for reading and parsing SMS from Nokia Xpress Music 5800 using GSMComm library I tried using GSMComm Demo: I'm able to get phone information, different status such as battery/storage and send SMS. But I'm not able to read SMS from the phone, it's giving following error: Error: The phone reports an unspecified error. This typically happens when a command is not supported by the device,a command is not valid for the current state or if a parameter is incorrect. ( GsmComm.GsmCommunication.CommException ) Since I use DLL's I don't see which commands are being sent to the phone. Also I doubt that all other commands work, except the ones reading the SMS. Questions: Main Question: what are possible causes of the problem? I know it's difficult to answer above question. So is there any logs/dumps/events being logged in some place? I'm totally new in this area (hardware interfacing) and need starting point for troubleshooting Stretch: If I implement using above technology (USB to COMM emulator, GSMComm), what's the portability of my application? Definitely GSMComm dll needs to be shipped. But does this mean that the target PC needs to have Ovi Suite (containing USB to COMM emulator) installed? What about portablity on the phone: will it work only WITH Nokia Xpress Music 5800, or will it work with other Nokia phone as well. Or with any other phone?" More info: OS on my phone is in Cyriliic alphabet, if that matters. Updated the question: since some of the questions were answered after a week of investigation. Update 2: I've followed instructions in this link . My phone is responding to some of the commands, but giving "ERROR" for others. Any ideas?
