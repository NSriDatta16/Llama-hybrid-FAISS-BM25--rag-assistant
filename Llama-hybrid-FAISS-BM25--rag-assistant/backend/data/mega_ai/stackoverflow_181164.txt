Signature files for document retrieval

I was wondering if you know somewhere where I can find information on how to build a signature file for docuement retrieval. Do you know if there is some code out there that I can use or look at? I have to create a signature file in C++ under linux platform. UPDATE: Sorry, I appreciatte the help but I was refering to signature files not as a way to validate documents but as a way of indexing documents. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_files Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks,
