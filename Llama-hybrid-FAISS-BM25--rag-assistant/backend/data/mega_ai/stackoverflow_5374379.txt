Impossible to create file on external storage Android

I want to create a .txt file and store it on the external storage of the Android phone. I added the permission to my Android Manifest. When I run the code it doesn't give me any error but the file is never created. Not sure what I am doing wrong. public void createExternalStoragePrivateFile(String data) { // Create a path where we will place our private file on external // storage. File file = new File(myContext.getExternalFilesDir(null), "state.txt"); try { FileOutputStream os = null; OutputStreamWriter out = null; os = myContext.openFileOutput(data, Context.MODE_PRIVATE); out = new OutputStreamWriter(os); out.write(data); os.close(); if(hasExternalStoragePrivateFile()) { Log.w("ExternalStorageFileCreation", "File Created"); } else { Log.w("ExternalStorageFileCreation", "File Not Created"); } } catch (IOException e) { // Unable to create file, likely because external storage is // not currently mounted. Log.w("ExternalStorage", "Error writing " + file, e); } }
