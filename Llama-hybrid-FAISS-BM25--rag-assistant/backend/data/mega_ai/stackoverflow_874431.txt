More compact way to do this?

I have a couple of functions that loop around the surrounding cells of a cell. The grid is contained inside an array. In my code, I have checks to make sure it's not one of the edge cells, as checking an undefined cell causes an error. As such, I have code like this: if(x > 0) { var firstX = x - 1; } else { var firstX = x; } if(x 0) { var firstY = y - 1; } else { var firstY = y; } if(y A lot of lines of code to do very little. Is there a more elegant way to do this?
