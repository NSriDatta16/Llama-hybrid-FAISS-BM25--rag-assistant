Help on non-linear mixed effect modeling approach?

I am dealing with the following data frame: GroupID Month Year Concession_10Yr Action Historical_Action_5Yr XY1 12 1984 1 0 0 ... Here GroupID is a unique identifier for an organization. Then we have data every ear and month on whether the organization took "action", whether there was a "concession" (think "treatment") to this organization over the past 10 years and then whether the organization took action over the last 5 years. What I'm trying to do is model the probability of an organization taking action. Clearly I can't do a simple linear regression as the organizations would be correlated with one another as some organizations are more likely to take action then others. As such, I was thinking of a non-linear mixed effects model, something like: lmer(Action ~ GroupID + Historical_Action_5Yr + Concession_10Yr + 1/GroupID/Concession_10Yr + 1/GroupID/Historical_Action_5Yr, family = binomial(link = logit) However, I am not sure that I have the nesting correct. Also, this doesn't account for time directly... Any guidance would be much appreciated!
