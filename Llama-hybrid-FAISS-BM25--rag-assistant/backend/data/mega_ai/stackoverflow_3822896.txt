First off, software is not ISO 9001 compilant. Only organizations are ISO 9001 compilant . So the question as stated really makes no sense. The only thing you could ask is if the Git or Mercurial development teams are ISO 9001 compilant. (The same goes for CMMI). All ISO 9001 for a software development outfit really means is that you have a written process in place for everything you do (development, bug fixes, etc) and that you follow it. Well, that and you've paid someone to come do an ISO 9001 audit certifying as to the above. CMMI is a lot more involved, but for the purposes of this discussion, we can consider them similar. You'd probably have to look pretty long and hard to find a Free Software community project that bothered to go through the massive grunt work required in creating all the process documentation and that scraped together the money to pay for an audit. If you find one, it would probably only be due to some kind of large corporate sponsor wanting it. If the question is what those standards specify about the use of Source Control, in the case of ISO 9001 that would be nothing . The old joke is that if you take your product and drop it out a 10 story window to the loading dock below, that's just fine by ISO as long as that's your documented process and you follow it.
