Compute frequency of time series

I would like to understand how is the period or frequency of time series calculated. Shouldn't a weekly repeating pattern be of the frequency 7, and the yearly pattern be 365? I ask because the paper http://robjhyndman.com/papers/complex-seasonality/ suggests that the data: http://robjhyndman.com/data/callcenter.txt (Fig 1b from the paper) has the period of 169 days (and another of 169*5). I do not understand why?
