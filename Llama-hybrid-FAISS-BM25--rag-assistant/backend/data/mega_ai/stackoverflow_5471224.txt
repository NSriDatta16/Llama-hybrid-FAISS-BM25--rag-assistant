Calls to malloc in separate processes will execute independently regardless of whether you are on a NUMA architecture. Calls to malloc in different threads of the same process cannot execute independently because the memory returned is equally accessible to all threads within the process. If you want memory that is local to a particular thread, read up on Thread Local Storage. I have not been able to find any clear documentation on whether the Linux VM and scheduler are able optimize the affinity between cores, threads, local memory and thread local storage.
