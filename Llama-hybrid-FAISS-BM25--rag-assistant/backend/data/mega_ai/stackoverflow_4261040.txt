I've seen this before from someone that didn't know that feature existed. Definitely use the auto-increment feature. Some people take the "roll your own" approach to everything, often because they haven't taken the time to see if that is an available feature or if someone else had already come up with it. You'll often see crazy workarounds or poor performing/fragile code from these people. Inheriting a bad database is no fun at all, good luck!
