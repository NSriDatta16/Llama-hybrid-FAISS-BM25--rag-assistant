How to detect a NOT-possible drag-n-drop in WPF applications?

I see some QnAs in our SO discussing about how to detect a drag-n-drop event but sometimes, for some reason such as application A run with admin right whist application B did not, the drag-n-drop is NOT allowed by Windows OS. My question is: How can we detect a NOT-possible drag-n-drop happens in our code? Edit This question is about drag-n-dropping between two applications, one is privileged (run as admin) and other is NOT. Dragging between them is not allowed by Windows OS. I want to detect that situation and pop up a message in my application to let the users know why dragging then is not possible.
