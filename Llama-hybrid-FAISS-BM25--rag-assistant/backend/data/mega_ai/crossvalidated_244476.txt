Zero inflation makes things difficult and we don't know what your expectations as to accuracy are. A simple way to let the zero inflation be handled by the algorithm would be a tree model (packages rpart oder party ) or a lot of trees (package randomForest or party ). 22000 rows are a lot, if 10% out of that are non-zero and there are 7 predictor variables this may even be enough for a sensible neural net. More R packages on machine learning at https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning In the following simulated example you can see, how well the different rules of generating zeros are modeled as well as the rule of number generation by a simple tree: library(rpart) library(rpart.plot) expl.data 80) return(0) if(C Which leads to
