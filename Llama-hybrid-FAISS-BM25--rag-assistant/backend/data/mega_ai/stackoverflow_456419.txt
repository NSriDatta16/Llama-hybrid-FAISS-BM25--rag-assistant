If you are going to reuse the requirements you might as well reuse the code too. But on a lower level I think what you are looking for would be "requirement patterns", along the lines of "programming patterns". Now here is a book from Microsoft on the topic, but as with all domain patterns, the idea is that they should organically grow and fit the needs of the domain users and experts. If you want the true source of the idea check out the seminal book on patterns , although it's from Architecture and not programming, surprise surprise :)
