Get Areas associated with an MVC project

Is there a way I can get the names of the areas in an MVC project? Here's a few ways I can think of: a) If I had the source, I could browse through the project folder structure and enumerate the folders under the Areas folder. But that wouldn't guarantee all the folders represent areas unless I also enumerated the Controllers and Views folder under each of the sub-folders. This approach, as you can tell, sucks. b) From the binary, I could enumerate all namespaces that match the criteria RootNamespaceOfProject.Areas.* . Or, I am sure there's a more elegant way. There must be some dictionary in the ASP.NET MVC framework that keeps a record of all the areas. Secondly, is there also a programmatic construct in the MVC framework that represents an area? I can't seem to find one. There are only four constructs that are related to areas: 1. AreaRegistration 2. AreaRegistrationContext 3. IRouteWithArea 4. AreaHelpers (an internal class) If there were one, would it be possible, say, to enumerate all the controllers within that area? Edited I just noticed that there's this file called MVC-AreaRegistrationTypeCache.xml in the folder \Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.x.x\Temporary ASP.NET Files\root\RandomlyGeneratedHash1\RandomlyGeneratedHash2\UserCache. This folder has two files: a) MVC-AreaRegistrationTypeCache.xml : This file has the list of all the areas in all the assemblies on the machine that have areas. b) MVC-ControllerTypeCache.xml : This file lists the controllers within the areas of the assemblies. Now, the only thing to find out is if there's some programmatic way to have the MVC framework read these files and tell me if a certain area exists in a binary. I am thinking that the AreaRegistration class might be the one. Exploring it further...
