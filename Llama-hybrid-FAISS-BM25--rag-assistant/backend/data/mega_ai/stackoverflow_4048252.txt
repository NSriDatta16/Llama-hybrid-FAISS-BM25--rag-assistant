Modern books on native C++ development

I was going through the Hilo tutorial series Developing C++ Applications for Windows 7 ; seemed pretty interesting. What modern books that go into details of developing C++ based applications for Windows 7? It should show how to take advantage of Windows 7 features and based on "modern" C++ (templates, Unicode, etc.). Not looking for old school Petzold or MFC type books (sorry). Also should feature native code development (i.e. no Qt-/wx-type 3rd party libraries). The 3rd party libraries seems to be at least a generation behind and don't seem to leverage the latests features (ex. Ribbon, Animation etc.).
