In this case, the proper measure of central tendency is the median. There are two major reasons for this. because your data is positively skewed, the mean value will be less representative of the typical test score. The reason for this is because the mean represents the arithmetic average of the distribution which is only equal to the expected value when the data set is normally distributed. The mode is not relevant here unless you wanted to identify what the most common test score is. The mode is most commonly used for categorical and ordinal data or for identifying multimodal distribution (mean and median cannot identify multiple peaks). Well, I suppose you could make a solid argument that this is a multimodal distribution due to that low value of the 4th Bin from the left. To reiterate, the proper measure of central tendency here is median because the data is ratio data and it is heavily skewed. Also, as for mode, you really just need to ask what relevance knowing which score was the most common has. Personally, I do not think that the mode is all that relevant here as the important fact here is that the data is heavily concentrated to the low end of the score range. The mode may tell you which score is most common, but it is possible for the mode to be far away from the bulk of the scores (ex. if you had a class take a test but a third of the class refused to answer any questions, the mode would be zero while most of the scores would likely be above 50 out of 100). Also, for comparing between two groups using the median as the measure of central tendency, you would use the Mann-Whitney U Test. Quantile regression would be useful only if you were interested in how the age variable impacted the distribution of scores. Now if you wanted to compare the impact of age group on the quantile distribution of the DV, then that would be a case for quantile regression. But that depends entirely on your research question or how detailed you really want to be. If there is something to be gained from the more complex and detailed option of quantile regression, then do it. But personally, I do not see much value in that level of detail (Then again, I can't see the distributions for both age groups and that information could change my position). Regardless, THE ANSWER TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION is that you want to use the median and not the mode. As for whether you should use the Mann-Whitney U Test to compare independent group medians or quantile regression is realistically a judgement call as both have their advantages and disadvantages. Oh one more thing. Technically the Mann-Witney U Test does not directly compare medians between groups (it compares distributions). It also has its limitations (particularly for data where the distributions are different and heavily skewed). You can also use Mood's Median Test to directly compare the medians between groups. Though the Mood's test can be susceptible to low sensitivity with small sample sizes.
