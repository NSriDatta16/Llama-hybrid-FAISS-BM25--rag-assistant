Unresolved external symbol

Main article there is a header file and a source file . After copying those two files and adding few headers: #include #include #pragma comment(lib, "d2d1") #include #include #include "SafeRelease.h" //Safe realease file template inline void SafeRelease( Interface **ppInterfaceToRelease ) { if (*ppInterfaceToRelease != NULL) { (*ppInterfaceToRelease)->Release(); (*ppInterfaceToRelease) = NULL; } } when I'm trying to compile this project I'm getting an error: Error 1 error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__DWriteCreateFactory@12 referenced in function "private: long __thiscall SimpleText::CreateDeviceIndependentResources(void)" (?CreateDeviceIndependentResources@SimpleText@@AAEJXZ) Have no idea why. All? headers are included. Hopefuly some of you will be able to help with this. Thank you.
