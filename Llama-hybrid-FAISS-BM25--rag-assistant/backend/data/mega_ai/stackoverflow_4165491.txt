Drupal: help with content type creating & linking nodes

I have a situation where someone can create a job content type. I've added a CCK field that is related to the 'organisation' content type. So when someone creates a new job posting they can choose which organisation the job is for in that field (auto completed). The problem is I can create a new job and select any organisation, even if I didn't create that organisation myself. Is there a way I can restrict what someone types in that field to 1. an organisation name that exists, and 2. an organisation that belong to that user? I'm using drupal 6. Any help most appreciated!
