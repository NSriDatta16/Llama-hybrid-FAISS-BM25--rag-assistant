Is it possible to create smaller memory-mapped views on a 2GB+ file?

I have written a C++ class for Windows and Linux that creates a memory-mapped view for an file of arbitrary size n. The code for the class constructor can be seen here . I am currently testing the code on Windows 32 bit XP. I have found for file sizes 0 = 2 GB, MapViewOfFile returns a NULL value and an error code of 8, "Not enough storage is available to process this command". Evidently, Windows cannot find an available address space of size 2 GB in the process. Therefore, I may need to modify the class constructor to create a set of smaller memory-mapped views totaling >= 2GB bytes && Previously, I used the following code for random access: char* KeyArray; try { mmapFile = new cMemoryMappedFile(n); } catch (cException e) { throw; } KeyArray = (char *)(mmapFile->GetPointer()); KeyArray[i] = ... How should I modify the class to handle these requirements?
