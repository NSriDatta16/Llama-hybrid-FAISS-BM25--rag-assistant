Two-way imputation: A Bayesian method for estimating missing scores in tests and questionnaires, and an accurate approximation

I read the article "Two-way imputation: A Bayesian method for estimating missing scores in tests and questionnaires, and an accurate approximation" by Van Ginkel et al. (available here ) about a Bayesian two-way imputation method for estimating missing scores in tests and questionnaires. Does anyone have suggestions about how to implement this? Is there a package or function (in e.g. R or SPSS) available that can deal with this method?
