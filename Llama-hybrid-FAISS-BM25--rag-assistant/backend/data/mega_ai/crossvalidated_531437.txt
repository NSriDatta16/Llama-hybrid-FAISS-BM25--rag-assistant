If your dependent variable is only binary, you could try out the package "bife". Their package description is: "Estimates fixed effects binary choice models (logit and probit) with potentially many individual fixed effects and computes average partial effects. Incidental parameter bias can be reduced with an asymptotic bias correction proposed by Fernandez-Val (2009)"
