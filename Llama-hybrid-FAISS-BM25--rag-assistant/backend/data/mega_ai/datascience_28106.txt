No. Any dimensionality reduction technique suppose you are dealing with algebraic values, and categorical variables do not have such meaning. If you have a categorical variable which indicate - as example - families' pets in one of (cat, dog, red fish) mapped to (0, 1, 2), you simply cannot say that the distance between cat and dog is equal to one, because those categories do not lie in an algebraic space. So, in those cases, you do the one-hot encoding of the variables, a.k.a. dummyfication. Then you can safely apply PCA, or any other dimensionality reduction technique.
