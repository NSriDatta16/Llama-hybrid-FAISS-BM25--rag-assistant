I've worked in the storage industry for a decade. Arguments over the size of a TB can vary the size of a solution by 10%. In short: programmers and the storage industry use different measurements. Neither are right all the time. The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) dictionary defines kilobyte as: Kilobyte (KB) [General] 1,000 (10^3) bytes. The SNIA uses the 10^3 convention commonly found in storage and data transfer-related literature rather than the 1,024 (2^10) convention common in computer system random access memory and software literature. My rule of thumb is: Measure memory, files, file systems, and data on a network in 1024^n byte blocks. Measure raw disk space — and only raw disk space — in 1000^n byte blocks. Tell the customer which unit you're using. Repeat yourself often. By and large, that keeps me out of trouble.
