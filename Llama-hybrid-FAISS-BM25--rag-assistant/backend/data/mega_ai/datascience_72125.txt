You basically want to create a column for each product bought, as the presence or absence of each in the list is a feature in itself. See Hadley Wickhamâ€™s definition of tidy data. That being said, you seem to have numerous products. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, what I would do is take your binary bought/not features (or count values might be even more effective if you have that data) and do dimensionality reduction to get a reasonable set of features. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (which comes from topic modeling), PCA, t-SNE, and our UMAP are all easy to implement and worth trying. PCA is the least sophisticated and the fastest to run and would be a good baseline. When you have your smaller list of features, you might want to try using a classifier that further selects the most relevant features, like gradient-boosted trees.
