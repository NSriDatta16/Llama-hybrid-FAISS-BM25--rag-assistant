I don't follow your PCA pipeline, but you are using fitrsvm , which is meant for regression problems for a multi-class classification problem. Won't work. fitcsvm implements svm classification but it doesn't handle multiclass classification. try fitcecoc , which warps binary svm classifiers by a multiclass error-correcting output codes classifier or even fitcnb for naive Gaussian bayes. For mutli-class SVM extensions, you'll have to look outside of Mathworks' toolboxes.
