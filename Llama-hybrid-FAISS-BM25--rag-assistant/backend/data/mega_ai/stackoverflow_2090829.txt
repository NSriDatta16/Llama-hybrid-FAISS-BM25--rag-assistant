Stylesheet Switcher in jQuery. In response to the 'newbie followup' comment, I will try to make it a little more instructional. The page I was playing with to test on while writing can be found here . Page Display You're going to want to have your current stylesheet displayed in a tag in the of each of your pages. The tag will need an id for reference later in JavaScript. Something like: stylesheet; ?> ' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' id='stylelink' /> Changing the preference Once you are displaying the users stylesheet, you need a way to change it. Create a that will send a request to the server when the user changes their stylesheet: Black &amp; White Shades of Grey Server Side Now, without jQuery, submitting this form should GET (you could change it to POST if you like) stylesheet={new stylesheet} on the current page. So somewhere in your bootstrap / sitewide include file, you do a check for it, a php sample: $styles = array( 'css1.css' => 'Black &amp; White', 'css2.css' => 'Shades of Grey', ); if (!empty($_GET["sytlesheet"]) { // VALIDATE IT IS A VALID STYLESHEET - VERY IMPORTANT // $styles is the array of styles: if (array_key_exists($_GET["stylesheet"], $styles)) { $user->stylesheet = $_GET["stylesheet"]; $user->save(); } } Live Preview At this point, you have a functioning styleswitcher for the lame people without javascript. Now you can add some jQuery to make this all happen a little more elegantly. You'll want to use the jQuery Form Plugin to make a nice ajaxForm() function, that will handle submitting the form. Add the jQuery and jQuery Form library to the page: Now that we have the libraries included - $(function() { // When everything has loaded - this function will execute: $("#style_form").ajaxForm(function() { // the style form will be submitted using ajax, when it succeeds: // this function is called: $("#thediv").text('Now Using: '+$('#styleswitch').val()); }); $("#styleswitch").change(function() { // When the styleswitch option changes, switch the style's href to preview $("#stylelink").attr('href', $(this).val()); // We also want to submit the form to the server (will use our ajax) $(this).closest('form').submit(); }); // now that you have made changing the select option submit the form, // lets get rid of the submit button $("#style_form input[type=submit]").remove(); });
