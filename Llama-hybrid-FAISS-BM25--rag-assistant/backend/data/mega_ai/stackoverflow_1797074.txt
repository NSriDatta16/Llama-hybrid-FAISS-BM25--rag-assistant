Local executing hook after a git push? (post-push)

I've looked at the githooks manpage but unless I'm missing something I don't see an option for local, post-push git hooks. I'd like to have one that updates the api docs on my web server (for which I already have a script) after I push the master branch to the GitHub repo. Of course I could just write my own script that combines the git push and the api docs run, but that feels somewhat inelegant.
