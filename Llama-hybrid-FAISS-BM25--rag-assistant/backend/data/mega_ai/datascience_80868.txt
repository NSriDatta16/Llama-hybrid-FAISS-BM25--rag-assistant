Overfitting in Linear Regression

I'm just getting started with machine learning and I have trouble understanding how overfitting can happen in a linear regression model. Considering we use only 2 feature variables to train a model, how can a flat plane possibly be overfitted to a set of data points? I assume linear regression uses only a line to describe the linear relationship between 2 variables and a flat plane to describe the relationship between 3 variables, I have trouble understanding (or rather imagining) how overfitting in a line or a plane can happen?
