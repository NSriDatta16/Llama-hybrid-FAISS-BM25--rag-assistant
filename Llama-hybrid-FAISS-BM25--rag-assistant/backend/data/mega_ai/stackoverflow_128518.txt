I know this isn't javascript but C# 3.0 has an API for doing this. The System.Windows.Media.Imaging namespace has a class called BitmapMetadata which can be used to read and write image metadata (which is stored in the image itself). Here is a method for retrieving the metadata for an image given a file path: public static BitmapMetadata GetMetaData(string path) { using (Stream s = new System.IO.FileStream(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.ReadWrite)) { var decoder = BitmapDecoder.Create(s, BitmapCreateOptions.None, BitmapCacheOption.OnDemand); var frame = decoder.Frames.FirstOrDefault(); if (frame != null) { return frame.Metadata as BitmapMetadata; } return null; } } The BitmapMetadata class has a property for tags as well as other common image metadata. To save metadata back to the image, you can use the InPlaceBitmapMetadataWriter Class .
