How do I get SQLite to cache results of a select command

I am running a web application with a backend SQLite database that solely performs read operations. Users connect to the database, search for entries via a select command, and view the results in a browser. But, the select is quite time-consuming because it involves character pattern matching across several million table rows. (The size of the results table is quite small). Different users will generally do the exact same search, so if I can cache the results of the select the first time, the next user to search to database (concurrently or more likely a few days later) can get back the results quickly. How can I do this in SQLite? Is there a pragma I need to use? I hear that SQLite has an automatic caching feature, but this does not seem to help. Note that I'm using a hosting service, so I cannot rebuild SQLite in anyway. Any help would be much appreciated.
