Where do I start? I have a massive dataset (from web scraping) and want to predict y from 20 variables

I'm trying to do my best to recreate an algorithm that a company is using by sucking in all of its outputs and adding in some relevant variables (I won't be able to perfectly recreate it as I'm missing inventory data). I'm guessing this is a job for machine learning but I was wondering where I start? Are there specific models I should start with? Software I should use? Courses I should dive into?
