Firstly you should organise your string into an array of names, this way its more manageable when it come's to checking against a data source. you should look at mysql LIKE or IN commands, used like so: SELECT column FROM table WHERE column LIKE (params) if you had the string: $string = "tom paul james robert yes123"; you can use php functions to prepare it so you can do: $string = explode(" ",$names); $string = implode(",",$string); $query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IN (".$string.")"; With the LIKE command you can do: SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%robert%' OR column LIKE '%yes123%'
