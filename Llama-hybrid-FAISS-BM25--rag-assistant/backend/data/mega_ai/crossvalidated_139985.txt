Time series periodicity bootstrapping

I'm interested in analysing the periodicity of a parameter X, measured over time on cells. The method I am using is destructive, so I cannot follow the same cell over time, but I am rather measuring different groups of cells belonging to the same population, but taken at different point in times. I have values for X every 15' from time 0 to time 120', 150-200 cells per time point, and I want to establish whether X is periodic over time. I thought of the following approach: Create a "family" of time series by sampling with replacement from the distribution of X at each time point. Measure some periodicity index for these time series Create another group of time series by sampling with replacement from all of the time points (i.e. not keeping the temporal order of the data) Measure the periodicity index and calculate CI for it. Compare the mean of the index calculated in 2 with 4. Is this approach correct, or would you suggest something else? What periodicity test would you recommend for such short time series (only 9 points)?
