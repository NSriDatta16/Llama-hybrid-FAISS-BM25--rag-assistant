Memcache is just key-value storage. It's useless, if your application doesn't know, how to use it. By adding extension=memcache.so to php.ini, you are only enable memcache api in php. After that, you must teach drupal, how to use memcache, to store some data in it. I don't realy know, how to configure drupal to use memcache, but i think, it's very possible, and may be vary easy. Just look to some configuration files of drupal.
