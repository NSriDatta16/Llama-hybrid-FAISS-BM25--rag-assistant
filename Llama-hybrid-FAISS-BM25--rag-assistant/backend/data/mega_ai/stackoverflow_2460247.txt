Checking deployed port in ruby on rails application

Is there an elegant way to check which port you deployed a ruby on rails application using mongrel? I could not find a directive (i.e. such as #{RAILS_ROOT} which contains the root directory of the application) that I can use to perform a check. I need this to do a check since I am deploying the same application on different ports and I need the app to do different things according to the port that is being accessed. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks
