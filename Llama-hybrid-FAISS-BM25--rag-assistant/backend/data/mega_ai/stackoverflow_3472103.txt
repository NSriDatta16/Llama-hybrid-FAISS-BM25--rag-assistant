Eclipse Java Projects in Git

I am trying to figure out the best way to create a java project in GIT. In particular I would like to create the git repository such that when I import from git in Eclipse, the project is automatically created correctly with all its .project settings intact and all other settings setup. I.E. if I do a git clone javaEclipseProject in my workspace/ folder then do an import on that javaEclipseProject folder it will open up the project without having to use the new project wizard.
