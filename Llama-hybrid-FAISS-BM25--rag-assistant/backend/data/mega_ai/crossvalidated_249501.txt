As you suggest, linear interpolation is likely the most computationally efficient way to compute estimates for your time shifted time series. Any other method would require looking at more data points to impute the points at 0, 10, 20, 30, so while might provide better estimates, will be computationally less efficient. It really depends on the variance in your time series.
