Help to understand magic_quotes_gpc()

i was learning this PHP code from a tutorial to upload files 0) { $fileName = $_FILES['userfile']['name']; $tmpName = $_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']; $fileSize = $_FILES['userfile']['size']; $fileType = $_FILES['userfile']['type']; $fp = fopen($tmpName, 'r'); $content = fread($fp, filesize($tmpName)); $content = addslashes($content); fclose($fp); if (!get_magic_quotes_gpc()) { $fileName = addslashes($fileName); } include 'library/config.php'; include 'library/opendb.php'; $query = "INSERT INTO upload (name, size, type, content ) ". "VALUES ('$fileName', '$fileSize', '$fileType', '$content')"; mysql_query($query) or die('Error, query failed'); include 'library/closedb.php'; now i understand every function and everything by using php documentation EXCEPT get_magic_quotes_gpc() WHAT is it? What it does? Is it eseential? If yes, Is there a replacement for this? the PHP Manual said "This feature has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged.". Elaborate please? Isn't there a way to upload files to (web)server harDisk and provide links to them..
