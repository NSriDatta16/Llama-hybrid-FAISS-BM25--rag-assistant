Correlation between two nodes of a single layer MLP for joint-Gaussian input

Let's say you have a jointly gaussian vector random variable $\mathbf{x}$, with mean $\mathbf{M}$ and covariance $\mathbf{S}$. I now transform each scalar element of $\mathbf{x}$ , say $x_j$, with a sigmoid: $$y_j = 1/(1+\exp(-x_j))$$ I am interested in the expectation between two variables $y_j$ and $y_j'$ of the resulting distribution, that is $$E\{y_j y_j'\}$$ where $E\{\}$ is the expectation operator. Note: The whole PDF of $y$ can be computed just by applying a change of variable. Unfortunately the integrals leading to the expectations are intractable (to the best of my knowledge). I'm looking for closed-form approximations, no Markov Chain-Monte Carlo, no variational stuff. That is, approximations to the variable change, to the expectation integrals, to the sigmoid, to the resulting PDF, that allow computing $E\{y_j y_j'\}$. Some dead ends: Taylor, often used in papers on the topic, is inaccurate by the mile. Gradshteyn and Ryzhik does not seem to contain the integrals.
