Best way to handle malloc failure in Cocoa

Although it won't happen often, there are a couple of cases where my Cocoa application will allocate very large amounts of memory, enough to make me worry about malloc failing. What is the best way to handle this sort of failure in a Cocoa application? I've heard that Exceptions are generally discouraged in this development environment but is this a case where they would be useful?
