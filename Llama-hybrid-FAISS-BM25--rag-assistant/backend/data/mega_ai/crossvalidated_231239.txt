So far, only efficient samplers with normal priors (with large variances in the case of weak information) have been developed. The relevant reference is: Polson, Nicholas G., James G. Scott, and Jesse Windle. " Bayesian inference for logistic models using Pólya–Gamma latent variables ." Journal of the American statistical Association 108.504 (2013): 1339-1349. This methodology is implemented in the R package BayesLogit .
