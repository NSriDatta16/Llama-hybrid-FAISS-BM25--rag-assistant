AIC of a two-part/hurdle model?

I have continuous data with a point mass at zero, so my plan is to use a two-part model where I first model whether an observation is zero or non-zero in a logistic regression and then model the positive values by a Gamma GLM. How do I compute the AIC for this model? I'm using R and the glm statement, both GLMs give me an AIC, what is the overall AIC to compare this to e.g. a simple Normal Distribution glm?
