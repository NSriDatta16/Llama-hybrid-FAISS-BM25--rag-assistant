When you get a bit more insight into network topologies these hyperparameters will make more sense, but in general this is just like any other hyperparameter, you will have to test some settings and see what works better. In the case of pooling layers it is actually relatively interpretable. Why do we use pooling? To downsample our feature maps. This is done to decrease the resolution of our processed image but also to increase the receptive fields of our following layers. Because it is a form of downsampling we throw away all the information that was not the maximum in case of max-pooling, or we throw away information about the spread with mean-pooling. By increase our pooling filter size, we decrease our resolution even further and lose more information, but we will also need less parameters in our network if we have a fully connected layer at the end and our next convolutional layers will have a bigger receptive field, but with less attention to detail.
