I don't think it will make a significant difference in compile time but #pragma once is very well supported across compilers but not actually part of the standard. The preprocessor may be a little faster with it as it is more simple to understand your exact intent. #pragma once is less prone to making mistakes and it is less code to type. To speed up compile time more just forward declare instead of including in .h files when you can. I prefer to use #pragma once . See this wikipedia article about the possibility of using both .
