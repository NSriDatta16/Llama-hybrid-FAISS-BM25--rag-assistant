Sending user agent and postdata with sync request?

I've got the following synchronous request... var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open("GET",uri,false); xhr.send(null); I've read http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-open-method and it appears that this doesn't allow for extra parameters. Basically I'd like to send other data such as postdata and useragent how would I do this using AJAX?
