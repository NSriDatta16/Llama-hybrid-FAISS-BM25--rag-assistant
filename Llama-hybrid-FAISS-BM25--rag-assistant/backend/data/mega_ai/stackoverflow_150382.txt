I either go the CSV route (as described above), or more often these days, I use Infragistics NetAdvantage to generate the file. (The very vast majority of the time where Infragistics is in play, we're just exporting an existing UltraWebGrid, which is essentially a one-LOC solution unless extra formatting tweaks are needed. We could manually generate an Excel/BIFF file as well, but there's rarely a need to.)
