When would you choose certain CNN pretrained models?

I'm totally new to the field of deep learning so I'm just trying to get a sense of some of the decisions made, especially with convolutional neural networks. After reading a few blogs/articles about the different pretrained CNN architectures, I'm wondering: When would you choose a certain architecture over another? I've seen a lot of examples using VGG-16 and I'm curious why this one is the go-to when it seems like such a large (and slow?) way to train? Are there certain examples of applications where one architecture would be better than another?
