You need some assumptions if you are going to do a permutation test (otherwise nothing will be exchangeable under the null hypothesis). If fact, you didn't even state that these were two independent simple random samples from two populations - as far as I know these could be two time series. ASSUME (maybe): Honey values are independent and identically distributed. No honey values are independent and identically distributed. The two samples are also independent of each other. Let the Honey values have distribution F(t) and the No Honey values have distribution F(t-$\theta$). Then $H_o: \theta = 0$ vs $H_a: \theta \not= 0$. Note that $\theta$ is the difference of the two population means (assuming they HAVE means...which is reasonable). Then, under $H_o$, you can mix the two groups together, then split them randomly into samples of size 9 and 6, compute the difference of the means, then repeat. This will give you the null distribution of the difference of the means. You might consider: temp = sample(c(Honey,NoHoney),replace=FALSE) resample_honey = temp[1:9] resample_nohoney = temp[10:15] null[i] = mean(resample_honey) - mean(resample_nohoney)
