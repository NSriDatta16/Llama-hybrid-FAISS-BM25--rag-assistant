Once you have figured out how to scroll it, it's very simple in mootools to obtain that "bounce" effect. For example, you can apply a particular bounce effect in this way: //element is supposed to be the main div you want to drag on iPhone var element = $('elementID'); //instantiate a morph fx referred to that element var bounceEffect = new Fx.Morph(element,{duration:1000, transition:Fx.Transitions.Bounce.easeOut}); //...then, when you want it to bounce back (e.g. at the release, or when it goes below a certain position) you can do: bounceEffect.start({'top':0}); Edit: take a look @ mootouch too, it's a very interesting project
