Set Tax Rate in Magento based on Discount / Coupon Code

I've been trying to set a tax rate or customer class rate for magento based on the discount code used. Im only using the discount code as I can use it for a input. Does anyone have any idea how this can achieved or any pointers? Kind Regards Chris
