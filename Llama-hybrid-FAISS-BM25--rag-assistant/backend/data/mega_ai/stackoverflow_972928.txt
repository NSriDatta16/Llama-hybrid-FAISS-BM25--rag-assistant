Beautiful soup is definitely the way to go with a problem like this. The code is cleaner and easier to read. Once you have it installed, getting all the tags looks something like this. from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup import urllib2 def getTags(tag): f = urllib2.urlopen("http://cnn.com") soup = BeautifulSoup(f.read()) return soup.findAll(tag) if __name__ == '__main__': tags = getTags('p') for tag in tags: print(tag.contents) This will print out all the values of the p tags.
