Interpreting interaction effect with orthogonal polynomial contrast codes

I'm running a logistic regression with two categorical variables (sample_number: 1, 2, 3, 4; and sample_length: 60, 70, 80, 90, 100) and a continuous predictor (dot_size). My model in R looks like this: logit = glm(formula = Response ~ sample_numerosity*sample_length*dot_sizes_mean_c,data = det_data_confounded) I've ordered my factors and use the contr.poly function to create contrast coding for them. I've also checked my omnibus tests with car::Anova(logit,type=3,family = binomial(link="logit"),icontrasts = c('poly.sum',"contr.poly")) I mean centered the continuous predictor. My question is in interpreting my interaction effect. The car package anova gives me this output: LR Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) sample_numerosity 4.884 3 0.1804952 sample_length 23.544 4 9.859e-05 *** dot_sizes_mean_c 22.998 1 1.622e-06 *** sample_numerosity:sample_length 34.825 12 0.0004993 *** sample_numerosity:dot_sizes_mean_c 5.086 3 0.1656402 sample_length:dot_sizes_mean_c 6.527 4 0.1630820 sample_numerosity:sample_length:dot_sizes_mean_c 35.785 12 0.0003508 *** Which seems to make sense, we have an interaction between sample_numerosity and sample_length, which is the interaction I'm interested in. I'm confused about how to interpret this interaction in light of the fact I used polynomial contrast codes. If I look at the output from the glm function, where it breaks down the interactions for each pair of contrasts, I get this: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 7.877e-01 2.151e-02 36.622 It looks as if the interaction between numerosity and length is driven by an interaction between the linear trend in sample numerosity and the quadratic trend in sample length. What does this mean? I can't wrap my head around what it means for two trends to be interacting. Any intuitive or rigorous explanation would be very helpful. EDIT: Here are the contrast codes I'm using for sample_numerosity .L .Q .C [1,] -0.6708204 0.5 -0.2236068 [2,] -0.2236068 -0.5 0.6708204 [3,] 0.2236068 -0.5 -0.6708204 [4,] 0.6708204 0.5 0.2236068 and for sample_length [1,] -0.6324555 0.5345225 -3.162278e-01 0.1195229 [2,] -0.3162278 -0.2672612 6.324555e-01 -0.4780914 [3,] 0.0000000 -0.5345225 -4.095972e-16 0.7171372 [4,] 0.3162278 -0.2672612 -6.324555e-01 -0.4780914 [5,] 0.6324555 0.5345225 3.162278e-01 0.1195229 I assume the interaction contrasts will just be multiplication of the relevant columns in the above matrices.
