iPhone - Linking touch events to different classes/controllers

I have a UISlider inside a custom UITableViewCell named SliderCell. I have a method in SliderCell which updates a UILabel to match the slider's value. - (IBAction)sliderChanged:(id)sender; I have the same method in a viewController that uses SliderCell in it's table. Base on the value of the slider, I want to reload an NSDictionary. When I link the UISlider to SliderCell's method, it works. When I link the UISlider to viewController's method, it crashes the app without even displaying an NSLOG at the beginning of the method. I linked the UISlider to the viewController by simply dragging my viewController class into my SlideCell nib. Does the app try to init another viewController instance? How do I link it properly?
