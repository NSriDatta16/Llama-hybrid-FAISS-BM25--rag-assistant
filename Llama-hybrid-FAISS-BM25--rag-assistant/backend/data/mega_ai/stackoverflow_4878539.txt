How to securely convert this double into an int?

I have an double which is a time interval in seconds. Valid values are 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, etc. Now I need to convert this value into an int. But I cannot do this: int converted = (int)theDouble; Because what may happen is, that my double due to floating point errors is 0.999999999 rather than 1.000000000. It would just cut off the tail, and we'd end up with 0 instead of 1. Also, when my double is 0.9, I want an int that is 1. When it is 1.1, I want the int to be 1. When it is 1.8, I want the int to be 2. There's a round() function but Xcode doesn't show a documentation for this. The header only tells it returns a double. So not what I need. What's the safest way to get a close int representation of that double? Although it is a double I'll never need higher precision than 0.5 or one fragmental digit (I'm no math genius and don't know the exact scientific terms).
