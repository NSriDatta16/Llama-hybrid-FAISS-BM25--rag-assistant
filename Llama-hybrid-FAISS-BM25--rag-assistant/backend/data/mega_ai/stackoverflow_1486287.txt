Algorithm to find longest anagram

Let's say that we have a dictionary of about 250.000 words. Algorithm should take in 12 letters as an array or a string and find the variation that matches longest word from a dictionary. Of course, one can always brute-force it, but I wonder what would be the most elegant way to do this? Answers using languages other than PHP will also be accepted if they do not use any language-specific functions as a shortcut for the main problem. Note: Words are stored in the database, but I could pull them into memory for speed. Although I'm not sure PHP's indexing is better than that of an MySQL database?
