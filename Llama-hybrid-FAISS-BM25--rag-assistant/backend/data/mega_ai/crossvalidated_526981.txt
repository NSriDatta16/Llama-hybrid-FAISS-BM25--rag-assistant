Converting a confidence interval into a credible interval

The problem of correctly interpreting confidence intervals has been discussed at length here. I have a related question which I believe may be a useful contribution: Frequentist probabilities by definition refer to an infinite number of repetitions of an experiment. Therefore, the frequentist definition of a confidence interval (CI) is: If you extract an inifinite number of samples from a normal distribution with unknown parameters ( $\mu,\sigma$ ) and calculate a CI from each sample via a defined algorithm $A_{95}$ , said CI will contain $\mu$ in $95 \% $ of all cases. From a frequentist point of view, it doesn't make sense to apply that probability to a given CI to estimate its likelihood of containing $\mu$ . But what if someone were to switch from a frequentist to a Bayesian viewpoint after constructing the CI and ask themselves the question: "How confident am I (i. e. at what rate would I - given that there is someone who knows $\mu$ and will reveal it at some point - be willing to bet) that this given CI contains $\mu$ knowing that it was constructed using $A_{95}$ ?" Wouldn't the answer be " $95 \%$ " (or $20:1$ )? C. f.: Should I have "Confidence" in Credibility Intervals?
