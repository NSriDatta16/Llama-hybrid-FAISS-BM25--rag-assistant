Custom Named Entity Recognition using deep learning

I have a dataset with two columns. First column has some text (news article) and the second column contains names of people (not exactly English names) present in those news articles (first column). I've tried to build a custom named entity recognizer using Spacy but it isn't working. Can I use deep learning approach to identify the names in unseen news articles ? (Test data)
