How do I combine two different measures of correlation coefficients?

In the dataset, we have a numerical feature and a numerical target. We are calculating the Pearson coefficient and Spearman rank correlation. Pearson to track the linear relationship and Spearman to track the relationship (if any) between two variables The customer is asking to combine the results from these two coefficients so that the user can see a consolidated score instead of looking at two different results. Does averaging the results from Pearson and Spearman coefficients make sense here?
