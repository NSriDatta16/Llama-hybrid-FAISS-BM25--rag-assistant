I have no experience with this, but you could try your luck with DOM storage in newer browsers: IE8 FF>=2 Opera > 9.5, as I have read somewhere Safari and Chrome should implement it, too, I guess Here's an article by John Resig about that. However, if questions contain something like 'without the user's knowledge' or 'without the user having to agree', typically the one asking really should reconsider his/her thoughts about the visitors and what is or isn't good for them. Cheers,
