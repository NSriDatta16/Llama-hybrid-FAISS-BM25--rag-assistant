Silhouette clustering index in practice

I don't have much experience with data analysis algorithms (data mining, machine learning, if you like) and I'm interested if some could share their experience with practical usage of Silhouette in cluster validation/interpretation. Concretely, is it practical to use it in case of big data? My question comes from the fact that you need n^2 calculations to get the output, which could be a problem in case of larger data and intense distance measure. For example, I cluster signals of average length of 1500 points per signal and currently I have about 10.000 signals (and there could be much more). That means that if I want to produce silhouette I need to calculate 10^8 distances, which is a lot. Also, I need to calculate distances between all the points, on the other hand, to perform K-means (for example) I have much less calculation. Somehow a question arises - should I allow that much calculations for the validation, than for the clustering itself? Is silhouette really practically used?
