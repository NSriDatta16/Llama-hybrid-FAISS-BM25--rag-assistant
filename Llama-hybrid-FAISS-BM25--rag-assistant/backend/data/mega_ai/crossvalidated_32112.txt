You have a couple of good answers here already (+1 to both @Cam.Davidson.Pilon & @MichaelChernick). Let me throw out a couple of points that help me to think about this issue. First, PCA operates over the correlation matrix. Thus, it seems to me the important question is whether it makes sense to use a correlation matrix to help you think about your data. For example, the Pearson product-moment correlation assesses the linear relationship between two variables; if your variables are related, but not linearly, the correlation is not an ideal metric to index the strength of the relationship. ( Here is a nice discussion on CV about correlation and non-normal data.) Second, I think the easiest way to understand what is going on with PCA is that you are simply rotating your axes. You can do more things, of course, and unfortunately PCA gets confused with factor analysis (which definitely does have more going on). Nevertheless, plain old PCA with no bells and whistles, can be thought of as follows: you have some points plotted in two dimensions on a sheet of graph paper; you have a transparency with orthogonal axes drawn on it, and a pinhole at the origin; you center the origin of the transparency (i.e., the pinhole) over $(\bar x, \bar y)$ and put the tip of your pencil through the pinhole to hold it in place; then you rotate the transparency until the points (when indexed according to the transparency's axes instead of the original ones) are uncorrelated. This isn't a perfect metaphor for PCA (e.g., we didn't rescale the variances to 1). But does give people the basic idea. The point is now to use that image to think about what the result looks like if the data weren't Gaussian to begin with; that will help you decide whether this process was worth doing. Hope that helps.
