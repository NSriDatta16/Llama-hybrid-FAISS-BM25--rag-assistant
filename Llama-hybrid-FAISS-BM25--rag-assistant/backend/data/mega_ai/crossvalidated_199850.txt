Very Large RMSE with Linear Regression

I am working on a regression problem that has about 180 binary features and approximately 280,000 data samples. For certain train-test splits of my data, the resulting linear-regression model (implemented in python using pandas and scikit-learn) will yield an RMSE that is orders of magnitude greater than what I typically get (for example, I expect around 6.4 RMSE, and sometimes I will get an RMSE that is 7 orders of magnitude greater than that). Needless to say, these astronomically-large error values are destroying my average RMSE. Has anyone experienced this problem? Thanks!
