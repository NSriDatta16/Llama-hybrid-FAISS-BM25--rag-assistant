No, it is not true. ASP.NET MVC builds on the top of ASP.NET so you have the same storage options like Application, Session, Cache, ... It is up to the developer to decide whether he wants to use session or not. So if you use Session inside your ASP.NET MVC application the performance would be the same if you were using Session in a classic WebForms application.
