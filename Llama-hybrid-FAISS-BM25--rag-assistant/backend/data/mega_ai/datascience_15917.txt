Adding as a answer instead of comment due to insufficient reps. Consider developing a model that can identify the pattern of electricity and water usage per house throughout the year. And predict the upcoming requirements. It will be a time series problem. This will help in maximising resource utilisation and better availability of resources among everyone.
