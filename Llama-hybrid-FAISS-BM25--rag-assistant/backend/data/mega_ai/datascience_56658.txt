Random Forest Prediction

Let's say I want to classify if the employee will churn or not. In my random forest, I have 6 estimators where 3 of them predict the employee to churn and the other estimators predict the employee to retain. In short, 3 estimators = predicted to churn and 3 estimators = predicted to retain . I know that the random forest works by getting the most votes for each class or by getting the mode. The question is how does the random forest predict in this case?
