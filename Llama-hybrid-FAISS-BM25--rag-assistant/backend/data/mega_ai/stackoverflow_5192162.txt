Even though you don't need a third table, you can have a third table (for optimization purposes, for instance). In this case, you can map the relationship as usual, plus adding the @JoinTable annotation: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/JoinTable.html Alternatively, you can find more information about it in the Hibernate documentation (see section 5.1.7.1. Using a foreign key or an association table): http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/reference/en-US/html_single/#d0e7541
