Identify distributions within a mixed set

I am looking for a way to identify possible distributions within a set of data points. assuming I have a 1-dim mixed vector of points $d_j$ within $[0; 300]$ the points can be from different distributions for example: log-normal distribution with $LN (10, 0.5)$ exponential distribution with $\lambda = 0.6$ other distributions like Erlang (or Gaussian ) [spec. it is about durations of failures] My aim is to tell if the data points are from one distribution or maybe from two different. But so far I faced some problems for which I am looking for help: if the distributions overlap, some common clustering algorithms fall short, here I tried using mode detection ( LPMode ) but I am not sure if there might be a better way can I take advantage of the fact that I can restrict the choice of distributions to choose from? I had a look into AutoClass and was wondering if there are some advances in the Bayesian methods I should have a look into?
