Writing a remove name loop for a list

I'm looking to try to make an efficient delete method to work on a list. This situation is as follows: Say for e.g. I have a (potentially) massive list of names: Alex Smith Anna Hobb Bertie Blackman Bill Clinton David Smith David Warner George Jung George Washington William Wobbits Lets say that this is a List with Person having properties FirstName and LastName . As in the example, there is the possibility for two people sharing same FirstName. What I need to do is go through the list and delete all Davids, for example. I was looping through finding all davids, adding to a list DeletePerson , then looping through again for each DeletePerson and removing. I'm sure there would be a more efficient method? Efficiency isn't critical in this app but it just seems a long winded way to do it, also I guess as after the letter D in the first name we know we won't be adding any more to the DeletePerson list (assuming the list is sorted alphabetically) Thanks!
