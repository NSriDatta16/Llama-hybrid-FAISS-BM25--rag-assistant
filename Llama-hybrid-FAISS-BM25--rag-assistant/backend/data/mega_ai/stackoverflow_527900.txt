As the other answers already mention, this should be approached manually, because you may want to change other things as you go along to make the code base cleaner. Maybe the actual invocation is already superfluous, or similar fragments can be combined. Also, in practice people usually slightly change the copied code, so there will often not be direct duplicates, but close variants. I fear automatic c&p detection will mostly fail you there. There are however refactoring tools that can help you with acutally performing the changes (and sometimes also with finding likely candidates). Google for "php refactoring", there are quite a few tools available, both standalone and as part of IDEs.
