This can’t work: A contains B contains A contains B contains …. Where to stop? All you can do to model cyclic dependencies is use pointers: class A; class B { A* _iNeedA; }; class A { B* _iNeedB; }; Now the classes don’t contain each other, merely references to each other. Furthermore, you need to pay attention that you can’t use things you haven’t defined yet: in the above code, you have declared A before defining B . So it’s fine to declare pointers to A in B . But you cannot yet use A before defining it.
