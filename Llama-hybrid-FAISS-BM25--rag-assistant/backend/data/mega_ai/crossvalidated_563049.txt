I take it this is some sort of free throw percentage. Let's plot the data It isn't enough to just look at the plots. Dates which have more free throws have a more precise estimate of the FT% than dates which have fewer free throws. You can use a variety of models for data like these. I'm going to keep it simple and plot a regression weighting each observation of the FT% by the number of observations on that date. The trend is shown below It may look like your FT% is increasing, but the slope of this line is not statistically distinguishable from no increase in FT% as a function of time. Shown below is the model output Call: lm(formula = (makes/takes) ~ t, data = d, weights = takes) Weighted Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.7292 -0.2650 -0.1260 0.2557 1.1678 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.594751 0.044380 13.401 8.36e-11 t 0.001003 0.001142 0.878 0.391 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 You want to focus your attention on the row labelled t (for time since the first date listed). The coefficient is estimated to be positive, but there is a relatively large uncertainty (relative to the estimate of the effect), meaning the effect could be positive or negative, we can't say for certain. All in all, you could not conclude from these data alone that your FT% is increasing.
