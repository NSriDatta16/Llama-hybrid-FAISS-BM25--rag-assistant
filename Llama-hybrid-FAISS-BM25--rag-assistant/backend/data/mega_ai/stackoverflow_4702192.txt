Using a handle to resize in Silverlight

I have an image and a handle. I want to drag the handle with two effects: resizing the picture and moving the handle to keep it in the corner of the picture. Here's my code: public void StartResizing(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { resizing = true; Point pos = e.GetPosition(null); resizeX = pos.X; resizeY = pos.Y; distH = pos.X - 200; //Canvas.Left of the image distV = pos.Y - 50; //Canvas.Top of the image } public void KeepResizing(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (resizing) { Point p = e.GetPosition(null); double x = p.X - resizeX; double y = p.Y - resizeY; this.handle.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, 280 + x); //280.130 is the original position of the handle this.handle.SetValue(Canvas.TopProperty, 130 + y); double newDistH = p.X - 200; double newDistV = p.Y - 50; pic2.Height = (newDistV / distV) * orgHeight; //orgHeight and Widthinitialised earlier pic2.Width = (newDistH / distH) * orgWidth; } } public void StopResizing(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { resizing = false; } It works alright until I try to resize it for the second time. That's when the image is usually shrunk in a seemingly random way. What's wrong with the code?
