You should use empty XmlDataDocument when loading from file or string, so I guess you problem is here. As I remember .Net 2 supports Select method, which is more elegant way to get element from xml. see XmlDataDocument.Select , but this is not your case, just create new XmlDataDocument on loading. Hope this helps
