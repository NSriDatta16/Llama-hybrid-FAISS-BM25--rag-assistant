What are you trying to do. If you just want to load data using ajax and wanted to manipulate your var listBox = $("#CountyList"); $.post("/County/List/" + stateId, null, function (data) { var items = " Select County "; $.each(data, function (i, c) { items += " " + c.Text + " "; }); listBox.html(items); }, 'json'); You then just need to form a string with all your option elements in it, then load it unto the select box using .html() if you want a more elegant way to manipulate your select box . You could give this a try. http://www.texotela.co.uk/code/jquery/select/
