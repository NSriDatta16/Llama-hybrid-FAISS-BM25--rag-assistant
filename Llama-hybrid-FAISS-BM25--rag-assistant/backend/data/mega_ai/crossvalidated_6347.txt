PCA Based Filtering but only filter out small values

PCA based filtering is used to identify and eliminate noise in data. This would basically involve computing the PCs and using the top k PCs to denoise the data. What if I know for sure that only the extremely small values in my matrix are noise? Now, a value may be small w.r.t the entire matrix but not small w.r.t a particular row/column. Can I achieve this with some transformation of the input matrix followed by a PCA based filter?
