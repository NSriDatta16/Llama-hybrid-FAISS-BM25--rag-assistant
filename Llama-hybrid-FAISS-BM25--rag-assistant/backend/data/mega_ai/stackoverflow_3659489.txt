I'm trying to create a as400/Iseries Telnet Client, and can't find any documentation

I am attempting to create a telnet client that I can use to transfer green screen RPGLE apps to fancier client applications. I am able to establish a sockets connection and I have sent in a default "enter" command to access the log in screen but I don't know where to began to interpret where the fields are, where the server id of the session is stored, how to send back a comment, and how to identify the type of field. Does anyone know some good decent documentation that describes the communication between the telnet client and its server? I've tried looking online with no avail. I am writing this using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (vb.net).
