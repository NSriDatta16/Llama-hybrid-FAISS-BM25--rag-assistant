The comment below doesn't really work: "...a pragmatic alternative might be to introduce an extra (bool) column for the purpose. Set/clear that marker as the predicate (using a regex or any other complicated logic), and just use the row-filter to say "where set". Not very clean, maybe, but a lot simpler than implementing a custom data-view / binding-source." When you set the new column this causes the row state to change and you basically end up with the whole table/dataview thinking that it needs to do every row in the next update. Not sure how to get around this problem.
