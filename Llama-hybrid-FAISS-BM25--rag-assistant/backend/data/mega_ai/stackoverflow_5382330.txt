Divide List in Equal Parts

I have a big List that may have some 50,000 or more items and i have to do operation against each item.takes some X time now if i use conventional method and do operation in sequential manner it is definitely take X * 50,000 on average. I planned to optimize and save some time and decided to use Background Worker as there is no dependency among them.Plan was to divide the List in 4 parts and use each in separate Background Worker . I want to ASk 1.is this method DUMB? 2.Is there any other Better Method? 3.Suggest a nice and clean method to divide List in 4 equal Parts? Thanks
