How to do custom tasks during install/uninstall of a ClickOnce app?

Is there any way to run custom code during the installation or uninstallation of a ClickOnce app? This question has been asked before here , but that was a long time ago, the answer given there was IMHO very kludgy, and I'm kind of hoping that the later releases of VS have provided a more elegant solution...
