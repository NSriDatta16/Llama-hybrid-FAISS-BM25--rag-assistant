Multivariate Linear Regression

Question: Please help me to explain what the output of the generalized linear model (glm) means. I understand the inputs, but I don't understand what the outputs of the fit are, or what the they mean in terms of the relationship between satisfaction and infidelity. Do the results that I am getting mean that I have not performed the analysis correctly? I am pretty new to both the topic and tools. Background: So, I am trying to compute a multivariate linear regression model in order to examine the extent to which sexual satisfaction is associated with infidelity. Infidelity has 3 separate measures to actually test infidelity with 2 separate time points (measured 2 weeks apart) The issue I am having is how to interpret the output and put this into a table. So I decided to take the average of each infidelity measure at time 1 and 2, and sexual satisfaction at time 1 and 2. Then I run the analysis by going through General Linear Model, Multivariate, placed my 3 infidelity variables in the DV box and satisfaction in the fixed factors with a covariate. So now I have the output but I don't know how to interpret it. I believe I would need to report the b, β, Confidence Intervals and P value. Although I cant seem to find the β value which leads me to believe I have run the test wrong. This is how I run the test: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21476743 I hope this is a better explanation.
