Distribution of the ratio of a squared Gamma variable to another Gamma random variable

I'm trying to figure out a distribution of (average) velocities v in capillary network where I know the diameters d as well as the capillary lengths l are gamma distributed and the average velocity in a capillary is related via v~dÂ²/l (I assume constant pressure differences). I know the ratio of two gamma distributions ends up in a beta prime distribution. However I'm not sure what to do about the square. In concise form: Let $$Y = \frac{X^2}{Z} \quad \text{ where} \quad X \sim \text{Gamma}(a,b) \quad \text{ and } \quad Z \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha,\beta)$$ What's the distribution of $Y$?
