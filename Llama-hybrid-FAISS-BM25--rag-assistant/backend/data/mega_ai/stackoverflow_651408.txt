Well, no, more or less by definition. In a lazy-evaluation language, you should by definition get the same results you'd get with vigorous (are people really using "strict" now?) evaluation, except for the delay of evaluation until needed, storage implications and all that. So if you could get some different behavior except for that, it would be a bug.
