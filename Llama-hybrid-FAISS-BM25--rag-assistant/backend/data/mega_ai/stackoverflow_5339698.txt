Magento Enterprise Edition (EE) is a closed-source superset of Magento Community Edition. It contains a number of additional features, and requires an annual license fee. The Enterprise Edition was developed from the same code-base as Community Edition, however it has forked in some aspects, and Magento do not guarantee a direct upgrade path from Community Edition to Enterprise Edition. The additional features encompass more robust marketing, administration, content management and engineering tools, along with customer-facing functionality. More information on the Enterprise only features can be found at the Magento website . Developers should be careful to test custom code in both Community and Enterprise editions.
