You should consider multinomial logistic regression . It is, I think, exactly what you are looking for, assuming that all d choices are available to all subjects. If that assumption doesn't hold, you should look in the literature for discrete choice models . Be wary of the assumptions of these models, many require behavioral assumptions that are dubious.
