Online deseasonalization of time series data

Are there any existing methodologies of deseasonalizing time series data online, in order to avoid lookahead bias? It seems that if you don't deaseasonalize time series data online, you would not be able to evaluate a machine learning algorithm that runs online on time series data that you wish to deseasonalize.
