You’ve taken a little bit of an idiosyncratic approach to this problem, but it points to the two main ways people deal with this in the epi modeling community. Probably the most common approach is to frame the problem as a partially observed Markov process—a model with an assumed Markov structure to the state space and an observation model that represents how (some) state variables are sampled. In this approach, implemented generically in the pomp package in R and described here for example http://www2.uaem.mx/r-mirror/web/packages/pomp/vignettes/intro_to_pomp.pdf , one doesn’t explicitly model the error structure between time point as long as one can simulate it under your model. This is necessary because most of the time for interesting models, the likelihood is intractable. Perhaps this framework will be enlightening to you. The other approach less often used in practice is joint Bayesian estimation of the model parameters and the missing data using MCMC. Here’s an idealized tutorial https://si.biostat.washington.edu/sites/default/files/modules/2017_SISMID_8_Lab7.pdf , and a much deeper discussion https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6275108/ . In this approach, you’ll see familiarity with your question about the missing “delta-R” data. Here, one simulates the missing data under the model while also estimating parameters, so that you can work with the tractable full data likelihood. A third approach, much more similar to what you’ve laid out in notation and ideas—using a Gaussian approximate to describe the complete data likelihood above— is also described here https://iazpvnewgrp01.blob.core.windows.net/source/archived/Sustained_reductions_in_transmission_have_led_to_declining_COVID_19_prevalence_in_King_County_WA.pdf . It’s new enough we don’t have the formal publication yet. In comparing your post to the approaches here, the challenge you’re facing is that you’re trying to write out something approximately equivalent to the likelihood of the process and observation model with the hidden states “integrated out.” This is intractable. Digging into either of the approaches above and the literature around them will get you where you need to go! Enjoy!
