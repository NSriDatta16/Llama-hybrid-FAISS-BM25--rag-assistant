Interrupts are preferred when low latency is required. If you poll for some condition N times per second, then on average you will discover that condition in time one half of 1/N after it has actually happened. Polling is sometimes preferred when absolute deterministic timing is required. By their very nature, interrupts can occur at unpredictable times and greatly complicate timing analysis, whereas with polled systems, it is relatively easy to make provable statements about deadline satisfaction.
