In short: components might automatically work in x64 Delphi, however most of them likely need changes, especially when they use pointers or assembly language. I know that the Delphi team strives for an upgrade path to be as smooth as possible. But x64 - like Unicode - is a breaking change, so be prepared to update your components too. Usually, platform vendors will brief 3rd party vendors before the general public so they have time to make their 3rd party products compatible with their new platform version. Microsoft has done this for .NET, the Delphi team has done this for Unicode and .NET, and other vendors have done similar things. Like Eugene mentioned, 3rd party library vendors could also use the x64 version of Free Pascal to get a feel of what changes might be needed. When you look at the source code, you see that some vendors indeed do. You can get yourself a feel for the changes too. For instance, Allen Bauer uses his blog and his twitter feed to post some info on x64 Delphi. He also talked about Delphi x64 on this Delphi.org podcast interview . Embarcadero has shown an alpha version of the Delphi x64 command-line compiler during roadshows and conferences, including the last virtual CodeRage conference . --jeroen
