The official answer is the one that produces the largest hash (like SHA-512). However, in practice, you usually have to make a tradeoff between that and storage concerns and processing time to calculate the hash. Here's a list of hash functions, along with data about their size and more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Cryptographic_hash_algorithms
