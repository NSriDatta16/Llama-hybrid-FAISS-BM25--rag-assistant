Best Chicago Font alternative

I'm just after reading the "User Interface Design for Programmers 2001" by Joel Spolsky. He suggests Apple Chicago as a good font solution to a WinForms App. I would like to know what can be the best alternative of Apple Chicago font in Windows environment. Do you know any out-of-the-box or free-to-download mono spaced fonts that look elegant?
