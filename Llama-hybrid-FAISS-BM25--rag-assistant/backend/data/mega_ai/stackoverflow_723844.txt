Code coverage for people (manual) tests?

Are there any code coverage tools for manual testing? For example, if I write 30 new lines of code, compile, then run, is there any way to quickly verify that all 30 lines were run? Also, later, after I've checked the code into an official build, is there any way that I can verify that the test department hit on all 30 lines of code when they conducted their independent testing? I know that there are a lot of tools for verifying that test departments test all requirements, but I haven't found a tool that verifies that testers test all lines of code. I'm most interested in .NET / C# tools.
