Python object in QMimeData

I'm implementing drag and drop QTreeView based on my custom model. All works fine, my tree displays data, drag and drop is enabled and now the last step lies ahead of me - to drop and trasfer dragged data. To do this I need to implement mimeTypes, mimeData and dropMimeData methods in my model. And now my question: Is there any easy standard way how to pass an arbitrary Python object through QMimeData? I'm doing just an internal move within QTreeView which displays hierarchy of my Python classes Person. And I want to reorder them. No drag and drop outside the application, not even outside of control. I have found only single one tutorial: link text . But is it the only way? Cannot it be done without encoding the Python object into ByteArray. I need really simple solution for my only one class Person. Thank you.
