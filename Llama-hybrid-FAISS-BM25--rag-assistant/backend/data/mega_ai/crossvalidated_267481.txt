Generating random survival values using Cox model estimates

Background I'm fresh to survival analysis and I'm using R's survival and coxme libraries to evaluate the effects of two covariates -- population size and resource level -- on the lifespan (in weeks) of local populations. I scaled down population size by 100 and resource measure by 10. From the subsequent censored data frame: > head(pop.surv) location lifespan censor size resource 1 13 2 1 3.10 0.0 2 13 1 1 0.68 0.0 3 26 2 1 2.02 0.0 4 26 2 1 2.04 0.0 5 30 3 1 5.23 0.1 6 13 1 1 5.22 0.0 I ran a mixed-effect cox-proportional hazard model: res Based on the result, > summary(res) Cox mixed-effects model fit by maximum likelihood Data: pop.surv events, n = 1940, 1940 Iterations= 23 165 NULL Integrated Fitted Log-likelihood -12751.36 -12318.14 -12288.69 Chisq df p AIC BIC Integrated loglik 866.45 3.00 0 860.45 843.74 Penalized loglik 925.35 21.51 0 882.33 762.50 Model: Surv(lifespan, censor) ~ size + resource + (1 | location) Fixed coefficients coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p size -0.01693793 0.9832047 0.003612058 -4.69 2.7e-06 resource -0.15943564 0.8526248 0.007610163 -20.95 0.0e+00 Random effects Group Variable Std Dev Variance location Intercept 0.3320527 0.1102590 I interpret that, holding the other covariate constant, an additional 100 members in a population reduces the weekly hazard of extinction by a factor of 0.9832 on average -- that is, by 1.68 percent. Similarly, each 10 unit increase in resource level reduces the hazard by a factor of 0.8526, or 14.74 percent. Question Based on this knowledge, I now want to write a predictive function survfunc(s,r) that takes the arguments of population size s and resource level r , then outputs a survival distribution with a covariate-dependent hazard rate and randomly samples a lifespan value from it. How would I do that?
