Robots are quite hard to defeat. On one website I was involved with, we didn't even use Captcha - just a field labelled "Leave this field blank". Robots always failed that really simple test. The bigger problem is mass-human solving. There are lots of implementations whereby users solve screen-scraped captchas in return for something, like videos or images (you know what I mean). This means that there's a real human solving the captcha, so emotive, facial and more complex patterns are meaningless. Multi-step processes will discourage this behaviour, but at the cost of making things harder for genuine visitors, which is sad when we're all trying to design websites that are more usable.
