I find it helps to Get a good grasp of the syntax and semantics of the language, by looking at SIMPLE examples and relating it to something you already know Look at what libraries and design patterns are common. Find out why they are common. Was the language designed to encourage them? Is it convention? Efficient? have an idea that you want to implement in the language. It will give you a goal, and some perspective. Look at other's code, once you are comfortable picking apart and reading it, and comfortable with source-layout, conventions, common-naming and so on I find it best to dive-in heads first. Get feedback from people if possible. Most importantly: don't be afraid of making mistakes they are a big part of the learning process. And try and relate things to concepts you are already comfortable with.
