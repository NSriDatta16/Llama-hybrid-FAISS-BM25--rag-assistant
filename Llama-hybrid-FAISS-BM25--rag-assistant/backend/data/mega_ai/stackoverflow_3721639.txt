Done is done - it has to be all those things you defined, however treating them as steps explicitly with a bug tracker can have the undesired side effect of encouraging divisions within then team and throwing stuff over the wall. So coders would claim they are done once ticket is marked "coded" and "unit tested", testers when marked tested etc. This is exactly the opposite of what Scrum intends to do - the whole team commits to doing the stories so that they meet the definition of done in the end. So even though some of the elements of achieving done are indeed steps one should be very careful with solidifying these steps in any kind of defined workflow. (This btw shows nicely why using a bug tracker as a scrum tool is a bad idea. Those are different tools that should be optimized for different things - even if linked together through some APIs.)
