Neural Networks in NeuronDotNet

i am using neurondotnet library for ANN programing, my input layer vector is 400 and my output layer vector is 5 and my sample for learning is only 28. my problem is that i don't have any idea of how to choose how many hidden layer i should have and the size of their vectors. can anyone put me on the right direction ? thank you.
