Always end each sentence with a newline. Never reformat paragraphs. These rules not only minimize spurious conflicts but also make your collaboratively edited paper easier to revise. For author commentary I use marginal comments: \long\def\authornote#1{% \leavevmode\unskip\raisebox{-3.5pt}{\rlap{$\scriptstyle\diamond$}}% \marginpar{\raggedright\hbadness=10000 \def\baselinestretch{0.8}\tiny \it #1\par}} \newcommand{\simon}[1]{\authornote{SLPJ: #1}} \newcommand{\norman}[1]{\authornote{NR: #1}} \newcommand{\john}[1]{\authornote{JD: #1}} We put these in the margin because frequently we're preparing a paper to strict length limits, and we want the marginal notes not to change the length of the paper. Marginal notes are then turned off by \long\def\authornote#1{\relax} I also invented the nbibtex tool (now in Debian!) so that you can use different .bib files from your coauthors without having to agree on arbitrary BibTeX keys. nbibtex works like BibTeX except that it uses key words from author, title and other fields. Each author's BibTeX file can be different, but if the paper is there, nbibtex will find it.
