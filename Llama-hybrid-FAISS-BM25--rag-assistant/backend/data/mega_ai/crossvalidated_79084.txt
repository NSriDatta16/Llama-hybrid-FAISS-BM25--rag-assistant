It probably means that you are overcorrelating your ensemble. Random forest works because it is based on highly independent trees achieved through randomizing the sample on which the trees are built and the candidate variables for each split of each tree. Because of the Jensen's inequality you know that the error of the average of the prediction of your tree ensemble will always be smaller or equal than the average error of your individual trees. It must be noticed that the loss function here must be convex and that the "guesses" must be independent. If you make too many trees there comes a point where this is no longer true. It could also be, as you mentioned, because of the random nature of the random forest model. Since they are based on bootstrapping.
