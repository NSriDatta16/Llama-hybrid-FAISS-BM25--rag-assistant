You could pass the bean as an attribute on the component (I assume when you say "component" you are using ui:component ). For a component: You could have a backing bean with these methods: private Object field; private UIComponent component; public void setMyComponent(UIComponent c) { component = c; } public UIComponent getMyComponent() { return component; } private void lookupFields() { field = component.getAttributes().get("foo"); } public String getSomething() { if (field == null) { lookupFields(); } return "" + field; } Not very elegant, but I'm not all that familiar with the mechanics of Facelets includes and this is the first thing that occurred to me. Note that the attributes might be persisted when the view is saved - I can't remember for stuff that gets set on the attributes map.
