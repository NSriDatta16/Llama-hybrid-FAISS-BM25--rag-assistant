From my experience, forced = hated. So you have to make people want to use it, ie make it useful. A central Wiki sounds like the best solution, but it's hard to say. You might want to look into MediaWiki , Traq , or Sharepoint Services (not to be confused with Office Sharepoint ). Your organization may find it encouraging if you post a list of the top contributors, editors, or visitors to the site. But that depends on how your org perceives competition.
