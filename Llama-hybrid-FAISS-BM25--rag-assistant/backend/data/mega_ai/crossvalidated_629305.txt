The Need for Corrections There is no reason to utilize a p value correction with respect to standalone chi-square tests. The reason being is that a normal chi-square test only spits out one p value based on the entire contingency table. In other words, you are only conducting one hypothesis test on the entire table, and thus the probability of errors in estimation are constrained to a single testing of the hypothesis. Therefore there is no need to adjust for pairwise comparison error rate (PCER). The situation would be different if for some reason you were conducting multiple chi-square tests on additional contingency tables. Typically you find p value corrections are more common for things like ANOVA-based pairwise comparisons, where uncorrected tests of several group comparisons may lead to problematic Type I error rates. This is because here you are actually conducting multiple hypothesis tests instead (though this to a degree may also not be ideal, as you may end up reducing power of these tests in the process). For a detailed discussion on this topic, refer to the citation I provide at the end of my answer. As a side note: make sure to report descriptive data and nominal magnitudes of association (such as the phi coefficient), as testing the null hypothesis alone isn't all that useful in my opinion.
