Is it possible to get the average image color with RMagick?

I need to know the average color from an image when I upload it to my Ruby on Rails application. Is it possible to get the average color value in HEX or in RGB to use this color later in the view that's going to display this image? Something like: img = Magick::Image.read(path).first hexVal = img.getHexValue
