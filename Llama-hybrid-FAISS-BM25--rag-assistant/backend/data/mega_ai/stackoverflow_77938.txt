You could use a multiview and just have a display view and an edit view.. then do your assignments as: lblWhatever.Text = txtWhatever.Text = whateverOriginatingSource; lblSomethingElse.Text = txtSomethingElse.Text = somethingElseOriginatingSource; myViews.SelectedIndex = myConditionOrVariableThatDeterminesEditable ? 0 : 1; then swap the views based on permissions. not the most elegant but will probably work for your situation. Maybe I should elaborate a little.. dismiss the psuedo (not sure if I have the selectedindex yada yada right.. but you get the point).
