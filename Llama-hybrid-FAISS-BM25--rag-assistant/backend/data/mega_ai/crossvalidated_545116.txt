This was a bit of a rabbit hole. None of the existing answers really answered my question, but the comments by "whuber" (pointing to this very similar post ) and "Dave" pointed me in the right direction. I'll summarize here what I learned. I simulated everything to check my assumptions. Assuming that vehicle speeds are normally distributed and that distribution is constant in time and space, passing a car or me being passed can be considered a sampling from that distribution. The fact that I'm driving does not matter, because, as "Dave" points out, the properties of the normal distribution are invariant for the change of reference (linear operation). If I do have a (reliable) radar gun, I can use the Maximum Likelihood Estimator to estimate the parameters of the distribution ( $\mu, \sigma$ ). The fact that I will observe only more much faster/slower vehicles does not really matter, as long as the observations don't skew towards one of those categories (e.g. I get passed a lot by much faster cars, but I don't pass a lot of much slower cars). If I don't have a radar gun, I can count the number of cars I pass and that pass me and use that as a z-score (see aforementioned post . In this way, assuming that the distribution is centered around the speed limit and if my speed is not equal to the average speed, I can estimate $\sigma$ from my observations. I tried to combine the results from counting at two different speeds (what "David Smith" suggests) and then estimate both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , but this doesn't give good results, (probably for reasons that are obvious to people more versed in statistics).
