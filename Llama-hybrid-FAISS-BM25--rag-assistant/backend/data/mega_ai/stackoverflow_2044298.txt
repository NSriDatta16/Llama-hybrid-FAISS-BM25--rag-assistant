DI without question. Or would you prefer to enhance your factory code when you create/update/delete an implementation? IMO, If you're programming to an interface, then you shouldn't bootstrap your implementations, however many layers deep it actually occurs. Also, DI isn't synonymous to Spring, et al. It's as simple as containing a constructor with the abstracted interface as an argument, i.e. public FileApp(FileStorage fs) { } . FYI, another possibility is a proxy .
