Stationarity of AR(1) model

I understand that a (weakly) stationary time series is one where $E[X_t]$ = constant $Var(x_t)$ = constant $cov(x_t,x_{t-h})$ = constant, at any h (regardless of t) and that ARMA models can only be applied on data that is stationary. Then, I learnt that for a AR(1) model to be stationary, the coefficient $|\phi_1|$ has to be less than 1. What does it mean for a "model" to be stationary? Does it just mean that the data we have applied the model to is stationary? Or is it something else?
