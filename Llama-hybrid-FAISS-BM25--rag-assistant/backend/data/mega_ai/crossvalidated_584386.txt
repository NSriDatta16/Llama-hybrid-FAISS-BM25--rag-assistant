How to interpret a logistic regression result with continuous variables?

I am conducting a regression analysis. I have a first problem and that is that the database has only an n of 41 (n=29 for one group and n=12 for the second group). But I have gone ahead with the logistic regression. For this I used the following code: model The "group" variable is whether the patient is asthmatic or not and the variables arrayil2, cytometriail2, cytometriail4, cytomtriail5 are continuous values. TABLA This gives me the following result: I don't quite understand the result, as I usually perform logistic regressions with a larger n and with categorical variables. I would need help in interpreting these results and whether they are wrong or not. Thanks in advance.
