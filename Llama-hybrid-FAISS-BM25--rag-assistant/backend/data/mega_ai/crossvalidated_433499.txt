You need to get something like $$ E[f(x)] = \int f(x) \, dx $$ MCMC was designed to approximate such integrals. By the law of large numbers $$ E[f(x)]\approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x) $$ So the proper way is just to plug-in the MCMC samples from the posterior distribution to your function $f$ and calculate arithmetic mean (or median, quantiles, or whatever else you want). As a sidenote, whatever you use MCMC for, if you want it to work, you need large samples, so the number of MCMC samples should be rather thousands, or tens of thousands, then hundreds. With 500 samples the estimate wouldn't be reliable for most of the cases. Moreover, usually the number of effective samples (e.g. measured by $n_{eff}$ statistic), i.e. the number of "independent" samples, would usually be much smaller then the number of MCMC draws, so your 500 samples can possibly have "value" of much smaller number of samples.
