Yes, adding the pragma would be correct. The memory is considered implicitly shared by all threads. Still that doesn't mean it will work faster. There are multiple issues to be considered: how many processors does your system have ? do you use integer or floating point ? For integer the order will not matter, but this is not true for floating point what variables are accessed only by the innermost loop ? You could declare them private to obtain better performance.
