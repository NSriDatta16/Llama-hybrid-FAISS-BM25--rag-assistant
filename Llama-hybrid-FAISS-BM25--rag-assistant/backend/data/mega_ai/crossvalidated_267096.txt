R: return date from element in time series

Is there a way to get the time stamp of an arbitrary element in time series object in R? Let me give you an example of what I mean. Imagine you had a series: library(foreign) bjg The function time() returns all time stamps for the entire series. > head(time(airline.ts)) [1] 1949.000 1949.083 1949.167 1949.250 1949.333 1949.417 But it doesn't work if I want the time stamp of a particular element, say > time(airline.ts[6]) [1] 1 attr(,"tsp") Why is that? Is there a way to extract the time information of a given element?
