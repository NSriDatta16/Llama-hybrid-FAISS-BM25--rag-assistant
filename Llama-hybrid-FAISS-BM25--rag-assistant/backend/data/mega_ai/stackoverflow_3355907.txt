I'm slightly confused. If you don't want to rewrite your jquery code: include jquery. If you want to use only one library and that's yui: rewrite the legacy jquery code to yui. But if you're moving from yui2 to yui3, you'll have to rewrite the yui code as well, they're different enough. I think the first thing you need to do to have think - if there are resources for a refactor, I'd avoid thinking in shims and extra layers. The personal opinion though is yui3 is still not quite ready for primetime, despite all the cool and very elegant stuff they're doing.
