How to pause an html 5 video at a specific time

Is there an elegant way to pause html 5 video at a specific time? I tried two ways: Use the timeupdate event and see if the currentTime property is greater than the desired time and make a call to pause(). This performs well in Firefox, other Browsers sometimes lag behind and render additional frames before the video really pauses. Use TimedTracks and a Cue with the PauseOnExit Flag set to true. Unfortunatly, no browser implements TimedTracks... Do you have other ideas? Cheers, Stefan
