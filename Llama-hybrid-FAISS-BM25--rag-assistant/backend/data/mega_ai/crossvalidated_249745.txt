You have an extremely short time series: 16 daily observations. Daily data often exhibit weekly seasonality, but with only 16 observations, detecting weekly seasonality is hopeless. A seasonplot of your series does not show any pattern: library(forecast) xx (Days of week may not match your actual dates, but this is not overly important.) The best forecasting method for short time series is typically the historical average. A word of caution: your data are asymmetrically distributed. hist(xx) If you try to minimize the mean absolute error, you may end up with biased forecasts (because the expected MAE is minimized by the median of the distribution, not the mean ). I recommend reconsidering your error measure. More info on this in Morlidge (2015, Foresight ) and my paper (Kolassa, 2016, International Journal of Forecasting ).
