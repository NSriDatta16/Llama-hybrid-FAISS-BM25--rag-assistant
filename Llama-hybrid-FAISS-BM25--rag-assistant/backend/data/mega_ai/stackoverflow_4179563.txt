Ok, after a lot more investigation and hair-pulling the 16k limit seems to be a red-herring. It may be relevant but the actual problem is a serialization issue. There seems to be 2 issues here regarding the serialization of complex types to IsolatedStorageSettings. The first one is the one mentioned above where the _LocalSettings class is truncated at 16k halfway through an XML element. This causes the "Operation not permitted on IsolatedStorageFileStream" exception. The second is on a smaller complex type - after examining the contents of _LocalSettings it seems to write to it but then on the NEXT time you load up the app the first Settings.Save wipes all existing settings (ie. it does not load the existing ones and resave them). This makes the _LocalSettings reset to blank again (ie. ALL your settings are not persisted). The problem was that one of my base types (incidentally the MVVM Light ViewModelBase - read more about this here ) does not have a public paramaterless constructor and is therefore not serializable (there was no warning on this, it just exhibited the strange behaviours above). You have to exit the program to have this happen - when you read the setting after a write like this it works fine - I suspect Silverlight is doing more behind the scenes after you exit completely. If anyone can confirm this?? As soon as I made the base class serializable then it worked again.
