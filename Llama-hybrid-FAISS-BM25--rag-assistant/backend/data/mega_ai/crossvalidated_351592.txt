Time Series: use of Box-Cox to reduce the "noise"

I am researching the best method to use with time series. FBprophet (Python) seems like a strong option. To prepare time series for Prophet I am thinking about using boxcox and inv_boxcox at the end from fbprophet import Prophet from scipy.stats import boxcox from scipy.special import inv_boxcox what is your opinion? Is boxcox helpful in reducing the noise of the Values? Any tips and suggestions will be greatly appreciated
