Training a neural network (R)

I'm working on a neural network with one hidden layer. So far I've implemented the algorithm, and I've been able to numerically verify the partial derivatives I get from back propagation. My problem is when I try to train the network by updating the weights. No matter what I do it doesn't seem like I can get my estimates to come close to the actual values. The data I'm using is from the function: $$ f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} $$ On a side note, I haven't added bias parameters because I couldn't get the dimensions to fit in back propagation once I added the bias in forward prop. Not sure if this is an issue since I understood the bias parameters as a safeguard against inputs equal to 0? theta
