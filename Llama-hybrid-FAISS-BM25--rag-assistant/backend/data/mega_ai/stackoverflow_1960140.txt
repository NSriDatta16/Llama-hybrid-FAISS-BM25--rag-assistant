Sharing Data Between User Controls

How do I share data between user-controls in .Net, using ADO.net datasets, without ditching the designer? A simple example: I have two separate user-controls; Control1 , which contains a textbox, and Control2 , which contains a label. Both the textbox and the label are bound (using the designer) to the same property in the same dataset. If I drag both Control1 and Control2 into the same form, I would expect that changing the textbox would change the label. However, it doesn't, since Control1 and Control2 have separate DataSets and BindingSources. I want to keep the textbox and label synchronized without having to ditch the designer and code the entire form by hand. Thanks in advance for any help.
