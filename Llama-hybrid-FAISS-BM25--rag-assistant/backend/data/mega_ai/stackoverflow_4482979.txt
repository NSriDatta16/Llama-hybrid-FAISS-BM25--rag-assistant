wpf DependencyProperty for button custom control

I have been making my own custom control and I ran into trouble when I wanted to my OwnButton to react as proper component. I would like my component's content be "ownButton" when it is dragged to designer and then there would be a property "Content" in property-list where a programmer would be able to change that text to whatever is needed. Here is a part of my Generic.xaml file: I was able to make a DependencyProperty in OwnButton class, but it isn't linked to Button's content. Here is the code: private const string defaultContent = "ownButton"; public String Content { get { return (String)GetValue(ContentProperty); } set { SetValue(ContentProperty, value); } } public static readonly DependencyProperty ContentProperty = DependencyProperty.Register("Content", typeof(String), typeof(OwnButton), new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(OwnButton.defaultContent, new PropertyChangedCallback(OwnButton.OnContentChanged), new CoerceValueCallback(OwnButton.CoerceContent))); Would someone be able to help me with my problem?
