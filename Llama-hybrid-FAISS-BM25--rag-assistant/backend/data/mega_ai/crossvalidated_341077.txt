What is a "recognition network" in ML?

The authors of "Composing graphical models with neural networks for structured representations and fast inference" consistently refer to "recognition networks", for example: The variational autoencoder (VAE) handles general non-conjugate observation models by introducing recognition networks. I assume a recognition network is a type of neural network, but when I google the term, I don't find an authoritative source on what a "recognition network" actually is in machine learning.
