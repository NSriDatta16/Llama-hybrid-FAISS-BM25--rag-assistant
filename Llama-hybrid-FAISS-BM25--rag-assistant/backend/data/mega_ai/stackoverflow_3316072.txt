Logging/tracking in PHP: Scribe, Chukwa, log4php?

This is probably a pretty high-level question that requires a lot of explaining, but I'm in need of a lot of explaining. Basically I'm developing a PHP application that requires a lot of logging and tracking. Tracking clicks, interactions, performance, etc. etc. Anything under the sun. Facebook's Scribe and Yahoo's Chukwa are both great implementations of this. I know little about log4php. What I want is a high-level overview of how this kind of logging works, specifically in conjunction with a PHP application. You can stop at the point where the log gets processed; I already know that I want to use Hadoop/Hive for processing and storage. I'd also like some fairly low-level looks at what happens within the application itself. For example, how does one take the behavior of a click and send that to the logger? I'd appreciate any reading that can help get me started, as well.
