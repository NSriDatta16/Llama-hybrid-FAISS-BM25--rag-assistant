Time component in the distribution of N elements randomly falling in M bins

I have a system where N elements randomly fall into M bins, so that each bin contains X elements on average. I assume that the distribution of bin occupancies is Poisson(lambda = X). I want to understand how does the probability of the event [ some bin reaches occupancy K] behave, in the course of (or after) L extra actions: a random element (among those currently present in the bins) is revoked, then a new element is added to a random bin (so that the total number of elements in all bins is kept N). For example, N is 100 and M is 100. Given a static random sample of elements, the probability of any given bin to have occupancy of at least K = 10 could probably be approximated as A = Poisson(lambda = 1, k >= 10) ~= 10 -7 . Then, the probability that some bin has occupancy of at least 10 is 1 - (1 - A) 100 ~= 0.00001, i. e. it is rather low. Then, we perform L = 1 000 000 pairs of actions: 1) revoke one element (selected uniformly at random among the 100 currently present elements) 2) add one new element, and after each such action we check if some bin has occupancy 10. Intuitively, after a million of such actions the probability that at some point we have seen some bin having 10 elements is rather high, probably approaches 1. I want to understand what could be the generic way to express this probability for L = 1, L = 50, L = 1000, etc.
