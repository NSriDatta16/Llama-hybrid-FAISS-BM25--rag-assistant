I agree that code coverage should ideally be 100%. This does not necessarily mean 60 lines of code would have 60 lines of test code, but that each execution path is tested. The only thing more annoying than a bug is a bug that hasn't run yet. By only testing the public API you run this risk of not testing all instances of the internal classes. I am really stating the obvious by saying that, but I think it should be mentioned. The more each behavior is tested, the easier it is to recognize not only that it is broken, but what is broken.
