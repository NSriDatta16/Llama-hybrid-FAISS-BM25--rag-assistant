Code Coverage and Blame

Has anyone seen a tool that will integrate code coverage results with SCM/VCS to attribute untested lines of code to developers? For example, is there a tool that will take NCover's Coverage.Xml, combine it with SVN blame, and produce a report that tells me things like developer who commits most untested code?
