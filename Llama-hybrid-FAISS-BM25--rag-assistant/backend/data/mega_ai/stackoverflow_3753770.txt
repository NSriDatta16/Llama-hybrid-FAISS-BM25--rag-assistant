You have more than one field with the names id and name . Try changing the SELECT portion of your SQL (in the PHP code) to: SELECT `modx`.coverage_nation.id, `modx`.coverage_nation.name, `modx`.coverage_national_region.id AS coverage_national_region_id, `modx`.coverage_national_region.name AS coverage_national_region_name Or something similar so returned fields have distinct names.
