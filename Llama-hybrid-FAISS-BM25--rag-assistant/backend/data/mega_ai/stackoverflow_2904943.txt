Hmm, well, yes, sort of. There isn't really sophisticated support for tagging, and what there is, is implemented in pdftex/luatex. Support for bookmarks and in-document cross-references is done using tagging. There's also been some more sophisticated work shown at TUG conferences, but this is all in the pipeline for now. Context/luatex has better support that Latex for this sort of thing: there's some support for interactive documents using Context's layers, where the contents of the layers change when buttons are clicked in the PDF. I think this must be done using tagging. I've never heard of anything like embedded forms, digital signing, or embedding the Latex/Tex/Context source in the resulting PDF, but in principle this is all possible.
