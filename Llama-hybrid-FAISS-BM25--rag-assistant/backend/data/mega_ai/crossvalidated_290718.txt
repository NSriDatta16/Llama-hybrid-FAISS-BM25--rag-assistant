ARMA - coefficient interpretation

I would like to interpret my ARMA model. I would like to tell about all those numbers as much as possible. I tried to study it but there as still some issues I am not sure about. I will start by trying to explain the thing I hope I understand correctly (if not, please help me out) and then ask you guys how to interpret the rest. The data are inter-bank interest rates. The first is AIC and BIC. This should tell me how good the model is. I can use these numbers to compare with other models used on these data. For example I can try to do ARMA (5, 5) and see if this less complex but better interpretable model is better. The lower the AIC and BIC, the better. Am I correct? Coef of constant is just the constant of the function that tries to describe the data I model. Am I correct? ar.L1.PRIBOR_1m this is the autoregresive of the model. It means that if the value is changed by 1 in previous period, then the current value is changed by 1,9136. Am I correct? ar.L2.PRIBOR_1m this means that if the value in two periods back is changed by 1, then current value is changed by -1,4880. And so on with ar.L3.PRIBOR_1m etc. Am I Correct? the P>|z| is the p-value of the significance of the coef. If I decide that for me is 5 % enough then all the coefs where P>|z| is lover then 0,05 are OK. Am I correct? I do not know how to interpret: - std err moving average part of the model. Can those coefs by somehow interpreted as autoregresive part? What does [95,0% Coef. Int.] mean? How can I write down this model as a function? Something like Y=.... is the second part of the table (real, imaginary,...) worth describing? Thank you very much for your help.
