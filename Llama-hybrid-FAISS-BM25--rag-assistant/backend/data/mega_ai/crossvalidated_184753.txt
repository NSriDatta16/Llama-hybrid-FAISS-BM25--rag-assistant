In a GLM, is the log likelihood of the saturated model always zero?

As part of the output of a generalised linear model, the null and residual deviance are used to evaluate the model. I often see the formulas for these quantities expressed in terms of the log likelihood of the saturated model, for example: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/113022/22199 , Logistic Regression : How to obtain a saturated model The saturated model, as far as I understand it, is the model that perfectly fits the observed response. Thus, in most places I have seen, the log-likelihood of the saturated model is always given as zero. Yet, the way the formula for deviance is given suggests that sometimes this quantity is non zero. (As if it is zero always, why bother including it?) In what cases can it be non zero? If it is never non-zero, why include it in the formula for deviance?
