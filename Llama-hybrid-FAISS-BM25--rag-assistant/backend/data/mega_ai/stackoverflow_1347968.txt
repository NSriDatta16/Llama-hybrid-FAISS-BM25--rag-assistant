I think trying to organize your cascade rules by class and id might be miss guided. You really should just be thinking of the actual cascade of things rather than trying to make them private. For example the following: #container { width: 600px; margin: auto; } #left { width: 250px; float: left; } #left p { color: Blue; } #left .information p { font: normal .83em sans-serif; color: #000000; } #right { width: 250px; float: right; } #right ul { font: normal .83em sans-serif; list-style: none; } Will show the this: alt text http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/1576/croppercapture5e.jpg As you can see, there is no font face for the page itself. But as you dive deeper in the levels of the style cascade you will find that paragaphs have style defined and with the .information class you have a color blue defined on a paragraph. By thinking of what styles are needed as you dive deeper into your HTML you will see that you actually end up with less HTML and better organized style sheets. Good luck and hope this helps.
