It's not as good as using atmospheric noise but it's still truly random since it depends on the characteristics of the network which is notorious for random non-repeatable behavior. See Random.org for more on randomness. Here's an attempt at an implementation: @ips : list = getIpAddresses(); @rnd = PseudorandomNumberGenerator(0 to (ips.count - 1)); @getTrueRandomNumber() { ping(ips[rnd.nextNumber()]).averageTime }
