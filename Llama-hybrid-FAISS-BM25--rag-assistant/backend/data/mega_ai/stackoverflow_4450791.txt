When jQuery accordion is clicked, needs to go to top of page

I have an accordion layout in jQuery with one section that has become rather large. I need to be able to click the different sections and have the accordion open and the scroll bar on the right be all the way to the top of the right of the page. I tried the but that doesn't work and breaks the accordion. How can I click a link and have the accordion stay at the top of the page? code: $(document).ready(function() { $('#other').change(function() { $('#otherrace').parent().toggle(this.checked).focus(); }); $("#toggleElement").change(function() { $('input[name=living]').not(this).attr('disabled', this.checked); }); $("#toggleInsurance").change(function() { $('input[name=insurance]').not(this).attr('disabled', this.checked); }); $("#toggleInsurance").change(function() { $('input[name=insurance]').not(this).attr('disabled', this.checked); }); $("#accordion").accordion(); $('[name*="race"]').click(function() { $('#otherrace').css('visibility', $('#other').attr('checked') ? 'visible':'hidden'); });});$(document).ready(function() { $('[name*="RadioGroup1"]').click(function() { $('#RadioGroup1_11').css('visibility', $('#RadioGroup1_10').attr('checked') ? 'visible':'hidden'); }); }); Demographcis Last Name &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle Initial &nbsp; &nbsp; First Name &nbsp; &nbsp; Address &nbsp; &nbsp; Rural Route# &nbsp; &nbsp; City State ZIP DOB &nbsp; &nbsp; Phone &nbsp; &nbsp; Gender Female Male &nbsp; &nbsp; Race/Ethnicity Asian White Black Latino Pacific Islander Other, specify &nbsp; &nbsp; Living Arragenments With whom do you live?
