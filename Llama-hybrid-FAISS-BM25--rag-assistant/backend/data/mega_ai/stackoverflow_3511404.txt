Yes, if these pages content needs to be referenced by search engines, of course they have to be in sitemap. I worked on a lot of ebusiness website and of course, almost 99% of pages where dynamically generated, almost 1000 product pages versus the 3 sales conditions & legal static pages. So the sitemap itself was dynamic and regenerated every 15 minutes (to avoid dumping the whole product base each and running thousands of queries each tim the sitemap is called). You can use a sort of separate script to do this : I would do one static part template if you have static page, and one other embedding the dynamically generated urls. It would be easier if you CMS already embed url management (or routing) system.
