I believe you did not add the reference to System.Web.dll. References and namespace imports are different things. Namespace is a way to group related classes together, so all classes related to collections reside in System.Collections, all Windows Forms stuff is in System.Windows.Forms and you may also want to organize your project to separate business logic, presentation and data access in different namespaces. However namespaces are purely logical. You can build several libraries that add classes to the same namespaces, and you can also use several namespaces in one project. You imported System.Web namespace here with the using statement: using System.Web; It only means that instead of accessing the class by its full name , System.Web.HttpUtility, you can write just HttpUtility, and the compiler will infer you mean the System.Web one. However, for Windows applications, the library itself, called System.Web.dll is not referenced by default. This means that none of System.Web classes are even known to the compiler right now. To add a reference to physical library file, right-click on project References folder, choose ' Add Reference... ' and pick System.Web.dll . And, again, namespaces are just logical groupings, assemblies are physical files on your hard drive. Good luck, Dan
