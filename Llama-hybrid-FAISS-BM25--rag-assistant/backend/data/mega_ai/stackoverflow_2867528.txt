Performance when accessing class members

I'm writing something performance-critical and wanted to know if it could make a difference if I use: int test( int a, int b, int c ) { // Do millions of calculations with a, b, c } or class myStorage { public: int a, b, c; }; int test( myStorage values ) { // Do millions of calculations with values.a, values.b, values.c } Does this basically result in similar code? Is there an extra overhead of accessing the class members? I'm sure that this is clear to an expert in C++ so I won't try and write an unrealistic benchmark for it right now
