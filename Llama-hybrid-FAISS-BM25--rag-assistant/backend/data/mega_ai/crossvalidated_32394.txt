I think some of the books I mentioned for advanced undergraduate or first year graduate school are appropriate based on your description of what you need. Something like Hogg and Tanis Probability and Statistical Inference 8th Edition would be very suitable. Here is a link to amazon where there are 48 customer reviews of the book. http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistical-Inference-Robert-Hogg/dp/0321584759/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1342453674&sr=1-1&keywords=probability+and+statistical+inference+eighth+edition
