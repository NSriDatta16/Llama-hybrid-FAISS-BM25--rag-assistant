When to stop MCMC within collapsed Gibbs?

I am setting up a Hierarchical model whose target distribution is $p(\theta,w|y)$ , $\theta$ being a reduced set of high-level parameters, $w$ being a data augmentation of very high dimension, and $y$ being the data. The big problem is that there is a coupling between $w$ and $\theta$ making vanilla Gibbs sampler unusable. My strength is that I can sample from $w$ quite efficiently. However, I cannot evaluate $p(w|\theta, z)$ . Decorrelation methods like Yu and Meng's gave disappointing results. I also have bad results with blocked methods from Rue and Held because I update $w$ in several steps and therefore I cannot get the Holy Grail of $p(w, \theta|z)/p(w|\theta, z) = p(\theta|z)$ . Since smart methods did not work, I am going for low-brow strategy. Since I have an efficient integrator on $w$ , I want to use the efficient sampler for $w$ in order to compute Metropolis ratios of the shape: $$p(\theta'|y)/p(\theta|y) = \int p(y|w)p(w|\theta')dp(w|\theta', y) ~~/ ~~ \int p(y|w)p(w|\theta)dp(w|\theta, y).$$ I have two interrogations. The first is when I should stop the integration needed to update $\theta$ . Isn't there a way to cut corners in the evaluation of $\int p(y|w)p(w|\theta)dp(w|\theta, y)$ ? Any reference would be appreciated. I also wonder if anyone thinks that I have missed out something obvious.
