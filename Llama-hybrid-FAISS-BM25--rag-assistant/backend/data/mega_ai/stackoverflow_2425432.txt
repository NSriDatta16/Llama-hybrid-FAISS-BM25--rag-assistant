ActiveSync really only has 2 "modes" - either with the ability to sync PIM info, or just the ability to connect as Guest. In both modes a user can browse the device from the PC. What it sounds like you want to do is not include ActiveSync at all, but instead make your device a USB function device that acts as Mass Storage. If you do that you can then set a specific folder to be the mounted store and they would have access to only that folder. Of course in that scenario you can't use any of the PIM data sync features.
