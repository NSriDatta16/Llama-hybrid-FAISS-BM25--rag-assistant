Strange artefact in my Fourier transform

I have performed an fft (fast fourier transform) on a time series waveform in Matlab, but I seem to have a weird wave actually in the fourier transform plot, although there are spikes this wave looks like something I'd expect to see only in the time domain. Is there any programming reason why this could happen?
