What is the correct way of splitting out your solutions? Check out this chapter from the TFS guide by the Patterns & Practices team: Chapter 3 - Structuring Projects and Solutions in Source Control Pay special attention to this note to the "Partitioned Solution" scenario (which I believe you're actually trying to implement): Unlike previous versions of Visual Studio, Visual Studio 2005 relies upon MSBuild. It is now possible to create solution structures that do not include all referenced projects and still build without errors. As long as the master solution has been built first, generating the binary output from each project, MSBuild is able to follow project references outside the bounds of your solution and build successfully. This only works if you use project references, not file references. You can successfully build solutions created this way from the Visual Studio build command line and from the IDE, but not with Team Build by default. In order to build successfully with Team Build use the master solution that includes all of the projects and dependencies.
