Optimal formula to predict product when one of the components is certain

When an item is clicked, it generates revenue equal to the cost per click (CPC). As such, revenue = I(click) x CPC . I want to select the item with highest expected revenue to be shown. I have a machine learning model that predicts the probability of click (eCTR). The obvious idea would be to rank by expected revenue = eCTR x CPC . However, CPC is certain, whereas the click isn't. As such, even if the eCTR model is calibrated, my intuition is that CPC should be given precedence. If it's a calibrated yet high-loss classifier, it may be beneficial to rely more on the (certain) CPC. Am I wrong in believing a formula such as revenue = root(eCTR) x CPC may perform better in generating more revenue than the unbiased revenue = eCTR x CPC ? What's the math?
