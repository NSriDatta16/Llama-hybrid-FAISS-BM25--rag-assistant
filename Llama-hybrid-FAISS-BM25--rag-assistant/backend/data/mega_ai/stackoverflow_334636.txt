If you insist on staying with this design, I would suggest that you use JSTL . This provides a set of tags for accessing data, controlling logic, and performing SQL access. See the Sun Tutorial on the Standard Tag Library and the SQL tags . This is a much better approach than embedding scriptlets into your JSP. That said, I would recommend this approach (or scriplets) only be used for prototypes or as a very-temporary fix. With JSTL, you could replace all of the scriptlets with something similar to: select * from fus where tester_num like ? ${row.column1name} ${row.column2name} ${row.column3name}
