CSS Refactoring Best Practice

we are working on a large web application with Rails for quite a while and produced a lot of css for our templates. Stylesheet definitions are organised in a bunch of css files that have grown with the project. As people are not always as disciplined as they should be, it seems to me that a lot of definitions have become deprecated and useless. Is there an (semi-)automatic way to get rid of this stuff? How do you identify useless css in your project?
