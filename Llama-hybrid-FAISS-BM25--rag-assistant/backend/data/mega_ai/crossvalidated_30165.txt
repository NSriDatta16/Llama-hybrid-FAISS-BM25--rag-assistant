One possible pragmatic response is inspired by the motivation behind the logit transformation used in logistic regression. In that situation, the original response is constrained between 0 and 1 and hence treating it as though it has a normal distribution causes all sorts of problems. Part of the response is to transform by log(y/(1-y)), where y is the modelled response. Your problem is comparable, just that the limits are 1 and 5 rather than 0 and 1. If you want to analyse your data using methods motivated by Normal-distribution assumptions (into which I would categorise use of squared errors), you could consider transforming it on to a scale with no upper or lower bounds as below (in R, but the code should make sense if you're not familiar with it; the key line is the one that creates the "z" variable from the original "y"): # generate some skewed data in the [1,5] space: y 5] 5),3.5,5) # transform it similar to logit transform z The new z variable is much more suited for OLS or whatever other similar techniques you might want to try.
