Monitoring application-specific metrics using JMX and Hyperic

My webapp exposes some application-specific metrics (think "orders placed") via JMX, which I'd like to monitor using Hyperic HQ (open source edition). According to the Hyperic Inventory Model , my Linux server is called a Platform hosting my Tomcat 6 Server , which in turn hosts Services (e.g. "Servlet Monitor") that finally expose Metrics (e.g. "Error Count per Minute"). I assume I need to develop a custom Hyperic plugin (just an XML file, really) that would point the agent and server at the correct JMX MBeans. Ideally, I would like to see my webapp listed as a Service hosted by the Tomcat 6 Server, but looking at the Plugin Development docs , that doesn't seem to be possible. Maybe that's not too bad anyway, because in theory, I might want to switch my app to Jetty. But I figure that's a very common use case, so are there any best practices? I couldn't really find any examples of this on the web, so I thought I might just ask the experts.. Please note: The Hyperic docs I linked to seem to require an account to view.
