Getting started with dynamic neural networks

I was wondering if anybody had some good references on dynamic neural networks. The goal is to have a neural network that responds in real-time (and is governed by say a system of DEs) instead of at discrete time-steps. The prototypical application is a robot: we have a series of sensors that are constantly feeding data into the input neurons, and we have output neurons that are constantly telling the motors what to do. We want to optimize this robot to do some tasks. Is there a nice recent survey on dynamic neural nets? In particular one that discusses recurrent DNN, feedforward DNN, and DNN with and without learning. Alternatively, if continuous dynamic neural networks are not the right approach for this sort of task, then suggestions of other types of neural nets are also welcome. Notes I also cross posted this question to MetaOptimize.
