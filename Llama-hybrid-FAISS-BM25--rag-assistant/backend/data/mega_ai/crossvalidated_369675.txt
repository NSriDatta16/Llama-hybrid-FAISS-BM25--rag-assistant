Is there a clustering algorithm that maximizes average silhouette? If not, why not?

The average silhouette index of a clustering of data seems to be used to determine the hyper parameter $k$ (i.e. number of clusters) in clustering algorithms like $k$ -means. Is there an algorithm that instead takes $k$ to be fixed and maximizes the average silhouette index? If there is not then is there an explanation for why this would not be a good algorithm? Is it too hard? OR does it produce bad clusters? I have found this paper: Clustering Categorical Data Using Silhouette Coefficient as a Relocating Measure But I am interested in optimal algorithms or approximations not heuristics.
