It may help to read more about how odds work. A place to start might be: Interpretation of simple predictions to odds ratios in logistic regression . To answer your specific question, $0.99$ is a negative relationship. Every time you increase gestational age by $1$ unit (week?) the odds of having a brain disease is multiplied by $0.99$ . That's less than $1.0$ , so the odds are decreasing. To illustrate, let's imagine the odds of brain disease for babies born at $30$ weeks is $1.0$ . Now, let's see what happens to the odds of brain disease as babies are born later (less early): week odds(BD) [1,] 30 1.0000000 [2,] 31 0.9900000 [3,] 32 0.9801000 [4,] 33 0.9702990 [5,] 34 0.9605960 [6,] 35 0.9509900 [7,] 36 0.9414801 [8,] 37 0.9320653 [9,] 38 0.9227447 [10,] 39 0.9135172 [11,] 40 0.9043821 The odds are in fact decreasing.
