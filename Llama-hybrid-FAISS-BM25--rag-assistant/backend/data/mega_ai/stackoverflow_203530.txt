In Code Complete (p. 411) Steve McConnell gives the following advice (which Bill Gates reads as a bedtime story in the Microsoft commercial). "used in appropriate circumstances, table driven code is simpler than complicated logic, easier to modify, and more efficient." "You can use a table to describe logic that's too dynamic to represent in code." "The table-driven approach is more economical than the previous approach [rote object oriented design]" Using a table based approach you can easily add new "users"(as in the modeling idea of a user/agent along with it's actions). Its a good way to avoid many "if"s. And I've used it before for situations like yours, and it's kept the code nice and tidy.
