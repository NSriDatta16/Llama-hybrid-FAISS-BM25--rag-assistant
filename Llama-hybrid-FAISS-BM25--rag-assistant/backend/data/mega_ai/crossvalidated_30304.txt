The general technique is the 'Rejection Method', where you just reject results that don't meet your constraints. Unless you have some sort of guidance (like MCMC), then you could be generating a lot of cases (depending on your scenario) which are rejected! Where you're looking for something like a mean and standard deviation and you can create a distance metric of some kind to say how far you are away from your goal, you can use optimisation to search for the input variables which give you the desired output values. As an ugly example where we will look for a random uniform vector with length 100 which has mean=0 and standard deviation=1. # simplistic optimisation example # I am looking for a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one # but starting from a plain uniform(0,1) distribution :-) # create a function to optimise fun
