This was what I came up with: req = mechanize.Request("https://www.site.com/path/" + url, " ") req.add_header("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.7) Gecko/20100713 Firefox/3.6.7") req.add_header("Referer", "https://www.site.com/path") cj.add_cookie_header(req) res = mechanize.urlopen(req) Whats interesting is the " " in the call to mechanize.Request forces it into "POST" mode. Obviously the site didn't choke on a single space :) It needed the cookies as well. I debugged the headers using: hh = mechanize.HTTPHandler() hsh = mechanize.HTTPSHandler() hh.set_http_debuglevel(1) hsh.set_http_debuglevel(1) opener = mechanize.build_opener(hh, hsh) logger = logging.getLogger() logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)) logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET) mechanize.install_opener(opener) Against what Firebug was showing.
