105216 is the number of rows of your data ; 2014 : 365 days 2015 : 365 days 2016 : 366 days ( since 29 February) 24 hours each day and 15 minutes for each hour (365+365+366) * 24 * 4 = 105216 data point You can plot the data, and see the seosonality visually (if there exist some) by, plot(m3) or by using some other codes, m3 When it comes to NA values. It probably stems from the method used in calculating the trend.( i.e, in moving average method for detrending the data, you inevitably lose some values from the start and end of your data.)
