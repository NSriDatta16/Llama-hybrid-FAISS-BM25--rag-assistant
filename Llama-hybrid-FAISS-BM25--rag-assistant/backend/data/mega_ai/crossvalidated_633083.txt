Expected deviation between a theoretical discrete probability distribution and the simulated one resulting from a number of trials

Suppose we have seven colors, each associated with a theoretical probability to choose one of them. The probabilities are as follows: red ______ 0.304761904761905 blue _____ 0.304761904761905 yellow ___ 0.304761904761905 green ____ 0.021428571428571 purple ___ 0.021428571428571 cyan _____ 0.021428571428571 magenta __ 0.021428571428571 Question 1 : We run a simulation in which we pick up a random color 10000 times according to the above probability distribution. By measuring how many times we picked up each color, we may deduce a simulated probability distribution. What is the expected deviation between the two probability distributions? Is there a mathematical formula to determine it? Assume for this and the following question that if the deviation per color is dev(c) where c is the color, then the single criterion for the aforementioned deviation would be max(dev(c)). Question 2 : If we want the deviation between the theoretical and simulated probability not to exceed 0.001, how can we determine the number of trials that must be performed? Is there a mathematical formula to determine it?
