Thanks to the information offered by @Mohamed Mansour, I was able to find more details on this issue. The rationale for Chrome's behavior is to prevent a maliciously-crafted page from, through JavaScript and internal frames, accessing the contents of your file system without your knowledge and upload data to the Internet [ Chromium bug 4197 , Chromium bug 47416 ]. It is unfortunate, from my point of view, that the Chromium team chose to take things as far as they did. Gecko is a bit more subtle in whacking this mole: it limits cross-page scripts to same-subdirectories [ Mozilla bug 230606 , Same-origin policy for file protocol ]. The result is much less surprising for users and developers and has generated much, much less angst than has arisen over Chrome's behavior — read Chromium bug 47416 in particular to see what I mean. Because of this behavior, I've had to modify my "website" — which cannot be hosted on the Internet and must reside on local-users' machines — so that it throws up a dialog box telling users to switch browsers. It's really too bad — I'd like to support Chrome but just can't expect my users to relaunch it with an obscure command-line option whenever they want to run my "website." I'm posting my findings here in case anyone else stumbles across my question when Chrome seems to mysteriously not work for them and also to encourage anyone who reads this to consider starring Chromium bug 47416 . The developers have made it painfully clear that they are unwilling to consider changing Chrome's behavior unless it's clear people really care about the issue. Being told "I've had to tell users not to use Chrome" hasn't been enough encouragement.
