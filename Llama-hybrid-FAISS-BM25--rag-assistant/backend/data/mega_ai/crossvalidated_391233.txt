In mixed-effects logistic regression, the fixed coefficients have an interpretation conditional on the random effects. For an explanation of the issue have a look here . Like in your case, I'd say that you want to see the effect of a correct response in test1 in the odds of test2 averaged over the subjects . You can obtain coefficients with a marginal interpretation using the marginal_coefs() function from the GLMMadaptive package. For example, for your data you can try: library("GLMMadaptive") fm Here you don't see any differences because the variance of the random effects is relatively small. The bigger the variance the greater the difference between the two sets of coefficients.
