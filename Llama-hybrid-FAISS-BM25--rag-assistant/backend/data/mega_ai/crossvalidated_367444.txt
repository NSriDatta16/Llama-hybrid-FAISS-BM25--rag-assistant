Similarity is determined by the classifier that is being calibrated. This paragraph is saying that if we run our classifier on a pile of emails, then for all of the emails $x$ that we predict $p(y=\text{SPAM}\mid x)=0.2$ (i.e., emails that our classifier scores similarly), roughly 20% of them should actually be $\text{SPAM}$. It may be helpful to think about calibrated outputs as an interpretation of a classification decision. It doesn't really add information to the decision function, it simply maps it to the interval $[0,1]$ so it can be interpreted as a probability.
