Tree Show toolTip during drag

I am denying a user the ability to drop into my tree during certain conditions, it's all going well, but I want to tell the user why I'm denying the drop. I would prefer to do it with a toolTip, but it doesn't seem to work. Can I not have a toolTip during a drag operation? How can I force one? Flex seems to treat toolTips as a property of the UI component, with the component deciding when and if to show it. I would like it to force it to be like doing one in javaScript where it was always just like saying "Show it now" "stop showing it now" Does anyone know about doing this during drag? Thanks ~Mike
