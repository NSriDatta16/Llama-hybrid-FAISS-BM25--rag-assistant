Plotting average shows (log) linear trend but fitting line has 0 p value

I have some data and I am examining the relationship between two variables. When I form x-bins and take summary statistics of y in those bins, I see the plot below. The black line is the mean of each bin, the blue line is the median of each bin and the ranges are the lower and upper quartiles of the bins. Here is a histogram of all my y values: When I do linear regression with scipy.stats.linregress I get intercept -1.21, slope 1.69, r value .21 and p value 0. I think the slope and intercept sort of check out, but how do I interpret the pvalue of 0?
