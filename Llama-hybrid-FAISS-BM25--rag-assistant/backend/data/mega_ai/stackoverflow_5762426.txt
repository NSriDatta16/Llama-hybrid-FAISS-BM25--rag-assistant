Why not Vim? It most likely comes by default with your distribution and is a lot more powerful than TextMate. I recommend it, even on Mac OS X. Or Emacs. Edit I keep seeing this answer upvoted from time to time so, FWIW, this is the story of my switch from TextMate to Vim: As a long-time BBEdit user, I fell in love with TextMate's elegance and intuitiveness in 2006 and became proficient with it quite quickly. A couple of years later, though, I switched to Linux at home and went on a 10 months-long editor safari, looking for a cross-platform alternative to TextMate. In those 10 months I tried seriously every editor, lightweight IDE or full-blown IDE that worked both on Linux and on Mac OS X with varying success. Too bloated, too light on features, not well integrated in the OS… every editor/IDE I tried had unacceptable flaws. Last on the list were Emacs and Vim, mostly because of their legendary learning curves and their perceived "strangeness". Both editors passed all my tests successfully but Vim ultimately won because of the intuitiveness of its language and the simplicity of its configuration. So… I then spent a few months doing the most pointless thing ever: trying to turn Vim into a TextMate clone. I somehow pulled this off but the result was slow and bloated and all duct-tapped to death. Frustration led me to enlightenment and made "get" Vim which I've been using with much pleasure as my main editor for the last 4+ years.
