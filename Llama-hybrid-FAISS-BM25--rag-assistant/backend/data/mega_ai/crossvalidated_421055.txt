Writing out the estimands may help. With $Y$ as the observed outcome, $A$ is the treatment of interest, $Z$ is the instrument, and $Y^a$ is the potential outcome under treatment plan $A=a$ . For the TOT (or average treatment effect in the treated, ATT), the estimand is $$E[Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} |A=1]$$ For LATE $$E[Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} | A^{z=1} = 1, A^{z=0}=0]$$ From this, we can see that the TOT is estimated in the population all treated ( $A=1$ ) individuals, whereas LATE applies to a subset of the treated individuals in the population. More specifically, LATE applies only to compliers as defined by $Z$
