Empty $_GET despite the URL

$_GET variable shows empty on the URL www.abc.com/ec/basket.php?product_id=1 . This is very surprising as $_GET does show value on a different domain with the same URL on the same server. Of course the code is a copy of the original domain. I am baffled as to why is this happening. Even the first line of the code shows blank $_GET . When I did print_r($_SERVER) on the first line of the page, I get the following response. The first two values are surprising. Array ( [REDIRECT_REDIRECT_REQUEST_METHOD] => GET [REDIRECT_REDIRECT_STATUS] => 404 [REDIRECT_STATUS] => 404 [HTTP_HOST] => www.abc.com [HTTP_CONNECTION] => keep-alive [HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL] => max-age=0 [HTTP_USER_AGENT] => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/534.27 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.712.0 Safari/534.27 [HTTP_ACCEPT] => text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 [HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING] => gzip,deflate,sdch [HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE] => en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6 [HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET] => ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 [HTTP_COOKIE] => [various values] [PATH] => /sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin [SERVER_SIGNATURE] => Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat) Server at www.abc.com Port 80 [SERVER_SOFTWARE] => Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat) [SERVER_NAME] => www.abc.com [SERVER_ADDR] => [IP address] [SERVER_PORT] => 80 [REMOTE_ADDR] => [IP address] [DOCUMENT_ROOT] => /var/www/htdocs [SERVER_ADMIN] => webmaster@abc.com [SCRIPT_FILENAME] => /var/www/htdocs/index.php [REMOTE_PORT] => 39746 [REDIRECT_URL] => /page-not-found.html [GATEWAY_INTERFACE] => CGI/1.1 [SERVER_PROTOCOL] => HTTP/1.1 [REQUEST_METHOD] => GET [QUERY_STRING] => [REQUEST_URI] => /ec/basket.html?product_id=1 [SCRIPT_NAME] => /index.php [PHP_SELF] => /index.php [PHP_AUTH_USER] => [PHP_AUTH_PW] => [REQUEST_TIME] => 1301662577 ) HTTP status on this shows 404 but the page comes up properly. Just that I am not able to get any values in the $_GET variable. Also the $_GET variable works perfectly fine on other pages on the same site. I have been scratching my head on this since hours but cannot find a solution. Any help will be highly appreciated.
