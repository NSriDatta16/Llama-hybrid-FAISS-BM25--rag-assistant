Just another way to do this when the reports (as_dict) are passed as list. This will return the result as a dictionary. def report_average(reports): mean_dict = dict() for label in reports[0].keys(): dictionary = dict() if label in 'accuracy': mean_dict[label] = sum(d[label] for d in reports) / len(reports) continue for key in reports[0][label].keys(): dictionary[key] = sum(d[label][key] for d in reports) / len(reports) mean_dict[label] = dictionary return mean_dict
