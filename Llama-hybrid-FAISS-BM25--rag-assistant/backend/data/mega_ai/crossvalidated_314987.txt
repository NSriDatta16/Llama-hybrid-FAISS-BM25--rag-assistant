Is ISL too basic after having completed a one-semester measure-theoretic statistics course?

I already know a good deal of measure-theoretic statistics from 1 semester-long course. I want to learn machine learning. The "Bible" in this field seems to be Elements of Statistical Learning. I have skimmed a few chapters, and it feels a bit of a tough read for my current level, but I do believe that I could manage to read it, if I put in the effort, and used google to fill in any gaps that may arise. However, I also know there's Introduction to Statistical Learning, which focuses more on applications and R code. This may be a more manageable book to read, but I fear that it's too basic and aimed at people who don't know statistics all that much. So my question is, is ISL too basic of a book for somebody who already knows statistics, and would my time be better spent doing the hard work it'll take to get through ESL? Or should I just quickly get through ISL, and then maybe take on ESL afterwards?
