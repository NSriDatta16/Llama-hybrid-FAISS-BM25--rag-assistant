The "value" is the contribution of a leaf to the logit. The logit for a sample is the sum of the "value" of all of a sample's leafs. Because XGBoost is an ensemble, a sample will terminate in one leaf for each tree; gradient boosted ensembles sum over the predictions of all trees. Then the logit can be used in the ordinary way, such as computing the predicted probability of class membership. More information about gradient boosted trees generally and XGBoost specifically can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754 or xgboost .
