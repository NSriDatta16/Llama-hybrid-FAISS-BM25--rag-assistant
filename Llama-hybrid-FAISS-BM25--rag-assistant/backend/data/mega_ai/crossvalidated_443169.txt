As mentioned in https://kourentzes.com/forecasting/2014/11/09/additive-and-multiplicative-seasonality/ your data looks like possessing Multiplicative seasonality because the amplitude of the seasonal component is dependent on the level of the Time series. However, one good way of figuring it out is to try both additive and multiplicative models and choosing the one having least rmse. This process has the advantage that it can be automated and it gives an answer based on a metric.
