I'd say its elegance is 0 compared to size_t pos = string1.find(string2); The standard library is there for a reason. Use it. Even if you wanted to create strstr , which is a C function and not a C++ function, you really don't need to avoid using strcmp . And even then, implementing strcmp yourself in a separate function is going to make this clearer. On top of that, your static variables make this function only work once. You're doing it wrong. From your wording, it sounds like this may be a homework question? In which case you should add the homework tag, and say exactly what the requirements are.
