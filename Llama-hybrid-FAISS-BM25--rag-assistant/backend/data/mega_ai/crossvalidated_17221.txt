Decision theory is the underlying theory on which statistics operates. The problem is to find a good (in some sense) procedure for producing decisions from data. However, there's rarely an unambiguous choice of procedure, in the sense of minimizing expected loss, so other criteria must be invoked to choose among them. Choosing the procedures that is Bayes with respect to some prior is one of these criteria, but it may not always be what you want. Minimax might be more important in some case, or unbiasedness. Anyone who insists that the frequentists are wrong or the Bayesians or wrong is mostly revealing their ignorance of statistics.
