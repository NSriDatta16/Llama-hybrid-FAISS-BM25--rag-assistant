It looks like SqLite does not support a GUID type natively. It's supported by wrappers and plugins but I think that you're experiencing some impedance between the way the type is used. You are probably better off changing it to a TEXT type. Your predicate will then work. EDIT To create a new GUID value to insert into the row as a pkey just do: Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); In addition I found the following info : GUID is not(!) a native SQLite-datatype, but an addon provided by Robert's wrapper. In the connection string you can specify "BinaryGUID=Yes|No", with Yes as default. When "BinaryGUID=Yes" the GUID is stored taking 16 bytes of storage. Now it depends whether "SQLite Expert" recognises the datatype GUID. If so, you should look at its documentation how it is handled. If not, it is probably treated as text (likely with invalid character data). You will have this trouble again when you change your SQLite editor or wrapper. When "BinaryGUID=No" the GUID is stored as text taking 32-38 bytes (I don't know whether the minus-signs and braces {} are stored, you have to test). When storage is not a large problem, I would recommend to use this form. You then should have no problems with whatsover wrapper or DB editor you use and save a lot of time and trouble. There seems to be an issue with the type itself.
