When using IPW methods for causal inference, why does the robust variance lead to conservative standard errors?

I'm trying to understand a claim that I've seen stated in a few different papers that when using IPW methods as the estimator for a causal estimand, the robust standard errors from the outcome model will be conservative. See the appendix of Cole et al. 2007 for an example of this claim . See option 2 in this answer for an example of this claim on stackexchange . When I've tried to run down the source for this claim, the reference that is cited is: Robins, JM. Marginal Structural Models. in: 1997 Proceedings of the Section on Bayesian Statistical Science. American Statistical Association, 1998: 1-10. From this paper, I can glean the theoretical development of marginal structural models estimated using inverse probability weighting, but it is not clear to me what result justifies the claim that the robust standard errors are conservative. Is there an alternative reference that supports this claim? If not, could some kind soul point out what section of that reference justifies this claim?
