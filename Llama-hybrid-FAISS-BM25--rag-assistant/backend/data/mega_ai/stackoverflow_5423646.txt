How do you get Dropbox shareable links from the API?

We have a web application that uses dropbox as file storage. We have currently run into the issue that shortlinks become inactive after 31 days ( http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=33049 ). Therefore, we are looking for ways to create shareable links instead of shortlinks. However, we can't seem to find this in the API. Also, it appears to use the funcationality to create a shareable link, you first have to visit a specific dropbox URL to enable something ( http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=35225&replies=2#post-303557 ). Would this also need to be done via the API?
