If you only have a small amount of code I don't believe it is worth the effort to split it up. Depending on how much JS you have, consider a build process that can concatenate your separate JavaScript files into one, minified single download. YUI is incredibly modular. They have a 'core' set of includes and then you can supplement these with the widgets you actually use. For instance, I have no interest in using their file uploader widget so never include the JS for it. Cache the JS for a date far in the future. If you need to make a change, append a version stamp to the end of the SRC attribute, i.e. my-code.js?v=91 Use namespaces to avoid polluting the global scope. Again, YUI is very organised in this regard - see the YAHOO.namespace() function.
