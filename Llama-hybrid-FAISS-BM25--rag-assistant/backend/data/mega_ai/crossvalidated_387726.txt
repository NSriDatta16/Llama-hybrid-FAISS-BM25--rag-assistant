Is there an upper bound on number of logistic regression responses that yield infinite estimates

Suppose a logistic regression problem has N observations of {0, 1} and that there are p parameters. Also assume the design matrix, X, is full rank with p 3 and I can't find anything. The problem is related to convex polygon partitioning on the unit sphere in p-dimensional space since the regions where the data can be completely separated are intersections of N p-1 dimensional half spaces. Each half space through the origin is defined by the subspace orthogonal to a row of X...hence there are N of them. What is the maximum number of these convex polygons that can be generated by intersecting N p-1 dimensional half spaces?
