OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library that lots of folks use to base these styles of project off of. There's currently a beta-quality project for running the OpenCV code using the NDK on Android: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Android There are plenty of resources for OpenCV linked to from the wiki and the project page, and it's pretty easy to find samples for OpenCV floating around. But like you said, it's a pretty complex topic overall, and while the framework gives you a leg up on development there will still be plenty to layer in before you even have a working prototype.
