Multiple correlations across subjects

I have a bunch of data where I am recording two variables across time for many subjects: velocity of the right hand, and intensity of the speech. For each of my 20 subjects, I have ~30 recordings of ~1 minute each. So, my data looks like this: I can calculate the correlation between the velocity of the hand and the intensity of the speech for each recording. The thing is, I am not sure about what to do next. It seems like I cannot really "average" this correlations for each subject, and then compare these averages between subjects - or even compute a meta-average between all subjects. How can I get: A correlation coefficient accounting for all the trials of one subject A correlation value that accounts for the variation of correlation across all subjects? Thanks for your help!
