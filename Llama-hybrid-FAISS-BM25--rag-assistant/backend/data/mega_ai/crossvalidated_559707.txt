Finding the standard error of mean for samples of different size

I have a set of data which is the result of a set of questionnaires for different classes. The questionnaires are identical (but they refer to different subjects) Each class has different number of participants. The dataset I have has for each class and question: Mean std no. of participants Regarding the no of participants a few assumptions. not all students in a class answer the questionnaire Also, for simplicity sake assume that the number of students that participate $n_{i,j}$ is much smaller than the total students in each class the number of students that participate is greater than 30 (i.e. $n_{i,j}>30$ ) e.g. Class Question mean std no.Participants $C_1$ $Q_1$ $\mu_{1,1}$ $s_{1,1} $ $n_{1,1}$ $C_1$ $Q_2$ $\mu_{1,2}$ $s_{1,2} $ $n_{1,2}$ ... ... ... ... ... $C_i$ $Q_j$ $\mu_{i,j}$ $s_{i,j} $ $n_{i,j}$ What I want is to calculate the Standard Error of the mean for a specific question. E.e. I want to collect all question ones from all classes and calculate the mean value for $Q_1$ . My guess is that the standard error of the mean for question 1 will be calculated from : $$SE_{q1} = \sqrt{\frac{s_{1,1}^2}{n_{1,1}} + \frac{s_{2,1}^2}{n_{2,1}} +\ldots +\frac{s_{k,1}^2}{n_{k,1}} } = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{s_{i,1}^2}{n_{i,1}}} $$ for question J: $$SE_{qJ} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{s_{i,J}^2}{n_{i,J}}} $$ So the idea is that the expected mean is the weighted average of the means, plus/minus the above standard error (times the critical T-value). ie.: the expected mean value $\bar{x}_{J}$ : $$\bar{x}_{J} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \mu_{i,J}\cdot n_{i,J}}{\sum_{i=1}^k n_{i,J}} $$
