Simply put Betas are used as for smoothing the path to the convergence also providing some momentum to cross a local minima or saddle point. Now how does it affects can be thought of as Beta default value 0.9 just averages the gradient or (square of the gradient) of previous 10 batches which is calculated by 1/(1-0.9) which means it represent how we are coming from last 10 batches down when minimizing the loss. So instead of tuning that you can always tune the batch size it will have almost same impact!
