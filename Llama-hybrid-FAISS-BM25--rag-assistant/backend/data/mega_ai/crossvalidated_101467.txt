How to interpret autocorrelation

I have calculated autocorrelation on time series data on the patterns of movement of a fish based on its positions: X ( x.ts ) and Y ( y.ts ). By using R, I ran the following functions and produced the following plots: acf(x.ts,100) acf(y.ts,100) My question is, how do I interpret these plots? What information is needed to report any sort of pattern? I have been surfing the internet and have yet to find a concise way that effectively explains it. Also, how do you decide the correct amount of lag to use? I used 100, but I am not sure if that is too much.
