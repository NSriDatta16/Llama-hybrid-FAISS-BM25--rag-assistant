It looks like this is the best I can do: ^\s*([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+(?:[^ ]+\s+){3}([^ ]+)\s+[^ ]+\s+([^ ]+)\s+ I collapsed the matches you do not care about, made them not capture, and left off the unneeded trailing matches. If it is important to match everything (e.g. there are other lines that would match this) you can say: ^\s*([^ ]+)\s+([^ ]+)\s+(?:[^ ]+\s+){3}([^ ]+)\s+[^ ]+\s+([^ ]+)(?:\s+[^ ]){4} Note, my changes also change the capture numbers: $1: percent finished $2: size uploaded so far $3: size to upload $4: average upload rate You may be able to get away with this if it supports \S ^\s*(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(?:\S+\s+){3}(\S+)\s+\S+\s+(\S+)\s+ but it does not mean exactly the same thing.
