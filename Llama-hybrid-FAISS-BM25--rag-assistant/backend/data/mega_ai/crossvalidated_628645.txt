You make a valid point about the common practice of taking averages of values that aren't always naturally occurring numbers. Averages are a useful tool for summarizing data and comparing performance in various fields, and they often involve rounding or interpreting values in a meaningful way. In the context of college students and their GPAs, it's true that GPA values typically include decimals, even though individual course grades are usually whole numbers. The GPA system uses weighted averages to provide a more nuanced reflection of a student's overall performance.
