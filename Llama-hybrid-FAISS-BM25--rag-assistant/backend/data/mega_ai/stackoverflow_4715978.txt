rtf file contains strange formatting data preventing field merging

I created an RTF file using Word 2007. I want to insert merge fields that can be parsed and merged with database info at a later stage. The document contained the phrase 'Dear [salutation] [surname] How are you?'. I then edited the [surname] part to say [lastname]. If I now view the rtf source it contains loads of unwanted characters as follows: Dear [salutation] [}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid6575321 last}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid2040086 name}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid2434881 ]}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid2040086 \r\n\par How are you? This means that when I try merging then the [lastname] is too mangled to be found for merging. Does anyone know what's going on here, and how I can prevent Word from embedding all this unwanted stuff? Thanks.
