For your requirements, I would check out the SHA-3 finalists . If you have the AES primitive implemented for encryption, you can reuse that to implement several of the functions relatively simply. Otherwise, I think I would go with Daniel Bernstein's Cubehash . That one looks to have some of that "simple elegance" that you were looking for.
