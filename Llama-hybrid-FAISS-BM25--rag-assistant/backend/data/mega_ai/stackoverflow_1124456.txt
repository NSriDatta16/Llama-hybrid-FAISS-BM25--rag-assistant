How do I write an uploaded file to disk using the Oracle directory alias and BFILE objects?

I have a java webapp which needs to upload files via http and then store them on the server. The files need to be associated with specific records in an Oracle database, so there will be a table in the database storing the reference to the associated record, and a reference to the file, along with other descriptive data such as title etc. The options for this table appear to be: store the file as a BLOB store a BFILE reference to the file store a String containing the path to the file We would prefer to store the file outside of the database, so we will not store it as a BLOB. The DBAs have indicated that their preferred option is to store the reference as a BFILE. The oracle.sql.BFILE object provides access to an InputStream for reading the file, but no obvious way of writing to it. What is the best way of writing the file data back to disk when the only reference to the storage directory is the Oracle directory alias? We decided that simple java.io was the best way to write to the file, which means that the storage directory has to be available to the web application servers as a mount. Since the directory was available to the webapp anyway, we then decided that the BFILE was not required and just to store the filename in the database instead.
