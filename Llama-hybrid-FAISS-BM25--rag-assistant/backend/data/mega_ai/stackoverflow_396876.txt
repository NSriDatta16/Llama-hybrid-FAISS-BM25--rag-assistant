From your example, it seems to me you want to use a static method. class mystuff: @staticmethod def average(a,b,c): #get the average of three numbers result=a+b+c result=result/3 return result print mystuff.average(9,18,27) Please note that an heavy usage of static methods in python is usually a symptom of some bad smell - if you really need functions, then declare them directly on module level.
