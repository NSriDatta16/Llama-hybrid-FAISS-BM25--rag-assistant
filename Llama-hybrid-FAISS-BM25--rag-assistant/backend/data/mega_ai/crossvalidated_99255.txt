getting from Edgeworth expansions to Cornish Fisher Expansions

I am currently trying to work out how to get from the Edgeworth expansion to the Cornish-Fisher expansion. I use van-der-Vaarts "Asymptotics Statistics" and Hall's book on Edgeworth expansions and the bootstrap. Unfortunately neither help much to get the details right (vdVaart p 338). tldr: Edgeworth expansions can be inverted to get Cornish Fisher expansions - but how? The paragraph im having trouble with is the following Let $\Phi, \phi$ be the normal cdf, pdf, $p_1$ a polynomial, $z_\alpha, \hat{\xi}_{n,\alpha}$ the normal and bootstrap upper $\alpha$ Quantiles. The book states that $$ 1-\alpha = \Phi(\hat{\xi}_{n,\alpha})+\frac{p_1(\hat{\xi}_{n,\alpha}\mid\hat{P}_n)\phi(\hat{\xi}_{n,\alpha})}{\sqrt n} + O_P(n^{-1}) $$ can be somehow inverted to obtain $$ \hat{\xi}_{n,\alpha}=z_\alpha-\frac{p_1(z\alpha \mid P)}{\sqrt n}+ O_P(n^{-1}) $$ apparently by Taylor expanding $\Phi, \phi$ and $p_1$ around $z_\alpha$ I guess it all makes sense and I can accept that it is possible, but I'd like to see formal justification.
