How to make Nokogiri transparently return un/encoded Html entities untouched?

How can I use Nokogiri with having html entities (like German umlauts) untouched? I.e.: # this is fine node = Nokogiri::HTML.fragment(' &ouml; ') node.to_s # => ' &ouml; ' # this is not node = Nokogiri::HTML.fragment(' รถ ') node.to_s # => ' &ouml; ' # this is what I need node = Nokogiri::HTML.fragment(' รถ ') node.to_s # => ' รถ ' I've tried to mess with both PARSE_OPTIONS and :save_with options but could not come up with a way to have Nokogiri just transparently behave like above. Any pointers?
