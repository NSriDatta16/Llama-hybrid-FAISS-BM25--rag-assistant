Contrast for logistic regression using rms

I am conducting a logistic regression with an interaction term involving two categorical variables. One variable (variable a) has 7 values and the other has 3 (variable b). I want to run a contrast and jointly test for differences in variable b at each value of variable a. In other words I want to run 7 separate contrast. I am using the contrast function in rms. I can't quite understand what the contrast is testing when I provide only one list to the function E.g. contrast(fit = model1, a = list(variableA = "one", variableB=c("one", "two"', "three"), type = "joint"). I have read the documentation but any help interpreting would be most appreciated.
