You're heading in the right direction, but (as with most things Magento), there are a couple of options. The most important principle here is that the architecture of the modifications must not lead to the situation where upgrades/patches on the core are compromised. What's interesting about that is that Magento has moved away from the highly extensible and upgrade-safe (mostly) EAV model for Mage_Sales_Model_Order (and related objects) in the current release. That makes it more difficult to add attributes in a upgrade-safe manner, IMHO. I would recommend that you use the Observer system to add your new attribute values, but into a related Model. That is, rather than adding the attribute into the Order model itself, create a model that holds an order_id and your custom attributes. Hook into the appropriate event (probably sales_convert_quote_to_order for all Orders or checkout_type_onepage_save_order_after for frontend orders) and examine the Quote Items to set the values in your custom Model. When you execute your process to transmit orders to the fulfilment house, you can lookup the custom attributes via the order_id .
