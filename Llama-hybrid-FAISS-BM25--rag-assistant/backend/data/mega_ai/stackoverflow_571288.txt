If at all possible I'd try and do it all in SQL Server. You can create a linked server to your other database server. Then simply use T-SQL to copy the data across - it would look something like... INSERT INTO new_server_table (field1, field2) SELECT x, y FROM mylinkedserver.myolddatabase.myoldtable If you need to do this on a regular basis or clear out the data first you can do this as part of a scheduled task using the SQL Agent.
