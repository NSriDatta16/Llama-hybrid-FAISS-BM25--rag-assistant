Tracking Versions, Builds, Revisions, with TortiseSVN

I am the sole developer on a project and have been using tortoiseSVN for quite a while. Now Id like to start getting version information working correctly in the project I.E. show Major Version, Minor Version, Update, Build/Revision in the log files and in Help > About etc... I cant seem to find the best fit. svn keywords Revision seemed like a good idea but the information it inserts into files is not in a friendly format for updating resources. $rev$ is expanded to $Revision: 72 $ on the other hand subwcrev nearly makes it but I cant get it to write the correct revision to the version file. In other words if I run subwcrev c:\myproject c:\myproject\version.in c:\myproject\version.h it will write the current revision (72) correctly but if I then commit (now revision 73) and check out that revision at a later stage the actual revison in the project will be 72. Am I taking a wrong approach to this? Should I take a different approach and just use an auto incrementing build number in Visual Studio? What do you do in your organization?
