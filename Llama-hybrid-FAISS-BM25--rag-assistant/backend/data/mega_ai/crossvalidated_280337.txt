Percentage difference of percentages

Basic question - we have data representing the average performance of two sets of hospitals on a quality measure. The denominator for each set is different. Is it acceptable to calculate percentage difference between one average and another? I was always under the impression that such a measure is misleading and you would need the raw data (numerator and denominator) that were used to calculate the average performance.
