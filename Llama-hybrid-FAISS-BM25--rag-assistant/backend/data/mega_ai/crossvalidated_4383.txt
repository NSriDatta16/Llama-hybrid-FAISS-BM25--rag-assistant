Can one validly reduce the numbers of items in a published Likert-scale?

[edits made in response to feedback- thanks :-) ] Doh! More edits! Sorry! Hello- I am doing some rather rough and ready data collection with a survey sent out to healthcare staff using a published scale about morale and other such issues. The only thing is that the scale is rather long with all the other things in the survey and I would like to reduce its size by cutting each subscale in half and only using half the items. My intuition is that this is fine, since the subscales are inter-correlated, and while it's not ideal for publication-standard research, it's okay just for a bit of intra-organisational fact finding. I wondered if anyone had any thoughts on the validity of doing this, pitfalls, or anything else. References particularly are gratefully received because my colleagues will need some convincing! Many thanks, Chris B edits- Yes it is a validated scale with known psychometric properties. It's unidimensional and it has subscales, if that's the right way to put it. I'll be working at the subscale and total, not the item, level. 30 items, probably about 40-60 individuals. Cheers!
