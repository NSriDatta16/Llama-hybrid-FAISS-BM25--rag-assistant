How to spread tempdb over multiple files?

This blog http://blogs.msdn.com/sqlserverstorageengine/archive/2009/01/04/managing-tempdb-in-sql-server-tempdb-configuration.aspx states that it is a good idea to "Spread TempDB across at least as many equal sized files as there are COREs or CPUs." So my basic question is how do i actually configure my SQL server to do that. So I right click the tempdb, choose properties, files and then add a file for each CPU? How does it know that it should spread the tempdb across these files? is there a flag I should set? Have I misunderstood the article?
