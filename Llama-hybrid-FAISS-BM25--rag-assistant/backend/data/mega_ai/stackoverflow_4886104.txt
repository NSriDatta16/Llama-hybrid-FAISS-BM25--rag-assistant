In my company I implement Josso with this kind of architecture. We have may be 5 servers with more or less 10 applications and the authentication is entirely managed with JOSSO. Most of our applications use ASP MVC .Net, so I had to write an agent (embedded in the client application) for this, because Josso doesn't provides ones. But the central JOSSO gateway runs as a tomcat servlet on an independant server. So, yes it supports this kind oif architecture. We use josso 1.8 for two years now, and then I tweak it to fit some requirements. We didn't upgrade to josso 2 because I don't think they is any new extradinary new features. It exists other open source, have a look at CAS: http://www.jasig.org/cas which is really close to josso implementation, but may be better.
