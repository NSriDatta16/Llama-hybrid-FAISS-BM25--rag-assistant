How to efficiently cache dynamic content in asp.net mvc?

" Blogging on App Engine, part 1: Static serving " describes how to properly handle dynamic content caching when using python with GAE. It covers DownStream caching, conditional GETs, 404 responses, Etags... I haven't found anything as comprehensive related to a targeted asp.net mvc implementation. What would be the most elegant/readable/maintainable way to implement this when targeting asp.net mvc platform ? EDIT: " Enabling Client-Side Caching of Generated Content in ASP.NET " provides one with some interesting insight about the subject.
