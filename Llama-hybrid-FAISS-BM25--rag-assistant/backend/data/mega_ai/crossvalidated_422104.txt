What is the difference between lasso and WOE encoding in logistic regression?

I know lasso is one of the best method to select important variables and make variables sparse. But WOE encoding does the same thing, making variable smooth. I would like to know what is the difference between lasso and WOE in result of logistic model? If I have used WOE encoding, when I train the logistic model, can I use lasso?
