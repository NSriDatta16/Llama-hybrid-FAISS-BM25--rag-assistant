Extract Data from XML into C# object using LINQ to XML, Enums

I am trying to extract data from XML file and save it my C# class/object. My problem is I have an XMl file like this > I have an enum like this public enum typesectionEnum { [Description("Subject Section")] subjectSection, [Description("Vehicle Section")] vehicleSection, [Description("Possible Related Section")] possibleRelatedSection, [Description("Agent (Summary) Section")] AgentSection } I am trying to extract data from the XML file and save to my C# class/object. List = ( from d in query.Descendants(xmlns + "claim") select new Claim { id = d.Attribute("id").value, type = ???? } ).ToList (), What I am wondering is, I want to set the value in my application that will access the value in the xml file.
