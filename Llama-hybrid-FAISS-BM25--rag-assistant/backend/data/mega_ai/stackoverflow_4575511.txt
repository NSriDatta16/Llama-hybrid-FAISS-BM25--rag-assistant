Note: Don't fall into the same trap I did. There is also a function called SIM in Simulink that will likely show up in searches for the function SIM in the Neural Network Toolbox ... The first thing I would check is that the second input argument A{1,1} is of the correct form. Specifically, A{1,1} would have to be a cell array or a matrix of doubles . If it is of any other form, like a structure or a matrix of any other class , you will get the error you are seeing. Admittedly, this particular error isn't handled very well by the subfunction simargs , in that it gives you some cryptic messages that don't really tell you the basic problem, which is that your input is not in the right format. Here are a couple things to check: Do you really mean to pass the first element of cell array A as an input argument, or do you mean to simply pass the cell array itself? If it's the second option, just do this: y = sim(net,A); If you do mean to pass the first element of A as an input argument, double-check it's class using the function CLASS : class(A{1,1}) If you don't see double displayed, it means the first element of A is not the right type. If it is a matrix, you can convert it to double before you pass it to SIM like so: y = sim(net,double(A{1,1}));
