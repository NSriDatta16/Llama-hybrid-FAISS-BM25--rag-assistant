The Differences between Randomized Logistic Regression and Plain-Vanilla Logistic Regression

I would like to know the differences between Randomized Logistic Regression (RLR) and plain Logistic Regression (LR), therefore, I am reading a paper "Stability Selection" by Meinshausen, et al. ; however I do not understand what RLR is and what the differences between RLR and LR are. Could someone point out what I should read to understand RLR? Or is there a simple example to start with?
