say we have active directory installed with domain TestDomain.com and you have a OU ( Organization Unit ) called USERS and you have a user in it called TestUser so we can saye the following ldapDomain : the fully qualified domain as TestDomain.com or dc=contoso,dc=com objectPath : the fully qualified path to the object: CN=TestUser, OU=USERS, DC=TestDomain, DC=com userDn : the distinguishedName of the user: CN=TestUser, OU=USERS, DC=TestDomain, DC=com in creating user you should determine where you want to create by determining its path ( ldap path ) In our sample we can consider it as below : string ldapPath = "LDAP://OU=USERS, DC=TestDomain, DC=com" For more information check the following links : http://www.selfadsi.org/ldap-path.htm http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=101405&seqNum=7 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.directoryservices.directoryentry.path.aspx
