You definitely want to look at NIST's Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures . It's got the traveling salesman problem , the Byzantine generals problem , the dining philosophers' problem , the knapsack problem (= your "bin packing problem", I think), the cutting stock problem , the eight queens problem , the knight's tour problem , the busy beaver problem , the halting problem , etc. etc. It doesn't have the firing squad synchronization problem (I'm surprised about that omission) or the Jeep problem (more logistics than computer science). Interestingly enough there's a blog on codinghorror.com which talks about some of these in puzzle form. (I can't remember whether I've read Smullyan's book cited in the blog, but he is a good compiler of puzzles & philosophical musings. Martin Gardner and Douglas Hofstadter and H.E. Dudeney are others.) Also maybe check out the Stony Brook Algorithm Repository . (Or look up "combinatorial problems" on google, or search for "problem" in Wolfram Mathworld or look at Hilbert's problems , but in all these links many of them are more pure-mathematics than computer science.)
