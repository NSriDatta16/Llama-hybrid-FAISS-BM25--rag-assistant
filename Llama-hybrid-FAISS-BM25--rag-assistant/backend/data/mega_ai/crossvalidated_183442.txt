If you think all the labels are more or less equally sized (have roughly the same number of instances), use any. If you think there are labels with more instances than others and if you want to bias your metric towards the most populated ones, use micromedia . If you think there are labels with more instances than others and if you want to bias your metric toward the least populated ones (or at least you don't want to bias toward the most populated ones), use macromedia . If the micromedia result is significantly lower than the macromedia one, it means that you have some gross misclassification in the most populated labels, whereas your smaller labels are probably correctly classified. If the macromedia result is significantly lower than the micromedia one, it means your smaller labels are poorly classified, whereas your larger ones are probably correctly classified. If you're not sure what to do, carry on with the comparisons on both micro- and macroaverage :) This is a good paper on the subject.
