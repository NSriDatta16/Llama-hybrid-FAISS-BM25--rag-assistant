What's the point in neural networks for multivariate regression?

Do you have any case in which fitting a multivariate regression (so having multiple output nodes) outperforms the fitting of a single output one at a time in terms of accuracy ? I ask this because there is not, as I see it, a sharing of information between output nodes, as could be the case in a linear multivariate regression where residuals of different responses can be correlated: $Y_{i1} = X_i \beta_1 + \epsilon_{i1}$ $Y_{i2} = X_i \beta_2 + \epsilon_{i2}$ $E[\epsilon_{i1}]= E[\epsilon_{i2}] = 0$, $Cov(\epsilon_{i1},\epsilon_{j2})=0$ for $i \neq j$, $Cov(\epsilon_{i1},\epsilon_{j2})= \sigma_{ij}$ for $i = j$ . In this simple (bivariate) case if $|\sigma_{ij}| \approx 1$ then I may expect that a very high value of $Y_1$ (relatively to its expected value given by $X \beta_1$) will result in a corresponding high value of $Y_2$ (relatively to its expected value $X \beta_2$ ). This is something that I don't find in a neural network context, since nodes are no random variables, rather deterministic.
