My instinct tells me it is the former as the straight line plot on excel has a non-zero intercept This may be due to regression attenuation, see the following example where we generated $[A] = [B] \sim U(1,2)$ then add gamma distributed noise. The image below shows that this results in a symmetrical situation, but the fitted line is not. (see also Effect of switching response and explanatory variable in simple linear regression ) set.seed(1) n = 100 u = runif(n,1,2) x = rgamma(n,20,20/u) y = rgamma(n,20,20/u) plot(x,y, xlim = c(0,3),ylim=c(0,3)) mod = lm(y~x) lines(c(-1,4), mod $coefficients[1]+ mod$ coefficients[2]*c(-1,4), lty = 2) mean(y/x) ## result: 1.045009 The alternative, using values $y/x$ , is not perfect either as this may have bias as well (there are some formula's to reduce this). In the example above the mean of $y/x$ is approximately $1.045$ Below we see a histogram for a thousand repetitions of the above simulation and it shows that the mean is on average around 1.05 instead of the true value 1.00 A simple alternative can be the use of the average of y and the average of x such that you estimate the reaction ratio as $\hat{r} = \bar{x}/\bar{y}$ .
