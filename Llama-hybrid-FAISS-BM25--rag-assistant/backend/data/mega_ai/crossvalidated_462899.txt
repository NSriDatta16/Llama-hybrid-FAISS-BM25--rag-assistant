Logistic regression for compositional data

I am looking at dimensions of LIWC-Data (Linguistic Inquiry and Wourd Count), which, according to the authors, gives out values for word-categories such as "positive emotion", "health-related" or "swear words" as percentages of the whole text. I want to compare the relationship of only one such compositional variable (e.g. "positive emotion") with a continuous dependant variable to the correlation between a non-compositional explanatory variable with the same dependant variable. As dependant variable, I am using a continuous variable with range 1-7. As for my understanding, even if I am only interested in a subset of those LIWC-dimensions, I am dealing with compositional data, which cannot be analysed properly through regular correlation. As an alternative, is it reasonable to split the dependant variable into a binary and predict it with logistic regression? Thanks for any expertise and insights, links to papers are also highly appreciated.
