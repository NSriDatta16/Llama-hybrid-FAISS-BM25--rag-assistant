When the mouse button is held down, why do SimpleButtons stop detecting over state?

I was hoping to gain some insight as to why Flash acts in a particular way. Here is the scenario: if you... 1) add a SimpleButton to the stage and view the SWF 2) then press and hold the mouse button down OUTSIDE of the button's boundaries 3) then drag the cursor over the SimpleButton while still holding down the mouse button... ...Then the SimpleButton on the stage does not detect the mouseover and display its 'over' state. It just stays in its idle state. Why is this? And is there a way to enable the SimpleButton to display its over state while the mouse button is being held down and then the cursor brought on top of the button (as described above)? That's the abstract, and if you are at all curious (this won't elaborate on the question, but maybe help you visualize a practical scenario) what's motivating the question, it is an application I'm building. In this app, the user is able to drag video thumbnails in order to rearrange their order. When a user begins dragging a video clip, a visual indicator is activated so the user knows where the clip will be placed when the user releases the mouse button (e.g. the clip was in position 1, and the user drags it between clips 4 and 5. A visual indicator--a SimpleButton--would, ideally, show the user that it will be dropped between clips 4 and 5 if the user releases the mouse button). Thanks for the insight!
