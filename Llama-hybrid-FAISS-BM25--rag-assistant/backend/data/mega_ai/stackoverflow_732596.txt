A lot of writes,but few reads - what Mysql storage engine to use?

I was wondering if anyone has a suggestion for what kind of storage engine to use. The programs needs to perform a lot of writes to database but very few reads. [edit] No foreign keys necessary. The data is simple, but it needs to preform the writes very fast.
