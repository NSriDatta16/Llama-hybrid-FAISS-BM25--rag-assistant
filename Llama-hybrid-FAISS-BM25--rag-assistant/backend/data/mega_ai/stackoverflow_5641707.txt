If I just define my ID column as IsPrimaryKey = true and IsDbGenerated = true , everything works just fine: [ColumnAttribute(Storage="_ID", AutoSync=AutoSync.OnInsert, DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsPrimaryKey=true, IsDbGenerated=true)] public int ID {....} Then, in code - when I create a new entity, I just assign the entity an arbitrary ID - I typically tend to use negative numbers: MyEntity entity = new MyEntity { ID = -55 }; MyContext.MyEntities.InsertOnSubmit(entity); MyContext.CommitChanges(); After the call to .CommitChanges() , the new entities are stored in the database table, and the actual, real ID values ( INT IDENTITY ) are being set and reflected on my entity object - i.e. after the call, I get back the real ID that the database has given my new entity. So my question is: where is your problem then?? It seems to work just fine....
