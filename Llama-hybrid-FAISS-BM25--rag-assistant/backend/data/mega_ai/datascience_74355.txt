Formulate multivariate multistep time series forcasting using traditional machine learning, NOT deep learning

How do you represent multivariate multistep data using traditional machine learning? I know this seems like a tailored problem for RNN/LSTM, but I am wondering what the alternative machine learning solution would be. Ex. time, feature_1, feature_2, feature_3 1 25 150 0.7 2 25.3 147 1.1 3 25.5 145 0.8 ... 10 26.7 165 1.2 Now I want to predict feature_1 at time 10 using the first 3 time steps of all features, and get a dataset like this feature_1, feature_2, feature_3, target [25,25.3,25.5] [150,147,145] [0.7,1.1,0.8] 26.7
