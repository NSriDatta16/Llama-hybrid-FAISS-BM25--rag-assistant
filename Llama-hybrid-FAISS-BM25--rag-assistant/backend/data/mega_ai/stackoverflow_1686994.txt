Weighted average of angles

I want to calculate the weighted mean of a set of angles. In this Question , there's an answer how to calculate the mean as shown in this page . Now I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the weighted average. That is, for each angle there is a weight (the weights sum up to 1) 0.25, 0 degrees 0.5, 20 degrees 0.25, 90 degrees The weighted avg should (if I didn't make a mistake) be 32 degrees.
