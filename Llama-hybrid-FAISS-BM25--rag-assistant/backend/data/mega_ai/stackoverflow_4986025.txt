How does the appengine datastore (java - JDO) store and return data, i.e. is it FIFO or LIFO? If its FIFO or NEITHER, how can I make it LIFO?

I was just wondering if I store some data chronologically, will it be returned back in the order of most-recent to least-recent OR least-recent to most-recent? For e.g. If I input data in the following order: A[1], B[2], ... , if I do a simple select query of the table, will it return the list as {A, B, ...} or {..., B, A} ? Assume that I haven't set any indexes i.e. indexing is automatically set by appengine. A critical part of my system's design depends on this information, so I want to confirm this information before I proceed. Any help will be highly appreciated. I need the data retrieval to be in LIFO format, how can I ensure this? FIFO - first in first out LIFO - last in first out
