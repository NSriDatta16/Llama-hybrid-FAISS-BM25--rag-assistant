Is there a way to cause that generated code to have import statements? That would prevent you from having to have the fully-qualified name of the class. So, if you could add: import org.apache.axis.client.Call; to the file then your method call would just be: _call.setProperty(Call.SEND_TYPE_ATTR, Boolean.FALSE); I'm not sure if Axis has an option for that though. If not I'd say renaming the variable (maybe to "organization") would be the best thing. I would recommend avoiding manual edits of auto-generated files, as that makes regenerating them harder.
