How do I code my ASP.NET page to parallelize downloads across hostnames?

Google Page Speed test tells me I need to distribute my queries across DNS Domain names to speed up rendering. Since I do development offline, I'd like to find a solution that will distribute my static content (img, CSS, js) across different hostnames, and will still work when I'm offline in an airplane. Q: How can I code my page to use relative paths (or local host) when offline, and to consistently send static content requests among 5 hosts? After reading this I'd like the url to be similar to this: When Online: Dynamic content www.TLSAdmin.com When Online: Static content static1.TLSAdmin-Static.com static2.TLSAdmin-Static.com static3.TLSAdmin-Static.com static4.TLSAdmin-Static.com When Offline: All content localhost I'd prefer to make it so that the referred to hostname will be consistent after a page refresh to leverage browser caching. So a random guid.TLSAdmin.com will not be a good idea.
