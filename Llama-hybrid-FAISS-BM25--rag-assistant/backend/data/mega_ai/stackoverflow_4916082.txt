There's a list of the various extensions within the " Installation of extensions on Windows " section of the PHP manual that provides some additional clues, but here's what I believe each of these DLLs are for: Unicode - icudt38.dll, icuin38.dll, icuio38.dll, icule38.dll, iculx38.dll, icutest.dll, icutu38.dll, icuuc38.dll OpenSSL - libeay32.dll, ssleay32.dll Spell checking abstraction layer - libenchant.dll, libenchant_ispell.dll, libenchant_myspell.dll PostgreSQL - libpq.dll Cyrus SASL (LDAP, etc.) - libsasl.dll For use when embedding PHP5 - php5embed.lib
