Yes, the analyses which you have asked for, can be done in R. The technique is called time series analysis. So, I would answer your questions, by taking them one after one: 1. given a client and a time frame, what's their behaviour? Yes, the behaviour of a client, with respect to time, can be analyzed in R; by converting the data into a time series data and doing the relevant exploratory analyses like exploring trends, seasonalities, outlier behaviour, etc. 2. Do they do regular purchases (1st type above), or do they make big orders less frequently (2nd type above)? Plotting the above time series data would help you answer questions like these. If you want to compare clients, then overlapping both their time series curves would help you understand their behaviour with respect to each other. 3. If it is the second type, what is the frequency of the peaks? is it regular or random? Yes, one can write functions like these for getting the frequencies of time series data, and as you are talking about peaks, I would also suggest you to do an outlier analysis too. Finally, knowledge of auto-correlation, and thus about the ACF, PCF curves for identifying noise would also be very helpful.
