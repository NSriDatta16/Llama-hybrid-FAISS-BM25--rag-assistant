doctests are great for some uses working and up to date documentation sample tests embeded in docstrings spikes or design phases when classes API is not really clear unit tests are better in differents cases: when you need clear and somewhat complex setup/teardown when trying to get better coverage of all cases, inclusinf corner cases for keeping tests independant from each other In other words, at least for my own use, doctests are great when you focus on explaining what you are doing (docs, but also design phases) but more of a burden when you intent to use tests as a seat belt for refactoring or code coverage.
