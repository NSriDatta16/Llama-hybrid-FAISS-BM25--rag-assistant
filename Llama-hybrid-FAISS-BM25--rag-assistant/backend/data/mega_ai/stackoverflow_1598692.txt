with inside CSS column are not wrapping properly

Lalalal, I am going insane with the CSS... I can't achieve the simplest layout here, something is breaking. I want 2 columns next to each other: [**** 300px ****][******** 500 px ********] 2nd column heading Some text.. - 1st bullet point text - 2nd bullet... - 3rd... ------------------------- I have these divs: Video/screenshot coming soon.. Q: How to add an item to a group? Place your finger on one of the four icons at the bottom toolbar. Move your finger with the icon to drag it to the group to which you wish to add the item. Release your finger. Enter the price, adjust the quantity if needed, and press the 'return' button. And the CSS: .faq_item strong { display:block; margin-bottom: 10px; } .faq_item span { display: block; } .faq_item { margin:0 0 30px 50px; } .faq_item div { display:inline-block; } .faq_link { width:300px; } div.faq_item hr { width:500px; float:right; clear:left; } My problem is that 1st div inside sits on top of the 2nd div when the code is at it is now. Once I eliminate the longest "li" tags, the whole div aligns properly (2 divs inside are next to each other). I don't understand why don't "li" wraps as it should normally and with 2 divs as inline-block they should be next to each other and not stacked vertically. Please advise. Thank you!
