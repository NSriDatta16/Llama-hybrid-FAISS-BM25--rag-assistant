Analytic prediction intervals for time series usually ignore the uncertainty in the parameter estimation. If you simulate using only the uncertainty due to the noise process, you should get equivalent results (apart from the randomness due to simulations of course). If you are simulating the parameters, make sure you take account of the correlation between the parameter estimates as they can be highly correlated and that makes a big difference to the results.
