For HTML Validation done from PHP, the tidy extension might do just what you want : Tidy is a binding for the Tidy HTML clean and repair utility which allows you to not only clean and otherwise manipulate HTML documents, but also traverse the document tree The example given on the tidy::__construct is like this : $html = title paragraph text HTML; $tidy = new tidy(); $tidy->ParseString($html); $tidy->CleanRepair(); if ($tidy->errorBuffer) { var_dump($tidy->errorBuffer); } And gives this output : string 'line 8 column 14 - Error: is not recognized! line 8 column 14 - Warning: discarding unexpected ' (length=104) A couple or other methods seem interesting too, btw ;-) Note you need to have this extension installed / enabled on your webserver, though -- there should be a "tidy" section in the output of phpinfo() .
