t for series and other production rights with the Broke and Bones company by July 2020, although rights for Black Mirror still remained with Endemol. According to Variety, this left Brooker and Jones unable to produce additional series unless new agreements were put in place. In a May 2020 interview with Radio Times, Brooker questioned whether the public mood would suit a sixth series of Black Mirror and said that he had been working on more comedic projects. A sixth series was announced by Netflix in May 2022, to consist of more than three episodes. The series was produced by Broke and Bones, rather than House of Tomorrow. However, House of Tomorrow's new owners Banijay retained ownership of the programme. Brooker started writing the sixth series with the idea to "refresh" or "reset" what Black Mirror was about. He stated that many new dystopian sci-fi programmes had emerged since its 2011 debut, and he now wished to focus on horror and settings in the past. He said that Black Mirror should continually reinvent itself and display standalone stories; he began the series by "deliberately upending" his "core assumptions" about the programme. Some episodes contain elements he had "previously sworn blind" he would avoid. The idea was to prevent Black Mirror being "the show about consciousness being uploaded into a little disc". He began with "Demon 79", a horror story set in the past without technology as a theme. Filming took place in mid-2022. The first teaser trailer was released on 26 April 2023, announcing a June release date; the five episode titles followed in May. The series was released on 15 June 2023. "Joan Is Awful" follows Annie Murphy's character Joan as a Streamberry programme is made about her life using computer-generated imagery (CGI) and starring Salma Hayek as Joan; "Loch Henry" explores true crime, as Samuel Blenkin's Davis and Myha'la Herrold's Pia make a documentary about a serial killer in Scotland. Set in 1969, "Beyond the Sea" is about the isolation of the astronauts Cliff (Aaron Paul) and David (Josh Hartnett), despite their ability to inhabit artificial replicas on Earth. "Mazey Day" follows a paparazza (Zazie Beetz) in 2006 as the title character Mazey (Clara Rugaard) transforms into a werewolf. "Demon 79" sees Nida (Anjana Vasan) unleashing a demon named Gaap (Paapa Essiedu) who encourages her to kill three humans. Series 7 A seventh series was announced in November 2023. In March 2024, it was announced that one of its six episodes would be a sequel to "USS Callister"â€”marking the first Black Mirror story to receive a continuation. Immediately following its release in 2017, the director Toby Haynes had expressed interest in a television series spin-off, and Brooker and Jones did not rule out a sequel. On 19 September 2024, Awkwafina, Issa Rae, Paul Giamatti, Billy Magnussen and Tracee Ellis Ross were announced to have joined the cast of series 7, with Magnussen reprising his role from the fourth series' "USS Callister". Additional cast include Rashida Jones, Chris O'Dowd, Siena Kelly, Rosy McEwen, Emma Corrin, Peter Capaldi, Lewis Gribben, and Patsy Ferran, as well as Poulter, Chaudhry, Milioti, Simpson, and Plemons reprising their roles from previous series. The series was released on 10 April 2025. Following Series 7's release, both Brooker and Jones announced they were leaving Broke & Bones in July 2025, which according to Deadline Hollywood, was the conclusion of their five-year contract with Netflix in 2020, and which would give them freedom to develop series for other media outlets. The rights of Black Mirror would stay with Netflix, and Brooker said that he would still want to further write for Black Mirror. Suggested spin-offs Several sequel episodes or spin-offs have been suggested. In 2013, Robert Downey Jr. optioned the episode "The Entire History of You" to potentially be made into a film by Warner Bros. and his production company Team Downey; in 2018, the episode's writer Jesse Armstrong s
