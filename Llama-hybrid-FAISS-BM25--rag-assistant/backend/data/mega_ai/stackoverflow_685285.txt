Change Location Folder?

I have just few days to show a demo about a Music Player in WPF and i have a trouble that i can not work out right now . I need know how change a location folder meantime the Music Player is running ,i have 3 location folder: D/: Morning; D/: Afternoon; D/: Night; in each folder there are songs of different genre. This music player will be used everyday from the 8am to 10pm with no stop ,so when run the application in morning(8am) it will download automatically the folder"Morning" but when the timeOfDay is Midday it will change location folder and so pass in the folder"Afternoon"(about 6p would pass to the folder "Night") and at the point i get stuck i don't know how work out this step,i don't know how organise my code to make the Music Player change location folder and download new songs in automatic way. Please do you have some idea to illuminate my mind and go on to finish this Demo? Sorry for my confusion; Thanks a lot
