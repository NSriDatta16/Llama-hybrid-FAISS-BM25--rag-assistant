Regarding the case of spam vs ham, you are right that the spam category has common features (words), whereas the ham category could have multiple sub-categories, each with distinct feature sets. However, these distinct features can also be used to label an instance as "ham". Eg: If spam messages don't usually talk about sports scores, then the occurrence of the word "score", could be used to classify a message as "ham", even when it co-occurs with typical spam words such as "ad", "offer", etc. However, the one-class classifier cannot make use of such a mechanism. In a similar manner, specific features will help to identify a news article as belonging to "sports", "religion", etc, thereby making them easier to label as "non-political". The miscellaneous class would be more diverse, however. One-class SVMs are useful in cases where you want to detect novel instances, the kind of which you have not seen before, and hence cannot characterize in advance. Binary classification can be used when the understanding is that the available labeled dataset covers the typical kind of examples you would see while using the model for prediction.
