Here's an excerpt from the Troubleshooting section of an MSDN article on reg-free COM. As in Eugene's answer it suggests looking at the event log in Windows Server (maybe with Virtual PC ?). First get ... your client working with a registered server; then unregister the server and verify that your error message is what you expected; and finally... craft and deploy manifest files. This way your troubleshooting efforts ... will be confined to the structure of your manifest files (and the correct embedding of the assembly manifest if you choose to do so). When troubleshooting registration-free COM issues, the Event Viewer on Windows Server 2003 is your friend... look in the System Event Log for events from the COM server. I don't suggest that you look at the Windows XP Event Log... it will invariably contain a message... which doesn't help identify the problem.
