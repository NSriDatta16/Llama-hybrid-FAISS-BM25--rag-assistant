reinterpret_cast

In the C++ Without Fear: A Beginner's Guide That Makes You Feel Smart book, and in chapter (8), it mentions the following about reinterpret_cast ....converts from one pointer type (int ) to another (char*). Because the cast changes the way the data pointed to is interpreted, it is called reinterpret_cast, as opposed to static_cast.* Can you describe this paragraph here? Especially the reason for the way the operation is named? Thanks.
