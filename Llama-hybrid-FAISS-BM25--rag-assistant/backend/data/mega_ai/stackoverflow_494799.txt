The pattern I normally use for this is: SELECT whatever FROM person LEFT JOIN subtable AS s1 ON s1.personid = person.personid ... WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM subtable WHERE personid = person.personid AND orderbydate > s1.orderbydate ) Which avoids the TOP 1 clause and maybe makes it a little clearer. BTW, I like the way you've put this query together in general, except I'd leave out the brackets, assuming you have rationally named tables and columns; and you might even gain some performance (but at least elegance) by listing columns for tr1 and tr2, rather than "tr1.*" and "tr2.*".
