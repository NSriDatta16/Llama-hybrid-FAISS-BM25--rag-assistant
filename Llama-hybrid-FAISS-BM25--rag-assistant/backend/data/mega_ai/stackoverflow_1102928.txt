You have my sympathy - Access VBA is not object-oriented in any sense like Ruby. You will have to change your mindset when tackling development in Access; such applications are almost always geared around the concept of data rows and sets rather than objects. The user interface is often bound to data rows and sets in a way that hides a lot of plumbing. Having said that it is possible to build pefectly decent maintainable applications in Access with care and attention. Good luck.
