I would suggest you do your capturing with the Capture::Tiny module from CPAN. It's small, simple, and well tested. It has an elegant API and if you totally can't have any dependencies, it can be embedded into your program easily. Apart from that: If you have any control over the testing program being run, I would suggest you investigate the Test Anything Protocol . If you can make your test program output TAP, then your use case including a nice summary of the tests becomes as simple as: perl -MTest::Harness -e 'runtests(@ARGV)' bin/rununittests NB about the second paragraph: Potentially recent Test::Harness required. Also, doesn't quite do what you need regarding the shell invocation, but it should get you close enough.
