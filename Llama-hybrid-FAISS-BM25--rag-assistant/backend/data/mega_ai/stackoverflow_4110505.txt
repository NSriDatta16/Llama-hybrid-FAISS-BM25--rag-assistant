Deciding database need

I have small .net application which I sell. I was using Access as database but I think it's not flexible and fast enough. Also I'm planning to enable network database access so I need suggestions which database system to move. My program is a shop sales organizer and I record every sale on a shop. I need customer, stock, sale records in the database. Some clients make 10k sales and about 100k products in a month. EDIT: Also the database system must be easy to manage and easy to backup.
