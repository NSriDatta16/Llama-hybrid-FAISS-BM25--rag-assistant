Can I import an entire directory of jar files at once, .. No. ..or must I specify each jar individually when creating a JNLP? Yes. ..If the latter, are there any workarounds? There ain't no workaround, cos' it ain't broke. That is the way JWS is supposed to work. You don't just toss every single resource on the file system at it.
