This may be a old thread, but still a relevant question. The most prominent example of the connections between Neural Networks (NN) and Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) is the one between Boltzmann Machines (and its variations like Restricted BM, Deep BM etc) and undirected PGMs of Markov Random Field. Similarly, Belief Networks (and it's variations like Deep BN etc) are a type of directed PGMs of Bayesian graphs For more, see: Yann Lecun, " A tutorial on energy-based learning " (2006) Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow and Aaron Courville, "Deep Learning", Ch 16 & 20 (book in preparation, at the time of writing this)
