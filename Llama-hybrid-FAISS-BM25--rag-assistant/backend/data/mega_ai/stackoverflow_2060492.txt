How hard is it to upgrade from Rails 1.2.3 to 2.3.5?

Is it even worth it? I'm working on assessing a legacy code base for a client -- the source code has been largely untouched since 2007 and it's built with Rails 1.2.3. My Rails experience began at version 2.1 -- the code is fairly stock/scaffold like and devoid of meaningful tests -- I was curious to even see if I could get it running locally -- but, I'm not even sure where to start. Right off it doesn't even know what 'rake db:create' means. Ha! Is it going be a major pain to even getting it running in 2.3.5? Should I bother? Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks
