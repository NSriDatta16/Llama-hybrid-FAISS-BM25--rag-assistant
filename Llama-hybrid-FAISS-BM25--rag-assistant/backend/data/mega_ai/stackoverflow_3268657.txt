Design Strategy: Query and Update data across 2 different databases

We have a requirement in which we need to query data across 2 different databases ( 1 in SQL Server and other in Oracle). Here are the scenarios which need to be implemented: Query: Get the data from one database and match for values in other Update: Get the data from one database and update the objects in other Technology that we are using: ASP.net, C# The options that we have thought about: Staging area in one database Link Server ( can't go with the approach as it is not allowed due to organization wide policy) Create web services Create 2 different DAL and perform list operations with the data from 2 sources in DAL I would like to know what is the best design strategy to deal with this kind of a scenario? If yes, then what are the pros and cons of that approach
