raphael.js crop image

I am newbie to raphael.js and svg. I have an image element, i can select rectangles on it using drag and drop in any area. The problem is that image must be transparent, but selected rectangles not. If i used css i would set background-image for rectangles and background position, but i have not found such possibility for svg (and probably vml for ie). How can i crop the image and put it over transparent image or set background position to rectangle? UPD : Actually i found the solution: for each newly created rectangle I can copy image and use clip-rect attribute. But this solution does not match my needs. I can not rotate clip-rect area, image only.
