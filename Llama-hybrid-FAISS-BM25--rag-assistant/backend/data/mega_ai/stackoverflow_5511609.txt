Augmented Reality usually uses a space-filling-curve to reduce the 2 to 3-Dimensional problem to a 1-2 Dimensional problem. Basically it is just a reordering of sub-divisions of the surface thus it makes it easier to query the database for any locations or items in range or it helps partitioning the surface at all. You want to look for Nick's blog about spatial index quadtree and hilbert curve. A good example of a sfc is also the internet-map from the xbcd-comic.
