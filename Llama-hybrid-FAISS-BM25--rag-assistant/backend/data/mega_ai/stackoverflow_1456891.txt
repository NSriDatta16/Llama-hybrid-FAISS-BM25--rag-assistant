I believe this answer comes late in the day, but it is put down to help others understand how WTP support for WebSphere works in Eclipse. WTP support for the newer versions of the WebSphere Application Server come only with commercial IDEs - Rational Application Developer, for example. MyEclipse is another IDE that comes with support for WAS 7; one would need the Blue Edition to work against a v7.0 WAS instance. The philosophy is that if the vanilla Eclipse WTP project has to support an application server, then the application server vendor must either provide the adapter or some means to perform the integration. For obvious reasons, this is absent for WAS 6.1 and 7.0, but available for 6.0. This was the case, but IBM has since release WebSphere Application Server tools edition and has donated a server adapter to the Eclipse market place. This will cover WAS 7, 8 and 8.5 alpha.
