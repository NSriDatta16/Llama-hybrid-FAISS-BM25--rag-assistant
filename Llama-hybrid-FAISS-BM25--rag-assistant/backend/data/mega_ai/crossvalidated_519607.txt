Logistic Regression and NaiveBayes with infinite dataset

I'm comparing the LR and NB performance on different datasets. And suddenly I am wondering what if we have a big dataset that is infinitely large (at least ensure both models trained to its best??). How would two algorithms work? Usually, LR tends to be overfitting and it requires regularisation. Would in this case it also tend to be overfitting?
