I have categories for age, gender, education, organization size, type, department, position in a firm. Yes, I had numbers first time I did the analysis, now I've recoded them according to a reference category. So this means first time the approach was wrong ... I'm working with SPSS. Say my variables are socialization in a firm and fit between a person and a firm. Theoretically it is possible for socialization to influence fit which in turn can influence turnover and the other way around, for fit to influence socialization which in turn can influence turnover. Then can I use both hypothesis about the mediation? I've used two macros which both allow to test multiple mediation. Even so, I'm thinking all macros can test simple mediation, for example, only with the predictor, mediator and outcome included. Shouldn't the results be the same in this case?
