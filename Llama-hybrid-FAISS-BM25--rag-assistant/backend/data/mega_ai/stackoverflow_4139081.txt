Active Directory WCF Service

I'm wondering what solutions/options I might have for managing user authentication and authorization with AD? I'm in a situation where we want to use AD accounts/groups/etc to manage our users, both internal and external. I found this article ( http://blog.waleedmohamed.net/2009/12/create-active-directory-service-using.html ) that shows a simple WCF Service exposing some AD operations. My thought is to create an AD WCF Service which multiple apps can consume for account CRUD operations and other needed functions like logging in and password retrieval. Is this a good idea to have a service with this much power? We're thinking about having the service use an account that only has permissions on certain OU's to limit its power. Thanks!
