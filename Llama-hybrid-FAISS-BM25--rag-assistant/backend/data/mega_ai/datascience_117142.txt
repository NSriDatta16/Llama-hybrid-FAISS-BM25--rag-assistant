the meaning of Time_step in Time series Data

I have an application that can generate 50 data in 1 second,which means the sampling_rate of my application is 50Hz. then theb data type is timeseries. then I make my data like below before training. steps= 50 inp = [] out = [] for i in range(len(data_scaled_out) - (steps)): inp.append(data_scaled_in[i:i+steps]) out.append(data_scaled_out[i+steps]) inp data shape is (50,89) if I use data shape (50,89) is it the same I change the model's sampling rate to 1Hz? means that the model can only predict 1 data in 1 second? because my professor said that if I use the input shape (50.89) it is the same as me downsampling the frequency. Is that true?
