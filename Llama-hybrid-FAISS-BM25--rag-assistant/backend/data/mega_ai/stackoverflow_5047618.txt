You cannot use a SimpleCursorAdapter with TouchListView , for the simple reason that a SimpleCursorAdapter cannot be modified. The Adapter has to change its data to reflect and drag and drop operations. The simple but somewhat clunky solution would be to iterate over the Cursor and create an ArrayList of something out of that data, then use that ArrayList with an ArrayAdapter and TouchListView . The slick but complex solution would be to create a decorating ListAdapter that sits between TouchListView and your SimpleCursorAdapter and knows about your drag and drop data changes and applies them on the fly. For example, if the user swaps positions 5 and 6, when TouchListView calls getView() to get position 5, the decorating adapter would know to get position 6's row from the SimpleCursorAdapter .
