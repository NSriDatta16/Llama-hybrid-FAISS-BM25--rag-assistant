Expression tree modification problem

I have the following: Expression > myExpr = car => car.Wheel.Tyre.Pressure; I want to remove the parameter, and make the first member the parameter for a sub-expression, so i end up with: Expression > mySubExpr = wheel => wheel.Tyre.Pressure; This needs to work for any expression tree of the above format, including MemberExpression , MethodCallExpression and any other Expression which has a .Expression property. For example: Expression > myOtherExpr = car => car.GetRearLeftWheel().GetTyre().Pressure or Expression > anotherExpr = car => car.Wheel.GetTyre().GetPressure(); How would I achieve this elegantly? Thanks Andrew
