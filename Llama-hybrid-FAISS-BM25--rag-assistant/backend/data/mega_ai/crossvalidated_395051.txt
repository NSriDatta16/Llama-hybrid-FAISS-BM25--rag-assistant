Comparing two logit models

Folks, Would appreciate any advice on the following topic. My question I would like to answer is the following. What are the determinants of being a First Time Buyer of a House? Based on a survey I have a dataset which contains a binary indicator if an individual identified themselves as a First Time buyer or not. The idea is to fit a logistic regression model where my dependent variable would be the binary indicator and I would have a number of controls such as; Age, Income, House Price, Region where house is located, nationality of owner. However, I have a suspicion that the FTB indicator in the survey may underestimate the proportion of first time buyers i.e. individuals who should be a FTB are not denoting themselves as one. Therefore, I have developed my own method to independently identify whether someone may be a first time buyer. This involves examining administrative records based on property purchases. I would like to fit a logit model for this too and compare results. Note that the cohorts are exactly the same. Is it possible to compare and contrast the results of these two models and identify whether one is a better predictor or not? Basically I need some way to validate my own methodology. Any ideas are welcomed.
