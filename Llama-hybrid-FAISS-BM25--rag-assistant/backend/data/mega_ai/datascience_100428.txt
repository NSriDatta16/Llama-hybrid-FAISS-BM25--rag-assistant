In case of image classification one of the important thing to remember while connecting Convolutional layer output to Dense layer is to make sure Flatten the output of the Convolutional layer then pass it to Dense layer. Just add following code snippets just before your 1st Dense layer containing 2048 neurons. cnn_radheKrishna.add(BatchNormalization( )) cnn_radheKrishna.add(Flatten( )) # As your import statement contains Flatten layer cnn_radheKrishna.add(Dense(2048, activation = 'relu')) ```
