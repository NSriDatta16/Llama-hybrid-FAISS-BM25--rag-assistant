Eclipse can handle all of these tools, but then so can Netbeans. For your first project with GWT you should read through this tutorial: http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/tutorials/1.6/gettingstarted.html If you don't know Java then you will have some learning to do, and unlike Visual Studio your UI won't be just drag and drop, so it will be a bit harder than you are used to. Subversion is fine, it is a nice source control, and any IDE will work with it. Depending on your project would determine if GWT is the best choice though. I expect UML may be overkill, and if you were following an agile methodology you wouldn't use it. Your best bet is to get the UI done first, just have it appear as you want, and have some fake results, until you are happy with the look and feel. Then, start to do the wiring to whatever you need on the backend.
