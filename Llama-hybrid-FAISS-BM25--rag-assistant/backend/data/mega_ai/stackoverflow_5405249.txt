There are two ways to distribute your app. One is to deliver the files (users will need both the app and a provision profile) to your users' computers by whatever means you like (e-mail, web server, thumb drive, etc.) and have your users install the app by dragging those files into their iTunes library. The other way is to host your app on a web server and distribute it directly to users' devices. Apple's instructions for both methods are here . It's hard to say what's causing your code signing error. What's helped me in the past is to read the error carefully for clues, and sometimes Google the exact error message. Make sure you've got your Entitlements file set correctly -- requirements for this seem to have changed at some point.
