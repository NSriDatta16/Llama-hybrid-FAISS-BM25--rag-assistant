Calculate Moving Average in Excel

I want to calculate a moving average of the last, say 20, numbers of a column. A problem is that some of the cells of the column may be empty, they should be ignored. Example: A 175 154 188 145 155 167 201 A moving average of the last three would be (155+167+201)/3. I've tried to implement this using average, offset, index, but I simply don't know how. I'm a little bit familiar with macros, so such a solution would work fine: =MovingAverage(A1;3) Thanks for any tips or solutions!
