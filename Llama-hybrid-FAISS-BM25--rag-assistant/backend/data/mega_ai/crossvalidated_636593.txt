Issues with metaprop function for computing pooled specificity in meta-analysis

I am training to learn how to perform meta-analysis using R. I conducted a meta-analysis using the metaprop function in R with the provided dataset. The goal is to compute the pooled specificity using the code snippet below: Data I encounter multiple problems when I wanted to use metaprop to compute pooled specificity using this code: library(meta) metaprop(event = TN, n = TN + FP, studlab = rownames(Data2), data = Data, sm = "PLOGIT", method.ci = "CP", subgroup = Data$detection, comb.fixed=FALSE, comb.random=TRUE, title = "Specificity") This is the result: Review: Specificity Number of studies: k = 12 Number of observations: o = 506 Number of events: e = 493 proportion 95%-CI Random effects model 0.9829 [0.9462; 0.9947] Quantifying heterogeneity: tau^2 = 0.7642; tau = 0.8742; I^2 = 0.0% [0.0%; 58.3%]; H = 1.00 [1.00; 1.55] Test of heterogeneity: Q d.f. p-value Wald 3.80 11 0.9755 LRT 19.52 11 0.0523 Results for subgroups (random effects model): k proportion 95%-CI tau^2 tau Q I^2 detection = Fluorescence 10 0.9761 [0.9374; 0.9911] 0.3949 0.6284 3.80 0.0% detection = Lateral flow 2 1.0000 [0.0000; 1.0000] 0 0 0.00 0.0% Test for subgroup differences (random effects model): Q d.f. p-value Between groups 0.00 1 0.9995 Details on meta-analytical method: - Random intercept logistic regression model - Maximum-likelihood estimator for tau^2 - Logit transformation - Continuity correction of 0.5 in studies with zero cell frequencies (only used to calculate individual study results) Warning messages: 1: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : unable to evaluate scaled gradient 2: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Hessian is numerically singular: parameters are not uniquely determined 3: In vcov.merMod(res.ML) : variance-covariance matrix computed from finite-difference Hessian is not positive definite or contains NA values: falling back to var-cov estimated from RX 4: Ratio of largest to smallest sampling variance extremely large. May not be able to obtain stable results. 5: Ratio of largest to smallest sampling variance extremely large. May not be able to obtain stable results. I have some questions: Confidence Interval for Lateral Flow: The confidence interval for specificity in the "Lateral flow" subgroup is reported as [0.0000; 1.0000]. Given the absence of false positives in both studies using the "lateral flow" method, I expected a more precise interval. Why does it return (0-1)? Interpretation of Warnings: The function generates several warning messages, and I'm unclear about their implications. Any insights or suggestions on resolving these issues would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
