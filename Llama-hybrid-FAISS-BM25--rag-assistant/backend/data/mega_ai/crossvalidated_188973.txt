Measure influence of attribues on clustering

I don't have a specific example for my problem and maybe this is trivial, but I want to know how to measure the influence of specific attributes (or dimensions) of a dataset for clustering, like there are ways to compute cluster validity. As far as I know in PCA variance is used to determine which attributes can be unused but still no information is lost. Are there other units to measure the influence or importance of attribues to select the most promissing features? In other words: Is there a way to create a ranking or something to choose what attributes to use in a subset? Feel free to direct me to other sites or material if this question is to easy, but I couldn't find myself any desired answers.
