Can't connect IBOutlet in Interface Builder

I'm having a weird experience. I create any type of iPhone application, add a UIViewController with Xib file. I can edit the xib file with controls and see them rendered if I run. Now i'm trying to add a few IBOutlets to the controller, so I add them to the .h file, synthesize on the .m file. Then i head over to Interface Builder to connect the outlets. I drag the UILabel to the UIView, and then i try to connect the File Owner (which my custom UIViewController), but all that i can select when i try to connect to the UILabel is "view", which is obviosly wrong. So I'm not able to connect IBOutlets to their controls in Interface Builder. Any ideas?
