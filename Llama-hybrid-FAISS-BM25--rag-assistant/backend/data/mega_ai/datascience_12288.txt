If you're new to both machine learning and programming, try taking a look at this guy's tutorials: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/ . I've been using them for a while, and I think they're great because of how visual, hands-on, and practical they are. For example, he has facial recognition and handwriting recognition lessons. I'm using what I learned in his tutorials to build a self driving remote control car (similar to this: https://zhengludwig.wordpress.com/projects/self-driving-rc-car/ ).
