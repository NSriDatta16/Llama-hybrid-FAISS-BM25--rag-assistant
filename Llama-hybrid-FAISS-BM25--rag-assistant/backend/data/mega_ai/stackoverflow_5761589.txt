I can't find any elegant way. This is the ugly way. Run: rlwrap awk '{print "%run myfile.py"} {print} {fflush()}' |ipython This reads from STDIN, but prints the command you wanted before each command. fflush is there to disable buffering and pass things to ipython immediately. rlwrap is there to keep the readline bindings; you can remove it if you don't have it, but this will be less convenient (no arrow keys, etc.). Mind that you will have to type your commands before the ipython prompt appears. There might be other more annoying things which break, I haven't tested thoroughly.
