Trying to partially answer my own question, there are some examples of using regular bootstrap to approximate Bayesian inference e.g. Laird and Louis (1987) used empirical Bayes together with bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals, Djuric (1997) used MAP with bootstrap for model selection, and to improve MCMC sampling ( 1999 ), Osband and Van Roy (2018) used bootstrap together with Thompson sampling for multiarmed bandits problem, while Osband et al (2018) used it in reinforcement learning scenario (see figure below), and Everitt (2017) and Picchini and Everitt (2018) (see also this talk ) described using bootstrap in Approximate Bayesian Computation. Unfortunately, neither of those references described just using bootstrap with MAP, but apparently there are some promising results in related areas.
