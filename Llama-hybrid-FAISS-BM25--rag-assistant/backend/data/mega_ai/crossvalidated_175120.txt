I'm not sure about the pseudo R2 for the averaged model, but if you are simply looking for a way to measure the 'fit' of the averaged-model, I believe you can use AUC or Cross-Validation. You can get the area under the receiver operating curve with function roc(), from package pROC on averaged models, or you can get cross-validation error rates for the averaged model (it can be altered slightly depending on how many models are averaged); link for CV averaged model . Another way is to report the deviance explained, by using ((null deviance â€“ residual deviance)/null deviance), although I'm not sure how common this is used.
