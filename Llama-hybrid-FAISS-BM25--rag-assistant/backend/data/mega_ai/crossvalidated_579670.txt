good intermediate-level textbook for undergraduate applied statistics in data science?

I will be teaching an applied statistics course for the first time and the main audience will be 2nd and 3rd year undergraduates, mostly data science majors. They will have an intro statistics course as a pre-requisite that covers really basic topics (e.g., graphs, quantitative vs. categorical data, simple linear regression, probability, some CI and hypothesis testing). This second course will pick up where the first one leaves off and ideally would cover the following topics: review of CIs and hypothesis testing, ANOVA, goodness of fit tests, maximum likelihood, simple and multiple linear regression, logistic regression, nonparametric testing and also get into some Bayesian statistics as well as GLMs and GEEs time permitting. It would be great if the textbook also came with examples in R. It's been difficult to find a textbook that covers all these topics sufficiently and isn't too heavy on theory - since the students will mostly be interested in application. Does anyone have any good recommendations?
