Yes, a byte variable in Java is in fact 4 bytes in memory. However this doesn't hold true for arrays. The storage of a byte array of 20 bytes is in fact only 20 bytes in memory. That is because the Java Bytecode Language only knows two integer number types: ints and longs. So it must handle all numbers internally as either type and these types are 4 and 8 bytes in memory. However, Java knows arrays with every integer number format. So the storage of short arrays is in fact two bytes per entry and one byte per entry for byte arrays. The reason why I keep saying "the storage of" is that an array is also an object in Java and every object requires multiple bytes of storage on its own, regardless of the storage that instance variables or the array storage in case of arrays require.
