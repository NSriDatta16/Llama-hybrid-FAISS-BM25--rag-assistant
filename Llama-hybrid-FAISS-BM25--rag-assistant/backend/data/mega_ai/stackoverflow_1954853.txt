Does C++ programmer simulate features of Java?

As I read in Thinking in java , Interface and inner class provide more sophisiticated ways to organize and control the objects in your system. C++, for example, does not contain such mechanisms, although the clever programmer may simulate them. Is it true that C++ programmer simluate features that java owns,e.g. interface and constraint themself not to step over the boundary,e.g. including non-static-final(non-const) data member within the simluated interface? Are these features that Java provided natural way for developing software.So if C++ programmers could,they should code and think like a Java programmer? EDIT : I know that every programming langauge have its own characteristics and its application area and the design of programming language is making tradeoffs.But what I want to know is whether something java introduced for example interface,are better way to help/force programmer think throughly and produce good class design?so C++ programmers would like to simulate some of these features? thanks.
