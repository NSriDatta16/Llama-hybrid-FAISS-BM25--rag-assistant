Is Mongo good for transient storage (high volume of object creates & deletes)?

I have an application that will periodically create a large number (10,000+) of hashes (collections of name/value pairs). The hashes may be manipulated a few times, and then deleted. Is MongoDB an appropriate choice for this? Are there any obviously-better-suited alternatives?
