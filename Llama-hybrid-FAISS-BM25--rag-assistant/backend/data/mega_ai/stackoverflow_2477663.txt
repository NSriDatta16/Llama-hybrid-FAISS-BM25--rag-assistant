LineChart segments in Flex

I'm doing some line charts in my Flex application, and I need to draw segments of those line chart in different color. Does anyone have an idea how this could be achieved? For instance, if I have a code like this (actually, I have given this trivial example for simplicity (the problem is the same)): I would like this "Profit" series to be blue (as it currently is), but I would like first segment of the line (Jan, Feb) to be, let's say yellow, and another segment, let's say (Mar, Apr, Jun) to be red. I know I could draw additional series for these segments with proper coloring on top of existing one, but I was wondering is there a more elegant way of doing this in Flex? Thanks for you answers.
