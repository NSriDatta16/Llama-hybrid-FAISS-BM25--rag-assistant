Random Forest is essentially a bagging (bootstrap aggregating) method and it is therefore most useful in high variance regimes. It could be the case that you do not have a high variance problem. Especially since it seems that feature selection helps with your accuracy, you might have a high bias problem. In this case, random forest's performance will decrease.
