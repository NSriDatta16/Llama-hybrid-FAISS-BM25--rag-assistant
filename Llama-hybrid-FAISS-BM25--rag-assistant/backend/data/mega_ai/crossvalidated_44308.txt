Why would predicted values be normally-distributed when the actual values are uniform?

I'm building a supervised learning model where the target variable is a uniformly-distributed continuous value ranging from 0-1 (originally a rank value from 1-38000, then scaled down to 0-1). The 20 predictor variables are a mix of continuous and categorical variables, with no more than 6 levels for the latter. But when I apply various modeling techniques to the data (including regression, random forest, MARS, neural nets) using R, the predicted values for every model are shaped like a bell curve. What could cause the fitted values (bell shape) to be so consistently different from the actual ones (uniform shape)? And is there any way to force these models to produce a more uniformly-shaped prediction?
