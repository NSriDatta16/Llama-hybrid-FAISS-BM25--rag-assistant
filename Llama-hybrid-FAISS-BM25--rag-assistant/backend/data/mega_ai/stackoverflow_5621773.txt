This is because writeObject in ObjectOutputStream overrides the method in the ObjectOutput interface which does not require that the object be Serializable . The ObjectOutput interface specifies methods that allow objects to be written to a stream or underlying storage, but this may be achieved by a process other than serialization. The ObjectOutputStream implements this functionality, but requires serializable objects. However, it cannot modify the signature of the interface that it implements.
