Sorry, but you cannot have a macro emit another macro because the pre-processor is single pass. Also from the c99 standard: (6.10.3.4 paragraph 3): 3 The resulting completely macro-replaced preprocessing token sequence is not processed as a preprocessing directive even if it resembles one, ... c++ has something similar as well.
