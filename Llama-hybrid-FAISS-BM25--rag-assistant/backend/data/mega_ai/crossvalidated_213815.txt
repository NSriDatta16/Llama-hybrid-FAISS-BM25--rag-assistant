If there are 100 types of damages, then each combination can be represented as "$n_1$ scratches, $n_2$ dings, $n_3$ damages of type 3 ... $n_{100}$ damages of type 100". Your task is to estimate $n_1$, ..., $n_{100}$ from the input data. This leads to a neural network which has 100 output neurons. Unless only one damage of type $t$ can exist, the activation function for the unit $t$ should be linear rather than log-sigmoidal.
