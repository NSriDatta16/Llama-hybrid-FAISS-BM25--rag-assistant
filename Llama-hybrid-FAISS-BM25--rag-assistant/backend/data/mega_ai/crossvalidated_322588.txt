I'm looking for a risk analysis book with citations from academic backgrounds that focuses on shocks and the unknown. Looking for a Taleb alternative

I'm less than ... enthusiastic about some of Taleb's claims regarding, say, the paleo diet. I make no comment on his political content, but I want someone more factual and hard, and less prone to controversy and drama. I make no comment on Taleb's content herein as all I am saying is that I want someone different from his style, yet deals with the same overarching and broad content. I'm looking for a well-referenced popular risk book that deals with dealing with the unexpected and shocks. Is there such a thing? This book would ideally have (a) mirror(s) in mathematical language and risk analysis papers. Taleb discusses statistics here:-- ( https://econpapers.repec.org/article/besamstat/v_3a61_3ay_3a2007_3am_3aaugust_3ap_3a198-200.htm ) Content I have consumed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_analysis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility The Black Swan Bed of Procrustes Fooled by Randomness Antifragile
