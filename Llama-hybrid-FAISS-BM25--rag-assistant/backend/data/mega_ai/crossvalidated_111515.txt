Learning to map vectors to vectors

Say we want to learn a function: $f(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbf{R}^p) \rightarrow \mathbf{y} \in \mathbf{R}^q$ where $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are vectors representing time series. We have multiple examples of this mapping, i.e.: $$\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{x_0}\\...\\\mathbf{x_N}\end{pmatrix}\rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{y_0}\\...\\\mathbf{y_N} \end{pmatrix} $$ What type of problem is this? Is it a regression problem? If so, what metrics (loss functions) and methods would be appropiate for this problem? Anything specifically available in Python?
