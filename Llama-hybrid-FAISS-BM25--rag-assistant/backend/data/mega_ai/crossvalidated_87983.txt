You can apply a zero phase shifter filter and cut out all frequencies higher than some threshold; this would give you a "trend" of sorts. For example, look at this question, " How do I run a high pass or low pass filter on data points in R? " They show how to use Butterworth low pass filter. The problem with that filter is that it's not zero phase shift, i.e. as you see the low frequency component's phase is shifted relative to the original signal. You may want to find the filter which does not shift the phase. If this were economic data, I would suggest Christiano's filter as per "The Band Pass Filter" by Lawrence J. Christiano and Terry J. Fitzgerald (1999). For physical data, there must be a ton of zero phase shift filters available. UPDATE: Here's an example of applying the low band pass filter to the LOG of the second time series. The LOG is required to even out the variance. UPDATE2: Here's a sample decomposition in frequency domain with frequency bands: irregular [2-19], cyclical [20-99], and trend [100-$\infty$] (in period lengths). The frequency bands have to be chosen carefully based on the understanding of the underlying phenomenon.
