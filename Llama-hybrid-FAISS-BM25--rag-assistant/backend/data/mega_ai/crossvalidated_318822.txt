How are the epochs and iterations defined in a h2o deep learning perspective?

As per the usual definition of epoch and iteration, it takes multiple iterations to complete 1 epoch (for example see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4752626/epoch-vs-iteration-when-training-neural-networks ). So the relationship between epochs and iterations should be always #iterations >= #epochs. However in the h2o deep learning implementation, we observed that the number of epochs is higher than the number of iterations (as shown in the image). iteration "> This leaves the question: How are the epochs and iterations defined in a h2o deep learning perspective?
