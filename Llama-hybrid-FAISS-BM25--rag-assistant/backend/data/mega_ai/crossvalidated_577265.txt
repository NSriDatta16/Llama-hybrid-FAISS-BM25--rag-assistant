Why predictions are non-linear in logistic regression and are they interactions?

Consider this logistic regression on the Titanic dataset, with two predictors (one factor, Pclass and one continuous, Age ): library(modelr) library(titanic) library(tidyverse) titanic |z|) # (Intercept) 2.296012 0.317629 7.229 4.88e-13 *** # factor(Pclass)2 -1.137533 0.237578 -4.788 1.68e-06 *** # factor(Pclass)3 -2.469561 0.240182 -10.282 We have no interaction term, yet when we plot the predicted probability of surviving, we get non-parallel lines between the different classes: grid I assume this is because we are doing a logistic regression. Still, I wonder if we can interpret that as interactions, e.g. here that for older passengers, the class matters less than for younger passengers?
