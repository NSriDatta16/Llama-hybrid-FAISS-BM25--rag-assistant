Obtaining point forecasts from a DCC-GARCH model in rmgarch in R

I am becoming more acquainted with GARCH models in R, but I am not sure my code is right for what I am trying to do, so I would appreciate any help. Based on an xts I create using data from a csv with 3 columns of stock data (pictured below), I estimate the following basic multivariate GARCH model, with an ARMA(1,0) for the mean: # What each time series is defined by itself uspec = ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1,0)), variance.model = list(garchOrder = c(1,1), model = 'sGARCH'), distribution.model = 'norm') # Their connected dynamics mspec = dccspec(uspec = multispec(replicate(3, uspec)), dccOrder = c(1,1), distribution = "mvnorm") ## Fitting fit_rm = dccfit(mspec, data = x, solver = c('hybrid','gosolnp')) ## Forecasting forc_rm = dccforecast(fit_rm, n.ahead = 10) forc_rm currently gives me forecasts of the co-variance matrix, which is good, but how do I get forecasts of the 3 time series themselves? In rmgarch 's sister package, rugarch , the forecast object contains both conditional volatility forecasts and the actual time series forecasts, but I come up short with rmgarch . I only get vague options that do not seem like the return forecasts. (pardon large image) Am I missing something here?
