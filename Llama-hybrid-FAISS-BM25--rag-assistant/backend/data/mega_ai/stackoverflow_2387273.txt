getting googlemaps to accept a local KML file?

I am trying to get googlemaps to accept a local KML file. final Intent myIntent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("geo:0,0?q=file://" + Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/locate.kml")); startActivity(myIntent); The file is on the SD card, and is a valid kml file. Googlemaps loads up, but says it cannot find the file. final Intent myIntent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("geo:0,0?q=http://www.website.com/locate.kml")); startActivity(myIntent); Works fine. geo:0,0?q= seems to be very under documented, can anyone help me out with how to use it to refer to a local file?
