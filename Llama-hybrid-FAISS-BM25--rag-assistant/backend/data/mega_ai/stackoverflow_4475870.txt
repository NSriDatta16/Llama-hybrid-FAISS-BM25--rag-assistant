Activity or service in background task?

Here's my set-up; I have a news app. This app loads a few listviews from local storage (I'm abusing sharedpreferences for that, but if that's good practice would be another question). I want to be able to update this local storage smoothly. My first approach was to make a button trigger a service, which did the trick. But I also wanted the service to refresh the activity when it was done. I wasn't able to do that. My current approach seems to work, but not as smoothly on 3G. Activity A shows a 'Loading' box, then launches activity B and destroys itself. Activity B also shows a loading box, does the downloading, then destroys itself and relaunches activity A with the new content. However, this last approach makes the screen go black for a few seconds in transition from A to B when on 3G. For the sake of visual smoothness, I'd like one loading popup to display continuously. When done, the activity should be refreshed. Does anyone know how I can achieve this? I hope my explanation was clear enough. Otherwise, I'd be happy to share some code with you. Thanks a lot in advance
