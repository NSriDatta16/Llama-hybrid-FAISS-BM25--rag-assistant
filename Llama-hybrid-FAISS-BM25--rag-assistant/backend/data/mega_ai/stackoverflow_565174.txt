drag and drop using javascript

I have some items in panel A along with some descriptions like time of delivery. All items in different div. In the second panel I have list of drivers with different timings like 9AM, 10AM and so on. Now I need, that, when I drag and drop itemA from Panel1 to DriverA in panel2, I want that the item should be added to the dropped driver(DriverA) and the the cell of that particular driver with timing (say if item has to be delivered at 10AM , then then cell of driver with 10 AM changes the color to red).
