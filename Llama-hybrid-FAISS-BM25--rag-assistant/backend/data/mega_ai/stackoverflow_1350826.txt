How do I run Flash interactively in an MFC app?

I want to know if its possible to embed a flash movie inside an MFC app and let the user iteract with it. I know this is easily possible through embedding Flash activeX control. But I want the flash movie to be able to receive input from the MFC app (such as data and state update from the servers) and also should let the MFC app know about user interactions and other internal changes via callbacks or in some other way . Is this possible through Flex SDK, Adobe AIR or such runtimes ? Pls give me some starters so that I can get up and goin with it. Thanx.
