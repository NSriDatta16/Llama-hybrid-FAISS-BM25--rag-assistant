There might be various reasons for storing different files in different locations. Firstly, a restriction on the number of files in one directory might be a consideration. Secondly security might be an issue - if some are to be publicly viewable (such as profile photos for example) but others are not (such as CVs) then placing them in different directories would be easier to manage. Thirdly, simple admin tasks may be easier if files are split, browsing in a file explorer for example, or managing backups, or modifying the application to split file storage across multiple locations. There is also the issue of filename conflicts, but if you rename everything to match the database id field (for example) then this wouldn't be an issue. But at the end of the day it probably depends on volumes and your own preference.
