Putting a threshold on the density of probability equals to putting a limit on the probability in the sense that you say $$ \int_{-\infty}^{-\epsilon}p(y)dy + \int_{\epsilon}^{\infty}p(y)dy \equiv \alpha $$ and then define the rule (for a univariate Gaussian): if $$ \int_{-\infty}^{-x}p(y)dy + \int_{x}^{\infty}p(y)dy then $x$ is an outlier. And this is the idea behind more sophisticated approaches like one-class SVMs for outlier detection. You say any sample from sample space corresponding to regions with very (according to some threshold) low probability are considered outliers.
