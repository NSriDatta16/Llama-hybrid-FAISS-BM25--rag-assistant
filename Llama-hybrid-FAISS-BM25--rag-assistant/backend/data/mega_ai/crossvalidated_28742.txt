I am tempted to say use autobox, it will pick a model for you and may find a better one than the ones you are looking at. I am sure IrishStat would be thinking that and be glad I said it. But to answer your question: Your series is relatively long with around 100 observations. All the fit statistics suggest that the first model is much better than the second. The first model appears to be a constant. if there is any sort of pattern in the data it would be easier to see it in a plot of the data rather than a table of numbers. If a plot shows that it seems to randomly vary around 1.26 and the acf looks likeit should for a white noise series the first model may be the best. Otherwise look for a different alternative than the second model which is clearly a poor model. Now using the first model the best forecast is the current mean which is the intercept value 1.2623. Not a very satisfactory result if you wanted to take advantage of the power of time series analysis. It really says that the recent past is no moreimportant in forecasting the next time point than the distant past and new observations only help in refining your estimate of the mean.
