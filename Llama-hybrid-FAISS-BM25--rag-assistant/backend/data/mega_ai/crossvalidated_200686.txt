Does it make sense to use PCA when the determinant of the correlation matrix is (almost) zero?

I'm running a PCA over a data set of $N \times p$ size ($N\approx 1000$ being the number of measurements and $p\approx 200$ being the number of dimensions/predictors). I expect many of the predictors to be correlated and that the dimensions can consequently be reduced. I can even drop some columns that are linearly dependent with respect to the others. When I run the PCA I find that $\sim 50\%$ of the variance can be explained by the first 5 PCs, suggesting that the predictors can actually be grouped. But I am concerned about the smallness of the correlation matrix ($R$) determinant, which is $\det(R) \approx 10^{-100}$ or a ridiculous number like that. Do the results make sense with such a small number? Moreover, I see that the PCA results change (a lot!) if I round the input numbers to drop non-relevant digits, like the 10th digit or so. I think this is linked with the fact we are working with such a small determinant. Since a small determinant in R indicates that there are redundant dimensions, I would say that the PCA is the way to go to reduce them. Nevertheless, does it make sense to run a PCA with such a small determinant? If not, what is the best way to reduce the dimensionality of the problem?
