It's a trick. Conditionally on $X_{3,i} = x$ we have that $W_i$ equals $$\frac{X_{1,i} + X_{2,i}x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1).$$ This follows from the fact that for fixed $x$ this is a simple linear transformation of the two independent $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$-distributed variables $X_{1,i}$ and $X_{2,i}$. Whence, $W_i \mid X_{3,i} = x$ has a normal distribution. The conditional mean is seen to be 0 and the conditional variance is (by the independence assumptions) $$V(W_i \mid X_{3,i} = x) = \frac{V(X_{1,i}) + V(X_{2,i})x^2}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1 + x^2}{1 + x^2} = 1.$$ Since the conditional distribution of $W_i \mid X_{3,i} = x$ doesn't depend upon $x$ we conclude that it is its marginal distribution as well, that is, $W_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1).$ The rest follows from standard results on averages and residuals for independent normal random variables. Basu's theorem is not needed for anything.
