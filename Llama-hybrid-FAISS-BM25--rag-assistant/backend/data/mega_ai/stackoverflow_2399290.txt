You can separate the database into two parts: Definition Tables and Data Tables. Basically the Definition Tables is used to interpret the Data Tables where the actual data is stored (some would say that the definition tables is more elegant if represented in XML). The following is the basic idea. Definition Tables: TABLE class class_id (int) class_name (varchar) TABLE class_property property_id (int) class_id (int) property_name (varchar) property_type (varchar) Data Tables: TABLE object object_id (int) class_id (varchar) TABLE object_property property_id (int) property_value (varchar) It would be best if you could also create additional Layer to interpret the structure so as to make it easier for the Data Layer to operate on the data. And you must of course take into consideration performance, ease of query, etc. Just my two cents, I hope it could be of any help. Regards.
