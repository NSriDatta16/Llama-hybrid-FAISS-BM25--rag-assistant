Discrepancy in odds ratios when using dummy and effect coding - which is better?

I have a binary outcome variable and several binary predictor variables. When performing a logistic regression ( proc logistic ) in SAS, I get different odds ratios when I take the exponent of beta, compared to the odds ratios provided by the oddsratio statement. According to this , the difference comes about because the beta coefficients are calculated by default using effect coding, while the odds ratios calculated with the oddsratio statement are calculated using dummy variables. My question is - which one should I be using? It makes quite a difference to my results (e.g. ORs of 0.95 vs 0.57 for variable1, 1.2 vs 1.8 for variable2 for effect and dummy coding, respectively). My inclination would be to use the more conservative estimates, but I wonder if there is a more philosophical reason for using one or the other.
