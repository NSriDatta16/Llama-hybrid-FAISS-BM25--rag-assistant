Seminal works in deep learning

I'm compiling a list of 7 seminal works in deep learning to work on during 14 week semester course. I'd appreciate if you suggested papers for the list. I'm looking for the papers that impacted the field in a major way. The only constraint is that the paper must be reproducible, i.e. based on freely available data and the codes are described in sufficient detail. It really is not much of a constrain, actually. For instance, this paper would be in my list: Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I. and Hinton, G. E., ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, NIPS 2012: Neural Information Processing Systems, Lake Tahoe, Nevada
