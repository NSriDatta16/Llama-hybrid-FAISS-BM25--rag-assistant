Is there a simple method to calculate the minimum number of datalines needed for a machine learning algorithm with x variables?

Here is the problem: I am making a machine learning algorithm that takes the inputs and outputs of some software I've written, and I don't know how many datalines to produce to get results that are a 'good' fit. I realize the answer is 'the more the better' but I'm looking for any sort of minimum requirement. I also realize that the greater the number of variables the greater the number of datalines required. So I'm looking for a rule of thumb for number of variables to number of datalines.
