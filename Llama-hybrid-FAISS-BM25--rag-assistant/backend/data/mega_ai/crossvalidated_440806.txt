Are concept and hypothesis the same in the context of concept learning?

The lecturer is computing the size of concept space , regarding the EnjoySport example in Tom M. Mitchell. Machine Learning (free)  Sky: sunny, cloudy, rainy  Air Temp: warm, cold  Humidity: normal, high  Wind: strong, weak  Water: warm, cold  Forecast: same, change the result that professor gives is $2^{96}$ . I am not sure if concept and hypothesis are the same in the context of concept learning, yet I have no idea about the difference between them. assume they are the same, then the size of that concept space is the size of the size of the hypothesis space in the EnjoySport learning task, which is 973, per EXERCISE 2.1 in that book. What am I missing?
