Before calculating the pseudo- $R^2$ for your logistic regression, I want to ask you, do you think McFadden’s or McKelvey-Zavoina’s pseudo- $R^2$ measures good enough? The paper has been published. Surrogate R-squared measure Cannot find a suitable R-squared measure for binary or ordinal data regression models? Here comes our new research product: the surrogate R-squared. An R package is available here SurrogateRsq . Old answer: Firstly, the McFadden’s Pseudo- $R^2$ of the logistic model does not imply the proportion of the variance of the response explained by explanatory variables at all. But one of the purposes of developing a goodness-of-fit is this property. So I want to go deeper and broader for you to think about what could be a good goodness-of-fit measure for the logit/probit model. Before answering this question, I want to emphasize “comparability” first. This is the reason why the OLS $R^2$ is such an extensively used measure of goodness of fit. It is useful because we can compare the $R^2$ of different models to get an idea about how each model performs to fit the data and what their adequacy of them is. Another aspect of the “comparability” is when we compare models across different samples! consider the study of job satisfaction where data may be collected in three different fashions using (a) a quantitative score on a scale of 0-100; (b) a dichotomous indicator Yes/No, or (c) a five-category rating ranging from extremely unsatisfied to extremely satisfied. Although neither the samples nor the empirical models used to draw inferences are the same, “most empirical researchers are explicitly or implicitly making rough comparisons of ‘goodness of fit’ across” these models and samples, because they address similar domain questions (Veall and Zimmermann, 1996). In social studies, “the research experience in the area is far more important than any statistical criteria” such as what specific method is used to select variables (Veall and Zimmermann, 1996). We believe it is vital to have a goodness-of-fit measure for logit/probit models that is analogous to the OLS R2, as it will ensure the comparability of different models across different samples for similar research questions. There is no existing pseudo- $R^2$ known so far that can meet all the needs. To solve this issue, we have developed a new goodness-of-fit measure to resemble the OLS R-squared that can also imply the proportion of the variance of the surrogate response explained by explanatory variables. We have had the paper " A new goodness-of-fit measure for probit models: surrogate $R^2$ " published with all the details. Please check the package webpage as well: https://xiaoruizhu.github.io/SurrogateRsq/ . Old answer: Be careful with the calculation of Pseudo- $R^2$ : McFadden’s Pseudo- $R^2$ is calculated as $R^2_M=1- \frac{ln\hat{L}_{full}}{ln\hat{L}_{null}}$ , where $ln\hat{L}_{full}$ is the log-likelihood of full model, and $ln\hat{L}_{full}$ is log-likelihood of model with only intercept. Two approaches to calculate Pseudo- $R^2$ : Use deviance: since $deviance = -2*ln(L_{full})$ , $null.deviance = -2*ln(L_{null})$ pR2 = 1 - mod$deviance / mod$null.deviance # works for glm But the above approach doesn't work for out-of-sample Pseudo $R^2$ Use the "logLik" function in R and definition(also works for in-sample) mod_null This can be slightly modified to compute out-of-sample Pseudo $R^2$ Example: out-of-sample pseudo-R Usually, the out-of-sample pseudo- $R^2$ is calculated as $$R_p^2=1−\frac{L_{est.out}}{L_{null.out}},$$ where $L_{est.out}$ is the log-likelihood for the out-of-sample period based on the estimated coefficients of the in-sample period, while and $L_{null.out}$ is the log-likelihood for an intercept-only model for the out-of-sample period.
