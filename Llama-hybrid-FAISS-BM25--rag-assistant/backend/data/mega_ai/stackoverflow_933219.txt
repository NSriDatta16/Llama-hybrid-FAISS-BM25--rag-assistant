Since you're loading the content via AJAX, the animation and functionality that were present before the reload will not work anymore because the effects were only bound to the original elements. To fix this, you need to re-bind the loaded content to the animations, etc. There are a couple of ways to do this. Firstly, you could just re-apply your animation functions to the loaded content. For example, once the content has loaded, call a function that re-binds the animations to the new elements. Secondly, and more easily, you can use the jQuery live() function. This is the better method in my opinion. The live() function binds all current and future elements, instead of just binding current elements. So when creating your animation, create it inside the live() function. Here is a usage example from http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live : $("p").live("click", function(){ $(this).after(" Another paragraph! "); });
