As suggested by Mike, for binomial data (e.g. counts over a total - or binary data), logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than ANOVAs of transformed data. However, for non-binomial data you can try the logit transformation log (p/(1-p)) is proposed as an alternative trasnformation. The arcsine classic transformation for proportion data seems o became an historical antiquity. See the paper by Warton and Hui ,
