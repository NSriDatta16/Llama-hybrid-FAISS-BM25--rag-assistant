The convolutional generation process is called unpooling and "deconvolution"(formally transposed convolutional layer) as shown above. And we can also use RNN to generate pixels as stated in these paper: DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation and Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks . Reference: 1.
