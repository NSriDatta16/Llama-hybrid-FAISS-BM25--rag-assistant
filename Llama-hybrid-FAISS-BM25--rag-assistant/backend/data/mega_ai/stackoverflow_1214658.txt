CakePHP: Shared Hosting Dilemma

I'm having trouble with uploading my cakePHP project on a shared hosting ( from hostgator ). Here is what I have done: I've organized my cake distribution like this: home/user/app home/user/cake/cake home/user/cake/vendors home/user/cake/.htaccess home/user/cake/index.php I have taken the content of webroot directory from app and put it in home/user/public_html I've modified this file home/user/public_html/index.php ( the one that was in app/webroot ) changing these lines like this: define('ROOT', DS.'home'.DS.'user'); define('APP_DIR', 'app'); define('CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH', DS.'home'.DS.'user'.DS.'cake'); And that's about it. MY PROBLEM IS THE FOLLOWING: I have managed to deal with all the problems involved in the default index.php cakePHP page and I have a green and fully functional so to say, project. So when I access my "/", I get: "Your tmp directory is writable. The FileEngine is being used for caching. To change the config edit APP/config/core.php Your database configuration file is present. Cake is able to connect to the database." Now, I've created a model-view-controller with a mysql database background (like in the 15 min Blog Tutorial ), but when I'm trying to access some views ( e.g. /posts )...it gives me a blank page ( this worked perfect on my local machine virtual server apache ). What configuration am I missing ? Thank you. EDIT: Apparently I had problems with the hosting. My URL was something like: http://gator111.hostgator.com/~username/ and all I had to do was add an extra line in the webroot .htaccess: RewriteBase /~username/ Thanks for the support.
