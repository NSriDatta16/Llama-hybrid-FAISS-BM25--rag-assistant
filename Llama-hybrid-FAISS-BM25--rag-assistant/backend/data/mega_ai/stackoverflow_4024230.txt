Strange User Agent With Google Chrome

I was working with some javascript and found a strange user agent with my Google Chrome. I have Google Chrome 7.0.517.41 beta installed on my Ubuntu Laptop. Now AFAIK my user agent should be something close to Chrome/7.0.517.41 but it is showing me: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.41 Safari/534.7 Why is this happening.. I have disabled all the installed extensions but it is still the same..
