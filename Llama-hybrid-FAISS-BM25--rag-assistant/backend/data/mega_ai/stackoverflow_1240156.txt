If your website is completely user-generated content (UGC), it makes no sense to spread the word too far before there's any content. People will come, look at that empty ghost town, move along and never come back. A good strategy is to set up a front page just with the pitch and a place for interested people to leave their emails, then invite them to a closed beta period (maybe giving each a couple invites). It might help to pay some people to add seed content in the beginning. But do NOT, under ANY circumstance, give any prizes or any kind of financial incentive to users before you have a strong enough organic community to set the standard of what good content looks like and to help you weed out the cheaters. As for deployment, unless it takes forever (which it shouldn't) you should do it as often as possible. Especially in the beginning, where you're trying to gain the trust and support of the early adopters. Showing responsiveness to their feedback is the best way to have them help you more. At this point, with a small enough number of users, you can send private messages thanking them for their feedback and saying it's been fixed, and they'll feel very special about it.
