Just been through this myself. From SQL Books Online, here's what I found out... To get or set Job object properties, users must be a member of the SQLAgentUserRole database role on the MSDB database, or be the owner of the job, or be a member of the sysadmin fixed server role. To create a job, users must be a member of the SQLAgentUserRole, SQLAgentReaderRole, and SQLAgentOperatorRole database roles on the MSDB database, or be a member of the sysadmin fixed server role. To drop a job, users must be a member of the SQLAgentUserRole database role on the MSDB database, or be the owner of the job, or be a member of the sysadmin fixed server role.
