I agree in terms of the Model folder. You can organize it to your heart's content (BLL, DAL, etc.). I personally would avoid doing a separate assembly unless you have a compelling reason to. Being the kind of developer that tends to over-complicate problems if I'm not careful, I try to follow the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) practices as much as possible, which tends to keep me out of a certain amount of trouble.
