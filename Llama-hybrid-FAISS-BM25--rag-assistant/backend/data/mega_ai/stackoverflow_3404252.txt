If you use ssh-keys, you won't need to code passwords in shell scripts. You could even encrypt the key with a passphrase, and use ssh-agent to manage the key for you -- you unlock your key in the morning, start your tunnel, and then forget your key when you head to lunch, unlock your key in the afternoon, and forget it again when you go home at night. No on-disk magic gateway to remote machines.
