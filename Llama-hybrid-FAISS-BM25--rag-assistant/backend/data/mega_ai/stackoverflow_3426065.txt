You are running into confusion in your search results because the term hash is overloaded , as is the concept of parameter passing. You are seeing references to the concept of passing values in a hash beacause an associative array is called a hash in some languages (which is short for a hash table). The # character is also confusingly named. It is called, "hash", "pound", "number" and "octothorpe". Since I grew up in the US, I call it a "pound sign" in my head, which is likely annoying to users of more British English, and is no less fraught with potential for confusion (consider "Â£"). Passing function arguments in a hash in Perl is a nice way to get named arguments for a routine. PHP has positional arguments only, but using an Array works nicely there. Many web libraries use a hash/associative array type structure for form values. Keys are typically the field id, and values are the field values. In a URI the # denotes the start of the fragment specifier. It identifies a part of the page that the URI points to. It is generally not used to pass request information from the client back to the server.
