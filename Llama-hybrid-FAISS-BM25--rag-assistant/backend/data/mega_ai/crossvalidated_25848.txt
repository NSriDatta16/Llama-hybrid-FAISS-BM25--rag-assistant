How to 'sum' a standard deviation?

I have a monthly average for a value and a standard deviation corresponding to that average. I am now computing the annual average as the sum of monthly averages, how can I represent the standard deviation for the summed average ? For example considering output from a wind farm: Month MWh StdDev January 927 333 February 1234 250 March 1032 301 April 876 204 May 865 165 June 750 263 July 780 280 August 690 98 September 730 76 October 821 240 November 803 178 December 850 250 We can say that in the average year the wind farm produces 10,358 MWh, but what is the standard deviation corresponding to this figure ?
