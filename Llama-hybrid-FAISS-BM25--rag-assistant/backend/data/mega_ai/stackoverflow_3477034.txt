I think C++ is like the Roman empire. Its big, and too established to fix the things that are going to destroy it. c++0x - and boost - are examples of a horrible horrible syntax - the kind of baby only its parents can love - and are a long long way from the simple elegant (but severely limited) c++ of 10 years ago. The point is, by the time one has "fixed" something as terribly simple as comparisons of integral types, enough legacy & existing c++ code has been broken that one might as well just call it a new language. And once broken, there is so much else that is also eligible for retroactive fixing.
