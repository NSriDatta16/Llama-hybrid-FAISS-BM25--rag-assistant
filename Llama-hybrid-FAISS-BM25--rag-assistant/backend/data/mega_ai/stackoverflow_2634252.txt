Nested classes are classes that are declared within classes, but have the modifier static . They are a way of organizing the class so that it has access to the private declarations of its outer class, and can be used to better indicate the relationship between the outer and nested class. They are different from inner classes (declared the same way but without the static) in that an inner class has to have an instance of the outer class as a reference to be able to be instantiated. A nested class, by contrast, isn't tied to a specific instance of the outer class. EDIT: In response to those who say that a "nested class" can be both a static nested class or an inner class. OK, but you would never call an inner class a nested class, would you? Sure that isn't by the spec ( A nested class is any class whose declaration occurs within the body of another class or interface. ) But it is how it is used in practice.
