Absolutely! Learning C will improve your assembler programming as well. As you learn C you will start to transfer the structured method to your assembler programming. I noticed that the more I learn of high level languages the better the organization and understandability of my assemble language programming. It is very useful to be able to mix C and assembler. Being able to use both in a single project allows you to use the appropriate solution in any given situation within that project. For most tasks C is quicker to code, occasionally the opposite is true, assembly language is quicker. Sometimes the assembly language is better able to express a particular aspect of a solution (assembler's close mapping to the hardware can make programming I/O or device management clearer). For more abstract concepts C can be clearer (C++ can be better again). The same goes for learning C++. I find myself using an object oriented approach to both my C and assembler programming. In the end it's horses for courses. Use the appropriate language for the problem at hand.
