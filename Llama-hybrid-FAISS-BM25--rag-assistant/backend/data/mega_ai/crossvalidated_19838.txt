You'd still want your layman to know the calculus, as marginal effect is the derivative of a fitted probability with respect to the variable of interest. As fitted probability is the link function (logit, probit or whatever) applied to the fitted values, you need the chain rule to compute it. So, in linear index models (where parameters enter as something like X'b) it is equal to the parameter estimate times the derivative of the link function. As the derivative is different at different values of the regressors (unlike the case of a linear model), you have to decide, where to evaluate the marginal effect. A natural choice would be mean values of all the regressors. Another approach would be to evaluate the effect for the each observation and then average over them. The interpretation differs accordingly.
