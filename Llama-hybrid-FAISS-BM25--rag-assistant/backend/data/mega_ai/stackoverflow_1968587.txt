Storage for Write Once Read Many

I have a list of 1 million digits. Every time the user submit an input, I would need to do a matching of the input with the list. As such, the list would have the Write Once Read Many (WORM) characteristics? What would be the best way to implement storage for this data? I am thinking of several options: A SQL Database but is it suitable for WORM (UPDATE: using VARCHAR field type instead of INT) One file with the list A directory structure like /1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0 (but this one would be taking too much space) A bucket system like /12345/67890/ What do you think? UPDATE: The application would be a web application.
