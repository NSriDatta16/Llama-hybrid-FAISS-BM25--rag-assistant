For what you want, it is probably best not to use a grammar. But it requires that the users do the "minimal" basic training of the speech recognition engine. It's not very long and relatively pleasant. And it really makes a difference on the recognition accuracy (believe me, I have a strong French accent in my English). It can even be included as a preliminary practice for the game itself. You may find interesting to see this CodeRage 4 session on "Speech Enabling Delphi Applications (zip)"
