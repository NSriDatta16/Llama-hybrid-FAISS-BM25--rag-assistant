The short answer is, "This is not really the most effective way to use C++." When used correctly, the strong type system, the ability to pass by reference, and idioms like RAII make C++ programs more likely to be correct, readable, and maintainable. No one can stop you from using the language the way you want to. But you may be limiting yourself by not learning and leveraging actual C++ features. If you write code that other people will have to read and maintain, they will probably appreciate the use of "real C++" instead of "C with classes" (in the words of a previous commenter).
