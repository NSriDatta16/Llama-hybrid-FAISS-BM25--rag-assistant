Given the regularity of the data, I would start by simply drawing a collection of straight-line segments through the oscillating data. This presumes that you have some understanding of what is causing the sinusoidal trend (and, after talking to the right people, there may be an explanation that also lends itself to modeling). Compute the linear coefficients of the straight line segments via regression. Using these results, you can now detrended series (or an approximation to it). Then, apply time series modeling to determine the order and nature (autoregressive, moving average,...), etc. to the detrended series. Having accomplished this, do work on explaining the sinusoidal pattern. Based on any improved sinusoidal trend, detrend and re-examining your time series analysis. Check your model based on the accuracy of new data point forecasts.
