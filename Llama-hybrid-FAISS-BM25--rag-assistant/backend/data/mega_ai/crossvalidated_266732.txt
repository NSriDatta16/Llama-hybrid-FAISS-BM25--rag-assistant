Variable selection for multiple linear regression: lasso, stepwise or something else?

I have to do an analysis in order to find the correlation between an agent questionnaire and a usability questionnaire both of which are using Likert scales. I only have 90 samples and 25 predictors so I need to reduce them; otherwise I'm overfitting my model, right? I was wondering what type of regression I should do. I read an example in a book about statistical methods for user experience that uses stepwise but a couple of friends suggested $L_1$ or LASSO.
