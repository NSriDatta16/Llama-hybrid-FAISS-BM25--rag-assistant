I think you should start from defining a kind of "measure" which will tell you which layout is the best one, e.g. take the sum of the (average_size - actual_size(column))^2 for all columns. Then, because you always have 3 columns (is that right?) it should be reasonably fast to take all possible divisions and find the one maximising your measure.
