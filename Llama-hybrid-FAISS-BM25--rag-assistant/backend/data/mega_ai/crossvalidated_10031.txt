How to handle categorical dependent variable using logistic regression when one of the categories never occurs in the sample

I have a multinomial logistic regression model. One of the output categories is not observed in the data set that I'm using. Example: 4 different diagnoses (response variable) in the population, but in the sample, Type 3 never occurred 5 hormone level measurements (predictors) Question What books/papers discuss the mathematics of handling this situation in logistic regression?
