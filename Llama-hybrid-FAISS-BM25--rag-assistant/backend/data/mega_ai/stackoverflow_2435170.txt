tcpdump on dd-wrt router

I'm trying to capture packets from two devices on my network. I have tcpdump installed on my dd-wrt router and working correctly. However, the only packets I capture are broadcast packets when using a tcpdump statement that states only those two devices ./tcpdump -w /tmp/capture.pcap dst 192.168.3.105 or src 192.168.3.105 or dst 192.168.3.136 or src 192.168.3.136 I'm capturing on intefface br0. Is that correct? Both devices are plugged in directly to the ports 1 and 2 with ip addresses 192.168.3.105 and 192.168.3.136 respectively. Do I need to set br0 in promiscuous mode? A little stuck. Thanks.
