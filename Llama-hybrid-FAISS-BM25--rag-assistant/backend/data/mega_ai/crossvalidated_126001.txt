How to understand this ACF

I have two time series. After calculating the ACF, they are like the plot below. Does anyone know the meaning of this ACF plot? I know it's non-stationary time series, but I don't know how the lags can help me to build the model. My data are as below: Year,Parea,Uarea 1950,3435829.43 ,144179.7476 1955,3619503.16 ,168028.4699 1960,3881482.63 ,196839.0495 1965,4310040.34 ,229032.161 1970,4950230.51 ,262543.7928 1975,6216028.19 ,297502.4439 1980,7062749.74 ,337481.6276 1985,8187770.34 ,381059.4338 1990,9893501.67 ,432255.4666 1995,12011196.93 ,487330.1703 2000,13327189.88 ,546829.7056 2005,15231484.09 ,612606.1358 2010,16986859.05 ,683200.605 2014,18097951.40 ,743693 And I have doubts about my sample size and time-series data analysis~ My purpose for these data analysis are: 1) do the Granger Causal Relation Test between PArea and UArea. 2) build ARIMAs for PArea and UArea, respectively. But my data points are only 14, may be insufficient for purpose of my data analysis~ I wander if I can interpolate the values between the middle years to extend sample range?
