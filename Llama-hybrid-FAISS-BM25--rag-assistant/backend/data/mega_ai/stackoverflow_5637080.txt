Add value to dynamically populated list c#

I'm constructing a web page based on ASN.NET MVC3 with Razor templates and Entity. The task is to populate a @Html.DropDownList from the database, so far so good but now I want to insert a static value in the DropDownList. The code looks as follows The create method public ActionResult Create() { var parents = db.Organizations.OrderBy(o => o.Title).ToList(); var organization = new Organization(); return View(organization); } Extract from the Razor template @Html.DropDownList("ParentGuid", new SelectList(ViewBag.Organizations as System.Collections.IEnumerable, "ParentGuid", "Title", Model.ParentGuid)) So, the above code works but Im stuck in figuring out how to insert an empty row in the dropdown.
