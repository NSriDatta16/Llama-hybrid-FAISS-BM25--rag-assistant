From your description I don't see how it could increase the probability of a single player getting a rare card. There does not seem to be any interaction between the probability of getting a rare card and the number of packs opened. I suppose you mean that if, let's say, on average each 12th pack contains a rare card, then it is easier to be the 12th person when there are more packs being opened, but bear in mind that pack openings are (hopefully) independent trials. That means, if you have opened a pack and did not get a special card, it gives you no information whatsoever about the probability of getting a card upon opening the next pack.
