Why is the error square equivalent to variance of error?

I'm confused as to why is V( $\hat β$ ) = E[ $\ εε^t$ ] What's an intuitive explanation for this? Additionally, is this the reason why when we run Breusch Pagan test, we regress $ \ ε^2$ on independent variables because we are implicitly running variance on independent variables? Thank you !
