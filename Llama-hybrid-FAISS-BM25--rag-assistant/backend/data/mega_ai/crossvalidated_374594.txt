These answers were provided at https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-meta-analysis/2018-October/001228.html Estimated a covariance matrix using the ClubSandwich package, and run the analysis with a range of values for ‘r’: Vlist $vi, cluster = mydata_multi$ studyid, r=0.5 ) Where yi is the calculated effect size, ‘posneg’ is the label describing whether the results of that row refers to positive or negative symptoms, and ‘studyid’ is a separate label for each study. MultiMeta Using struct="CS" assumes that the amount of heterogeneity is the same for positive and negative symptoms, which may not be the case. To test for a difference between positive and negative symptoms, you can compute the contrast between the two estimates with: anova(MultiMeta, L=c(-1,1)) Alternatively, fit the model with 'mods = ~factor(posneg)'. Then one of the two levels becomes the reference level (and hence the intercept) and the coefficient for the other level is the difference between the two levels. You should get the same p-value for this coefficient as when computing the contrast as shown above. To add to Wolfgang's suggestions, it's also possible to test for differences between positive and negative symptoms using robust variance estimation. The advantage of doing so is that the hypothesis test/confidence interval is not predicated on having accurately imputed the within-study correlations between effect size estimates. Example code below. James library(clubSandwich) # Separate intercepts model MultiMeta
