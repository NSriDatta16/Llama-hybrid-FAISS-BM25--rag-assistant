When dealing with percentages like this, you wouldn't simply take an "arithmetic" average as the result wouldn't be meaningful. Instead, you'll do different kind of averaging. In your example, the arithmetic (regular) mean over all 7 weeks is 1.05 (assuming you add a one to each value). But if you had gained 5% each week, then after 7 weeks, you'd be left with a total return of 40.7%. In reality though, you end up with a total return of 33.2%. So that begs the question, "what average weekly gain would result in a total return of 33.2%?" The answer is 4.19%. The way you figure out this number is simple. You take the "geometric mean" which is defined as $(x_1 \times x_2 \times ... \times x_n)^{1/n}$. In your case, $x_1=1.05$, $x_2=1.1$, etc.
