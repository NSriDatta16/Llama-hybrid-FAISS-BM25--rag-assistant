a Date is a point in time, it has no format (like numbers: they don't have format). When you display the date, obviously it has to get a format: if you don't specifically give Oracle a format, the default format for your session will be used (session parameter NLS_DATE_FORMAT). In consequence: use the DATE datatype for date arithmetics and storage (no format). Use the to_char function or something equivalent when you need to display the date (in a report or in the GUI).
