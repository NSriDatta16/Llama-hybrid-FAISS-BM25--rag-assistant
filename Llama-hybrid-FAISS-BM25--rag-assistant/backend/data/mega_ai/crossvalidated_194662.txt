You can conceive of the individual ratios as slopes of lines through the origin, and (conditioning on the status-1 values) the combined ratio (or mediant ) as a weighted average slope. Let $r_A = A_2/A_1$ and so on. Then $v=\frac{A_2+B_2+C_2}{A_1+B_1+C_1} = \frac{A_1\,r_A +B_1\,r_B+C_1\,r_C }{A_1+B_1+C_1}$ So seeing the status-1 values as weights, that's a weighted average of the ratios. For example, if the subscript $1$ (initial status) represented some initial exposure, you could call it an exposure-weighted average of the individual slopes. If all the values are positive, we can see various things as a result; for example, the value of the mediant must lie between the largest and the smallest individual ratios.
