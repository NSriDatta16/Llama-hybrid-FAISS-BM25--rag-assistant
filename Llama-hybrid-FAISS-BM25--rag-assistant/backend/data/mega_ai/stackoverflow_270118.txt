Did you mean the automatic properties or the in-place assignment? Depends on your team IMO. If your team were comprised of C-style devs. Then I think it is ok. But if this code is gonna be maintained further by, say, VB developers, then you'd need to make this more readable. Examples? The assignment operator (=) in C langauges also return the values it's assigned. var a = 0; var b = 0; // This makes a *and* b equals to 1 a = b = 1; // This line prints 3 and a is now equals to 3 Console.WriteLine(a = 3); // This line prints 7 and a and b is now equals to 7 Console.WriteLine(a = b = 7); I think it is rather natural for this kind of assignment to happen. Because the C-languages seem to encourage shorthand notations IMO. If you need more readability and less trouble, then I'd say a newline is a nice add. displayReport( ReportClass.ReportName = cmbReportName.SelectedValue.ToString()); Make your intentions clearer when each compounded statements are on different lines. (but still a compound statement) Or, extract the right part out into its own variable first, e.g. var reportName = cmbReportName.SelectedValue.ToString(); displayReport(ReportClass.ReportName = reportName); I use it all the time, and I havn't seen anyone confused upon reading it yet.
