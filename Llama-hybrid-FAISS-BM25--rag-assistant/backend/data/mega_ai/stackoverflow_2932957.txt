Verify that you meet the following requirements: http://www.magentocommerce.com/system-requirements Magento only runs on php 5.2.x, not 5.3. Also make sure the extensions listed on the requirements page are enabled. Might be different for you, but I can check the php version using php -v Edit Also what c-verde said about using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost: This isn't your current problem, but you'll run into it later. You need to be able to accept cookies to log into Magento. Your browser won't accept cookies for local sites. In /etc/hosts you need to add 127.0.0.1 localhost.com And when you install magento you need to use either localhost.com or 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. I didn't have this problem with linux, but when installing on windows, it took several minutes after the config page to set up magento. Make sure the browser isn't doing anything.
