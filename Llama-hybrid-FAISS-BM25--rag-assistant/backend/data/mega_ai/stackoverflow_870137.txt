WPF: How to attach mouse events to a viewmodel?

I am trying to use the MVVM pattern for the first time. So I have an ItemsControl filled with my viewmodel objects, displayed using DataTemplate 's; the objects are "nodes" and "edges" represented in DataTemplate 's with Thumb and Polyline objects and I want to be able to detect clicks and drags on the ItemsControl in order to move the nodes and edges. Two questions: How do I attach mouse event handlers to the Polyline 's and Thumb 's to be handled by the little viewmodels? (I could attach a Thumb.DragDelta handler to the ItemsControl and e.OriginalSource points to the Thumb , but how do I get the corresponding viewmodel object?) How do I attach mouse event handlers to the ItemsControl to detect mouse clicks and drags on blank space? (answer is below) Note: I know it might not be considered a proper ViewModel if it's directly handling events of the View. But the important point is, I need to handle mouse events and I am not sure how to attach them.
