Cross-database queries with different DB names in different environments?

How would you handle cross database queries in different environments. For example, db1-development and db2-development, db1-production and db2-production. If I want to do a cross-database query in development from db2 to db1 I could use the fully qualified name, [db1-development].[schema].[table]. But how do I maintain the queries and stored procedures between the different environments? [db1-development].[schema].[table] will not work in production because the database names are different. I can see search and replace as a possible solution but I am hoping there is a more elegant way to solve this problem. If there are db specific solutions, I am using SQL Server 2005.
