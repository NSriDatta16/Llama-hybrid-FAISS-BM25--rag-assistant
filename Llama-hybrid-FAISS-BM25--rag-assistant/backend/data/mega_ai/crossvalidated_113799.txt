Arima model for non-negative data

I have been reading a tutorial for an introduction to time series. It contains a dataset, with an $Arima(2,0,0)$ forecast along with a 80% and 95% prediction interval. It looks like this: This model was chosen due to the behaviour of the partial autocorrelation function ("it is zero after lag 2"). However, as the tutorial later explains, there is a clear problem with this modelling approach. The prediction interval predicts some negative values, which would be invalid for this data. (The data is assumed to be $\geq 0$). The forecast errors also have undesirable properties. My question: How would you address this issue? Some of my thoughts: transforming the data $x$ using $\log(x+1)$. Is this a respected method? Any pros / cons I should know about? any predicted values $
