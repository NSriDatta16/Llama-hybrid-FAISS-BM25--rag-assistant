what is the best way to measure code coverage against a single spec with ruby?

I typically do rake spec:rcov but that measures code coverage across all tests. I would like a way to measure code coverage from one spec to help ensure that each model's spec is testing the full model rather relying on side effects in other tests. Any ideas?
