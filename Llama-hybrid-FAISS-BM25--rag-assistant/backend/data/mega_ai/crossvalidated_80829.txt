The closest thing I've found so far is John Fox's Effects Package . The package is both actively maintained and extremely mature â€” you can read this 2003 paper about it in the Journal of Statistical Software . I was able to use it recently to do most of what I had been doing in my own little package. The code to use it is less fragile and more clear. With the package, you construct a list and set the xlevels so that they include a range across your x-axis variable while holding the rest at the values of the prototypical individual(s). The effect() function will return an object that contains both predicted values and 95% confidence intervals for a variety of different types of model objects. The package includes a good deal of plotting code. Although these plots are instructive and useful, they are rather "old-school R" and not publication quality. That said, the eff (or effpoly ) object includes all the data necessary to construct a dataset to render beautifully with ggplot2 or similar.
