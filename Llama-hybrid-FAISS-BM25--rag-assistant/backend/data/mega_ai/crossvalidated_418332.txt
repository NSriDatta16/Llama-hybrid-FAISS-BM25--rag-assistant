Linear model on decompose time series in R and interpretation

I am a newbie in time series. I need a help with an interpretation of simple example of time series. I would like to analyze whether trends over time of time series significantly increases/decreases independently from seasonal and random effects(H0: trends does not significantly increase). Firstly, I want to decompose the time series "AirPassengers". Time is indexed as natural numbers. Finally, I use linear model regression and assess coef, se and p-value. Let's see the code: library(lmtest) library(data.table) library(tidyr) ###SIMPLE EXAMPLE data(AirPassengers) d Here's is plot of d$trend t % drop_na(value) t$time |t|) (Intercept) 100.649901 1.919275 52.442 I interpret the outcome as significant (p
