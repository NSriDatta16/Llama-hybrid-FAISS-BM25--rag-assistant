How to fit an appropriate SDE

Does any one know how we can fit an appropriate SDE to a time series data? how to understand which model will describe the model well? and then how to estimate its parameters? To be more specified, I am working on stock market data and I need to forecast and I am confused by using Fractional noise or Heston model or any other model. I appreciate your help.
