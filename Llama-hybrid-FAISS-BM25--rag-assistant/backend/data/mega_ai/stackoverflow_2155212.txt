Sockets Editor?

Currently I am developing an online game using sockets. I would like to know some way to debug whatever it send or receive. I remember when I played ragnarok, there was a program that detect the sockets that you receive and send, and you could edit them and send again. I would like to find a program like this, for debugging purporses only.
