Even if it is not a performance hit, it could be a problem in data integrity as FKs can't be enforced across databases. However, it is more likely your procs need to be tuned especially if they are thousands of lines long. To begin with look for cursors, correlated subqueries and bad indexing. Also look for where clauses that are nonsaragable and scalar functions that are runing row-by-agonizing-row. Of course the best way to prove that the separate database is not the issue is to take one slow proc and convert those tables to one database and test performance both ways. Please at least convince them to do this smaller test before they go ahead and make the horribly complicated and time consuming change to one database and then find out they still have performance problems. And remember, the execution plan is your friend is looking at these things.
