I'd take a graphical approach. The x-axis could be average rating and the y could be number of ratings. I used to do this with sports statistics to compare the contribution of young phenoms with that of veteran stars. The nearer a point is to the upper right corner, the closer to the ideal. Of course, deciding on the "best" item would still be a subjective decision, but this would provide some structure. If you want to plot average rating against another variable, then you could set up number of ratings as the third variable using bubble size, in a bubble plot--e.g., in XL or SAS.
