Combined average for priority and due date

Assume that a task exists with two attributes: priority and due date. Priority p is a numeric value. The priority importance increases to infinity, meaning that 5 is a priority higher than 4. Priority 0 is normal priority. Due date d is a date in the past or in the future, when compared with the current date. A d date before now is more important than a date in the future. The idea is to combine these two attributes, priority and due date, according to the rules above, in order to produce a numeric output that can be used to order a list of tasks. This should be possible to model as a math function but I am rusty, to say the least, in that field. I am even not convinced if it should be a 2D function or a 3D function. I started by a 2D graph where x-axis is for priority and y-axis is for the difference between the current date and the due date. The upper left quadrant A1 has due dates in the past and high priorities. The upper right quadrant A2 has due dates in the future and high priorities. The lower left quadrant A3 has due dates in the past and low priorities. The lower right quadrant A4 has due dates in the future and low priorities. Any guys with math knowledge that can throw a fee pointers?
