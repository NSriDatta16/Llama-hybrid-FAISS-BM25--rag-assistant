Is MyID indexed? If so, then Access shouldn't be dragging the entire table across from the server. I'm not sure where you're getting the criteria from, though, as that's not the SQL that a form filter is going to send. Or even a saved QueryDef with a hardwired reference to a control on a form. Try dropping .Value (it's redundant as it's the default property). Also, if it's a saved QueryDef, try defining the control reference as a parameter, i.e., PARAMETERS Forms!MyForm!MyControl Long; . Basically, nothing that you report is standard Access behavior with ODBC linked tables to SQL Server. If it were, Access would be hell to upsize, and it's not at all.
