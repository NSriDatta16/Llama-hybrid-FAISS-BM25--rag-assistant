It's really about how NHibernate session works. So if you within a session pull an instance of your CustomerDTO and then after a while you should get the same CustomerDTO (say by primary key) - you actually will get reference to the very same object like you did in your first retrieval. So what you do is that you either merge the objects by calling session.Merge or you ask your session for the object by calling session.Get(primaryKey) do your updates and flush the session. However as suggested by Steve - this is not usually what you do - you really want to get your domain object from the datastore and use DTOs (if neede) for transferring the data to UI, webservice whatever...
