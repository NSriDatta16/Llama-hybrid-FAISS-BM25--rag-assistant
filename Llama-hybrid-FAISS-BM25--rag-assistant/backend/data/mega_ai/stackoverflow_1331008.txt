Astoria Error - Expected an absolute, well formed http URL without a query or fragment

I'm trying out my ADO.NET Data Service for the first time by having the model create using Entity Framework. I am testing to see if the service works via a client by creating a simple console application. Here is the body of my Main method: MyEntities context = new MyEntities (new Uri("MyEntitiesDataService.svc", UriKind.Relative)); var query = (from c in context.EmployeeSet select c); foreach (Employee emp in query) { Console.WriteLine("{0}", emp.FirstName); } When I reach the first line where the "context" is declared, my debugger jumps to the Reference.cs file where I have the Service Reference within the same project saying "". /// /// Initialize a new MyEntities object. /// public MyEntities(global::System.Uri serviceRoot) : base(serviceRoot) Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong? Or what do you suggest I do to render by services via a console application? Next step will be Silverlight 3.0.
