Get Web Service Context Listner in JAX-WS?

When Web Service in loaded for the first time i need it to send a message(it contains the url to access this service) to one of my installed web applications. This web application is keeping track of alive web services. How can i achieve this? May this is not the right way to do it...but i need a simplistic approach. Can i get access Web Service Context Listner? If its the right way to go... My environment is JAX-WS 2.2, Javaee1.6, Glassfish 3.1.
