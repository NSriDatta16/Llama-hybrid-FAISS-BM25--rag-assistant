Strictly, the means and other summary statistics obtained from binary or ordinal data do not have normally distributed errors and are not homoscedastic. Strictly, ANOVA is not an appropriate tool to analyze such data. There is a controversy in the literature on whether the violations of the assumptions of the ANOVA matter in practice and whether ANOVA should be used to analyze data from Likert scales. Some authors (Vigderhous, 1977; Knapp, 1990; Kuzon, Urbanchek & McCabe, 1996; Jakobsson, 2004; Jamieson, 2004) claim that non-parametric methods should be used instead of ANOVA. Other researchers (Pell, 2005; Carifio & Perla, 2008; Norman, 2010) argue that ANOVA is robust against the violations and since the choice of non-parametric methods results in a loss of power, ANOVA is preferable. As O'Connell (2006) points out in the introduction to her book, there are methods that allow to map Likert scale data to an (latent) interval scale without throwing away the information provided by the data. In particular, I recommend the Ordered categorical regression as described by Gelman & Hill (2006) in chapters 6.5 and 15.2 of their book. Literature Carifio, J., & Perla, R. (2008).
