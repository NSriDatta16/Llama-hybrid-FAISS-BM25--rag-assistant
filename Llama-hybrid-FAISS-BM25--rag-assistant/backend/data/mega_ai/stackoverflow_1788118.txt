Launchd job running every minute

I am attempting to write a launchd script that runs once a day, on weekdays only. But once I load the script, it runs every minute instead of just on-schedule. This happens whether I load the script as myself or as superuser: launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.myname.foojob or sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.myname.foojob This is the plist file: org.myname.foojob Label org.myname.foojob ProgramArguments /Users/myname/bin/foojob.sh StartCalendarInterval Hour 16 Minute 00 Weekday 1 Hour 16 Minute 00 Weekday 2 Hour 16 Minute 00 Weekday 3 Hour 16 Minute 00 Weekday 4 Hour 16 Minute 00 Weekday 5 I'm running this with the original built-in launchd in Mac OSX 10.4. Hopefully it's just something slightly wrong with the plist file. Anybody have an idea?
