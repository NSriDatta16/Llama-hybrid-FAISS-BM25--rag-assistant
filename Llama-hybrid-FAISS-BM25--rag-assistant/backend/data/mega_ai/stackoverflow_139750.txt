In my opinion, jQuery is exceptionally powerful and simple. It uses CSS selector syntax to pull back elements and only adds two functions to the global namespace: jQuery() and $(), which is an alias for jQuery(). There are a massive number of plugins available for jQuery to let you do things like create slide shows, accordion controls, rich calendars, etc. The book "jQuery In Action" is a phenomenal companion to the online reference material. We used it on my last project to create a fairly rich scheduling tool and we liked it so much, we're encouraging it's adoption throughout our consulting company as the defacto standard for all JavaScript use.
