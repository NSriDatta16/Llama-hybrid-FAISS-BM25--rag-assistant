An unfair coin with different face value problem

Could any one give me some hints for the following problem: A coin has two face: 1 and -1/2, and the probability for 1 is $P(x=1)=1/3$ and for $-1/2$ is $P(x=-1/2)=2/3$. The expected value is therefore $E(x)=1\cdot(1/3)+(-1/2)\cdot(2/3) = 0$. Supposing for an infinite tossing, what's the chance that the average value would be bigger than $k$? (supposing the sample number is sufficiently large) Since if the face value are 1 and 0, it is simply a binomial distribution and can be approximate by normal distribution, so I also want to know if this problem can be transformed into binomial distribution $P(x>k)$ ? This is not any homework problem, but a problem I just think of and try to solve.
