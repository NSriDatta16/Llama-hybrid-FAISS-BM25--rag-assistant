Action-specific exception handler HTML in Rails

I've got a bunch of XHR actions in a controller, which return some HTML to insert into the page. If the response is an error, then it puts the output into a special error div. So far, nothing particularly interesting. However, this general process doesn't work for Rails' exception handling. If I raise an exception in my XHR actions, I get the generic 500 error handler output in my error div, which looks a bit horrific. While I can catch all possible exceptions in my action and render a more appropriate error, I lose the standard exception logging and notification, which sucks. So, the only solution I can think of is being able to specify a different 500 handler HTML fragment to use for these specific actions, but I'm not finding much. Anyone got any ideas?
