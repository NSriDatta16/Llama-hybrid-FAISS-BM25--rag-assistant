Ensemble of boolean predictors

Lets say we have a 0/1 predictor, that is right in p % of cases. If we ensemble N of those uncorrelated predictors, what is (an elegant solution for) their accuracy? (The ensemble's answer is the most voted variant.) (Disclaimer: Not a homework, just came across this and I believe that there must be some more elegant solution than doing it by hand)
