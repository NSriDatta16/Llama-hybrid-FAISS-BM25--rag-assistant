There are quite a few available python libraries that could help you work with data. If you could be more specific on the task you wish to accomplish that would help in supplying a better response. Right off the bat, I would suggest using the pandas library. You can look into the documentation here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html . It will help you store your data into a DataFrame object (essentially a table) that will be more tractable. From there, it is a matter of what you wish to do with your data. To visualize it, I would suggest matplotlib which is a great library for graphing points ( https://matplotlib.org/ ). Depending on the classifier you wish to use, you may want to use an sklearn supervised learning module ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html ). If you wish to make a deep neural network, then I would suggest starting out with keras ( https://keras.io/getting_started/ ) or pytorch ( https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ ). It is important to note that all of these libraries are meant to work with machine learning data so many fo the preprocessing steps you might want to do (i.e. processing your categorical values). Hopefully this provides a helpful start for you.
