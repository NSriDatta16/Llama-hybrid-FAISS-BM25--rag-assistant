Tools in Data Science

I am a new one in Data Science and Machine Learning. I have some experience in Java, Python, SQL, Jupyter and most polular libraries like scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras. What tools would you recommend else? And what OS is more suitable for DS (I've heard that Debian)?
