Excel VBA to average based on a time range

I have a series of values (Column B) that have a timestamp (Column A) in hh:mm:ss: AM/PM format. What I am trying to do is average the values in Column B for every 10 minutes past in Column A. For example, I would need to average all the values in Column A from 12:40:00 PM - 12:50:00 PM in Column B. Ideally the code could scan through the entire dataset to produce these 10 minute averages. Thanks in advance
