Linearly, no. One obvious reason is well explained in the comments. Let's further assume it increases linearly as you add more features and it gets saturated at 100 %. Then, random forest would be our silver bullet for any ML problem, but it's not. Let alone random forest, no algorithm provides you with such confidence. It's even not guaranteed to increase the accuracy when you add features and depending on how you tune and validate, you might end up decreasing your accuracy/or any other success metric as well.
