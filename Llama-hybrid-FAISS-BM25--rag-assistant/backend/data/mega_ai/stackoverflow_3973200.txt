How do I concatenate a String literal and a String variable in Java?

String date = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("MM-dd-yyyy").format(new java.util.date()); upload.uploadfile("192.168.0.210", "muruganp", "vm4snk", "/home/media/Desktop/FTP Upload/+date+"_RB.zip"", "/fileserver/filesbackup/Emac/+date+"_RB.zip""); uploadfile is a function which uploads the file 10-20-2010_RB.zip to the server location. But since I do have the string "date" in my path, few errors like illegal start of expression occurs. If I try the same as below, the program works fine. upload.uploadfile("192.168.0.210", "muruganp", "vm4snk", "/home/media/Desktop/FTP Upload/20-10-2010_RB.zip", "/fileserver/filesbackup/Emac/20-10-2010_RB.zip"); For some reasons, I am in a compulsion to insert the string in the file path. How can I attain the end result ? Kindly advise.
