Which distribution to choose in boosting when dataset ist binary in gbm package

I want to use the gbm package for boosting. As one can see, my data is completely binary and I'm kinda stuck which distribtion I should choose. I'm picking all the distributions from the documentation, which confuse me: Laplace (absolute loss) - does that mean, that it's just like a classification error? bernoulli (logistic regression for 0-1 outcomes), ok but huberized (huberized hinge loss for 0-1 outcomes), classes), adaboost (the AdaBoost exponential loss for 0-1 outcomes) also seem to be appropriate for 0-1 outcomes. So what is the right one in that particular dataset? str(df) data.frame': 1201 obs. of 321 variables: $ Y : Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ KC35: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 ... $ KP5Z: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 ... $ KG9J: Factor w/ 2 levels "0","1": 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 ... ...
