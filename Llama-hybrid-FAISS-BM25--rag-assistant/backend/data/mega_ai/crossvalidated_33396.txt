IrishStat makes a good point. If your data are two time series you have to take correaltion into account when comparing means. But the time series modeling is even more important because if the series are nonstationary because of a time-changing mean it may not make sense to just compare the averages over the length of the series. How the indices change with time would be more likely to be what you are interested in.
