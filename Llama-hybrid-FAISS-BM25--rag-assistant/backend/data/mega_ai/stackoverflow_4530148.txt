You can use convertPoint:toView: method of UIView. It is used to convert a point from one view's coordinate system to another. See Converting Between View Coordinate Systems section of UIView class reference. There are more methods available. -edit- You are using the wrong point when calling convertPoint: method. The given point should be in dragView's coordinate system where as dragView.center is in its superview's coordinate system. Use the following point and it should give you the center of dragView in its own coordinate system. CGPoint p; p = CGPointMake(dragView.bounds.size.width * 0.5, dragView.bounds.size.height * 0.5);
