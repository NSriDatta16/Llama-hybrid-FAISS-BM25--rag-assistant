Image resolution and PPI do matter in the context of object detection and recognition. Whether you're using a convolutional neural network, traditional computer vision methods, or just looking with your own eyes, if you have an object that only spans 4 by 4 pixels in an image, then you won't be able to detect it reliably by any means unless it is has a unique and distinctive color within the scene. Even then, another object with the same color at the right distance would be mistaken for it because there simply aren't enough pixels to tell the difference. The concept behind this is called pixel density. Different computer vision tasks, regardless of their proposed solution, require different minimum pixel densities. If we're interested in humans, for example, here's a great example:
