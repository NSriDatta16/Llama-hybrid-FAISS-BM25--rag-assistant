Perceptron models are contained within the set of neural net models. A (single layer) perceptron is a single layer neural network that works as a linear binary classifier. Being a single layer neural network it can be trained without the use of more advanced algorithms like back propagation and instead can be trained by "stepping towards" your error in steps specified by a learning rate. When someone says perceptron, I usually think of the single layer version. If you're talking about a multilayer perceptron , however, then the term is the same as a feed-forward neural network .
