I suppose you are not looking for multiple-step-ahead forecasts from the model estimated on the original data set (this is very easy to do with forecast.Arima or predict ; you should have been able to figure that out by yourself). I suppose you want to incorporate the new values as they come (but without reestimating the model) and use them in place of predicted values to produce one-step-ahead forecasts. Using your own example, I suppose you do not want $$ \hat{Y}_{t+1} = \hat{\mu} + \hat{\psi}_1 \hat Y_{t} - \hat{\theta}_{1} \hat\epsilon_{t} - \hat{\theta}_2 \hat\epsilon_{t-1} $$ but rather ( check out tildes and hats carefully ) $$ \tilde{Y}_{t+1} = \hat{\mu} + \hat{\psi}_1 Y_{t} - \hat{\theta}_{1} \tilde\epsilon_{t} - \hat{\theta}_2 \hat\epsilon_{t-1} $$ where $\hat\epsilon_{t}=0$ (based on model prediction not using the new value $Y_t$) while $\tilde\epsilon_{t}=Y_t-\hat Y_t$ (based on the actual value versus a prediction). This thread tells you how to refit your model on completely new data: "How to use a fitted model parameters for forecasting other time series" . Based on that idea, you can append the original data set with the new observations, one at a time; refit the model (without reestimating it); forecast one step ahead. Also, if you are doing things by hand, the model fitted on a sample spanning $1,\dotsc,T$ gives you fitted values $\hat Y$ and $\hat\epsilon$ all the way up to $T$, so obtaining them should be no problem.
