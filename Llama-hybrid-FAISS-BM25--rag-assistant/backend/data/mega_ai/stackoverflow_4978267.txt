Android app is not launching

i had a working application until i changed the package name in the AndroidManifest.xml. I changed it back, but then i found that i had two files in the gen folder. I usually (as now) have sg like this: But that time had something else in my gen folder: just "com.bfarago" as far as i remember and another R.java inside that was complaining about the package name. I deleted this package with the R.java and since then i cannot launch the application. I exited and restarted eclipse and at the launch its stuck at this point: [2011-02-12 14:04:55 - Nevnap] Android Launch! [2011-02-12 14:04:55 - Nevnap] adb is running normally.
