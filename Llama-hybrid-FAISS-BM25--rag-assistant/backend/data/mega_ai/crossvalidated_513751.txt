How to check baseline covariate balance after variable ratio matching?

In my case, each active subject is matched to a variable number of control subject. The way I can think of is to first average across the control subjects for the same active subject to make a 1: 1 matched sample so that it is easy to get mean difference etc. Is this the correct way? I am not getting the same results as the person who submitted the results for review. The matching was not done using matchit(). Therefore, I cannot use its summary or cobalt to assess covariate balance.
