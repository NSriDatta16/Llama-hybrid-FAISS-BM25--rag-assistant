AI and Machine Learning is a big field. If you want the broadest nontrivial introduction, you should check out: Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective . It covers everything from classical statistical methods to graphical models and deep learning. If you are specifically interested in topics having more to do with AI than machine learning, I think you would enjoy learning about reinforcement learning. Possibly as a result of recent renewed interest in the field, a second edition of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction has just come out. The original version was quite good and this new one has, amongst other things, a very interesting section on applications including AlphaGo and Watson (of Jeopardy fame). If you aren't really sure what you want to study, datasciencetexts.com contains a number of brief descriptions of related and prerequisite subjects, along with recommended books that you might be interested in. (Disclosure: I helped build it.) Happy Reading!
