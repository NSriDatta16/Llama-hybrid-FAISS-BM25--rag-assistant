Hi i have done a similar work using GWT/springs/ORMS combination, the results are fantastic ,how ever it also depends on the complexity of business process mine was a very very complex business process, what i did was segragate all the layers and treat each layer as a service , in the process i made an application which every one goes wow and at the same time is eligible for many certifications , but if you want to do it more faster and not change the front end u can use exodus cheers vasem vasem_want@yahoo.co.uk
