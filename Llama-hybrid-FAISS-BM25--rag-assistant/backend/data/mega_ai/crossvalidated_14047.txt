Dealing with response rates gets less quantitative and more qualitative, as there are no statistical tests to compare the respondents and non-respondents. You can find some guidelines to computing and generally dealing with (low) response rates at http://www.aapor.org/Content/aapor/Resources/PollampSurveyFAQ1/DoResponseRatesMatter/ResponseRatesAnOverview/default.htm . I'd agree that 30% is a very good response rate on a mail-in survey; generally you'd expect response rates in single digit % for this mode these days. If this is a list survey for an organization that has the information on its members, or for a medical provider who has the records, then you'd certainly want to do some matching of the sample with the existing records. You can either estimate response propensity models (assuming MAR, see an earlier comment ), or you can calibrate the sampling weights to adjust the demographics of your survey to that of the original list.
