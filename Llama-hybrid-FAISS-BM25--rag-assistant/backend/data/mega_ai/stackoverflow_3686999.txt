Style A Paragraph Line by Line

Is it possible so style a paragraph line by line with CSS? Say first line will have the green color, second line the red, and the third line the yellow. Note that the paragraph is native and no other tag is used inside the paragraph. I just want to change the style with CSS if possible. Thanks.
