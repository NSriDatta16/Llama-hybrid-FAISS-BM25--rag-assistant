You need to insert the namespace node onto the document element of your result tree. There are several ways to do this, depending on whether you're using XSLT 1.0 or 2.0. The following is a 2.0 solution. I'm assuming that you're doing a modified identity transform on the input document (your question didn't really specify): For complete coverage of all the different techniques for controlling namespaces in your output document, check out the "Not enough namespaces" section of the "Namespaces in XSLT" article on my website.
