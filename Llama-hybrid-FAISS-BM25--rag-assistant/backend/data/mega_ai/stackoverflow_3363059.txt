not actually an answer.. dont shoot me but needed more chars than the comments would allow thanks for the replys.. again though this does not seem to work with the backgrounds being alpha'd png's which is a shame as that appeared to be just what i needed.. tried .rounded{ -moz-border-radius:5px; -webkit-border-radius:5px; border-radius:5px; background:url("10x10.50percentalpha_white.png") repeat scroll left top transparent; height:270px; overflow:hidden; padding:0 0 5px; behaviour: url(path/to/PIE.htc) } I am using an alpha'd background image as putting opcatiy or whatever on the div, then alphas the content too.. dont want that.. any other suggestions? unless someone can explain a way to get the background nicely alpha'd without affecting the alphaness of the contained text/content. with all the funding that M$ have why cant they get rounded corners working like everyoe else has.. eh? tossers - always spend so much time getting things to work in IE that work fine everywhere else..
