From the Capybara docs: When working with asynchronous JavaScript, you might come across situations where you are attempting to interact with an element which is not yet present on the page. Capybara automatically deals with this by waiting for elements to appear on the page. You might have some luck increasing the wait time: Capybara.default_wait_time = 10 If that doesn't help then I would encorage you to contact somebody from the project on GitHub, write to the mailing list or submit an issue report.
