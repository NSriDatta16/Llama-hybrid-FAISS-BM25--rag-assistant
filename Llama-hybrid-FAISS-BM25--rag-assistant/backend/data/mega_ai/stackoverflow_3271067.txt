servlet, jsp and user feedback from form

I have been straggling as to how to implement the following scenario. Any guidance would be much appreciated. I have a form that the user fills in. Using jquery it is validated as much as possible before sending to the server. When the submit button is click the form is send to a servlet. The servlet will then check the db and if everything is still ok will add it sends the relevant information to a jsp that will then display a new page. The part that I can seem to nail down is if the servlet finds an error. In that case an error, a message should popup to the user and the page should not change. I know this may not be possible. If its not possible are there any good web design guidance on giving user feedback after they submit a form and how to implement it using servlet and jsp. Thanks Alexis
