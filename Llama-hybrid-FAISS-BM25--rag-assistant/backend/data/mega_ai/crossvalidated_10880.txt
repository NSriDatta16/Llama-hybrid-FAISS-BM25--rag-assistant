Calculating the value of attributes of cards in a card game

I hope this is a stats question :) There's a game (RftG) with cards, each of which has various attributes (generally bonuses of some kind) and a price. I'm wondering if there's some kind of technique for determining the average value of each attribute, and therefore calculating the expected cost of each card as a whole, and therefore finding "undervalued" and "overpriced" cards. Now, say that each attribute is a letter (A, B, C...), an obvious and simple technique would be to look for minimal pairs: ABC: $5 ABCD: $7 E: $1 ED: $2 Therefore D has an average value of $1.50 But that seems far too simple and limited. For starters, not every attribute will turn up in a minimal pair. Can anyone point me in the right direction of the kind of technique that would work here? I'm afraid I don't have a stats background. Even some relevant stats terms would help. If interested, there's a card list here: http://boardgamegeek.com/file/download/4wl2eqaevk/RftG_%2B_exp1_%2B_exp2_%2B_Card_Reference_v1.0.xls
