You could have for each book a container of pointers to base-interface singleton objects, something like std::map . Then you would require the interface by name, get the pointer to it (or null), and just call some doDefault() on it (or upcast the pointer to IDerived, if must). Each interface function would have to have pointer to Book as its first (or even only) parameter: doDefault(const Book*) .
