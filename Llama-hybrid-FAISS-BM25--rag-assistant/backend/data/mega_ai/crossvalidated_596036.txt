Relationship Between Logistic Regression and Principal Component Analysis

I have been into discussion about the usefulness of applied PCA before Logistic Regression for some classification task, the claim is as follow: In some cases, Applying PCA and Logistic Regression together leads to almost the same separating hyperplane as just Logistic Regression alone (PCA + LR ∼ LR ). In such cases there is a specific relation R between the projection hyperplane of PCA and separating hyperplane of LR. What is the relation R ? and why R is necessary and sufficient for PCA + LR ∼ LR?
