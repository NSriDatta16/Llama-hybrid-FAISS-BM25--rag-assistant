cURL: How do I know if my cookies are being set properly?

$ckfile = tempnam ("/tmp", "CURLCOOKIE"); $useragent="Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 3_0 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/528.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile/7A341 Safari/528.16"; $ch = curl_init ("website.com"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $useragent); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, $ckfile); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, TRUE); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); $output = curl_exec ($ch); The website sets a cookie and then redirects. Would this code suffice? Because it seems to be not getting the cookie properly. How can I check to see if it's set? Better yet, if I know what cookies I want can I just make it or something? Edit: So my CURL script visits the website right? The website sets cookies for validation, and I want to see if my cURL script is receiving those cookies properly. I want to know if there's a test for that, and/or I want to know if I can just create a cookie to validate for the website.
