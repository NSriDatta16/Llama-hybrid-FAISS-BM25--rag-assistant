Negative coefficients for ordinal logistic regression in R

I am trying to model my dependent variable (ordinal - three levels) using a set of independent variables (5 ordinal and 10 numeric). I am using lrm function in "rms" package of R. I am conducting principle component regression. S1 , C5 , C2 , C3 , S7 and S4 are the selected independent variables using PCA. Coef S.E. Wald Z Pr(>|Z|) y>=2 -1.0469 0.6092 -1.72 0.0857 y>=3 -8.5826 1.0354 -8.29 I understand, the output of the ordinal regression model is given by, ln(Fij/ 1-Fij) = Boj + B1X1 + B2X2 + .....BkXk where Fi1 is probability that Y=1, Fi2 is probability that Y=2, Fi3 is probability that Y=3 B0, B1.....Bk - coefficients X0, X1.....Xk - Independent variables My question is, how do we interpret negative coefficients here? Also, does ranking the values of Wald statistics from largest to smallest indicate descending strength of evidence of an association with the dependent variable?
