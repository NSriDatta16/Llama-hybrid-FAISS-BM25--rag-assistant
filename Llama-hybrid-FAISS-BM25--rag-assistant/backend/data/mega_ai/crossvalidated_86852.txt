Normalising higher moments of features for machine learning?

It's quite common to normalise different feature vectors so that they have the same mean and variance (usually (X-mean(X))/sd(X) ), so that the changes in the smaller variables aren't swamped. Is the same ever done for higher moments (skewness, kurtosis, ...), for data where those moments are extreme? If so, are there any precautions that need to be taken before doing so? Edit: the question is fairly general, I should qualify that I'm doing clustering analysis, and would love answers relating to the field. However, more general answers are welcome!
