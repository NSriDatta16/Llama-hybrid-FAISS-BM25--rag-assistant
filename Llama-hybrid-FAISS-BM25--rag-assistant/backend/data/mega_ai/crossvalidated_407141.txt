Unbiased variance question

A researcher is testing if a new swimming technique is more effective. She knows the average 50m time of swimmers in her club using the old technique is 35 seconds. After training 12 swimmers with the new technique she times them over 50m and summarises their time (t) in seconds: sigma (t) = 399 Sigma (t^2) = 13305 Lower times are considered better in swimming. Show that the unbiased estimate of the variance is 3.48 to two decimal places: Very unsure of how to do this, I thought the answer was 3.19. I got this through E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 and E(X^2) = 1108.75 and E(X) = 33.25. How do you get 3.48?
