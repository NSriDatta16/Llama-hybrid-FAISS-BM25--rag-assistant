In which cases can SVM totally fail but Decision trees/Multilayer Perceptrons succeed in classification?

I have been working with a binary classification problem recently. The dataset contained 20 features. I used SVM with different parameter settings and got 50% accuracy (i.e. all predictions are belonging to the same class). But when I used a decision tree, the accuracy was near 85%. I achieved almost the same accuracy using MLP. For what kinds of data might this happen?
