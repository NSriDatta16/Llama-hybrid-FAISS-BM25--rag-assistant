Firstly, commenting an error message is almost never the way to solve a problem, as you are just covering up some issue that may have severe consequences for your system. Nailing down errors like this can be hard, but there are a few places to look first: Did you install this system on a lower version and then upgrade? If so, how? Are you using any extensions that modify the sales/checkout portion of the site? Have you overridden any of the models concerned with this part of the site? Have you changed the JS or HTML for the checkout? If one of those is the case, you should review those changes for bugs. If not, try turning on the default theme for the site and checking out again. If the bug disappears, there is a problem with the theme that you are using. If it still appears, the problem is in code. In that latter case, use Firebug to verify that the offending page requests result in Magento sending back "redirect" commands to the frontend. If that isn't the case, it may be some kind of JS error, but more likely you are ending up with invalid data in the system somewhere that causes Magento to choke during checkout. Also (just thought of this, haven't tried it), try the multi-address checkout. As I recall, it uses regular page posts, and may even have more useful messaging than the OnePage checkout. Please edit your post with your findings from the above so that we can help more if that doesn't do it. Hope that helps!
