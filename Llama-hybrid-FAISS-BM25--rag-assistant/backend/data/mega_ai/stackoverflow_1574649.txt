Evil hack: Add a static pointer to your own activity, fill or override it when "onCreate" gets called. If it's null, play your movie, otherwise, don't. You could do the same with a static boolean really. private static boolean isRunning = false; protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) { super.onCreate(bundle) if(!isRunning) { isRunning = true; //Play your video here } } There are much more elegant and correct ways of doing this, but if you're in a hurry this will probably work.
