Inconsistency between definition of machine learning and popular usage

Wikipedia defines machine learning as "the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning However, most textbooks about machine learning don't show exactly how to train an algorithm to "progressively improve their performance". They simply show how to train it to do a task, but they don't show how to train it to improve its performance without being explicitly programmed to do so. I have read Hastie et al.'s "The Elements of Statistical Learning", Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", and Murphy's "Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective", and none of them show how to improve an algorithm's performance over successive iterations. Am I wrong to make this observation? If so, what am I missing or misunderstanding?
