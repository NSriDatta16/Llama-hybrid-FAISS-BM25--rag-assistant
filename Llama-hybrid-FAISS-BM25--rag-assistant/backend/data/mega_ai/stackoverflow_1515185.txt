Well, I won't bother explaining it since I don't remember how this works. But I wrote this in C++ back in ... uh... 1995-ish. I'm certain there are much more elegant ways of doing this since I'd only been writing code for about two years at the time. Anyway here it is converted to C#: static bool PointHitSegment(Point[] line, Point hitPoint, int errorMargin) { if (hitPoint.X >= (Math.Max(line[0].X, line[1].X) + errorMargin) || hitPoint.X = (Math.Max(line[0].Y, line[1].Y) + errorMargin) || hitPoint.Y errorMargin) return false; return true; }
