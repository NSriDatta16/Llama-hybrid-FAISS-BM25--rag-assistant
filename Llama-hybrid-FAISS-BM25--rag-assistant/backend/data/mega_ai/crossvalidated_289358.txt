It sounds like what you are asking for is a test of interaction. Interaction is most easily summarized as a product between two covariates (or some appropriate transformation thereof), treated as a third covariate in the model. The hypothesis of interaction (say between $X_1$ and $X_2$) is stated that: under the null, any expected difference in the outcome $Y$ comparing groups differing by one unit in $X_1$ remains the same irrespective of $X_2$. The model you've written above indicates that there is a slope in each of the covariates $X_2$ which follows $\alpha$ when $X_1 0$. It leaves us at a bit of a loss how to write the null model, but a reasonable assumption might be: $$ \mbox{logit} (y) = \sum_{i=2}^p \beta_i X_i$$ indicating there may be slopes in the other covariates but they do not differ with respect to $X_1$. If we define a new covariate $Y_1 = \mathcal{I} (X_1 > 0)$, we can create derived variables and re-express your model in terms of $$\mbox{logit} (Y) = \sum_{i=2}^p \alpha_i X_i + \sum_{i=2}^p \gamma_i X_i Y_1 $$ where $\gamma_i = \beta_i - \alpha_i$. The statistical significance of the $\gamma_i$ fit with the logistic regression model indicates the presence of interaction as described.
