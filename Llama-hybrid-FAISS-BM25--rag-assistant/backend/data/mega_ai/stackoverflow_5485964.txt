in my code I am using User-Agent as Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.0. Is this making any problem to post multiple files? No. I would also recommend to not touch this header, because it is expected that the OS will set it in a most proper way. UPDATE: Thanks to gnuf - I was incorrect saying "the OS will set it in a most proper way". It turns out there will be no such header at all, unless you set it. However I don't think this could be a reason, unless you instructed the server to reject requests if they don't have User-Agent header (which is unlikely). Or is there any another way to post the data. There may be a range of reasons. Basically what you need is to send a POST request of a 'multipart/form-data' type. So you need to correspond to the format of a such request. Some most important possible issues in this case are: Make sure you are using proper "Content-Length" and "Content-Type" headers. "Content-Type" should be "multipart/form-data; boundary=YOUR_ACTUAL_BOUNDARY" Make sure you didn't forget to add 2 extra '-' chars to the ending boundary.
