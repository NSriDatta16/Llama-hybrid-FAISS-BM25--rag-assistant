Bayesian inference of parameter governing Markov transition matrix

A 3-state Markov chain $X = \{x_i : i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}\}$ is observed, and its transition matrix $P$ is assumed to be of the form $$ \begin{pmatrix} (1-a)^2 & 2a(1-a) & a^2 \\ b(1-a) & (1-a)(1-b) + ab & a(1-b) \\ b^2 & 2b(1-b) & (1-b)^2 \end{pmatrix} $$ with $a$ and $b$ assigned a uniform prior distribution between 0 and 1. Let $c_{ij}$ denote the number of transitions from state $i$ to $j$ in the observed chain $X$. I'm interested in sampling from the posterior distribution $$ p(a,b|X) \propto p(X|a, b)p(a,b) = \prod_{i,j} {P_{ij}}^{c_{ij}} $$ This can be further developed as $$ (1-a)^{2c_{11}}\ (2a(1-a))^{c_{12}}\ a^{2c_{13}}\ (b(1-a))^{c_{21}}\ ((1-a)(1-b) + ab)^{c_{22}}\ (a(1-b))^{c_{23}}\ b^{2c_{31}}\ (2b(1-b))^{c_{32}}\ (1-b)^{2c_{33}} $$ but I don't know if it can be factored into a much nicer form. I'm wondering if there is any way to sample from this distribution without resorting to simulation methods such as MCMC. EDIT: improved question
