First thing to do is pay attention to the error message. IT will tell you what line and what file $menu is null at. Find that line... then look at everything that happens in reverse order. As others have said in their comments the results of your connect and select_db functions cannot produce a null value... and the variable has been defined (otherwise it would wine about it being undefined instead of null) so somewhere in the stack of calls and includes somethign is nulling out that variable.
