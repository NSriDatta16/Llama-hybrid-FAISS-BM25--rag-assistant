I am surprised nobody has mentioned an alternative database design - when hierarchy needs to be flattened from multiple levels and retrieved with high performance (not so considering storage space) it is better to use another entity-2-entity table to track hierarchy instead of parent_id approach. It will allow not only single parent relations but also multi parent relations, level indications and different types of relationships: CREATE TABLE Person ( Id INTEGER, Name TEXT ); CREATE TABLE PersonInPerson ( PersonId INTEGER NOT NULL, InPersonId INTEGER NOT NULL, Level INTEGER, RelationKind VARCHAR(1) );
