Interpreting plot of PCA results (from 3 to 2 dimensions)

I'm having trouble understanding how to interpret/explain the end result of dimensionality reduction via PCA. Namely, I've attempted to code up a simple example in R but can't really say what happened. I started with three vectors (x,y,z) where x and y are highly correlated and z is veeery loosely related to x. After finding the top 2 principal components and multiplying back by the original data, I have what I believe to be the "final result"... but the plot of the new 2-D data appears entirely uncorrelated. What am I seeing? What are the axes? I expected to see something that resembled the data on the x-y plane. I have plots of the mean-subtracted data in 3d and the reduced plot but not enough points to post them.
