Logistic Regression with Dummy dependent and Ordinal independent variables

I am working on model that involves a dummy dependent variable with probabilty of occurance of event (0,1) and ordinal independent variables (with the value increasing with the number of times another event happened) along with dummy control variables. Moreover, I am analyzing panel data. which model should i use?!
