y be modeled using graph-like structures. The field of graph representation learning is also relevant, with ongoing progress in developing evaluation benchmarks. Diffusion maps Another set of methods relevant to multimodal representation learning are based on diffusion maps and their extensions to handle multiple modalities. Multi-view diffusion maps Multi-view diffusion maps address the challenge of achieving multi-view dimensionality reduction by effectively utilizing the availability of multiple views to extract a coherent low-dimensional representation of the data. The core idea is to exploit both the intrinsic relations within each view and the mutual relations between the different views, defining a cross-view model where a random walk process implicitly hops between objects in different views. A multi-view kernel matrix is constructed by combining these relations, defining a cross-view diffusion process and associated diffusion distances. The spectral decomposition of this kernel enables the discovery of an embedding that better leverages the information from all views. This method has demonstrated utility in various machine learning tasks, including classification, clustering, and manifold learning. Alternating diffusion Alternating diffusion based methods provide another strategy for multimodal representation learning by focusing on extracting the common underlying sources of variability present across multiple views or sensors. These methods aim to filter out sensor-specific or nuisance components, assuming that the phenomenon of interest is captured by two or more sensors. The core idea involves constructing an alternating diffusion operator by sequentially applying diffusion processes derived from each modality, typically through their product or intersection. This process allows the method to capture the structure related to common hidden variables that drive the observed multimodal data.
