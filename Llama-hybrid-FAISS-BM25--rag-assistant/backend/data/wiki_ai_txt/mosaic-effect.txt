The mosaic effect, also called the mosaic theory, is the concept that aggregating multiple data sources can reveal sensitive or classified information that individual elements would not disclose. It originated in U.S. intelligence and national security law, where analysts warned that publicly available or unclassified fragments could, when combined, compromise operational secrecy or enable the identification of protected subjects. The concept has since shaped classification policy, especially through judicial deference in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) cases and executive orders authorizing the withholding of information based on its cumulative impact. Beyond national security, the mosaic effect has become a foundational idea in privacy, scholarship and digital surveillance law. Courts, researchers, and civil liberties groups have documented how metadata, location trails, behavioral records, and seemingly anonymized datasets can be cross-referenced to re-identify individuals or infer sensitive characteristics. Legal analysts have cited the mosaic effect in challenges to government data retention, smart meter surveillance, and automatic license plate recognition systems. Related concerns appear in reproductive privacy, humanitarian aid, and religious profiling, where data recombination threatens vulnerable groups. In finance, the mosaic theory refers to a legal method of evaluating securities by synthesizing public and immaterial non-public information. It has also been adapted in other fields such as environmental monitoring, where satellite data mosaics can reveal patterns of deforestation or agricultural activity, and in healthcare, where complex traits like hypertension are modeled through interconnected causal factors. The term applies both to intentional analytic practices and to inadvertent data aggregation that leads to privacy breaches or security exposures. Overview and background The mosaic effect, sometimes called mosaic theory or mosaicking, refers to combining data to reveal sensitive information not apparent in individual datasets, akin to assembling a mosaic from individual tiles. A core concern of mosaic theory is that large-scale data aggregation may reveal private facts about individuals that are not apparent from any single data point. Mosaic effect and theory concerns "the collection, analysis and correlation" of data rather than individual surveillance methods in isolation. The term "mosaic effect" originates in intelligence analysis, describing how seemingly harmless fragments of information can, when aggregated, enable sensitive inferences. The process of combining unrelated datasets to create a richer individual profile exemplifies the mosaic effect's capacity to bridge previously unlinked information across digital ecosystems. Authorized queries within such datasets can produce outcomes where benign data combinations result in the disclosure of otherwise privileged or sensitive information. Some data points that can be used to implement identification of data through mosaic practices can be remarkably slight, sparse, and seemingly of no value in isolation. Each iterative cycle of data merging under the mosaic effect refines user profiles further, making future data aggregation more effective and granular. Micro-data, when combined with other more established and robust datasets exposes the previously unseen connections. While potentially beneficial for public health analysis, such as tracking flu outbreaks, the mosaic effect also introduces risks, like revealing oil and gas transport routes through innocuous datasets. Although shared data structures improve accessibility and analysis, they simultaneously increase the risk of classified information being inadvertently exposed through data spillage. In the context of artificial intelligence, the mosaic effect has been identified as a catalyst for advanced fraud techniques by enabling the re-identification of individuals across online, physical, and bi
