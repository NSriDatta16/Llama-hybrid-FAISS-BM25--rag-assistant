cility dedicated to ambient intelligence; these led to the opening of HomeLab on April 24, 2002. In 2005, Philips joined the Oxygen Alliance, an international consortium of industrial partners within the context of MIT's Oxygen Project, which was aimed at developing technology for the computer of the 21st century. In parallel to the development of the concept and vision of "ambient intelligence" at Philips, several other initiatives were also starting to explore the concept of ambient intelligence. Following the advice of the Information Society and Technology Advisory Group (ISTAG), the European Commission used the vision for the launch of their sixth framework (FP6) in Information, Society and Technology, with a budget of 3.7 billion euros. During the first decade of the 21st century, several significant initiatives were launched. The Fraunhofer Society started several such activities, including multimedia, micro-system design, and augmented spaces. MIT started an ambient intelligence research group at their Media Lab. Several more research projects were started in countries such as the United States, Canada, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. Since 2004, the European Symposium on Ambient Intelligence (EUSAI) and many other conferences have been held that address special topics in ambient intelligence. Social and political aspects Europe's ISTAG suggests that society may be encouraged to use ambient intelligence if AmI projects are able to meet the following criteria: Facilitate human contact. Are oriented towards community and cultural enhancement. Help to build knowledge and skills for work, better quality of work, citizenship, and consumer choice. Inspire trust and confidence. Are consistent with long-term personal, societal, and environmental sustainability and with lifelong learning. Are made easy to live with and control by ordinary people. Technologies A variety of technologies can be used to enable ambient intelligence environments, such as: Bluetooth Low Energy RFID Microchip implant Sensors: ambient light sensors (photodetectors), thermometers, proximity sensors, and motion detectors Software agents Affective computing Nanotechnology Biometrics Criticism The ambient intelligence concept is subject to criticism. Ambient intelligence can be immersive, personalized, context-aware, and anticipatory. These characteristics bring up societal, political, and cultural concerns about the loss of privacy. Proponents of AmI argue that applications of ambient intelligence can function without necessarily reducing privacy. Critics also discuss the potential for concentrations of power in large organisations; a fragmented, decreasingly private society; and hyper-real environments where the virtual is indistinguishable from the real. Several research groups and communities have investigated the socioeconomic, political, and cultural aspects of ambient intelligence. Appearance in fiction The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 1979 novel by Douglas Adams: The doors have emotion and express this when people use them. The Diamond Age, 1995 novel by Neal Stephenson: It depicts a world completely changed by the full development of nanotechnology that is present everywhere. Minority Report (2002 film): One scene illustrates adaptive advertising where the future-consumers are identified via retinal scans and receive targeted ads. Her (2013 film): The opening scene depicts the protagonist commuting home. Upon arriving, the various lights throughout the apartment are turned on as the character moves through the rooms (automated lighting control). A later scene shows that an artificial entity can also control these systems, changing a song in the background to lighten a situation and for humorous effect.
