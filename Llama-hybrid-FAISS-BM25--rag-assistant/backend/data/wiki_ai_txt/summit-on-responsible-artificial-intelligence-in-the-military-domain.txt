The Summit on Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain, also known as REAIM 2023, was a diplomatic conference held in 2023 regarding military uses of artificial intelligence. It was held in the World Forum in The Hague on 15â€“16 February 2023. Sixty countries participated, including the US and China but not Russia. The summit concluded with the production of a non binding "call to action" document, endorsed by representatives from 60 countries including Russia and China. There were some external calls for starting negotiations on an internationally binding law or an enforcement-mechanisms-driven law. The US proposed a Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy. A second summit was held in Seoul, South Korea, between the 9th and 10th of September 2024. == References ==
