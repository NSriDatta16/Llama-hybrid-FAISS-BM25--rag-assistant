Wi-Fi – Technology for local area networking–based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, where devices may communicate through a shared access point or directly between individual devices. Zigbee – Communication protocols for personal area networking– based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, providing low power consumption, low data rate, low cost, and high throughput. Z-Wave – Wireless communications protocol used primarily for home automation and security applications Medium-range wireless LTE-Advanced – High-speed communication specification for mobile networks. Provides enhancements to the LTE standard with extended coverage, higher throughput, and lower latency. 5G – 5G wireless networks can be used to achieve the high communication requirements of the IoT and connect a large number of IoT devices, even when they are on the move. There are three features of 5G that are each considered to be useful for supporting particular elements of IoT: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). LoRa: Range up to 3 miles (4.8 km) in urban areas, and up to 10 miles (16 km) or more in rural areas (line of sight). DASH7: Range of up to 2 km. Long-range wireless Low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) – Wireless networks designed to allow long-range communication at a low data rate, reducing power and cost for transmission. Available LPWAN technologies and protocols: LoRaWan, Sigfox, NB-IoT, Weightless, RPMA, MIoTy, IEEE 802.11ah Very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) – Satellite communication technology using small dish antennas for narrowband and broadband data. Wired Ethernet – General purpose networking standard using twisted pair and fiber optic links in conjunction with hubs or switches. Power-line communication (PLC) – Communication technology using electrical wiring to carry power and data. Specifications such as HomePlug or G.hn utilize PLC for networking IoT devices. Comparison of technologies by layer Different technologies have different roles in a protocol stack. Below is a simplified presentation of the roles of several popular communication technologies in IoT applications: Standards and standards organizations This is a list of technical standards for the IoT, most of which are open standards, and the standards organizations that aspire to successfully setting them. Politics and civic engagement Some scholars and activists argue that the IoT can be used to create new models of civic engagement if device networks can be open to user control and inter-operable platforms. Philip N. Howard, a professor and author, writes that political life in both democracies and authoritarian regimes will be shaped by the way the IoT will be used for civic engagement. For that to happen, he argues that any connected device should be able to divulge a list of the "ultimate beneficiaries" of its sensor data and that individual citizens should be able to add new organisations to the beneficiary list. In addition, he argues that civil society groups need to start developing their IoT strategy for making use of data and engaging with the public. Government regulation One of the key drivers of the IoT is data. The success of the idea of connecting devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access to and storage & processing of data. For this purpose, companies working on the IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing. This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems. The other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data and how it is used. Though still in their infancy, regulations and governance regarding these issues of privacy, security, and data ownership continue to develop. IoT regulation depends on the country. Some examples of legislation that is relevant to privacy and data collection are: the US Privacy Act of 1974, OECD Guide
