Neuro-sama is an artificial intelligence VTuber and chatbot that livestreams on her creator's Twitch channel "vedal987". Her speech and personality are powered by an artificial intelligence (AI) system which utilizes a large language model, allowing her to communicate with viewers in the stream's chat. She was created by a computer programmer and AI developer named Vedal or known as "Vedal987", who had the idea of an AI VTuber by combining a large language model (LLM) with a computer-animated avatar. Her avatars, or models, are designed by the VTuber Anny, of the channel "annytf". She debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022. As of October 2025, Neuro-sama is the eighth most-subscribed channel on Twitch of all time. Development Neuro-sama was created by a developer named Vedal, with the username "vedal987". Her responses are generated by a large language model. Neuro-sama can communicate in several ways, primarily by converting these generated responses into a high-pitched female voice using a text-to-speech application, but she is also capable of sending private messages through Discord at her own discretion, in tandem with her VTuber model's speech. According to Vedal, a separate AI model controls her in-game actions when she plays video games. In a 2023 interview with Bloomberg News, he said that Neuro-sama was his full-time job. Evil Neuro debuted on 25 March 2023 and was initially created as a way for Neuro-sama to interact with herself. In order to visually distinguish them, Vedal used a version of Neuro-sama's first custom model, wearing black and crimson red ribbons instead of Neuro-sama's tan and blue. Furthermore, Evil Neuro has red eyes instead of Neuro-sama's blue. Later, as Vedal kept developing and improving Neuro-sama's voice, a decision was made to give Evil the newer voice while starting work on a different voice for Neuro-sama that was more akin to her voice at the time. This was due to technical problems and some audience backlash after hearing Neuro-sama's voice was going to change. The first iteration of Neuro-sama was created in May 2019 as a neural network trained to play the rhythm game osu!. Three years later, Neuro-sama would re-debut on Twitch, after a long hiatus, on 19 December 2022, now a chatbot utilizing the free-to-use Live2D 'Hiyori Momose' model. She received a new, custom-made model designed by Anny on 27 May 2023. The new model was designed to be similar to the original, which had become closely associated with Neuro-sama, while still giving Neuro-sama her own distinct visual identity. Anny has continued to create new avatars for Neuro-sama and her twin sister 'Evil Neuro', with Neuro-sama receiving another updated model on 19 December 2024, and Evil Neuro receiving a unique model on 25 March 2025, having previously used a modified version of Neuro-sama's original custom model. History 2022 Neuro streamed every day after her debut. She grew rapidly in popularity, from a maximum concurrent viewership of 516 on 19 December to 3,393 on 31 December, and going from a Twitch follower count of 2,825 to around 40,000 in the same time period. Nearly all of her streaming content in 2022 was of the rhythm game osu!, with one Minecraft stream. On 28 December, she defeated osu! champion mrekk 10â€“5 in a 1v1 contest. 2023 On 3 January, Neuro-sama reached 50,000 Twitch followers. The next day, on 4 January, Neuro-sama sang for the first time on stream, performing "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd. On 11 January, the Twitch channel received a temporary ban for unspecified "hateful conduct", so likely stemming from controversial statements made by the AI, including skepticism surrounding the validity of the Holocaust during a stream. Vedal added more words to her chat filter to prevent Neuro-sama from making offensive statements after this occurred. The channel was unbanned on 25 January 2023 and surpassed 100,000 followers the same day. On 25 January, Neuro-sama returned to Twitch with a stream in which she play
