The Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI) at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh was a non-profit technology transfer organisation that promoted research in the field of artificial intelligence. History The Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI) was founded in 1983 at the University of Edinburgh as a specialist research and technology-transfer unit focusing on the practical uses of artificial intelligence (AI). The institute was established by Professor Donald Michie and colleagues from the Department of Artificial Intelligence, with a mission to apply AI techniques to solve real-world industrial and governmental problems. Under the directorship of Austin Tate, who served from 1985 to 2019, AIAI became one of the leading UK research centres devoted to intelligent planning systems, decision support, and knowledge-based engineering. It collaborated with both academic partners and international organisations such as the European Space Agency and the UK Ministry of Defence. In 2001, AIAI joined the newly created Centre for Intelligent Systems and their Applications (CISA) within the University's School of Informatics. In December 2019, the institute was renamed the Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute to reflect a broader integration of fundamental and applied AI research. Research programmes AIAI’s research spans multiple areas of artificial intelligence, including: Knowledge representation and reasoning – development of ontologies, rule-based inference, and semantic modelling; Automated planning and scheduling – intelligent task management systems used in aerospace, manufacturing, and emergency response; Natural language processing and intelligent agents – interaction frameworks for human–computer collaboration; AI ethics and decision-making – research into responsible deployment and evaluation of autonomous systems. The institute also contributes to interdisciplinary fields such as computational creativity, explainable AI, and human–AI interaction. AIAI maintains close collaboration with the Bayes Centre and the Alan Turing Institute through joint research programmes and doctoral training initiatives. Technology transfer and impact From its inception, AIAI has combined academic research with technology-transfer activity, offering professional training, industrial consultancy, and bespoke software systems. It pioneered one of the earliest knowledge-based project-management systems, O-Plan, later evolved into the I-Plan framework used for autonomous planning and workflow management.
