g on the profile type, providing a common grammar for several classes of vocabulary. For example, it is possible, in some profile types, for terms to be contained within one another and be nested, which is suited to the expression of hierarchical vocabularies. Five profile types exist: lax, thesaurus, hierarchicalTokenTerms, ‘glossaryOrDictionary’ and flatTokenTerms. The lax profile is the least restrictive and offers the full VDEX model, whereas the flatTokenTerms profile is the most restrictive and lightweight. VDEX also offers some scope for complex vocabularies, assuming the existence of a well-defined application profile (for exchange interoperability). Some examples are: Faceted schemes – faceted vocabularies are possible with the definition of appropriate relationships Multi-lingual thesauri – metadata could be used within a relationship to achieve multilingual thesauri Polyhierarchical taxonomies – can be expressed using the source/target value pairs in the relationship. Identifiers in VDEX data should be persistent, unique, resolvable, transportable and URI-compliant. Specifically, vocabulary identifiers should be unique URIs, whereas term and relationship identifiers should be locally unique strings. Implementations ALOHA Metadata Tagging Tool — Java-based software project that can read IMS VDEX files. IVIMEDS 1G v1.0 Archived 2006-06-22 at the Wayback Machine – from The International Virtual Medical School – includes VDEX instances in curriculum maps. Partners can create their own maps in VDEX format and use these to help students search the repository. Skills Profiling Web Service — project implemented and demonstrated use of a skills profiling web service using open standards in a medical context. IMS VDEX files were used in the representation of the SPWS hierarchy skills framework. Scottish Doctors — project used VDEX as a format for expressing curricular outcome systems. VDEX XSLT scripts — developed by The Higher Education Academy Centre for Philosophical and Religious Studies to convert VDEX to XHTML and PostgreSQL . VDEX Implementation Project — carried out by the Institute for Computer-Based Learning at Heriot–Watt University, with a primary objective of creating a tool for editing vocabularies in VDEX format. The project, which ended in January 2004, was based on the Public Draft (not the current Final Specification). VDEX Java Binding — implementation neutral Java interface for VDEX, as well as providing a default implementation of that interface, and XML marshalling functionality. imsvdex Python egg — API for VDEX XML-files. It is free software written in Python. ATVocabularyManager — addon for Plone CMS uses VDEX as a possible format to define vocabularies. collective.vdexvocabulary — implements IMS VDEX as standard Zope vocabulary which can also be used in Plone CMS, written in Python. vdexcsv — offers a commandline converter from CSV to VDEX. It is written in Python.
