' the animated eyes never seem to focus. And for all the photorealism, when characters get wiggly-limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons, it's off-putting". Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon.com wrote of the film, "In the center of the action is Jim Carrey -- or at least a dead-eyed, doll-like version of Carrey". The 2011 animated movie Mars Needs Moms was widely criticized for being creepy and unnatural because of its style of animation. The movie was among the biggest box office bombs in history, which may have been due in part to audience revulsion. (Mars Needs Moms was produced by Robert Zemeckis's production company, ImageMovers, which had previously produced The Polar Express, Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol.) Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the 2011 animated movie The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn was affected by the uncanny valley effect. Daniel D. Snyder of The Atlantic wrote, "Instead of trying to bring to life Herge's beautiful artwork, Spielberg and co. have opted to bring the movie into the 3D era using trendy motion-capture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends. Tintin's original face, while barebones, never suffered for a lack of expression. It's now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage, his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles." He added, "In bringing them to life, Spielberg has made the characters dead.". N.B. of The Economist termed elements of the animation "grotesque", writing, "Tintin, Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photo-realistic, and nearly all of their features are those of flesh-and-blood people. And yet they still have the sausage fingers and distended noses of comic-strip characters. It's not so much 'The Secret of the Unicorn' as 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers'". However, other reviewers felt that the movie avoided the uncanny valley effect despite its animated characters' realism. Critic Dana Stevens of Slate wrote, "With the possible exception of the title character, the animated cast of Tintin narrowly escapes entrapment in the so-called 'uncanny valley'". Wired magazine editor Kevin Kelly wrote of the movie, "we have passed beyond the uncanny valley into the plains of hyperreality". In 2014, the titular protagonist of the children's TV series Bob the Builder got a redesign which was described by some as "creepy". The French movie Animal Kingdom: Let's Go Ape uses motion capture, leading to the apes being criticized for looking creepy. One review points out that they have "weirdly humanoid figures" and "recognisably human faces". The 2019 film The Lion King, a remake of the 1994 film that featured photo-realistic digital animals instead of the earlier movie's more traditional animation, divided critics about the effectiveness of its imagery. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the images were so realistic that "2019 might best be remembered as the summer we left the Uncanny Valley for good". However, other critics felt that the realism of the animals and setting rendered the scenes where the characters sing and dance disturbing and "weird". The 2020 movie Sonic the Hedgehog was delayed for three months to make the title character's appearance less human-like and more cartoonish, after an extremely negative audience reaction to the movie's first trailer. Multiple commentators cited the CGI half-human half-cat characters in the 2019 movie Cats as an example of the uncanny valley effect, first after the release of the trailer for the movie and then after the movie's actual release. In the 2022 live action/animated Disney+ film Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, the uncanny valley is mentioned when the animated duo visits a place where several realistic CGI characters, including a cameo of the Cats characters from the 2019 movie, are inhabitants. In the 2022 Disney+ series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the appearance of the main character, She-Hulk, who is depicted via CGI, was criticized
