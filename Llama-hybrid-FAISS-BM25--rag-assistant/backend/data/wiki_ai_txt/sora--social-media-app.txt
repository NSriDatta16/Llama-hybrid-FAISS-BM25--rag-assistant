Sora is a text-to-video model and social media app developed by OpenAI. The model generates short video clips based on prompts, and can also extend existing short videos. After OpenAI showed some examples in February, the first generation of Sora was released publicly for ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro users in the US and Canada in December 2024, and the second generation, called Sora 2, was released to select users in the US and Canada at the end of September 2025. It integrates social media features. By default, the generator uses copyrighted material in its videos (unless copyright holders actively opt-out of having their content included), and videos contain a visible, moving digital watermark to prevent misuse. However, only 7 days after Sora 2's release, third-party programs became prevalent which could remove the watermark. History Several other text-to-video generating models had been created prior to Sora, including Meta's Make-A-Video, Runway's Gen-2, and Google's Veo 3, the last of which, as of February 2024, is also still in its research phase. OpenAI, the company behind Sora, had released DALLÂ·E 3, the third of its DALL-E text-to-image models, in September 2023. The team that developed Sora named it after the Japanese word for 'sky' to signify its "limitless creative potential". On February 15, 2024, OpenAI first previewed Sora by releasing multiple clips of high-definition videos that it created, including an SUV driving down a mountain road, an animation of a "short fluffy monster" next to a candle, two people walking through Tokyo in the snow, and fake historical footage of the California gold rush, and stated that it was able to generate videos up to one minute long. The company then shared a technical report, which highlighted the methods used to train the model. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also posted a series of tweets, responding to Twitter users' prompts with Sora-generated videos of the prompts. Releases As of December 9, 2024, OpenAI had gradually made Sora available to the public for ChatGPT Pro and ChatGPT Plus users in the US and Canada. Prior to this, the company had provided limited access to a small "red team", including experts in misinformation and bias, to perform adversarial testing on the model. The company also shared Sora with a small group of creative professionals, including video makers and artists, to seek feedback on its usefulness in creative fields. In February 2025, OpenAI announced plans to integrate Sora into ChatGPT by letting users generate Sora videos from the chatbot. Sora 2 was unveiled on September 30, 2025, with an iOS app at the same time. All videos generated by the model feature a visible, moving watermark to prevent misuse behaviors of the tool. The previous version of Sora also used a safety watermark to let the audience distinguish between real and fictional content. Only 7 days later, on October 7, 2025, 404 Media reported that third-party programs which successfully removed the compulsory watermark from Sora 2 videos had become prevalent. By default, the generator uses copyrighted material in its videos unless copyright holders actively opt-out of having their content included. Legal regulation Intellectual property In November 2024, an API key for Sora access was leaked by a group of testers on Hugging Face, who posted a manifesto stating that they were protesting that Sora was used for "art washing". OpenAI revoked all access three hours after the leak was made public, and stated that "hundreds of artists" have shaped the development, and that "participation is voluntary." On its launch, Sora 2 allowed copyrighted content by default, unless copyright holders were to contact OpenAI and opt-out of the generation of their content on the platform. On October 3, 2025, OpenAI stated that a future update to Sora 2 would give copyright holders "more granular control" over the generation of copyrighted content, though OpenAI did not state if existing content would be removed.
