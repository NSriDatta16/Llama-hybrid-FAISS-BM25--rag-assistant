ng and evaluating the needs of underprivileged populations. Through data philanthropy, NGOs can distribute information while cooperating with governments and private companies. Corporate Data philanthropy incorporates aspects of social philanthropy by allowing corporations to create profound impacts through the act of giving back by dispersing proprietary datasets. The public sector collects and preserves information, considered an essential asset. Companies track and analyze users' online activities to gain insight into their needs related to new products and services. These companies view the welfare of the population as key to business expansion and progression by using their data to highlight global citizens' issues. Experts in the private sector emphasize the importance of integrating diverse data sources—such as retail, mobile, and social media data—to develop essential solutions for global challenges. In Data Philanthropy: New Paradigms for Collaborative Problem Solving (2022), authors Stefaan Verhulst and Andrew Young discuss this approach. Robert Kirkpatrick argues that, although sharing private information carries inherent risks, it ultimately yields public benefits, supporting the common good. – via Harvard Business Review (subscription required) The digital revolution causes an extensive production of big data that is user-generated and available on the web. Corporations accumulate information on customer preferences through the digital services they utilize and products they purchase to gain clear insights on their clientele and future market opportunities. However, the rights of individuals concerning privacy and ownership of data are controversial, as governments and other institutions can use this collective data for unethical purposes. Academia Data philanthropy is crucial in the academic field. Researchers face numerous challenges in obtaining data, which is often restricted to a select group of individuals who have exclusive access to certain resources, such as social media feeds. This limited access allows these researchers to generate additional insights and pursue innovative studies. For instance, X Corp. (formerly Twitter Inc.) offers access to its real-time APIs at different price points, such as $5,000 for the ability to read 1,000,000 posts each month, a cost that frequently exceeds the financial capabilities of many researchers. Human rights Data philanthropy aids the human rights movement by assisting in dispersing evidence for truth commissions and war crimes tribunals. Advocates for human rights gather data on abuses occurring within countries, which is then used for scientific analysis to raise awareness and drive action. For example, non-profit organizations compile data from human rights monitors in war zones to assist the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. This data uncovers inconsistencies in the number of war casualties, leading to international attention and influencing global policy discussions.
