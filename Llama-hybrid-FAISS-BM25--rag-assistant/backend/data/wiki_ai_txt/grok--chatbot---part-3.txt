 content and praising Hitler, days later, some of these changes were reversed. Grok 4 On July 9, 2025, xAI released Grok 4 and 4 Heavy, along with other updates to Grok. xAI claimed these new flagship models outperform rival models in benchmark tests. Within a week of Grok 4's release, it was demonstrated to occasionally research Elon Musk's views before providing its answer to a query; a request for Grok to discuss the Middle East conflict (without prompting for Musk's view) led to Grok declaring that it was "looking" at Musk's views "to see if they guide the answer", as "Elon Musk's stance could provide context, given his influence". In July 2025, anime-themed avatars called "Companions" were added. On August 10, 2025, unlimited access to Grok 4 for free users was made available for a limited time to compete with OpenAI's GPT-5. However, free users are restricted to two prompts every two hours. Grok 4 Fast To appeal to enterprise customers, xAI released Grok 4 Fast in September 2025. Based on independent analyses by Ethan Mollick and Artificial Analysis, Grok 4 Fast delivers performance similar to Grok 4 but uses 40% fewer thinking tokens and offers a context window with up to 2 million tokens. Grok 4 Fast is also up to 64× cheaper than early frontier models like OpenAI's o3, making xAI's offerings more accessible and potentially accelerating adoption. Versions Applications Grok is integrated with the social media platform X and has a standalone website. Apps for iOS and Android were released in early 2025. On July 12, 2025, Grok was added to Tesla's Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and Cybertruck vehicles via software version 2025.26. While the update provided in-car chatbot functionality, it did not give Grok control over vehicle functions. The same month, xAI also announced "Grok for Government" as part of a $200 million contract with the United States Department of Defense for use in the military along with Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. Features Tone of responses An xAI statement described the chatbot as having been designed to "answer questions with a bit of wit" and as having "a rebellious streak". It said that the bot had been "modeled after The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything". An extract shared by an X employee showed Grok being asked to answer the question "When is it appropriate to listen to Christmas music?" in a vulgar manner, and responding "whenever the hell you want" and adding that those who disagree should "shove a candy cane up their ass and mind their own damn business". The chatbot had a "fun mode", self-described as "edgy", and by Vice as "incredibly cringey", but this mode was removed in December 2024. Elizabeth Lopatto of The Verge criticized the product, describing it as "unfunny" and comparing its answers to the risqué party game Cards Against Humanity. Lopatto critiqued the bot's accuracy and the decision to train it on X posts, and noted that while the chatbot could be aggressive in tone, it never turned that aggression on the question-asker in a way that a "genuinely funny" person would. Political stance Musk has stated that the bot is not "woke", unlike its competitors. In response to Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, Musk said "the danger of training AI to be woke – in other words, lie – is deadly". Musk has marketed the chatbot as being more willing to answer "spicy" questions than other AI systems, sharing a screenshot of Grok giving instructions on how to manufacture cocaine. Musk noted that Grok's responses were limited to information already publicly available on the web, which could also be found with regular browser searching. Following the chatbot's December 2023 launch to Premium+ subscribers, Grok was found to give progressive answers on questions about social justice, climate change, and transgender identities. After research scientist David Rozado applied the Political Compass test to Grok and found its responses to be left-
