It is designed to perform various functions, including browsing the web and playing music, using voice commands and touch interaction, allowing AI to be used to provide services commonly associated with smartphones, such as ordering food delivery.

Software The Rabbit r1 runs on Rabbit OS, based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), specifically version 13. Lyu has claimed that Rabbit OS runs with a "very bespoke AOSP." The device employs a large action model (LAM) designed to perform actions and assist with tasks like web searches, streaming music, and transportation services. Perplexity.ai, an AI search engine, is one of the Large Language Models (LLM) used to respond to user queries and execute commands. The personal assistant is also capable of various actions such as ordering a cab or playing music from Spotify. This is through the "connections" system on the account management site, which the assistant calls "rabbits". Rabbit issued 15 software updates within the first four months after releasing r1. On July 11, 2024, Rabbit launched the "beta rabbit" advanced search and conversation assistant to "give more thoughtful responses to complex questions that require multiple steps of research and deeper reasoning".

In response, Lyu published statements confirming its use of Android, but denying that the r1 is an Android app. Mashable called its Vision features impressive, but said that "these praise-worthy features are overshadowed by buggy performance". Ars Technica wrote a blog post claiming "the company is blocking access from bootleg APKs". TechCrunch gave a slightly more positive review, calling the device a "fun peep at a possible future", but could not "advise anyone to buy one now." Shortly after the launch of r1, Rabbit began a weekly cadence of software updates to address much of the criticism from the early reviews, including "battery and GPS performance, time zone selection, and more".
