s MRI and PET images to address this challenge. GAN can be used to detect glaucomatous images helping the early diagnosis which is essential to avoid partial or total loss of vision. GANs have been used to create forensic facial reconstructions of deceased historical figures. Malicious Concerns have been raised about the potential use of GAN-based human image synthesis for sinister purposes, e.g., to produce fake, possibly incriminating, photographs and videos. GANs can be used to generate unique, realistic profile photos of people who do not exist, in order to automate creation of fake social media profiles. In 2019 the state of California considered and passed on October 3, 2019, the bill AB-602, which bans the use of human image synthesis technologies to make fake pornography without the consent of the people depicted, and bill AB-730, which prohibits distribution of manipulated videos of a political candidate within 60 days of an election. Both bills were authored by Assembly member Marc Berman and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. The laws went into effect in 2020. DARPA's Media Forensics program studies ways to counteract fake media, including fake media produced using GANs. Fashion, art and advertising GANs can be used to generate art; The Verge wrote in March 2019 that "The images created by GANs have become the defining look of contemporary AI art." GANs can also be used to inpaint photographs generate fashion models, shadows, photorealistic renders of interior design, industrial design, shoes, etc. Such networks were reported to be used by Facebook. Some have worked with using GAN for artistic creativity, as "creative adversarial network". A GAN, trained on a set of 15,000 portraits from WikiArt from the 14th to the 19th century, created the 2018 painting Edmond de Belamy, which sold for US$432,500. GANs were used by the video game modding community to up-scale low-resolution 2D textures in old video games by recreating them in 4k or higher resolutions via image training, and then down-sampling them to fit the game's native resolution (resembling supersampling anti-aliasing). In 2020, Artbreeder was used to create the main antagonist in the sequel to the psychological web horror series Ben Drowned. The author would later go on to praise GAN applications for their ability to help generate assets for independent artists who are short on budget and manpower. In May 2020, Nvidia researchers taught an AI system (termed "GameGAN") to recreate the game of Pac-Man simply by watching it being played. In August 2019, a large dataset consisting of 12,197 MIDI songs each with paired lyrics and melody alignment was created for neural melody generation from lyrics using conditional GAN-LSTM (refer to sources at GitHub AI Melody Generation from Lyrics). Miscellaneous GANs have been used to show how an individual's appearance might change with age. reconstruct 3D models of objects from images, generate novel objects as 3D point clouds, model patterns of motion in video. inpaint missing features in maps, transfer map styles in cartography or augment street view imagery. use feedback to generate images and replace image search systems. visualize the effect that climate change will have on specific houses. reconstruct an image of a person's face after listening to their voice. produces videos of a person speaking, given only a single photo of that person. recurrent sequence generation. History In 1991, Juergen Schmidhuber published "artificial curiosity", neural networks in a zero-sum game. The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. GANs can be regarded as a case where the environmental reaction is 1 or 0 depending on whether the first network's output is in a given set. Other people had similar ideas but did not develop them similarly. An idea involving adversarial networ
