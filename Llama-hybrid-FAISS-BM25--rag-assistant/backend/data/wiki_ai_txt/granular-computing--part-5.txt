he view from an observer which is only capable of detecting this single attribute. Then we obtain the following much coarser equivalence class structure. { { O 1 , O 2 } { O 3 , O 5 , O 7 , O 9 , O 10 } { O 4 , O 6 , O 8 } {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}\{O_{1},O_{2}\}\\\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\}\\\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\}\end{cases}}} This is in a certain regard the same structure as before, but at a lower degree of resolution (larger grain size). Just as in the case of value granulation (discretization/quantization), it is possible that relationships (dependencies) may emerge at one level of granularity that are not present at another. As an example of this, we can consider the effect of concept granulation on the measure known as attribute dependency (a simpler relative of the mutual information). To establish this notion of dependency (see also rough sets), let [ x ] Q = { Q 1 , Q 2 , Q 3 , … , Q N } {\displaystyle [x]_{Q}=\{Q_{1},Q_{2},Q_{3},\dots ,Q_{N}\}} represent a particular concept granulation, where each Q i {\displaystyle Q_{i}} is an equivalence class from the concept structure induced by attribute set Q. For example, if the attribute set Q consists of attribute P 1 {\displaystyle P_{1}} alone, as above, then the concept structure [ x ] Q {\displaystyle [x]_{Q}} will be composed of Q 1 = { O 1 , O 2 } , Q 2 = { O 3 , O 5 , O 7 , O 9 , O 10 } , Q 3 = { O 4 , O 6 , O 8 } . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Q_{1}&=\{O_{1},O_{2}\},\\Q_{2}&=\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\},\\Q_{3}&=\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\}.\end{aligned}}} The dependency of attribute set Q on another attribute set P, γ P ( Q ) , {\displaystyle \gamma _{P}(Q),} is given by γ P ( Q ) = | ∑ i = 1 N P _ Q i | | U | ≤ 1 {\displaystyle \gamma _{P}(Q)={\frac {\left|\sum _{i=1}^{N}{\underline {P}}Q_{i}\right|}{\left|\mathbb {U} \right|}}\leq 1} That is, for each equivalence class Q i {\displaystyle Q_{i}} in [ x ] Q , {\displaystyle [x]_{Q},} we add up the size of its "lower approximation" (see rough sets) by the attributes in P, i.e., P _ Q i . {\displaystyle {\underline {P}}Q_{i}.} More simply, this approximation is the number of objects which on attribute set P can be positively identified as belonging to target set Q i . {\displaystyle Q_{i}.} Added across all equivalence classes in [ x ] Q , {\displaystyle [x]_{Q},} the numerator above represents the total number of objects which—based on attribute set P—can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by attributes Q. The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects, in a sense capturing the "synchronization" of the two concept structures [ x ] Q {\displaystyle [x]_{Q}} and [ x ] P . {\displaystyle [x]_{P}.} The dependency γ P ( Q ) {\displaystyle \gamma _{P}(Q)} "can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in P to determine the values of attributes in Q" (Ziarko & Shan 1995). Having gotten definitions now out of the way, we can make the simple observation that the choice of concept granularity (i.e., choice of attributes) will influence the detected dependencies among attributes. Consider again the attribute value table from above: Consider the dependency of attribute set Q = { P 4 , P 5 } {\displaystyle Q=\{P_{4},P_{5}\}} on attribute set P = { P 2 , P 3 } . {\displaystyle P=\{P_{2},P_{3}\}.} That is, we wish to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into classes of [ x ] Q {\displaystyle [x]_{Q}} based on knowledge of [ x ] P . {\displaystyle [x]_{P}.} The equivalence classes of [ x ] Q {\displaystyle [x]_{Q}} and of [ x ] P {\displaystyle [x]_{P}} are shown below. The objects that can be definitively categorized according to concept structure [ x ] Q {\displaystyle [x]_{Q}} based on [ x ] P {\displaystyle [x]_{P}} are those in the set { O 1 , O 2 , O 3 , O 7 , O 8 , O 10 } , {\displaystyle \{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O
