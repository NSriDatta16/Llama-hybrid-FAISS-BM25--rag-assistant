if }}-1<p<+\infty \\T_{\mathrm {prod} }(x,y)&{\text{if }}p=+\infty \end{cases}}} The Sugeno–Weber t-norm T p S W {\displaystyle T_{p}^{\mathrm {SW} }} is nilpotent if and only if −1 < p < +∞ (for p = 0 it is the Łukasiewicz t-norm). The family is strictly increasing and continuous with respect to p. An additive generator of T p S W {\displaystyle T_{p}^{\mathrm {SW} }} for 0 < p < +∞ [sic] is f p S W ( x ) = { 1 − x if p = 0 1 − log 1 + p ⁡ ( 1 + p x ) otherwise. {\displaystyle f_{p}^{\mathrm {SW} }(x)={\begin{cases}1-x&{\text{if }}p=0\\1-\log _{1+p}(1+px)&{\text{otherwise.}}\end{cases}}} Ordinal sums The ordinal sum constructs a t-norm from a family of t-norms, by shrinking them into disjoint subintervals of the interval [0, 1] and completing the t-norm by using the minimum on the rest of the unit square. It is based on the following theorem: Let Ti for i in an index set I be a family of t-norms and (ai, bi) a family of pairwise disjoint (non-empty) open subintervals of [0, 1]. Then the function T: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] defined as T ( x , y ) = { a i + ( b i − a i ) ⋅ T i ( x − a i b i − a i , y − a i b i − a i ) if x , y ∈ [ a i , b i ] 2 min ( x , y ) otherwise {\displaystyle T(x,y)={\begin{cases}a_{i}+(b_{i}-a_{i})\cdot T_{i}\left({\frac {x-a_{i}}{b_{i}-a_{i}}},{\frac {y-a_{i}}{b_{i}-a_{i}}}\right)&{\text{if }}x,y\in [a_{i},b_{i}]^{2}\\\min(x,y)&{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}} is a t-norm. The resulting t-norm is called the ordinal sum of the summands (Ti, ai, bi) for i in I, denoted by T = ⨁ i ∈ I ( T i , a i , b i ) , {\displaystyle T=\bigoplus \nolimits _{i\in I}(T_{i},a_{i},b_{i}),} or ( T 1 , a 1 , b 1 ) ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ ( T n , a n , b n ) {\displaystyle (T_{1},a_{1},b_{1})\oplus \dots \oplus (T_{n},a_{n},b_{n})} if I is finite. Ordinal sums of t-norms enjoy the following properties: Each t-norm is a trivial ordinal sum of itself on the whole interval [0, 1]. The empty ordinal sum (for the empty index set) yields the minimum t-norm Tmin. Summands with the minimum t-norm can arbitrarily be added or omitted without changing the resulting t-norm. It can be assumed without loss of generality that the index set is countable, since the real line can only contain at most countably many disjoint subintervals. An ordinal sum of t-norm is continuous if and only if each summand is a continuous t-norm. (Analogously for left-continuity.) An ordinal sum is Archimedean if and only if it is a trivial sum of one Archimedean t-norm on the whole unit interval. An ordinal sum has zero divisors if and only if for some index i, ai = 0 and Ti has zero divisors. (Analogously for nilpotent elements.) If T = ⨁ i ∈ I ( T i , a i , b i ) {\displaystyle T=\bigoplus \nolimits _{i\in I}(T_{i},a_{i},b_{i})} is a left-continuous t-norm, then its residuum R is given as follows: R ( x , y ) = { 1 if x ≤ y a i + ( b i − a i ) ⋅ R i ( x − a i b i − a i , y − a i b i − a i ) if a i < y < x ≤ b i y otherwise. {\displaystyle R(x,y)={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}x\leq y\\a_{i}+(b_{i}-a_{i})\cdot R_{i}\left({\frac {x-a_{i}}{b_{i}-a_{i}}},{\frac {y-a_{i}}{b_{i}-a_{i}}}\right)&{\text{if }}a_{i}<y<x\leq b_{i}\\y&{\text{otherwise.}}\end{cases}}} where Ri is the residuum of Ti, for each i in I. Ordinal sums of continuous t-norms The ordinal sum of a family of continuous t-norms is a continuous t-norm. By the Mostert–Shields theorem, every continuous t-norm is expressible as the ordinal sum of Archimedean continuous t-norms. Since the latter are either nilpotent (and then isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm) or strict (then isomorphic to the product t-norm), each continuous t-norm is isomorphic to the ordinal sum of Łukasiewicz and product t-norms. Important examples of ordinal sums of continuous t-norms are the following ones: Dubois–Prade t-norms, introduced by Didier Dubois and Henri Prade in the early 1980s, are the ordinal sums of the product t-norm on [0, p] for a parameter p in [0, 1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval.
