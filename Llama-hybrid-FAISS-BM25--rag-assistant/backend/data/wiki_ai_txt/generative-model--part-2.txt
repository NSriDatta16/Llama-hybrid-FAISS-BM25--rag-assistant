f generative models, and are judged primarily by the similarity of particular outputs to potential inputs. Such models are not classifiers. Relationships between models In application to classification, the observable X is frequently a continuous variable, the target Y is generally a discrete variable consisting of a finite set of labels, and the conditional probability P ( Y ∣ X ) {\displaystyle P(Y\mid X)} can also be interpreted as a (non-deterministic) target function f : X → Y {\displaystyle f\colon X\to Y} , considering X as inputs and Y as outputs. Given a finite set of labels, the two definitions of "generative model" are closely related. A model of the conditional distribution P ( X ∣ Y = y ) {\displaystyle P(X\mid Y=y)} is a model of the distribution of each label, and a model of the joint distribution is equivalent to a model of the distribution of label values P ( Y ) {\displaystyle P(Y)} , together with the distribution of observations given a label, P ( X ∣ Y ) {\displaystyle P(X\mid Y)} ; symbolically, P ( X , Y ) = P ( X ∣ Y ) P ( Y ) . {\displaystyle P(X,Y)=P(X\mid Y)P(Y).} Thus, while a model of the joint probability distribution is more informative than a model of the distribution of label (but without their relative frequencies), it is a relatively small step, hence these are not always distinguished. Given a model of the joint distribution, P ( X , Y ) {\displaystyle P(X,Y)} , the distribution of the individual variables can be computed as the marginal distributions P ( X ) = ∑ y P ( X , Y = y ) {\displaystyle P(X)=\sum _{y}P(X,Y=y)} and P ( Y ) = ∫ x P ( Y , X = x ) {\displaystyle P(Y)=\int _{x}P(Y,X=x)} (considering X as continuous, hence integrating over it, and Y as discrete, hence summing over it), and either conditional distribution can be computed from the definition of conditional probability: P ( X ∣ Y ) = P ( X , Y ) / P ( Y ) {\displaystyle P(X\mid Y)=P(X,Y)/P(Y)} and P ( Y ∣ X ) = P ( X , Y ) / P ( X ) {\displaystyle P(Y\mid X)=P(X,Y)/P(X)} . Given a model of one conditional probability, and estimated probability distributions for the variables X and Y, denoted P ( X ) {\displaystyle P(X)} and P ( Y ) {\displaystyle P(Y)} , one can estimate the opposite conditional probability using Bayes' rule: P ( X ∣ Y ) P ( Y ) = P ( Y ∣ X ) P ( X ) . {\displaystyle P(X\mid Y)P(Y)=P(Y\mid X)P(X).} For example, given a generative model for P ( X ∣ Y ) {\displaystyle P(X\mid Y)} , one can estimate: P ( Y ∣ X ) = P ( X ∣ Y ) P ( Y ) / P ( X ) , {\displaystyle P(Y\mid X)=P(X\mid Y)P(Y)/P(X),} and given a discriminative model for P ( Y ∣ X ) {\displaystyle P(Y\mid X)} , one can estimate: P ( X ∣ Y ) = P ( Y ∣ X ) P ( X ) / P ( Y ) . {\displaystyle P(X\mid Y)=P(Y\mid X)P(X)/P(Y).} Note that Bayes' rule (computing one conditional probability in terms of the other) and the definition of conditional probability (computing conditional probability in terms of the joint distribution) are frequently conflated as well. Contrast with discriminative classifiers A generative algorithm models how the data was generated in order to categorize a signal. It asks the question: based on my generation assumptions, which category is most likely to generate this signal? A discriminative algorithm does not care about how the data was generated, it simply categorizes a given signal. So, discriminative algorithms try to learn p ( y | x ) {\displaystyle p(y|x)} directly from the data and then try to classify data. On the other hand, generative algorithms try to learn p ( x , y ) {\displaystyle p(x,y)} which can be transformed into p ( y | x ) {\displaystyle p(y|x)} later to classify the data. One of the advantages of generative algorithms is that you can use p ( x , y ) {\displaystyle p(x,y)} to generate new data similar to existing data. On the other hand, it has been proved that some discriminative algorithms give better performance than some generative algorithms in classification tasks. Despite the fact that discriminative models do
