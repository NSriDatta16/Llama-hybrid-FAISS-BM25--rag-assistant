rally have multiple segments with polar sensors on each joint. As per the CMM, as the articulated arm moves around the part sensors record their position and the location of the end of the arm is calculated using complex math and the wrist rotation angle and hinge angle of each joint. While not usually as accurate as CMMs, articulated arms still achieve high accuracy and are cheaper and slightly easier to use. They do not usually have CNC options. Companies such as FARO Technologies and Hexagon AB are notable developers of this technology. Both modern CMMs and Articulated Arms can also be fitted with non-contact laser scanners instead of touch probes. Non-contact active Active scanners emit some kind of radiation or light and detect its reflection or radiation passing through object in order to probe an object or environment. Possible types of emissions used include light, ultrasound or x-ray. Time-of-flight The time-of-flight 3D laser scanner is an active scanner that uses laser light to probe the subject. At the heart of this type of scanner is a time-of-flight laser range finder. The laser range finder finds the distance of a surface by timing the round-trip time of a pulse of light. A laser is used to emit a pulse of light and the amount of time before the reflected light is seen by a detector is measured. Since the speed of light c {\displaystyle c} is known, the round-trip time determines the travel distance of the light, which is twice the distance between the scanner and the surface. If t {\displaystyle t} is the round-trip time, then distance is equal to c â‹… t / 2 {\displaystyle \textstyle c\!\cdot \!t/2} . The accuracy of a time-of-flight 3D laser scanner depends on how precisely we can measure the t {\displaystyle t} time: 3.3 picoseconds (approx.) is the time taken for light to travel 1 millimetre. The laser range finder only detects the distance of one point in its direction of view. Thus, the scanner scans its entire field of view one point at a time by changing the range finder's direction of view to scan different points. The view direction of the laser range finder can be changed either by rotating the range finder itself, or by using a system of rotating mirrors. The latter method is commonly used because mirrors are much lighter and can thus be rotated much faster and with greater accuracy. Typical time-of-flight 3D laser scanners can measure the distance of 10,000~100,000 points every second. Time-of-flight devices are also available in a 2D configuration. This is referred to as a time-of-flight camera. Triangulation Triangulation based 3D laser scanners are also active scanners that use laser light to probe the environment. With respect to time-of-flight 3D laser scanner the triangulation laser shines a laser on the subject and exploits a camera to look for the location of the laser dot. Depending on how far away the laser strikes a surface, the laser dot appears at different places in the camera's field of view. This technique is called triangulation because the laser dot, the camera and the laser emitter form a triangle. The length of one side of the triangle, the distance between the camera and the laser emitter is known. The angle of the laser emitter corner is also known. The angle of the camera corner can be determined by looking at the location of the laser dot in the camera's field of view. These three pieces of information fully determine the shape and size of the triangle and give the location of the laser dot corner of the triangle. In most cases a laser stripe, instead of a single laser dot, is swept across the object to speed up the acquisition process. The use of triangulation to measure distances dates to antiquity. Strengths and weaknesses Time-of-flight range finders are capable of operating over long distances on the order of kilometres. These scanners are thus suitable for scanning large structures like buildings or geographic features. A disadvantage is that, due to the high speed of li
