t function. Linear and logistic regression: alpha in Ridge Regression or C in Logistic Regression. Naive Bayes: smoothing coefficients. Deep learning In the context of deep learning, Optuna can be exploited during the training of neural networks (NN), to optimize learning rate, batch size, and the number of hidden layers. For example, it can be used for: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification, object detection, and semantic-segmentation tasks. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for sequence-based tasks such as time-series forecasting and natural language processing. Transformers, for NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. Domains Optuna has found applications in various research studies and industry implementations across different applicative domains. Healthcare In healthcare, Optuna is currently exploited for medical image analysis to optimize DL models for tumor detection, disease identification, multi-organ semantic segmentation, and radiological image analysis. It can be also exploited for disease prediction, in particular for the improvement in the accuracy of predictive models for disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Its application can be also found in genomics, to predict genetic diseases and to identify genetic variations. Finance In finance, Optuna is used to optimize models for algorithmic trading. It allows for predicting market movements, given the ability in handling wide parameter ranges and complex model structures. In particular, it is exploited for financial risk analysis and forecasting. Topics addressed are credit, market, and operational risks. Autonomous systems Optuna is used for real-time applications in autonomous systems for robotics, supporting decision making in dynamic environments. It is also exploited in the context of self-driving cars, to optimize the model to navigate safely in complex environments. For example, Optuna can be used in scenarios where there is the need to evaluate the rate and the severity of accidents or to address the issue of network intrusion attacks due to possible vulnerabilities that might occur. Natural language processing (NLP) Optuna has also been applied in NLP, for example, for text classification to classify a piece of written text into categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam, topic modeling). Another task is sentiment analysis, namely the detection of feelings expressed in text, particularly exploited for the analysis of content from social media and customer reviews. Reinforcement learning (RL) For what concerns RL, Optuna is exploited in the gaming field, to improve the model performance in games and virtual environments, in robotics to optimize decision-making processes in robotic systems for tasks like manipulation and navigation, and in the field of autonomous vehicles, to optimize RL models to obtain enhanced safety, and a more efficient navigation strategy.
