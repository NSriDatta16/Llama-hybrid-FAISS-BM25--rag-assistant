ra includes a 200 MP wide lens, a 50 MP ultrawide lens, and both 10 MP and 50 MP telephoto lenses with up to 5× optical zoom, which can provide higher-resolution source material for editing. Best Face A photo optimization function that automatically selects and composites the most favorable facial expressions of subjects captured in a motion photo. The feature analyzes multiple frames taken in quick succession and identifies faces with open eyes, smiles, or minimal motion blur to generate a single improved image. Processing is powered by the device’s AI-enabled photo engine, utilizing frame comparison and face detection algorithms. Best Face can be accessed in the Samsung Gallery app through the choose best face icon displayed at the bottom of the image. Video editing Audio Eraser A post-processing feature that allows users to remove background noise or specific audio elements—such as voices, wind, or crowd sounds—from recorded videos. It uses AI-based audio separation to isolate and reduce unwanted sound components. While primarily software-driven, supporting systems such as the ProVisual Engine improve visual clarity and reduce noise in source video, indirectly enhancing audio separation accuracy. The feature is available in the Samsung Gallery app and can be accessed during video editing. Auto Trim A video editing function that detects and selects portions of footage based on visual or contextual patterns, enabling the assembly of shorter clips without manual editing. It is supported by AI-powered video analytics that assess scene composition and motion. High-resolution recording modes, such as 8K video capture, provide additional flexibility for cropping and reframing segments during editing. Optical Zoom systems included in the S25 series also contribute to framing inputs. Instant Slo-Mo A post-processing function that generates slow-motion playback by interpolating additional frames between existing ones. It is activated during video playback in the Gallery app by tapping and holding the screen, without the need for prior selection of a specific recording mode. AI frame interpolation, analyzes consecutive frames and predicts intermediate frames, allowing smooth slow-motion effects even for standard recordings captured at 30 or 60 frames per second. Native high-frame-rate recording, available up to 960fps, enables feature such as Super Slo-Mo. Instant Slo-Mo may be used with Log video, which captures a flat profile for dynamic range, and Galaxy Log, Samsung’s AI-based grading tool. These functions allow additional control in post-production. Assist Bixby and Bixby Vision Two input functions within the Galaxy device interface that handle voice and visual recognition tasks. Bixby processes spoken commands to operate certain features or access tools, and can be launched by voice or a hardware button. Bixby Vision identifies visual elements through the camera, such as objects or text, and displays related information within supported apps. Health Health Assist A health monitoring function in the Samsung Health app that generates an Energy score based on factors such as sleep quality, activity, and heart rate variability. The score is intended to reflect a user's general condition for daily activity, and is derived from data collected by other Galaxy devices, although only a watch or a smart ring can track sleep. Personalization Generative Wallpaper and Photo Ambient Two visual customization functions that modify wallpaper appearance using AI-based processing. Generative Wallpaper creates images from user-provided keywords or themes, operating locally on the device. Photo Ambient adjusts wallpaper based on environmental factors such as lighting and time, using preset visual filters. These features leverage on-device AI for privacy-sensitive tasks while utilizing cloud-based AI for complex processing needs. Supported devices Galaxy AI was introduced with the Galaxy S24 series in January 2024 and later extended to other Galaxy m
