This is a list of publications in data science, generally organized by order of use in a data analysis workflow. See the list of publications in statistics for more research-based and fundamental publications; while this list is more applied, business oriented, and cross-disciplinary. General article inclusion criteria are: Papers from notable practitioners or notable professors, either with a Wikipedia page or reference to their notability Common knowledge all data professionals should know, with references validating this claim Highly cited applied statistics and machine learning publications Discussion-facilitating papers on the field of data science as a whole (for example, the Attention Is All You Need paper is arguably a landmark paper that can be added here, but it is specific to generative artificial intelligence, not for all practitioners of data) Some reasons why a particular publication might be regarded as important: Topic creator – A publication that created a new topic Breakthrough – A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly Influence – A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of data science. When possible, a reference is used to validate the inclusion of the publication in this list. History Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures (with comments and a rejoinder by the author) Author: Leo Breiman Publication data: Online version: Description: Describes two cultures of statistics, one using a parsimonious and generative stochastic model, while the other is an algorithmic model with no known mechanism for how the data is generated. Breiman argues that while statistics has traditionally favored using the stochastic model, there is value in expanding the methods that statisticians can use to study phenomenon. Importance: Influence on the philosophies of statisticians right before the increased use of machine learning and deep learning methods. In a 20-year retrospective on this article, "Breiman's words are perhaps more relevant than ever". Notable statisticians at the time wrote opinion pieces about the publication. Although overall critical of the publication, David Cox writes that the publication "contains enough truth and exposes enough weaknesses to be thought-provoking." Bradley Efron commented that this publication is a "stimulating paper". Emanuel Parzen also comments about this publication that "Breiman alerts us to systematic blunders (leading to wrong conclusions) that have been committed applying current statistical practice of data modeling". Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century Author: Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil Publication data: Online version: hbr.org/2022/07/is-data-scientist-still-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century Description: Describes the new role at companies that is coined "Data scientist", what they do, how an organization might recruit one to their organization, and how to work with one effectively. Importance: This publication has been an influence on the data community as mentioned near the time it was published in 2012 by institutions like IEEE Spectrum, but also mentioned nearly a decade later asking the same question the title poses. In a retrospective response to their own publication 10 years earlier, authors Davenport and Patil have reflected that the role of a data scientist has "become better institutionalized, the scope of the job has been redefined, the technology it relies on has made huge strides, and the importance of non-technical expertise, such as ethics and change management, has grown". 50 Years of Data Science Author: David Donoho Publication data: Online version: Description: Retrospective discussion paper on the history and origins of data science, with a number of commentary from notable statisticians. Importance: This has been described as "the first in the field to present such a comprehensive and in-depth survey and overview", and helps to define the field that ha
