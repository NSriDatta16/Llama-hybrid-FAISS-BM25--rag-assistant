 interfaces. Some users have also created AI virtual assistants using 15.ai and external voice control software. Text-to-speech is also used in second language acquisition. Voki, for instance, is an educational tool created by Oddcast that allows users to create their own talking avatar, using different accents. They can be emailed, embedded on websites or shared on social media. Content creators have used voice cloning tools to recreate their voices for podcasts, narration, and comedy shows. Publishers and authors have also used such software to narrate audiobooks and newsletters. Another area of application is AI video creation with talking heads. Webapps and video editors like Elai.io or Synthesia allow users to create video content involving AI avatars, who are made to speak using text-to-speech technology. Speech synthesis is a valuable computational aid for the analysis and assessment of speech disorders. A voice quality synthesizer, developed by Jorge C. Lucero et al. at the University of Bras√≠lia, simulates the physics of phonation and includes models of vocal frequency jitter and tremor, airflow noise and laryngeal asymmetries. The synthesizer has been used to mimic the timbre of dysphonic speakers with controlled levels of roughness, breathiness and strain.
