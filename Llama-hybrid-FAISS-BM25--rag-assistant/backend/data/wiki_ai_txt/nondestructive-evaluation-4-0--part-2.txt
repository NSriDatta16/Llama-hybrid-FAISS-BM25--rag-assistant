rasound developed further into lighter, portable systems suitable for field testing. The first detectors for infrared and terahertz detection were invented around the same time and the first eddy current devices became available. Although these are critical methods of testing that persist to this day, further breakthroughs had to wait until digitization and digital electronics developed in the third NDE revolution. NDE 3.0 The third revolution in NDE parallels the advent of microelectronics, digital technologies and computers. It is usually thought of as the period starting in 1969, marked by the introduction of the first programmable logic controller (PLC), and 2016. Digital inspection equipment, such as X-ray detectors, digital ultrasonic and eddy current equipment, and digital cameras became integral parts of the system of testing and evaluation. Robotics lead to automated processes, improving convenience, safety, speed and repeatability. Digital technologies offered leaps in managing inspection data acquisition, storage, processing, 2D and 3D imaging, interpretation, and communication. Data processing and sharing became the norm. At the same time, these developments created new challenges and opportunities such as data security and integrity and introduced new concepts such as value of data and its monetization. NDE 4.0 Whereas prior revolutions focused on improving testing and evaluation by taking advantage of the tools, methods and development available at the respective periods, the 4th NDE revolution is characterized by integration; integration of tools, testing methods, digital technologies, and communication into coherent closed-loop systems that allows both feedback and feed-forward to manufacturing. The purpose is improvement in testing and evaluation taking advantage of current and emerging production technologies and communication and information systems. At the heart of NDE 4.0 are digitalization, networking, information transparency, communication and processing tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. One of the primary added values in NDE 4.0 is the possibility of product design and concurrent nondestructive evaluation through use of digital twins and digital threads, so that both design and testing can influence each other continuously. Another is the ability to serve emerging trends such as testing in custom manufacturing, remote testing and predictive maintenance over the lifetime of products. NDE 4.0 is not a fixed set of rules and concepts but rather and evolving progression of ideas, tools and procedures brought about by advances in production, communication and processing. Its global purpose is to serve the needs of industry and respond to changes brought about by emergence of new opportunities. Drivers and components The primary driver of NDE 4.0 is the same as that of the fourth industrial revolution – the integration of digital tools and physical methods, driven by current digital technologies through introduction of new ways of digitalization of specific steps in NDE processes, with a promise of overall efficiency and reliability. There are three recognizable components of NDE 4.0. First, Industry 4.0 emerging digital technologies can be used to enhance NDE capabilities in what has been termed “Industry 4.0 for NDE”. Second, statistical analysis of NDE data provides insight into product performance and reliability. This is a valuable data source for Industry 4.0 to continuously improve the product design in the “NDE for Industry 4.0” process. Third, immersive training experiences, remote operation, intelligence augmentation, and data automation can enhance the NDE value proposition in terms of inspector safety and human performance in the third component of NDE 4.0 – the “Human Consideration”.
