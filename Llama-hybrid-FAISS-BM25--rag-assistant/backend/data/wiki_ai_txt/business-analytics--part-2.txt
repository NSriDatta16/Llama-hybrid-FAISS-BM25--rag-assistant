ata across different systems, and then deciding what subsets of data to make available. Previously, analytics was considered a type of after-the-fact method of forecasting consumer behavior by examining the number of units sold in the last quarter or the last year. This type of data warehousing required a lot more storage space than it did speed. Now business analytics is becoming a tool that can influence the outcome of customer interactions. When a specific customer type is considering a purchase, an analytics-enabled enterprise can modify the sales pitch to appeal to that consumer. This means the storage space for all that data must react extremely fast to provide the necessary data in real-time. Competing on analytics Thomas Davenport, professor of information technology and management at Babson College argues that businesses can optimize a distinct business capability via analytics and thus better compete. He identifies these characteristics of an organization that are apt to compete on analytics: One or more senior executives who strongly advocate fact-based decision making and, specifically, analytics Widespread use of not only descriptive statistics, but also predictive modeling and complex optimization techniques Substantial use of analytics across multiple business functions or processes Movement toward an enterprise-level approach to managing analytical tools, data, and organizational skills and capabilities See also Business analysis Business analyst Business process discovery Customer dynamics List of information graphics software Test and learn References Further reading Davenport, Thomas H.; Jeanne G.
