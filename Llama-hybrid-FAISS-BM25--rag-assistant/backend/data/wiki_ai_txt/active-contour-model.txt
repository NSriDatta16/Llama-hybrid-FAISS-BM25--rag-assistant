Active contour model, also called snakes, is a framework in computer vision introduced by Michael Kass, Andrew Witkin, and Demetri Terzopoulos for delineating an object outline from a possibly noisy 2D image. The snakes model is popular in computer vision, and snakes are widely used in applications like object tracking, shape recognition, segmentation, edge detection and stereo matching. A snake is an energy minimizing, deformable spline influenced by constraint and image forces that pull it towards object contours and internal forces that resist deformation. Snakes may be understood as a special case of the general technique of matching a deformable model to an image by means of energy minimization. In two dimensions, the active shape model represents a discrete version of this approach, taking advantage of the point distribution model to restrict the shape range to an explicit domain learnt from a training set. Snakes do not solve the entire problem of finding contours in images, since the method requires knowledge of the desired contour shape beforehand. Rather, they depend on other mechanisms such as interaction with a user, interaction with some higher level image understanding process, or information from image data adjacent in time or space. Motivation In computer vision, contour models describe the boundaries of shapes in an image. Snakes in particular are designed to solve problems where the approximate shape of the boundary is known. By being a deformable model, snakes can adapt to differences and noise in stereo matching and motion tracking. Additionally, the method can find Illusory contours in the image by ignoring missing boundary information. Compared to classical feature extraction techniques, snakes have multiple advantages: They autonomously and adaptively search for the minimum state. External image forces act upon the snake in an intuitive manner. Incorporating Gaussian smoothing in the image energy function introduces scale sensitivity. They can be used to track dynamic objects. The key drawbacks of the traditional snakes are They are sensitive to local minima states, which can be counteracted by simulated annealing techniques. Minute features are often ignored during energy minimization over the entire contour. Their accuracy depends on the convergence policy. Energy formulation A simple elastic snake is defined by a set of n points v i {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{i}} for i = 0 , … , n − 1 {\displaystyle i=0,\ldots ,n-1} , the internal elastic energy term E internal {\displaystyle E_{\text{internal}}} , and the external edge-based energy term E external {\displaystyle E_{\text{external}}} . The purpose of the internal energy term is to control the deformations made to the snake, and the purpose of the external energy term is to control the fitting of the contour onto the image. The external energy is usually a combination of the forces due to the image itself E image {\displaystyle E_{\text{image}}} and the constraint forces introduced by the user E con {\displaystyle E_{\text{con}}} The energy function of the snake is the sum of its external energy and internal energy, or E snake ∗ = ∫ 0 1 E snake ( v ( s ) ) d s = ∫ 0 1 ( E internal ( v ( s ) ) + E image ( v ( s ) ) + E con ( v ( s ) ) ) d s {\displaystyle E_{\text{snake}}^{*}=\int \limits _{0}^{1}E_{\text{snake}}(\mathbf {v} (s))\,ds=\int \limits _{0}^{1}(E_{\text{internal}}(\mathbf {v} (s))+E_{\text{image}}(\mathbf {v} (s))+E_{\text{con}}(\mathbf {v} (s)))\,ds} Internal energy The internal energy of the snake is composed of the continuity of the contour E cont {\displaystyle E_{\text{cont}}} and the smoothness of the contour E curv {\displaystyle E_{\text{curv}}} . E internal = E cont + E curv {\displaystyle E_{\text{internal}}=E_{\text{cont}}+E_{\text{curv}}} This can be expanded as E internal = 1 2 ( α ( s ) | v s ( s ) | 2 ) + 1 2 ( β ( s ) | v s s ( s ) | 2 ) = 1 2 ( α ( s ) ‖ d v ¯ d s ( s ) ‖ 2 + β ( s ) ‖ d 2 v ¯ d s 2 ( s ) ‖ 2 ) {\displaysty
