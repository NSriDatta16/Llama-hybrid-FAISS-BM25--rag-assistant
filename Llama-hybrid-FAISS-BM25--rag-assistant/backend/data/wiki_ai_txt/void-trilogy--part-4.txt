echnology and gaiafield technology, among others. Characters from the Commonwealth Saga The Dreaming Void makes both references and features characters from the Commonwealth Saga. Paula Myo is now the chief of ANA security. In the Dreaming Void she is tasked with tracking Aaron and the Second Dreamer. After the events of the Starflyer War, Paula removed her rigid and unyielding hardwired genetic anomalies by Huxley Haven that made her obsessive and insensitive to criminals. In the years between the two books, Paula fought an appeal to keep Gene Yaohui (Oscar Monroe) in suspension. She also tracked down the deadly assassin and leader of the Knight Guardians, Cat "Catherine" Steward, resulting in Stewards 5000-year suspension. Late in life, Paula has taken a liking to music, listening to a vast diversity of music including Pink Floyd, Rachmaninoff and Deeley KTC. She also has a starship called the Alexis Denken, named after her lover from the Hive briefly mentioned in the Commonwealth Saga. Cat "Catherine" Steward is another character making an appearance. She took control of the Guardians of Selfhood after the Starflyer war, changing and rebranding them as the Knights Guardian. They eventually took control of Far Away and claimed independence. Far Away became a model for new planets in the generations after the Starflyer war. Cat was caught by Paula Myo after brutally killing Tiger Pansy, who in the years following the Starflyer war resided on Far Away with the Raiel Quatux. Gore Burnelli, helped create the ANA and is rumoured to be the leader of the Conservative faction; although he denies it, claiming he only has affiliations with the Conservatives. Justine, Gore's daughter, resides in the ANA. In the events of the Dreaming Void she leaves the ANA and acts as its physical ambassador. After 1,100 years Oscar Monroe was relifed. With no friends and family left, he had to start fresh. He initially sought recruitment from the Navy, however they had no desire for his services. He ended up as a starship pilot living on the External World of Orakum and lives with three life partners; Jesaral, Anja and Dushiku. Paula Myo recruits Monroe in order to find the Second Dreamer. Many other characters are referenced. Both Crispin Goldreich and Tonie Gall migrated into the ANA. After circumnavigating the galaxy Wilson and Anna Kime also joined the ANA. Mellanie is mentioned as having married Orion; and is an ancestor of Araminta. The Halgarths dynasty maintain Iaioud, an external world. Nigel Sheldon is briefly mentioned to have headed to another galaxy as the Void problem ultimately renders the Milky Way doomed. The Void The Void was created by the Firstlife—the first beings to have existed in the galaxy—to reach the state of post-physical and fulfilment. It is where Makkathran is situated. The people in the Void have psychic abilities such as "farsight" and the "third hand". The Void requires a tremendous amount of energy to sustain itself and the abilities it offers, which it acquires by expanding, consuming planets and star systems and converting them into energy. The Anomine is a race of alien beings who have reached post-physical status. They spread to many star systems in their prime. During this age, they discovered the Prime aliens and the threat they pose. They borrowed two DFspheres from the Raiel to generate the barriers around Dyson Alpha and Beta, the two star systems the Prime aliens inhabit, and confine them there (see the Commonwealth Saga). At the events of the Void trilogy, most of the Anomine already went post-physical, while some still live on their homeworld, living a life without the use of technology. The human race has spread to many star systems which are named the Greater Commonwealth. There are Inner Worlds, where most of the citizens are "Higher humans"—humans who utilise Biononics. Biononics enable the human body to essentially live forever as they rejuvenate the human body on a constant basis. Almost every huma
