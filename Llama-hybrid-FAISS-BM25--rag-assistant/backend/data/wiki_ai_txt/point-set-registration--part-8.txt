ence the structure of the algorithm remains unchanged, with the main difference being how the rotation and translation matrices are solved. Thin plate spline robust point matching The thin plate spline robust point matching (TPS-RPM) algorithm by Chui and Rangarajan augments the RPM method to perform non-rigid registration by parametrizing the transformation as a thin plate spline. However, because the thin plate spline parametrization only exists in three dimensions, the method cannot be extended to problems involving four or more dimensions. Kernel correlation The kernel correlation (KC) approach of point set registration was introduced by Tsin and Kanade. Compared with ICP, the KC algorithm is more robust against noisy data. Unlike ICP, where, for every model point, only the closest scene point is considered, here every scene point affects every model point. As such this is a multiply-linked registration algorithm. For some kernel function K {\displaystyle K} , the kernel correlation K C {\displaystyle KC} of two points x i , x j {\displaystyle x_{i},x_{j}} is defined thus: The kernel function K {\displaystyle K} chosen for point set registration is typically symmetric and non-negative kernel, similar to the ones used in the Parzen window density estimation. The Gaussian kernel typically used for its simplicity, although other ones like the Epanechnikov kernel and the tricube kernel may be substituted. The kernel correlation of an entire point set χ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {\chi }}} is defined as the sum of the kernel correlations of every point in the set to every other point in the set: The logarithm of KC of a point set is proportional, within a constant factor, to the information entropy. Observe that the KC is a measure of a "compactness" of the point set—trivially, if all points in the point set were at the same location, the KC would evaluate to a large value. The cost function of the point set registration algorithm for some transformation parameter θ {\displaystyle \theta } is defined thus: Some algebraic manipulation yields: The expression is simplified by observing that K C ( S ) {\displaystyle KC({\mathcal {S}})} is independent of θ {\displaystyle \theta } . Furthermore, assuming rigid registration, K C ( T ( M , θ ) ) {\displaystyle KC(T({\mathcal {M}},\theta ))} is invariant when θ {\displaystyle \theta } is changed because the Euclidean distance between every pair of points stays the same under rigid transformation. So the above equation may be rewritten as: The kernel density estimates are defined as: P M ( x , θ ) = 1 M ∑ m ∈ M K ( x , T ( m , θ ) ) {\displaystyle P_{\mathcal {M}}(x,\theta )={\frac {1}{M}}\sum _{m\in {\mathcal {M}}}K(x,T(m,\theta ))} P S ( x ) = 1 N ∑ s ∈ S K ( x , s ) {\displaystyle P_{\mathcal {S}}(x)={\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{s\in {\mathcal {S}}}K(x,s)} The cost function can then be shown to be the correlation of the two kernel density estimates: Having established the cost function, the algorithm simply uses gradient descent to find the optimal transformation. It is computationally expensive to compute the cost function from scratch on every iteration, so a discrete version of the cost function Equation (kc.6) is used. The kernel density estimates P M , P S {\displaystyle P_{\mathcal {M}},P_{\mathcal {S}}} can be evaluated at grid points and stored in a lookup table. Unlike the ICP and related methods, it is not necessary to find the nearest neighbour, which allows the KC algorithm to be comparatively simple in implementation. Compared to ICP and EM-ICP for noisy 2D and 3D point sets, the KC algorithm is less sensitive to noise and results in correct registration more often. Gaussian mixture model The kernel density estimates are sums of Gaussians and may therefore be represented as Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Jian and Vemuri use the GMM version of the KC registration algorithm to perform non-rigid registration parametrized by thin plate splines. Coherent point drift Coherent point drift
