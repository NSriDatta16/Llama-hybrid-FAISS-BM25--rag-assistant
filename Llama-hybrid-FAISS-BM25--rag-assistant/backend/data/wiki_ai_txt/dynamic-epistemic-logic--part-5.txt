}})\land C({\color {red}{A}}\vee {\color {blue}{A}}\vee {\color {green}{A}})} 'Everybody knows that A {\displaystyle A} has either the red, green or blue card and this is even common knowledge among all agents'. Knowledge versus Belief We use the same notation K j {\displaystyle K_{j}} for both knowledge and belief. Hence, depending on the context, K j ϕ {\displaystyle K_{j}\phi } will either read ‘the agent j {\displaystyle j} Knows that ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } holds’ or ‘the agent j {\displaystyle j} Believes that ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } holds’. A crucial difference is that, unlike knowledge, beliefs can be wrong: the axiom K j ϕ → ϕ {\displaystyle K_{j}\phi \rightarrow \phi } holds only for knowledge, but not necessarily for belief. This axiom called axiom T (for Truth) states that if the agent knows a proposition, then this proposition is true. It is often considered to be the hallmark of knowledge and it has not been subjected to any serious attack ever since its introduction in the Theaetetus by Plato. The notion of knowledge might comply to some other constraints (or axioms) such as K j ϕ → K j K j ϕ {\displaystyle K_{j}\phi \rightarrow K_{j}K_{j}\phi } : if agent j {\displaystyle j} knows something, she knows that she knows it. These constraints might affect the nature of the accessibility relations R j {\displaystyle R_{j}} which may then comply to some extra properties. So, we are now going to define some particular classes of epistemic models that all add some extra constraints on the accessibility relations R j {\displaystyle R_{j}} . These constraints are matched by particular axioms for the knowledge operator K j {\displaystyle K_{j}} . Below each property, we give the axiom which defines the class of epistemic frames that fulfill this property. ( K ϕ {\displaystyle K\phi } stands for K j ϕ {\displaystyle K_{j}\phi } for any j ∈ A G T S {\displaystyle j\in AGTS} .) We discuss the axioms above. Axiom 4 states that if the agent knows a proposition, then she knows that she knows it (this axiom is also known as the “KK-principle”or “KK-thesis”). In epistemology, axiom 4 tends to be accepted by internalists, but not by externalists. Axiom 4 is nevertheless widely accepted by computer scientists (but also by many philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Spinoza and Schopenhauer, as Hintikka recalls ). A more controversial axiom for the logic of knowledge is axiom 5 for Euclidicity: this axiom states that if the agent does not know a proposition, then she knows that she does not know it. Most philosophers (including Hintikka) have attacked this axiom, since numerous examples from everyday life seem to invalidate it. In general, axiom 5 is invalidated when the agent has mistaken beliefs, which can be due for example to misperceptions, lies or other forms of deception. Axiom B states that it cannot be the case that the agent considers it possible that she knows a false proposition (that is, ¬ ( ¬ ϕ ∧ ¬ K ¬ K ϕ ) {\displaystyle \neg (\neg \phi \land \neg K\neg K\phi )} ). If we assume that axioms T and 4 are valid, then axiom B falls prey to the same attack as the one for axiom 5 since this axiom is derivable. Axiom D states that the agent's beliefs are consistent. In combination with axiom K (where the knowledge operator is replaced by a belief operator), axiom D is in fact equivalent to a simpler axiom D' which conveys, maybe more explicitly, the fact that the agent's beliefs cannot be inconsistent: ¬ B ⊥ {\displaystyle \neg B\bot } . The other intricate axioms .2, .3, .3.2 and .4 have been introduced by epistemic logicians such as Lenzen and Kutchera in the 1970s and presented for some of them as key axioms of epistemic logic. They can be characterized in terms of intuitive interaction axioms relating knowledge and beliefs. Axiomatization The Hilbert proof system K for the basic modal logic is defined by the following axioms and inference rules: for all j ∈ A G T S {\displaystyle j\in AGTS} , The axiom
