and manage a spacefaring gunship called the 'Railjack', which is deployed in combat, unlike the Orbiter. Railjack was designed as a co-op experience with up to four people working together, performing different tasks to keep the ship operational while destroying enemy ships and completing objectives. A Railjack-focused update was released in 2021, which brought expanded content and a new skill tree system aimed at making solo play more accessible. Through the Orbiter's console, the player can select any of the available missions to them. To progress through the Solar System, players must complete mission 'nodes' on each planet to reach Junctions, and use these Junctions to travel to other planets. Other missions rotate over time as part of the game's living universe; these can include missions with special rewards and community challenges to allow all players to reap benefits if they are successfully met. High-difficulty daily and weekly challenges offer rare rewards. Aboard the Orbiter, the player can manage their arsenal of equipment, customize their Warframes and weapons, craft new equipment, and access the in-game marketplace. Missions can be played alone or with up to four players in a player versus environment cooperative manner, and are generally played on procedurally generated maps. Missions have various objectives, such as defeating a certain number of enemies (Exterminate), stealing data from terminals without raising enemy alarms (Spy), rescuing and escorting prisoners (Rescue), or defending points on the map for set periods (Defense). Later updates have added three large open-field environments where the player can accept bounties composed of several missions in succession. Players can use their weapons, abilities, and several parkour maneuvers to navigate through the area and defeat enemies within the mission. Upon losing all health, a player becomes downed; an ally may revive them, or a player may revive themselves a limited number of times each day. Once the mission is complete, players are rewarded with in-game items, as well as in-game currency and items picked up while exploring the map; failure to complete a mission causes these rewards to be lost. In addition to cooperative missions, the game includes player versus player (PvP) content through the multiplayer 'Conclave', which also rewards the player for placing highly in such matches. New Warframes, weapons, and other gear items are primarily acquired through equipment blueprints, which are then used to build the specified item in the Orbiter's Foundry. Blueprints and their resulting equipment may also be purchased directly using Platinum, the game's premium currency that can be traded for with other players for rare items in-game, or be purchased via microtransactions. Players need to have specific quantities of construction resources, found from missions and their rewards, to build these items. Players and their equipment also gain experience and level up from missions; equipment with higher levels support more 'Mods', abstracted upgrades (presented as cards in the game's UI) that can be slotted into the equipment to improve or customize its performance. Mods are rarely dropped by enemies during missions, and can also be mission rewards, traded between players, or purchased from NPC merchants. The most advanced weapon mods, called 'Riven Mods,' have randomized stats, based on a prefix/suffix system characteristic of ARPGs, and frequently have negative values. Alongside mods, players have other means of improving their equipment, including Orokin Catalysts and Reactors, which double total mod capacity, and conditional advanced upgrades like Exilus Adapters, Arcane Enhancements, and Valence Fusion. Most items stop gaining levels and experience points at rank 30, at which point an item called Forma may be used to customize its capacity for mods, and reset it to rank 0.
