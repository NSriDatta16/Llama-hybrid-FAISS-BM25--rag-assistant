 Global Acceleration Program with Station F, the IndiaAI Application Development Initiative, and IndiaAI FutureSkills on 6 March 2025, as part of the IndiaAI Mission to strengthen AI-driven research, innovation, and skill development. For public officials, the iGOT-AI Mission Karmayogi incorporates AI-driven learning recommendations. AIKosha: IndiaAI Datasets Platform To facilitate AI innovation, AIKosha will offer a safe, centralized platform with easy access to a database of models, use cases, and datasets. Through an integrated development environment, tools, and tutorials, it offers AI sandbox capabilities. AIKosha has features like permission-based access, content discoverability, AI readiness scoring of datasets, and security methods including secure APIs, firewalls for real-time harmful traffic filtering, and data encryption both in motion and at rest. More than 80 models and 300 datasets are available on AIKosha. Both the public and private sector organizations gather AIKosha datasets, which include census data, geospatial data, and linguistic data. IndiaAI Startups Global Acceleration Program The IndiaAI Mission will begin a four-month acceleration program in partnership with Station F and HEC Paris from 2025. The ten shortlisted AI startup companies will have access to networking opportunities, mentorship, and international market expansion in Europe. AI Research Analytics and Knowledge Dissemination Platform With a peak performance of 13,170 teraflops, AIRAWAT-PSAI is the biggest and fastest AI supercomputing machine in India. It was deployed at C-DAC, Pune in 2023 and is maintained by Netweb Technologies. MeitY is also funding the implementation of 200 AI Petaflops Mixed Precision peak computing capacity (scalable to 790 AI Petaflops) Proof of Concept for AI Research Analytics and Knowledge Dissemination Platform (AIRAWAT), which is being carried out by C-DAC, Pune. A combined peak compute of 410 AI Petaflops Mixed Precision and a sustained compute capability of 8.5 Petaflops (Rmax) Double Precision are achieved by combining the 200 AI Petaflop AIRAWAT PoC with the 210 AI Petaflop PARAM Siddhi-AI. 13 Petaflops is the maximum computation capacity (Double Precision, Rpeak). A plan for expanding AIRAWAT to 1,000 AI Petaflops of Mixed Precision computing capacity has been envisioned by MeitY. With its extensive, power-optimized AI cloud infrastructure, AIRAWAT will serve as a common computational cloud platform for Big Data Analytics and Assimilation, linking all Centers for Research Excellence in Artificial Intelligence (COREs), Indian Centres for Transformational AI (ICTAIs), and other academic, research lab, scientific community, industry, and start-up institutions with the National Knowledge Network. With an emphasis on NLP, surveillance and image processing, pattern recognition, medical imaging, education, agriculture, finance, healthcare, audio assistance, robotics, national security, defense, the automotive industry, supply chain management, human resource development, and anomalous behavior detection from video analytics, AIRAWAT will support the field of applied AI. Deployed under the National Supercomputing Mission, it will support the Digital India Bhashini initiative and accomplish the goals of the National Program on AI. International collaboration Prime Minister Narendra Modi with NITI Aayog officially opened the World Economic Forum's Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution liaison office in Navi Mumbai on 11 October 2018. It's objective is to foster the responsible adoption and deployment of new technologies by designing policy frameworks and protocols with the government, corporations, academic institutions, startups, and international organizations. The Indian team will collaborate with their counterparts in Beijing, Tokyo, and San Francisco to focus on blockchain & DLT, AI & ML. To increase farmers' incomes, C4IR has been working on AI-driven agricultural initiatives since 2018. In January 2024,
