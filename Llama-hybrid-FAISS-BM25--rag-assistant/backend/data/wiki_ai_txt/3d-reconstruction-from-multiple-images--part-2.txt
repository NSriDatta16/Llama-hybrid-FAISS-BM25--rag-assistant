 × 4 nonsingular matrix T. A projective reconstruction can be calculated by correspondence of points only without any a priori information. Auto-calibration In auto-calibration or self-calibration, camera motion and parameters are recovered first, using rigidity. Then structure can be readily calculated. Two methods implementing this idea are presented as follows: Kruppa equations With a minimum of three displacements, we can obtain the internal parameters of the camera using a system of polynomial equations due to Kruppa, which are derived from a geometric interpretation of the rigidity constraint. The matrix K = A A ⊤ {\displaystyle K=AA^{\top }} is unknown in the Kruppa equations, named Kruppa coefficients matrix. With K and by the method of Cholesky factorization one can obtain the intrinsic parameters easily: K = [ k 1 k 2 k 3 k 2 k 4 k 5 k 3 k 5 1 ] {\displaystyle K={\begin{bmatrix}k_{1}&k_{2}&k_{3}\\k_{2}&k_{4}&k_{5}\\k_{3}&k_{5}&1\\\end{bmatrix}}} Recently Hartley proposed a simpler form. Let F {\displaystyle F} be written as F = D U V ⊤ {\displaystyle F=DUV^{\top }} , where Then the Kruppa equations are rewritten (the derivation can be found in ) Mendonça and Cipolla This method is based on the use of rigidity constraint. Design a cost function, which considers the intrinsic parameters as arguments and the fundamental matrices as parameters. F i j {\displaystyle {F}_{ij}} is defined as the fundamental matrix, A i {\displaystyle {A}_{i}} and A j {\displaystyle {A}_{j}} as intrinsic parameters matrices. Stratification Recently, new methods based on the concept of stratification have been proposed. Starting from a projective structure, which can be calculated from correspondences only, upgrade this projective reconstruction to a Euclidean reconstruction, by making use of all the available constraints. With this idea the problem can be stratified into different sections: according to the amount of constraints available, it can be analyzed at a different level, projective, affine or Euclidean. The stratification of 3D geometry Usually, the world is perceived as a 3D Euclidean space. In some cases, it is not possible to use the full Euclidean structure of 3D space. The simplest being projective, then the affine geometry which forms the intermediate layers and finally Euclidean geometry. The concept of stratification is closely related to the series of transformations on geometric entities: in the projective stratum is a series of projective transformations (a homography), in the affine stratum is a series of affine transformations, and in Euclidean stratum is a series of Euclidean transformations. Suppose that a fixed scene is captured by two or more perspective cameras and the correspondences between visible points in different images are already given. However, in practice, the matching is an essential and extremely challenging issue in computer vision. Here, we suppose that n {\displaystyle n} 3D points A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} are observed by m {\displaystyle m} cameras with projection matrices P j , j = 1 , … , m . {\displaystyle P_{j},j=1,\ldots ,m.} Neither the positions of point nor the projection of camera are known. Only the projections a i j {\displaystyle a_{ij}} of the i t h {\displaystyle i^{th}} point in the j t h {\displaystyle j^{th}} image are known. Projective reconstruction Simple counting indicates we have 2 n m {\displaystyle 2nm} independent measurements and only 11 m + 3 n {\displaystyle 11m+3n} unknowns, so the problem is supposed to be soluble with enough points and images. The equations in homogeneous coordinates can be represented: a i j ∼ P j A i i = 1 , … n , j = 1 , … m {\displaystyle a_{ij}\sim P_{j}A_{i}\qquad i=1,\ldots n,~~j=1,\ldots m} (2) So we can apply a nonsingular 4 × 4 transformation H to projections P j {\displaystyle P_{j}} → P j H − 1 {\displaystyle P_{j}H^{-1}} and world points A i {\displaystyle A_{i}} → H A i {\displaystyle HA_{i}} . Hence, without further constraints, recons
