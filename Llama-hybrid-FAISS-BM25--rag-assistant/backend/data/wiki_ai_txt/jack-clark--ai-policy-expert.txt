Jack Clark is a co-founder of Anthropic and serves as its head of policy. He is also engaged in global AI policy, serving as an expert for the Global Partnership on AI and on an AI committee of the OECD. Career Clark was born in Brighton, England. Before joining OpenAI, Clark was a technology journalist, writing about topics including distributed systems, quantum computing, and AI for news outlets like The Register and Bloomberg News. Clark worked at OpenAI from 2016 to 2020, doing strategy and communications and becoming policy director. He then co-founded and joined Anthropic. Clark maintains a newsletter called "Import AI", which covers AI-related news, analyses, and includes short stories. Clark is co-chair of Stanford's AI Index (an organization that publishes yearly reports on the state of AI progress), and of the OECD's working group for classifying and defining AI systems. In 2023, Clark gave a briefing at the first United Nations Security Council meeting on AIâ€™s threats to global peace, where he argued for "developing ways to test for capabilities, misuses and potential safety flaws" of AI systems, and encouraged global action. In 2024, he pushed back against claims that AI progress was slowing, and warned that most people are not prepared for its pace. In 2025, Clark wrote in his newsletter Import AI an essay named "Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear". Clark wrote about advanced AI, "make no mistake: what we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine." The pro-regulation stance of Clark and Anthropic were criticized by David Sacks (Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar) who warned that AI regulation would reduce the United States' ability to compete with China.
