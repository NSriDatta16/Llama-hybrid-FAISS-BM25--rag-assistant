 with its data stream mining plugin (formerly concept drift plugin). EDDM (Early Drift Detection Method): free open-source implementation of drift detection methods in Weka. MOA (Massive Online Analysis): free open-source software specific for mining data streams with concept drift. It contains a prequential evaluation method, the EDDM concept drift methods, a reader of ARFF real datasets, and artificial stream generators as SEA concepts, STAGGER, rotating hyperplane, random tree, and random radius based functions. MOA supports bi-directional interaction with Weka. Datasets Real USP Data Stream Repository, 27 real-world stream datasets with concept drift compiled by Souza et al. (2020).

PAKDD'09 competition data represents the credit evaluation task. It is collected over a five-year period. Unfortunately, the true labels are released only for the first part of the data. Access Sensor stream and Power supply stream datasets are available from X. Zhu's Stream Data Mining Repository. Access SMEAR is a benchmark data stream with a lot of missing values. Environment observation data over 7 years. Predict cloudiness. Access Text mining, a collection of text mining datasets with concept drift, maintained by I. Katakis. Access Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset, a collection of 13,910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors utilized for drift compensation in a discrimination task of 6 gases at various levels of concentrations. Access Other KDD'99 competition data contains simulated intrusions in a military network environment. It is often used as a benchmark to evaluate handling concept drift.
