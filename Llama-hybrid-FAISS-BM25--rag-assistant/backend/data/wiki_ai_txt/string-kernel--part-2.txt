orithms, data enters into the algorithm only in expressions involving an inner product of feature vectors, hence the name kernel methods. A desirable consequence of this is that one does not need to explicitly calculate the transformation Ï• ( x ) {\displaystyle \phi (x)} , only the inner product via the kernel, which may be a lot quicker, especially when approximated. == References ==
