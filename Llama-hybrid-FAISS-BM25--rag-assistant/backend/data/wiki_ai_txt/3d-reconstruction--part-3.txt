onstruction is based on two or more images, although it may employ only one image in some cases. There are various types of methods for image acquisition that depends on the occasions and purposes of the specific application. Not only the requirements of the application must be met, but also the visual disparity, illumination, performance of camera and the feature of scenario should be considered. Camera calibration Camera calibration in Binocular Stereo Vision refers to the determination of the mapping relationship between the image points P 1 ( u 1 , v 1 ) {\displaystyle P_{1}(u_{1},v_{1})} and P 2 ( u 2 , v 2 ) {\displaystyle P_{2}(u_{2},v_{2})} , and space coordinate P ( x p , y p , z p ) {\displaystyle P(x_{p},y_{p},z_{p})} in the 3D scenario. Camera calibration is a basic and essential part in 3D reconstruction via Binocular Stereo Vision. Feature extraction The aim of feature extraction is to gain the characteristics of the images, through which the stereo correspondence processes. As a result, the characteristics of the images closely link to the choice of matching methods. There is no such universally applicable theory for features extraction, leading to a great diversity of stereo correspondence in Binocular Stereo Vision research. Stereo correspondence Stereo correspondence is to establish the correspondence between primitive factors in images, i.e. to match P 1 ( u 1 , v 1 ) {\displaystyle P_{1}(u_{1},v_{1})} and P 2 ( u 2 , v 2 ) {\displaystyle P_{2}(u_{2},v_{2})} from two images. Certain interference factors in the scenario should be noticed, e.g. illumination, noise, surface physical characteristic, etc. Restoration According to precise correspondence, combined with camera location parameters, 3D geometric information can be recovered without difficulties. Due to the fact that accuracy of 3D reconstruction depends on the precision of correspondence, error of camera location parameters and so on, the previous procedures must be done carefully to achieve relatively accurate 3D reconstruction. 3D Reconstruction of medical images Clinical routine of diagnosis, patient follow-up, computer assisted surgery, surgical planning etc. are facilitated by accurate 3D models of the desired part of human anatomy. Main motivation behind 3D reconstruction includes Improved accuracy due to multi view aggregation. Detailed surface estimates. Can be used to plan, simulate, guide, or otherwise assist a surgeon in performing a medical procedure. The precise position and orientation of the patient's anatomy can be determined. Helps in a number of clinical areas, such as radiotherapy planning and treatment verification, spinal surgery, hip replacement, neurointerventions and aortic stenting. Applications: 3D reconstruction has applications in many fields. They include: Pavement engineering Medicine Free-viewpoint video reconstruction Robotic mapping City planning Tomographic reconstruction Gaming Virtual environments and virtual tourism Earth observation Archaeology Augmented reality Reverse engineering Motion capture Digital Preservation of Cultural Heritage 3D object recognition, gesture recognition and hand tracking Problem Statement: Mostly algorithms available for 3D reconstruction are extremely slow and cannot be used in real-time. Though the algorithms presented are still in infancy but they have the potential for fast computation. Existing Approaches: Delaunay and alpha-shapes Delaunay method involves extraction of tetrahedron surfaces from initial point cloud. The idea of ‘shape’ for a set of points in space is given by concept of alpha-shapes. Given a finite point set S, and the real parameter alpha, the alpha-shape of S is a polytope (the generalization to any dimension of a two dimensional polygon and a three-dimensional polyhedron) which is neither convex nor necessarily connected. For a large value, the alpha-shape is identical to the convex-hull of S. The algorithm proposed by Edelsbrunner and Mucke eliminates all tetrah
