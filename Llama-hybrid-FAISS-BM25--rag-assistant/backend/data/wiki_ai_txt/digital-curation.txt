Digital curation is the selection, preservation, maintenance, collection, and archiving of digital assets. Digital curation establishes, maintains, and adds value to repositories of digital data for present and future use. This is often accomplished by archivists, librarians, scientists, historians, and scholars. Enterprises are starting to use digital curation to improve the quality of information and data within their operational and strategic processes. Successful digital curation will mitigate digital obsolescence, keeping the information accessible to users indefinitely. Digital curation includes digital asset management, data curation, digital preservation, and electronic records management. Word History Much like the word archive has layered meanings and uses, the word curation is both a noun and a verb, used originally in the field of museology to represent a wide range of activities, most often associated with collection care, long-term preservation, and exhibition design. Curation can be a reference to physical repositories that store cultural heritage or natural resource collections (e.g., a curatorial repository) or a representation of varied policies and processes involved with the long-term care and management of heritage collections, digital archives, and research data (e.g, curatorial/collections management plans, curation life-cycle, and data curation). Yet curation is also associated with short-term objectives and processes of selection and interpretation for the purposes of presentation, such as for gallery exhibitions and websites, which contribute to knowledge creation. It has also been applied to interaction with social media including compiling digital images, web links, and movie files. The term curation entered the legal framework through federal historic preservation laws, starting with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and was further defined and coded into federal regulations through 36 CFR Part 79: Curation of Federally-owned and Administered Archaeological Collections. Curation has since permeated into an array of disciplines but remains closely tied to heritage and information management. Core Principles and Activities The term "digital curation" was first used in the e-science and biological science fields as a means of differentiating the additional suite of activities ordinarily employed by library and museum curators to add value to their collections and enable its reuse from the smaller subtask of simply preserving the data, a significantly more concise archival task. Additionally, the historical understanding of the term "curator" demands more than simple care of the collection. A curator is expected to command academic mastery of the subject matter as a requisite part of appraisal and selection of assets and any subsequent adding of value to the collection through application of metadata. Principles There are five commonly accepted principles that govern the occupation of digital curation: Manage the complete birth-to-retirement life cycle of the digital asset. Evaluate and cull assets for inclusion in the collection. Apply preservation methods to strengthen the assetâ€™s integrity and reusability for future users. Act proactively throughout the asset life cycle to add value to both the digital asset and the collection. Facilitate the appropriate degree of access to users. Methodology The Digital Curation Center offers the following step-by-step life cycle procedures for putting the above principles into practice: Sequential Actions: Conceptualize: Consider what digital material you will be creating and develop storage options. Take into account websites, publications, email, among other types of digital output. Create: Produce digital material and attach all relevant metadata, typically the more metadata the more accessible the information. Appraise and select: Consult the mission statement of the institution or private collection and determine what digital data is relevant. T
