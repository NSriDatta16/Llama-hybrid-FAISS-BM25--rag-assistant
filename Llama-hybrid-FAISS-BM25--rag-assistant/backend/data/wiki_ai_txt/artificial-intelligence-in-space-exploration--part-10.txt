ers. Virtual assistants and search Intelligent personal assistants use AI to attempt to respond to natural language requests. Siri, released in 2010 for Apple smartphones, popularized the concept. Bing Chat has used artificial intelligence as part of its search engine. Spam filtering Machine learning can be used to combat spam, scams, and phishing. It can scrutinize the contents of spam and phishing attacks to attempt to identify malicious elements. Some models built via machine learning algorithms have over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails. These models can be refined using new data and evolving spam tactics. Machine learning also analyzes traits such as sender behavior, email header information, and attachment types, potentially enhancing spam detection. Facial recognition and image labeling AI has been used in facial recognition systems. Some examples are Apple's Face ID and Android's Face Unlock, which are used to secure mobile devices. China has used facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology in Xinjiang. In 2017, reporters visiting the region found surveillance cameras installed every hundred meters or so in several cities, as well as facial recognition checkpoints at areas like gas stations, shopping centers, and mosque entrances. Human rights groups have criticized the Chinese government for using artificial intelligence facial recognition technology for use in political suppression. The Netherlands has deployed facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology since 2016. The database of the Dutch police currently contains over 2.2 million pictures of 1.3 million Dutch citizens. This accounts for about 8% of the population. In The Netherlands, face recognition is not used by the police on municipal CCTV. Image labeling has been used by Google Image Labeler to detect products in photos and to allow people to search based on a photo. Image labeling has also been demonstrated to generate speech to describe images to blind people. Facebook's DeepFace identifies human faces in digital images. Scientific research Evidence of general impacts In April 2024, the Scientific Advice Mechanism to the European Commission published advice including a comprehensive evidence review of the opportunities and challenges posed by artificial intelligence in scientific research. As benefits, the evidence review highlighted: its role in accelerating research and innovation its capacity to automate workflows enhancing dissemination of scientific work As challenges: limitations and risks around transparency, reproducibility and interpretability poor performance (inaccuracy) risk of harm through misuse or unintended use societal concerns including the spread of misinformation and increasing inequalities Archaeology, history and imaging of sites Machine learning can help to restore and attribute ancient texts. It can help to index texts for example to enable better and easier searching and classification of fragments. Artificial intelligence can also be used to investigate genomes to uncover genetic history, such as interbreeding between archaic and modern humans by which for example the past existence of a ghost population, not Neanderthal or Denisovan, was inferred. It can also be used for "non-invasive and non-destructive access to internal structures of archaeological remains". Physics A deep learning system was reported to learn intuitive physics from visual data (of virtual 3D environments) based on an unpublished approach inspired by studies of visual cognition in infants. Other researchers have developed a machine learning algorithm that could discover sets of basic variables of various physical systems and predict the systems' future dynamics from video recordings of their behavior. In the future, it may be possible that such can be used to automate the discovery of physical laws of complex systems.
