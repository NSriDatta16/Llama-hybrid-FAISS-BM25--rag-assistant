lease of the software for processing the data, training the model and making inferences from the model. For the data, it only requires "sufficiently detailed information about the data used to train the system so that a skilled person can build a substantially equivalent system". In 2023 Llama 1 and 2, MosaicML's MPT, and Mistral AI's Mistral and Mixtral models were released. In 2024, Meta released a collection of large AI models, including Llama 3.1 405B, comparable to the most advanced closed-source models. The company claimed its approach to AI would be open-source, differing from other major tech companies. The Open Source Initiative and others stated that Llama is not open-source despite Meta describing it as open-source, due to Llama's software license prohibiting it from being used for some purposes. DeepSeek released their V3 LLM in December 2024, and their R1 reasoning model on January 20, 2025, both as open-weights models under the MIT license. Since the release of OpenAI's proprietary ChatGPT model in late 2022, there have been only a few fully open (weights, data, code, etc.) large language models released. Among these are the OLMo series of models released by the Allen Institute for AI. In September 2025, a Swiss consortium added to this short list by releasing a fully open model named Apertus, released in two sizes: an 8B and a 70B model. Latam-GPT, an open Latin America-focused model, is one other ongoing regional effort in this space. Ethics In parallel with the development of AI models, there has been growing interest in ensuring ethical standards in AI development. This includes addressing concerns such as bias, privacy, and the potential for misuse of AI systems. As a result, frameworks for responsible AI development and the creation of guidelines for documenting ethical considerations, such as the Model Card concept introduced by Google, have gained popularity, though studies show the continued need for their adoption to avoid unintended negative outcomes. Frameworks The LF AI & Data Foundation, a project under the Linux Foundation, has significantly influenced the open-source AI landscape by fostering collaboration and innovation, and supporting open-source projects. By providing a neutral platform, LF AI & Data unites developers, researchers, and organizations to build cutting-edge AI and data solutions, addressing critical technical challenges and promoting ethical AI development. As of October 2024, the foundation comprised 77 member companies from North America, Europe, and Asia, and hosted 67 open-source software (OSS) projects contributed by a diverse array of organizations, including silicon valley giants such as Nvidia, Amazon, Intel, and Microsoft. Other large conglomerates like Alibaba, TikTok, AT&T, and IBM have also contributed. Research organizations such as NYU, University of Michigan AI labs, Columbia University, Penn State are also associate members of the LF AI & Data Foundation. In 2024, while the OSAID was in development, the Linux Foundation was also developing a rubric of components of an AI system, and published a draft Model Openness Framework (MOF). The MOF is a system for evaluating and classifying the completeness and openness of machine learning models. It included three classes of openness, from more open to less open: Class I: Open Science Model; Class II: Open Tooling Model, and Class III: Open Model. The Linux Foundation participated in the OSAID development, and OSAID adopted the same rubric of components. In September 2022, the PyTorch Foundation was established to oversee the widely used PyTorch deep learning framework, which was donated by Meta. The foundation's mission is to drive the adoption of AI tools by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open-source, vendor-neutral projects integrated with PyTorch, and to democratize access to state-of-the-art tools, libraries, and other components, making these innovations accessible to everyone. The PyTorch Foundation also s
