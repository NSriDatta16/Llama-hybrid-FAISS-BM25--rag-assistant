ning ChatGPT. The New York Times has sued Microsoft and OpenAI in December 2023, claiming that their engines were trained on wholesale articles from the Times, which the Times considers infringement of their copyright. The Times further claimed that fair use claims made by these AI companies were invalid since the generated information around news stories directly competes with the Times and impacts the newspaper's commercial opportunities. In March 2025, the federal district judge denied OpenAI's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, while narrowing the Times's claims to those related to copyright infringement in training OpenAI's models. Eight U.S. national newspapers owned by Tribune Publishing sued Microsoft and OpenAI in April 2024 over copyright infringement related to the use of their news articles for training data, as well as for output that creates false and misleading statements that are attributed to the newspapers. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and several major music labels sued the developers of Suno AI and Udio, AI models that can take text input to create songs with both lyrics and backing music, in separate lawsuits in June 2024, alleging that both AI models were trained without consent with music from the labels. In September 2024, the Regional Court of Hamburg dismissed a German photographer's lawsuit against the non-profit organization LAION for unauthorized reproduction of his copyrighted work while creating a dataset for AI training. The decision was described as a "landmark ruling on TDM exceptions for AI training data" in Germany and EU more generally. The plaintiff has filed an appeal against the decision. Indian news agency ANI sued OpenAI before the Delhi High Court in India. The suit claims that OpenAI's ChatGPT reproduces ANI's copyrighted news content without authorization, amounting to copyright infringement and unauthorized use of proprietary journalistic material. Several Canadian news agencies under News Media Canada sued OpenAI in November 2024 for copyright violations related to the use of their news articles being used to train ChatGPT. They are seeking damages up to CA$20,000 per news article used for training. The German collecting society GEMA has sued OpenAI in November 2024 for copyright infringement by reproducing copyrighted song texts. And the same society has sued Suno Inc. in January 2025 for reproducing copyrighted works. Both lawsuits were filed in Munich. Midjourney was sued by Disney and NBCUniversal in June 2025 on claims the AI engine, described in the lawsuit as a "bottomless pit of plagiarism", was trained on copyrighted works from both companies without permission, including depictions of their characters. Warner Bros. filed a similar suit in September 2025 against Midjourney. In September 2025, Disney, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery filed a similar lawsuit against the AI image and video generation service Hailuo AI (operated by Chinese technology company MiniMax), alleging that it profits from the unlicensed use of "iconic copyrighted characters." Apple Inc. was sued in September 2025 by authors Grady Hendrix and Jennifer Roberson, who claimed that Apple trained their Apple Intelligence model from a portion of the Pile dataset that included unlicensed copies of their work. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. sued Perplexity AI search engine in September 2025, claiming that the results pulled material from their encyclopedia and Merriam-Webster dictionary website, denying them visits by users, without permission or compensation, as well as generated false results due to the nature of AI that is then attributed to their sites.
