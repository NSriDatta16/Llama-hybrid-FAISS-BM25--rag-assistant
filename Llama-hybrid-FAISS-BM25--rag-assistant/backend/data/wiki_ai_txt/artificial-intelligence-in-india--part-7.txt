irst four AI models—1.5 billion, 7 billion, 13 billion, and 40 billion parameters in size—will be made available as open-source after being trained on 22 Indian languages. The ability to generate text-to-text, text-to-video, speech synthesis and speech recognition will be aided by Hanooman's multimodal learning capability. SML is negotiating with healthcare organizations, BFSI, and mobile app developers to create customized models by refining the Hanooman series. The healthcare model VizzhyGPT is the first of these refined iterations, having been trained on extensive multiomics, clinical research, and electronic health record data. Hanooman's alpha version, which lacks multimodal features and internet access, was launched on May 10, 2024, in 98 international languages, including 12 Indian languages (Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Kannada, Odia, Punjabi, Assamese, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Sindhi). It enables tutoring, coding, and conversation. The platform is collaborating with NASSCOM, Hewlett-Packard, and the Government of Telangana. Yotta Infrastructure will supply GPU cloud infrastructure. As of May 14, 2024, the Hanooman chatbot is accessible via both a web-client and an Android application. Hanooman is jointly owned by SML and 3AI Holding Limited, an AI investment company based in Abu Dhabi. Both businesses will own 50% share under joint ownership arrangement. In order to improve Hanooman's text, voice, image, and coding capabilities for users, it will be able to access 3AI Holding's Omega GenAI, which is being created with 665 billion parameters and 20 trillion tokens. For business clients, Hanooman will launch a proprietary model. BharatGen BharatGen, formerly BharatGPT, marks the next phase of India’s sovereign AI development efforts. IIT Bombay Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan thought of creating a homegrown solution that would use GenAI and take into account the linguistic and cultural diversity of India. An open-source, multimodal, multilingual, India-centric foundation model called BharatGen was formally introduced on September 30, 2024. With an investment of less than ₹235 crore (US$28 million), the Department of Science and Technology is funding the project under National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems. Due to security concerns in mission-critical applications like defense, the project gained strategic importance and aims to reduce reliance on foreign AI models. Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan has been advocating for a public–private partnership in AI through the Bharat GPT program. The earlier Bharat GPT efforts have taken on a more formal role in the BharatGen project, which is anticipated for completion by 2026. As a national mission, BharatGen has been set up to facilitate inter-ministerial cooperation by taking whole-of-government approach. The AI will be developed from the ground up, guaranteeing that all intellectual property stays in the country. IndiaAI Compute Facility will spearhead the project. BharatGen will have robust academic base, incorporating faculty and research institutions into its ecosystem to guarantee sustained innovation. Yotta Infrastructure, and Neysa are providing cloud support. The backend algorithm development and the necessary technical work was done by a collaborative team from BharatGen consortium. As of February 2025, the BharatGen consortium has 50–60 researchers and a wide range of student contributors from the Indian Institute of Management Indore, the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Mandi, and IIT Madras. BharatGen consortium will work with behavioral economists, engineers, AI researchers, and design specialists, to develop a multidisciplinary strategy to use AI to address India's problems. The AI model takes into account the 1,600 languages and scripts that make up the Indian knowledge system. Each institute of the consortium is investigating particular tasks to create models i
