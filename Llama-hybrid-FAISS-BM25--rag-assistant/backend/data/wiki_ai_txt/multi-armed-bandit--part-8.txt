ary environments. Another work by Burtini et al. introduces a weighted least squares Thompson sampling approach (WLS-TS), which proves beneficial in both the known and unknown non-stationary cases. Other variants Many variants of the problem have been proposed in recent years. Dueling bandit The dueling bandit variant was introduced by Yue et al. (2012) to model the exploration-versus-exploitation tradeoff for relative feedback. In this variant the gambler is allowed to pull two levers at the same time, but they only get a binary feedback telling which lever provided the best reward. The difficulty of this problem stems from the fact that the gambler has no way of directly observing the reward of their actions. The earliest algorithms for this problem were InterleaveFiltering and Beat-The-Mean. The relative feedback of dueling bandits can also lead to voting paradoxes. A solution is to take the Condorcet winner as a reference. More recently, researchers have generalized algorithms from traditional MAB to dueling bandits: Relative Upper Confidence Bounds (RUCB), Relative EXponential weighing (REX3), Copeland Confidence Bounds (CCB), Relative Minimum Empirical Divergence (RMED), and Double Thompson Sampling (DTS). Collaborative bandit Approaches using multiple bandits that cooperate sharing knowledge in order to better optimize their performance started in 2013 with "A Gang of Bandits", an algorithm relying on a similarity graph between the different bandit problems to share knowledge. The need of a similarity graph was removed in 2014 by the work on the CLUB algorithm. Following this work, several other researchers created algorithms to learn multiple models at the same time under bandit feedback. For example, COFIBA was introduced by Li and Karatzoglou and Gentile (SIGIR 2016), where the classical collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering methods try to learn a static recommendation model given training data. Combinatorial bandit The Combinatorial Multiarmed Bandit (CMAB) problem arises when instead of a single discrete variable to choose from, an agent needs to choose values for a set of variables. Assuming each variable is discrete, the number of possible choices per iteration is exponential in the number of variables. Several CMAB settings have been studied in the literature, from settings where the variables are binary to more general setting where each variable can take an arbitrary set of values.
