The ProVisual Engine is an AI-powered imaging system developed by Samsung Electronics for mobile devices. It was introduced in 2024 with the Galaxy S24 series as a component of Samsung's Galaxy AI ecosystem, providing advanced image processing to enhance image quality in photography and videography. Overview The ProVisual Engine processes images using adaptive scene recognition, real-time optimization, and advanced image processing. It adjusts color accuracy, dynamic range, and noise levels, providing both automated and manual controls to accommodate various user preferences. Features The ProVisual Engine encompasses several features. Quad Tele System The Quad Tele System features 2x, 3x, 5x, and 10x optical zoom, supported by digital processing to enhance zoom clarity and detail. It incorporates Image Signal Processing (ISP) to refine detail retention, reduce noise, and enhance image clarity at different zoom levels while minimizing distortion. Nightography Nightography utilizes noise reduction techniques and advanced sensor technology to enhance low-light photography. By adjusting exposure and minimizing motion blur, the system helps produce more precise and more detailed images in dark environments for both photos and videos. Generative Edit Generative Edit allows for object removal, background expansion, and intelligent resizing. It reconstructs missing areas by filling backgrounds and completing cut-off objects, adjusting composition while preserving image integrity and refinement. Expert RAW Expert RAW allows users to capture RAW images directly from the camera app for advanced shooting and editing. It includes HDR (High Dynamic Range) support to enhance detail and dynamic range. The ProVisual Engine utilizes multi-frame processing to generate RAW images with increased clarity and depth for post-processing. Enhance-X and Camera Shift Enhance-X is an AI-based image processing tool that applies upscaling, noise reduction, and sharpening. Its Camera Shift feature adjusts the perceived camera height by modifying framing and proportions. A recent update extended support to human and pet images.
