same convergence guarantees as in FedDyn with less local computation. Personalized federated learning by pruning (Sub-FedAvg) Federated learning methods have poor global performance under non-IID settings. This motivates clients to yield personalized models in federation. To change this, Vahidian et al. recently introduced the algorithm Sub-FedAvg which does hybrid pruning (structured and unstructured pruning) with averaging on the intersection of clients' drawn subnetworks. This simultaneously addresses communication efficiency, resource constraints and personalized models accuracies. Sub-FedAvg also extends the "lottery ticket hypothesis" of centrally trained neural networks to federated learning, with the research question: "Do winning tickets exist for clients' neural networks being trained in federated learning? If so, how to effectively draw the personalized subnetworks for each client?" Sub-FedAvg experimentally answers "yes" and proposes two algorithms to effectively draw the personalized subnetworks. Dynamic aggregation - inverse distance aggregation IDA (Inverse Distance Aggregation) is a novel adaptive weighting approach for federated learning nodes based on meta-information which handles unbalanced and non-iid data. It uses the distance of the model parameters as a strategy to minimize the effect of outliers and improve the model's convergence rate. Hybrid federated dual coordinate ascent (HyFDCA) Very few methods for hybrid federated learning, where clients only hold subsets of both features and samples, exist. Yet, this scenario is very important in practical settings. Hybrid Federated Dual Coordinate Ascent (HyFDCA) is a novel algorithm proposed in 2024 that solves convex problems in the hybrid FL setting. This algorithm extends CoCoA, a primal-dual distributed optimization algorithm introduced by Jaggi et al. (2014) and Smith et al. (2017), to the case where both samples and features are partitioned across clients. HyFDCA claims several improvement over existing algorithms: HyFDCA is a provably convergent primal-dual algorithm for hybrid FL in at least the following settings. Hybrid Federated Setting with Complete Client Participation Horizontal Federated Setting with Random Subsets of Available Clients The authors show HyFDCA enjoys a convergence rate of O(1⁄t) which matches the convergence rate of FedAvg (see below). Vertical Federated Setting with Incomplete Client Participation The authors show HyFDCA enjoys a convergence rate of O(log(t)⁄t) whereas FedBCD exhibits a slower O(1⁄sqrt(t)) convergence rate and requires full client participation. HyFDCA provides the privacy steps that ensure privacy of client data in the primal-dual setting. These principles apply to future efforts in developing primal-dual algorithms for FL. HyFDCA empirically outperforms HyFEM and FedAvg in loss function value and validation accuracy across a multitude of problem settings and datasets (see below for more details). The authors also introduce a hyperparameter selection framework for FL with competing metrics using ideas from multiobjective optimization. There is only one other algorithm that focuses on hybrid FL, HyFEM proposed by Zhang et al. (2020). This algorithm uses a feature matching formulation that balances clients building accurate local models and the server learning an accurate global model. This requires a matching regularizer constant that must be tuned based on user goals and results in disparate local and global models. Furthermore, the convergence results provided for HyFEM only prove convergence of the matching formulation not of the original global problem. This work is substantially different than HyFDCA's approach which uses data on local clients to build a global model that converges to the same solution as if the model was trained centrally. Furthermore, the local and global models are synchronized and do not require the adjustment of a matching parameter between local and global models. However, HyFEM is
