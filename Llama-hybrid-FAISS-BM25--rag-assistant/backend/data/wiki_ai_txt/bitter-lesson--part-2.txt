 Bitter Lesson: Empirical Evidence from 20 Years of CVPR Proceedings" looked at further evidence from the field of computer vision and pattern recognition, and concludes that the previous twenty years of experience in the field shows "a strong adherence to the core principles of the 'bitter lesson'". In "Overestimation, Overfitting, and Plasticity in Actor-Critic: the Bitter Lesson of Reinforcement Learning", the authors look at generalization of actor-critic algorithms and find that "general methods that are motivated by stabilization of gradient-based learning significantly outperform RL-specific algorithmic improvements across a variety of environments" and note that this is consistent with the bitter lesson. == References ==
