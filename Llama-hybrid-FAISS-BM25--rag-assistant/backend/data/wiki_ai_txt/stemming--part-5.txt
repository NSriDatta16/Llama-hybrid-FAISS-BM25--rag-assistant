mming is used to determine domain vocabularies in domain analysis. Use in commercial products Many commercial companies have been using stemming since at least the 1980s and have produced algorithmic and lexical stemmers in many languages. The Snowball stemmers have been compared with commercial lexical stemmers with varying results. Google Search adopted word stemming in 2003. Previously a search for "fish" would not have returned "fishing". Other software search algorithms vary in their use of word stemming. Programs that simply search for substrings will obviously find "fish" in "fishing" but when searching for "fishes" will not find occurrences of the word "fish". Text mining Stemming is used as a task in pre-processing texts before performing text mining analyses on it.
