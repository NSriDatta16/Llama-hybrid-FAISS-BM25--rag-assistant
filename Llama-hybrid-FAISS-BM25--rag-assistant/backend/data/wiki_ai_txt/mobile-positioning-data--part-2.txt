nymise the dataset) time attribute (date, hours, minutes and seconds) location (at the level of the cell tower that the mobile device was connected to). For domestic and inbound mobile positioning data, the geographical reference is the location and/or the coverage area of the network cell (initially the ID of the cell). For outbound mobile positioning data, the initial geographical reference is the country of the roaming partner MNO. Passive mobile positioning data can be divided into three categories from the perspective of a mobile network operator: domestic mobile positioning data – any mobile positioning record created within the network of a mobile network operator (MNO) resulting from the mobile device use of a subscriber of a home MNO. outbound mobile positioning data – any mobile positioning record created in a roaming network of a foreign MNO resulting from the mobile device use of a subscriber of a home MNO. inbound mobile positioning data – any mobile positioning record created within the network of a mobile network operator resulting from the mobile device use of a roaming subscriber of a foreign MNO. Use cases The digital footprint left by mobile device users is sensitive, but also highly valuable, as it provides new possibilities of measuring and monitoring the spatio-temporal activities of the population. This makes MPD a great data source for gathering statistics, as it can fill in the gaps where other data sources are lacking. Traditionally, people's location and mobility are studied via questionnaires, travel and time use surveys, censuses. This method, however, has many limitations. The sample of questionnaires is usually relatively small and although censuses cover the whole population and contain detailed information, they are not held frequently. Thus the data from questionnaires can be gathered only in some discrete moments in time. The collection of MPD, however, is continuous and can cover the majority of the population. Also, since passive mobile positioning data is collected continuously by mobile network operators, it offers the possibility of generating statistics on a very granular level. Furthermore, it allows producing near real-time statistics as well statistics on events that happened years ago. A number of research papers and use cases shows that mobile positioning data plays a very important role in various domains such as tourism, health, socio-economics, disaster response, urban management, etc. Authors indicate a plethora of fields that could benefit from the use of mobile positioning, such as urban and transportation planning, traffic flow monitoring, event planning (concerts, sports, festivals), safety and security (risk analyses based on the number of people at a specific location at a specific time), transportation origin-destination matrices, tourism and place marketing, epidemiology (geographic spreading of infectious diseases), and monitoring of hotspots (gathering places for tourists and residents). Much of this research is conducted on the basis of identifying meaningful locations, such as home and work anchor points, with the help of passive mobile positioning data. Some domain-specific examples of MPD use include the following: Tourism – MPD enables examining tourist flows and linking them with event attendance and location visits, helping many tourism associations to plan and manage their work and services more efficiently. Transportation – MPD can effectively be used for a data-driven approach to reorganising public transportation. For example, in Estonia, the city government of Tartu launched a bus route network which was designed by using mobile positioning data to understand user needs and travelling routes. Development – call detail records can be analysed with the aim of planning humanitarian development actions, such as emergency migration in Haiti, malaria mapping in Kenya, poverty level estimation in Côte d'Ivoire. Social good – MPD can be used to inform development
