The intrinsic dimension for a data set can be thought of as the minimal number of variables needed to represent the data set. Similarly, in signal processing of multidimensional signals, the intrinsic dimension of the signal describes how many variables are needed to generate a good approximation of the signal. When estimating intrinsic dimension, however, a slightly broader definition based on manifold dimension is often used, where a representation in the intrinsic dimension does only need to exist locally. Such intrinsic dimension estimation methods can thus handle data sets with different intrinsic dimensions in different parts of the data set. This is often referred to as local intrinsic dimensionality. The intrinsic dimension can be used as a lower bound of what dimension it is possible to compress a data set into through dimension reduction, but it can also be used as a measure of the complexity of the data set or signal. For a data set or signal of N variables, its intrinsic dimension M satisfies 0 ≤ M ≤ N, although estimators may yield higher values. Example Let f ( x 1 , x 2 ) {\textstyle f(x_{1},x_{2})} be a two-variable function (or signal) which is of the form f ( x 1 , x 2 ) = g ( x 1 ) {\textstyle f(x_{1},x_{2})=g(x_{1})} for some one-variable function g which is not constant. This means that f varies, in accordance to g, with the first variable or along the first coordinate. On the other hand, f is constant with respect to the second variable or along the second coordinate. It is only necessary to know the value of one, namely the first, variable in order to determine the value of f. Hence, it is a two-variable function but its intrinsic dimension is one. A slightly more complicated example is f ( x 1 , x 2 ) = g ( x 1 + x 2 ) {\textstyle f(x_{1},x_{2})=g(x_{1}+x_{2})} . f is still intrinsic one-dimensional, which can be seen by making a variable transformation y 1 = x 1 + x 2 {\textstyle y_{1}=x_{1}+x_{2}} and y 2 = x 1 − x 2 {\textstyle y_{2}=x_{1}-x_{2}} which gives f ( y 1 + y 2 2 , y 1 − y 2 2 ) = g ( y 1 ) {\textstyle f\left({\frac {y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}},{\frac {y_{1}-y_{2}}{2}}\right)=g\left(y_{1}\right)} . Since the variation in f can be described by the single variable y1 its intrinsic dimension is one. For the case that f is constant, its intrinsic dimension is zero since no variable is needed to describe variation. For the general case, when the intrinsic dimension of the two-variable function f is neither zero or one, it is two. In the literature, functions which are of intrinsic dimension zero, one, or two are sometimes referred to as i0D, i1D or i2D, respectively. Formal definition for signals For an N-variable function f, the set of variables can be represented as an N-dimensional vector x: f = f ( x ) where x = ( x 1 , … , x N ) {\textstyle f=f\left(\mathbf {x} \right){\text{ where }}\mathbf {x} =\left(x_{1},\dots ,x_{N}\right)} . If for some M-variable function g and M × N matrix A it is the case that for all x; f ( x ) = g ( A x ) , {\textstyle f(\mathbf {x} )=g(\mathbf {Ax} ),} M is the smallest number for which the above relation between f and g can be found, then the intrinsic dimension of f is M. The intrinsic dimension is a characterization of f, it is not an unambiguous characterization of g nor of A. That is, if the above relation is satisfied for some f, g, and A, it must also be satisfied for the same f and g′ and A′ given by g ′ ( y ) = g ( B y ) {\textstyle g'\left(\mathbf {y} \right)=g\left(\mathbf {By} \right)} and A ′ = B − 1 A {\textstyle \mathbf {A'} =\mathbf {B} ^{-1}\mathbf {A} } where B is a non-singular M × M matrix, since f ( x ) = g ′ ( A ′ x ) = g ( B A ′ x ) = g ( A x ) {\textstyle f\left(\mathbf {x} \right)=g'\left(\mathbf {A'x} \right)=g\left(\mathbf {BA'x} \right)=g\left(\mathbf {Ax} \right)} . The Fourier transform of signals of low intrinsic dimension An N variable function which has intrinsic dimension M < N has a characteristic Fourier transform. Intuitively, since th
