Linagora then claimed the position of the leading French open source software company by revenue. In 2015, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls allocated €10.7 million from the "Investments for the Future" fund for a research program aimed at developing a new generation of open source software platforms based on Linagora's offerings. In September 2016, Linagora launched the social network "La Cerise" for the newspaper L'Humanité. This app aimed to be a "sounding board for the newspaper's ideas" by offering a service and tool for readers and citizens mobilizing for causes. It aimed to share engagement through petitions, discussions, agendas, and contacts. In October 2016, the company won two public contracts for supporting open source software in forty-two French ministries and other administrative entities.

In February 2024, the CNRS and Linagora signed a framework agreement to strengthen their research collaboration. In January 2025, Linagora released Lucie, an open source and sovereign AI that faced ridicule due to tests on an unfinished, uncensored version designed for scientific and experimental use. The platform divided opinions between those who saw it as a technological achievement and those who criticized it as "French bashing" compared to American and Chinese AIs.
