e Music Perfect Collection, was released as a double album in Japan on April 23, 2003. It features 68 compositions by Chikayo Fukuda, Seizo Nakata, and Norikatsu Fukuda. A special edition of this soundtrack includes a third disc featuring sound effects and clips used in the games. The album was released with fewer tracks in North America as .hack//Game Music Best Collection. Patrick Gann of RPGFan wrote that the second disc, which contains music for cutscenes and special events, was stronger than the first disc's generic town and battle themes. He called the soundtrack "techno meets opera", singled out the volume intro tracks for particular praise. Gann noted that the North American release functions as a "Best of" album, but felt that "a lot of solid music [is] missing" in this release. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic; Paul Koehler of RPGamer called the music "particularly bland" and IGN's Dunham lamented that the second installment did not introduce many new pieces. However, he concluded that "the melodious piano and oboe themes were still brawny enough to convince us that we needed to buy the soundtrack sometime in the near future". .hack//Game Music Perfect Collection .hack//Game Music Best Collection .hack//fr채gment .hack//fr채gment is a multiplayer online game based on the fictional MMORPG, The World. It was released only in Japan on November 23, 2005 and online service ended on January 18, 2007, after being extended two months because of its popularity. Famitsu Weekly gave .hack//fr채gment a cumulative score of 29 out of 40 over four reviews, much like its reviews of the main series. The game was never released outside of Japan because it was only intended for a Japanese audience. The game uses a modified version of the engine used in the .hack video game series and thus its gameplay differs from those games in a few ways. Players explore areas and fight monsters in real time but the game does not pause when the menu is opened. Due to this change it is now possible to assign items, messages and skills to hotkeys like in many other online games. Players may still use the skill "Data Drain" to weaken monsters and collect rare items. The user interface and control scheme are otherwise mostly unchanged. Players may create their characters based on a number of preset body shapes and color schemes and may choose a class (such as Wavemaster or Twin Blade), character name and bonus stat points. In online mode, players may enter a lobby and search for a maximum of two other players to join them on an adventure. The game includes an expanded communication interface that allows players to chat, send e-mail, post to an in-game Bulletin Board System, and receive server news updates. It is possible to establish ad hoc chat rooms separate from the public-access ones. Guilds are permanent, exclusive chat rooms for members, and can also be used to set up a storefront to sell items to online players. In offline mode, players may use the same character that they use for online mode, and any skills, items and levels they gain will carry over into online mode. Players may invite or create characters from the .hack games, .hack//Sign, and .hack//Legend of the Twilight into their party. The "story mode" of .hack//fr채gment is similar to that of the .hack games, though it does not feature any of the antagonists from the original games, and the scenario is an entirely non-canon what-if story. Players may also install a companion program on their PC called "Area Server", which allows them to create fields and dungeons for players to visit online. As players clear fields and dungeons on a user's Area Server, the Area Server gains experience points and levels. Once the server reaches a certain level, it is possible for custom areas to become "corrupted", much like in the events of the .hack games. Players can visit a corrupted area by breaking into it with virus cores obtained from using the Data Drain skill on enemies, and can defeat a data b
