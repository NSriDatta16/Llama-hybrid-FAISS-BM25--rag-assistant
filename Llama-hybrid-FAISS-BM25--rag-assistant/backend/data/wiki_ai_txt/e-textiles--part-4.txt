tovoltaic devices made from carbon-based semiconducting materials, designed to be flexible and lightweight. When applied to textile fibers, they allow fabrics to harvest solar energy, potentially powering wearable electronics. Healthcare Vital Sign Monitoring E-textiles can be used to monitor vital signs through integrated electronics. Sensors embedded in fabrics can track parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. The integration of sensors allows patients to wear non-invasive garments that provide real-time data to healthcare providers, enabling earlier detection of health issues and remote patient monitoring. Sensor technologies such as conductive yarns and printed electronics have been adapted for flexible and washable fabrics suitable for daily use. Chronic Disease Management E-textiles are used in the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. These e-textiles assist in monitoring biomarkers like glucose, lactate, and cortisol by analyzing the wearer's sweat through integrated sensors. Monitoring biomarkers through e-textiles has been reported as a less invasive alternative to blood tests. Sweat contains biochemical information that reflects metabolic and stress-related changes in the body, which can serve as a medium for continuous health assessment. Assistive Technologies E-textiles are used in assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. These textiles can incorporate sensors, actuators, and communication modules to help address challenges related to mobility, perception, and communication. For example, e-textiles equipped with motion and muscle sensors can assist in physical rehabilitation by tracking limb movement and providing feedback during stroke recovery. Similarly, tactile and auditory e-textile systems can be used to support people with visual impairments by translating Braille into speech. Integrating these functions into clothing can reduce bulk and weight compared to external equipment and allows continuous support during daily activities. Sports In sports, e-textiles can be used to monitor player performance and physical metrics. By embedding sensors within uniforms and equipment, these textiles can measure physiological data such as heart rate, muscle activity, energy expenditure, and distance covered. The collected information can be used to analyze performance, track workload, and detect fatigue or potential injury. Unlike traditional wearable devices, e-textiles integrate sensors directly into garments and equipment. This integration allows continuous, real-time monitoring during activity without restricting movement. Military E-textiles are used in military applications to track the health, vital signs, and location of soldiers, providing real-time information that can be used for operational safety and decision-making in the field. The data collected by these textiles can be used to monitor the physical and mental states of soldiers. Some e-textiles also integrate environmental sensors, allowing soldiers to receive alerts about exposure to hazardous conditions such as extreme heat or toxic chemicals.
