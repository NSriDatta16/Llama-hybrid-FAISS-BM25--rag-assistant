r them a curious drink they claim will have similar effects to beer. The trio sit back and enjoy the drink as the aliens recreate the look, sound, and smell of Old Man's Point. Finally, Cheemo utters the only line of spoken dialogue by the three men when he observes, “We should have done this years ago.” Themes Take Us to Your Chief draws on a variety of classic fiction tropes and themes to comment on contemporary life among Indigenous peoples in Canada. These tropes include political conspiracies; the first contact between societies and peoples; alien invasion; time and space travel; superhuman powers and abilities; and anthropomorphism. In general, the stories draw parallels to science fiction and world history, such as alien contact paralleling the first contact and later colonization by Europeans of the Americas. In addition to the science fiction tropes, these stories also examine social issues faced by Indigenous peoples. These include the rediscovery of cultural heritage; the geographic and social isolation of aboriginal people on reserves; suicide rates, especially among Native youth; depression; housing and water crises; environmental destruction; the violence of cultural assimilation; the heritage of the residential school system; and alcoholism. Reception It is the general consensus that Take Us to Your Chief is a successful cross-genre collection that blends First Nations and science-fiction literature. The majority of critical responses agree that while the science fiction aspect of the stories is entertaining and arouses the readers’ imagination, the character-driven plots are meaningful contributions about the First Nations people and their struggles. Alex Good from The Star deems the book an entertaining collection of "mash-ups" whose "tone is mostly comic, playing off of incongruities." Robert J. Wiersema states in his review that “Taylor’s ability to inject humour into even a post-apocalyptic setting is admirable,” and he notes the contrast between humor with the dark messages of the stories allows readers to appreciate the messages and get through the collection without being turned away, although some of the stories do "lack subtlety." Some reviewers of this compilation have criticized its clichéd use of Golden Age science fiction tropes as well as its use of humor. Publishers Weekly states that “the collection is probably too retro to appeal to serious fans of speculative fiction." In Ira Nayman's review published in Amazing Stories magazine, he writes about how “the tropes are well worn at this point in science fiction’s evolution,” though he notes that Taylor reinvigorates these tropes and that the chief strength of the collection is to make non-Native readers uncomfortable. Tor.com’s Aidan Moher believes that “what Take Us to Your Chief lacks in originality, it makes up for in perspective.” Nora Dector from the Malahat Review argues that “science fiction, even when it is playing out the end of the world, is still intended to entertain, and Taylor leads with that, letting the seriousness of his themes arise unexpectedly.” Awards and nominations Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humor (2017, nominated) == References ==
