oint m {\displaystyle m} . There is a set of values of multidimensional space points of M {\displaystyle M} : C M = { c i 1 , i 2 , … , i N ∣ i 1 = 1 , … , I 1 , i 2 = 1 , … , I 2 , … , i n = 1 , … , I N } , {\displaystyle C_{M}=\{c_{i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{N}}\mid i_{1}=1,\ldots ,I_{1},i_{2}=1,\ldots ,I_{2},\ldots ,i_{n}=1,\ldots ,I_{N}\},} where: c i 1 , i 2 , … , i N {\displaystyle c_{i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{N}}} is a value of the point of multidimensional space M {\displaystyle M} is a value of the point of multidimensional space ( i 1 , i 2 , … , i N ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{N})} . For every point of space M {\displaystyle M} there is a single value from C M {\displaystyle C_{M}} set or there is no such value. Thus, C M {\displaystyle C_{M}} is a set of data model state changes represented in multidimensional space. To implement a transition between multidimensional space and set of points values the relation μ {\displaystyle \mu } has been introduced: C x = μ ( M x ) , {\displaystyle C_{x}=\mu (M_{x}),} where: M x ⊆ M ; {\displaystyle M_{x}\subseteq M;} M x = F 1 x × F 2 x × ⋯ × F N x . {\displaystyle M_{x}=F_{1x}\times F_{2x}\times \cdots \times F_{Nx}.} To describe a data model in mivar information space it is necessary to identify three axes: The axis of relations « O {\displaystyle O} »; The axis of attributes (properties) « S {\displaystyle S} »; The axis of elements (objects) of subject domain « V {\displaystyle V} ». These sets are independent. The mivar space can be represented by the following tuple: ⟨ V , S , O ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle V,S,O\rangle } Thus, mivar is described by « V S O {\displaystyle VSO} » formula, in which « V {\displaystyle V} » denotes an object or a thing, « S {\displaystyle S} » denotes properties, « O {\displaystyle O} » variety of relations between other objects of a particular subject domain. The category “Relations” can describe dependencies of any complexity level: formulae, logical transitions, text expressions, functions, services, computational procedures and even neural networks. A wide range of capabilities complicates description of modeling interconnections, but can take into consideration all the factors. Mivar computations use mathematical logic. In a simplified form they can be represented as implication in the form of an "if…, then …” formula. The result of mivar modeling can be represented in the form of a bipartite graph binding two sets of objects: source objects and resultant objects. Mivar network Mivar network is a method for representing objects of the subject domain and their processing rules in the form of a bipartite directed graph consisting of objects and rules. A Mivar network is a bipartite graph that can be described in the form of a two-dimensional matrix, in that records information about the subject domain of the current task. Generally, mivar networks provide formalization and representation of human knowledge in the form of a connected multidimensional space. That is, a mivar network is a method of representing a piece of mivar space information in the form of a bipartite, directed graph. The mivar space information is formed by objects and connections, which in total represent the data model of the subject domain. Connections include rules for objects processing. Thus, a mivar network of a subject domain is a part of the mivar space knowledge for that domain. The graph can consist of objects-variables and rules-procedures. First, two lists are made that form two nonintersecting partitions: the list of objects and the list of rules. Objects are denoted by circles. Each rule in a mivar network is an extension of productions, hyper-rules with multi-activators or computational procedures. It is proved that from the perspective of further processing, these formalisms are identical and in fact are nodes of the bipartite graph, denoted by rectangles. Multi-dimensional binary matrices Mivar networks can be implemented on single computing systems
