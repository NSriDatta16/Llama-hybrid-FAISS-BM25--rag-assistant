c as algebra or geometry. Hobbes famously wrote in Leviathan: "For reason ... is nothing but reckoning, that is adding and subtracting". Leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning, the characteristica universalis, which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that "there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in hand, down to their slates, and to say each other (with a friend as witness, if they liked): Let us calculate." These philosophers had begun to articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would guide AI research. The study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible. The foundations had been set by such works as Boole's The Laws of Thought and Frege's Begriffsschrift. Building on Frege's system, Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece, the Principia Mathematica in 1913. Inspired by Russell's success, David Hilbert challenged mathematicians of the 1920s and 30s to answer this fundamental question: "can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized?" His question was answered by Gödel's incompleteness proof, Turing's machine and Church's Lambda calculus. Their answer was surprising in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction. The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines. Neuroscience In the 18th and 19th century Luigi Galvani, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Hermann von Helmholtz and others demonstrated that the nerves carried electrical signals and Robert Bentley Todd correctly speculated in 1828 that the brain was an electrical network. Camillo Golgi's staining techniques enabled Santiago Ramón y Cajal to provide evidence for the neuron theory: "The truly amazing conclusion is that a collection of simple cells can lead to thought, action, and consciousness". Donald Hebb was a Canadian psychologist whose work laid the foundation for modern neuroscience, particularly in understanding learning, memory, and neural plasticity. His most influential book, The Organization of Behavior (1949), introduced the concept of Hebbian learning, often summarized as "cells that fire together wire together." Hebb began formulating the foundational ideas for this book in the early 1940s, particularly during his time at the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology from 1942 to 1947. He made extensive notes between June 1944 and March 1945 and sent a complete draft to his mentor Karl Lashley in 1946. The manuscript for The Organization of Behavior wasn't published until 1949. The delay was due to various factors, including World War II and shifts in academic focus. By the time it was published, several of his peers had already published related ideas, making Hebb's work seem less groundbreaking at first glance. However, his synthesis of psychological and neurophysiological principles became a cornerstone of neuroscience and machine learning. Computer science Calculating machines were designed or built in antiquity and throughout history by many people, including Gottfried Leibniz, Joseph Marie Jacquard, Charles Babbage, Percy Ludgate, Leonardo Torres Quevedo, Vannevar Bush, and others. Ada Lovelace speculated that Babbage's machine was "a thinking or ... reasoning machine", but warned "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas
