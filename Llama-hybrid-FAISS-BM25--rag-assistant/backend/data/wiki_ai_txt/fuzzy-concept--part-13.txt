els to help understanding an issue. A concept can be clear enough, but not (or not sufficiently) precise. Terminology scientists at the German National Standards Institute (Deutsches Institut für Normung) provided the first official standard definition of what a concept is (in the terminology standard DIN 2330 of 1957, revised in 1974 and last revised in 2022). According to DIN 2330, a concept is "a unit of thought formed by abstraction from a set of objects by identifying their common characteristics". According to the ISO 1087 terminology standard of the International Organization for Standardization, a concept is defined as “a unit of knowledge created by a unique combination of characteristics”. A concept is regarded as language-independent, and exists independently of how exactly it is symbolized or referred to in natural language. Individual concepts refer to a single object or instance. General concepts refer to a class of objects with shared characteristics. The ISO 704 standard adds that a concept as a unit of thought comprises two parts: its extent and its intent. The extent comprises all objects belonging to the concept, and the intent comprises all attributes shared by those objects. Different standard definitions and terminologies for concepts exist for various systems in cyberspace. The official terminological standards are useful for many practical purposes. But for more complex concepts, the standards may not be so helpful. The reason is that complex concepts do not necessarily denote only a collection of objects which have something in common. A complex concept may for example express a Gestalt, i.e. it may express a totality which is more, does more and means more, than the sum of its parts (as recognized in Aristotle's Metaphysics). It may be that the parts cannot exist other than within the totality. The totality could also be a "totality of totalities". In such cases, the definition of the complex concept is not (or not fully) reducible to what its parts have in common. Modelling such a concept requires more than identifying and enumerating the parts that are included in (and excluded from) the concept. It requires also a specification of what all the parts together "add up to", or what they constitute collectively. In some respects at least, the totality differs qualitatively from any of its parts. The Gestalt could be a fuzzy object, figure or shape. Potential corruption Reasoning with fuzzy concepts is often viewed as a kind of "logical corruption" or scientific perversion because, it is claimed, fuzzy reasoning rarely reaches a definite "yes" or a definite "no". A clear, precise and logically rigorous conceptualization is no longer a necessary prerequisite, for carrying out a procedure, a project, or an inquiry, since "somewhat vague ideas" can always be accommodated, formalized and programmed with the aid of fuzzy expressions. The purist idea is, that either a rule applies, or it does not apply. When a rule is said to apply only "to some extent", then in truth the rule does not apply. Thus, a compromise with vagueness or indefiniteness is, on this view, effectively a compromise with error — an error of conceptualization, an error in the inferential system, or an error in physically carrying out a task. Kahan's criticism The computer scientist William Kahan argued in 1975 that "the danger of fuzzy theory is that it will encourage the sort of imprecise thinking that has brought us so much trouble." He said subsequently, "With traditional logic there is no guaranteed way to find that something is contradictory, but once it is found, you'd be obliged to do something. But with fuzzy sets, the existence of contradictory sets can't cause things to malfunction. Contradictory information doesn't lead to a clash. You just keep computing. (...) Life affords many instances of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons... It is in the nature of logic to confirm or deny. The fuzzy calculus blurs that. (...) Log
