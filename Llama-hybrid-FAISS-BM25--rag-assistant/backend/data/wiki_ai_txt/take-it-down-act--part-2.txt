he 119th Congress, Cruz re-introduced the bill, now with 20 co-sponsors, and it passed unanimously in February 2025. In the House, the bill was introduced by Representative María Elvira Salazar and passed the House's Committee on Energy and Commerce in early April 2025. It passed the full House on a 409–2 vote on April 28, 2025. President Donald Trump had expressed support for the bill following his election to his second term. First Lady Melania Trump also built support for the bill, as it followed on her "Be Best" anti-cyberbullying advocacy that she had led during Trump's first term. Trump signed the bill into law on May 19, 2025, and invited Melania to also sign it. Criticism The TAKE IT DOWN Act has drawn concerns from First Amendment-related groups such as the Center for Democracy & Technology, the Authors Guild, Demand Progress Action, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Fight for the Future, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, New America's Open Technology Institute, Public Knowledge, and TechFreedom. These groups did not take issue with fighting NCII, but cite concerns with the vagueness of the law's language, in that while the bill is written to target NCII, other legal content is not specifically exempted from the takedown enforcement. This could extend to non-public content stored on servers, such as the content of direct messages, and may require providers to break end-to-end encryption to be able to respond to takedown notices. The notice and takedown system was also said to be subject to potential abuse by bad-faith actors to misrepresent themselves and take down legal content, as had been seen with the enforcement of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While the DMCA has a mechanism for challenging takedown notices, the TAKE IT DOWN Act says takedown requestors should be acting in "good faith". The EFF also said that president Donald Trump has supported the bill but also that he would use it to his own ends to remove content critical of himself. This concern was coupled with the firing of the two Democratic commissioners on the FTC by Trump during the first months of his second term; the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, supportive of the intent of the bill, said "Platforms that feel confident that they are unlikely to be targeted by the FTC (for example, platforms that are closely aligned with the current administration) may feel emboldened to simply ignore reports of NCII. Platforms attempting to identify authentic complaints may encounter a sea of false reports that could overwhelm their efforts and jeopardize their ability to operate at all." Related legislation Senator Klobuchar had introduced, beginning in 2022, the Stopping Harmful Image Exploitation and Limiting Distribution (SHIELD Act), which would bolster law enforcement tools to investigate and charge those that publish NCII with harsher penalties for NCII related to minors. The bill had passed through the Senate in 2024, but failed to pass through the House, but Klobuchar since reintroduced the bill in the Senate in February 2025. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has introduced the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (DEFIANCE) Act, which would provide victims of NCII the ability to seek civil damages from those that created the images. The bill has had bipartisan support in both houses, and while it had cleared the Senate in 2024, failed to pass the House. Ocasio-Cortez reintroduced the bill after the passage of TAKE IT DOWN in May 2025.
