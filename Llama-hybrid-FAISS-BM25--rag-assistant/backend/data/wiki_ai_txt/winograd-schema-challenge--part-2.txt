iversity, has compiled a list of over 140 Winograd schemas from various sources as examples of the kinds of questions that should appear on the Winograd schema challenge. Formal description A Winograd schema challenge question consists of three parts: A sentence or brief discourse that contains the following: Two noun phrases of the same semantic class (male, female, inanimate, or group of objects or people), An ambiguous pronoun that may refer to either of the above noun phrases, and A special word and alternate word, such that if the special word is replaced with the alternate word, the natural resolution of the pronoun changes. A question asking the identity of the ambiguous pronoun, and Two answer choices corresponding to the noun phrases in question. A machine will be given the problem in a standardized form which includes the answer choices, thus making it a binary decision problem. Advantages The Winograd schema challenge has the following purported advantages: Knowledge and commonsense reasoning are required to solve them. Winograd schemas of varying difficulty may be designed, involving anything from simple cause-and-effect relationships to complex narratives of events. They may be constructed to test reasoning ability in specific domains (e.g., social/psychological or spatial reasoning). There is no need for human judges. Pitfalls One difficulty with the Winograd schema challenge is the development of the questions. They need to be carefully tailored to ensure that they require commonsense reasoning to solve. For example, Levesque gives the following example of a so-called Winograd schema that is "too easy": The answer to this question can be determined on the basis of selectional restrictions: in any situation, pills do not get pregnant, women do; women cannot be carcinogenic, but pills can. Thus this answer could be derived without the use of reasoning, or any understanding of the sentences' meaning—all that is necessary is data on the selectional restrictions of pregnant and carcinogenic. Activity In 2016 and 2018, Nuance Communications sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $25,000 for the top scorer above 90% (for comparison, humans correctly answer to 92–96% of WSC questions). However, nobody came close to winning the prize in 2016 and the 2018 competition was cancelled for lack of prospects; the prize is no longer offered. The Twelfth International Symposium on the Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning was held on March 23–25, 2015 at the AAAI Spring Symposium Series at Stanford University, with a special focus on the Winograd schema challenge. The organizing committee included Leora Morgenstern (Leidos), Theodore Patkos (The Foundation for Research & Technology Hellas), and Robert Sloan (University of Illinois at Chicago). The 2016 Winograd Schema Challenge was run on July 11, 2016 at IJCAI-16. There were four contestants. The first round of the contest was to solve PDPs—pronoun disambiguation problems, adapted from literary sources, not constructed as pairs of sentences. The highest score achieved was 58% correct, by Quan Liu et al, of the University of Science and Technology, China. Hence, by the rules of that challenge, no prizes were awarded, and the challenge did not proceed to the second round. The organizing committee in 2016 was Leora Morgenstern, Ernest Davis, and Charles Ortiz. In 2017, a neural association model designed for commonsense knowledge acquisition achieved 70% accuracy on 70 manually selected problems from the original 273 Winograd schema dataset. In June 2018, a score of 63.7% accuracy was achieved on the full dataset using an ensemble of recurrent neural network language models, marking the first use of deep neural networks that learn from independent corpora to acquire common sense knowledge. In 2019 a score of 90.1%, was achieved on the original Winograd schema dataset by fine-tuning of the BERT language model with appropriate WSC-like training data to avoid hav
