d that no Black people were directly involved in the creation of FN Meka, with one of his known creators being white and the other Asian; this was deemed problematic due to Meka's use of the N-word in several of its songs, including "Florida Water". Since then, Martini has claimed that the anonymous human who voiced FN Meka was black and that the team behind Meka was "one of the most diverse teams you can get." The campaign group Industry Blackout demanded that FN Meka be dropped from the label and a public apology from Capitol, describing in a statement the caricature, stereotyping and cultural appropriation of Black artists that they saw FN Meka represented. On August 23, 2022, Capitol Music Group (CMG) released an apology statement announcing it had dropped FN Meka "with immediate effect" and said that it had signed FN Meka "without asking enough questions about equity and the creative process behind it." As a result of him being dropped, "Florida Water" was also removed from streaming services. A day after, rapper Kyle the Hooligan claimed on Instagram that he was the original voice of FN Meka. He alleged that Factory New "ghosted" him around 2021 after FN Meka grew in popularity and failed to fulfill any of the commitments they had promised him. He has also stated he does not know who is the vocalist on "Florida Water". When Billboard requested to speak with Black creatives involved in the project, Martini claimed that they wished to remain anonymous. After the backlash, Martini left the project and said that the project's treatment of Kyle was "deeply at odds with his core values." Kyle the Hooligan announced on August 28, 2022, that he intends to sue Brandon Le and Factory New.
