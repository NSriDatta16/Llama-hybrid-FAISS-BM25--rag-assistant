Other characters Eve (イヴ, Ivu) Voiced by: Inori Minase (Japanese); Erika Harlacher (English) A mysterious blonde girl who befriended Hiroto a few years prior to events of Gundam Build Divers; this friendship between the two soon escalated into romance. Since her disappearance, Hiroto has been searching for her throughout the game. It is later revealed that she is the first to exist of the 87 EL-Divers and Sarah's older sister, although through the few years she spent together with Hiroto and those close to him she kept her EL-Diver identity a secret, and she was seemingly affiliated with Avalon. She had many personality traits and abilities that Sarah has and more, most notably having empathic senses for people and gunpla. Her existence also caused glitch bugs in the game, but small ones that were not that harmful. However, a few years later, she could no longer contain Sarah's bugs due to the backlash from the Break-Decal incident. Before the events of the battle between the original Build Divers and the second Coalition of Volunteers, she pleaded with Hiroto to mercifully sacrifice her using the Core Gundam and promise to her that he will still be the same caring person to help others in need, especially her sister, also mentioning that she would only pass on into GBN's Sea of Data. Despite his plead to stop her, she ended up a sacrifice right before Hiroto's eyes and her form faded out of existence. This incident traumatized Hiroto greatly, leaving him with permanent emotional open wounds. He felt that clinging to Sarah for the rest of his life would help him move on to the point that led him to blame Riku and the Build Divers before ultimately sparing him in order to save Sarah's life and leaving Avalon to become a rouge diver, but kept a vow to never blame Sarah. In the final episode, May, another EL-Diver whom Hiroto teamed up with, is revealed to be born with some lingering remnants of her lost data, sporting her earring on her armband, which she wore under her jacket the whole time. Hiroto finally has closure but continues to view her has all the Build Divers' true Goddess of Victory, with Hinata as her priestess.
