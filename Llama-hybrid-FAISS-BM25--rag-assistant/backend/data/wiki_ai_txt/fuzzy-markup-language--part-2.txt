zySystem> which represents the fuzzy controller under modeling. This tag has two attributes: name and ip. The first attribute permits to specify the name of fuzzy controller and ip is used to define the location of controller in a computer network. The fuzzy knowledge base is defined by means of the tag <KnowledgeBase> which maintains the set of fuzzy concepts used to model the fuzzy rule base. In order to define the fuzzy concept related controlled system, <KnowledgeBase> tag uses a set of nested tags: <FuzzyVariable> defines the fuzzy concept; <FuzzyTerm> defines a linguistic term describing the fuzzy concept; a set of tags defining a shape of fuzzy sets are related to fuzzy terms. The attributes of <FuzzyVariable> tag are: name, scale, domainLeft, domainRight, type and, for only an output, accumulation, defuzzifier and defaultValue. The name attribute defines the name of fuzzy concept, for instance, temperature; scale is used to define the scale used to measure the fuzzy concept, for instance, Celsius degree; domainLeft and domainRight are used to model the universe of discourse of fuzzy concept, that is, the set of real values related to fuzzy concept, for instance [0°,40°] in the case of Celsius degree; the position of fuzzy concept into rule (consequent part or antecedent part) is defined by type attribute (input/output); accumulation attribute defines the method of accumulation that is a method that permits the combination of results of a variable of each rule in a final result; defuzzifier attribute defines the method used to execute the conversion from a fuzzy set, obtained after aggregation process, into a numerical value to give it in output to system; defaultValue attribute defines a real value used only when no rule has fired for the variable at issue. As for tag <FuzzyTerm>, it uses two attributes: name used to identify the linguistic value associate with fuzzy concept and complement, a boolean attribute that defines, if it is true, it is necessary to consider the complement of membership function defined by given parameters. Fuzzy shape tags, used to complete the definition of fuzzy concept, are: <TRIANGULARSHAPE> <RIGHTLINEARSHAPE> <LEFTLINEARSHAPE> <PISHAPE> <GAUSSIANSHAPE> <RIGHTGAUSSIANSHAPE> <LEFTGAUSSIANSHAPE> <TRAPEZOIDSHAPE> <SSHAPE> <ZSHAPE> <RECTANGULARSHAPE> <SINGLETONSHAPE> Every shaping tag uses a set of attributes which defines the real outline of corresponding fuzzy set. The number of these attributes depends on the chosen fuzzy set shape. In order to make an example, consider the Tipper Inference System described in Mathworks Matlab Fuzzy Logic Toolbox Tutorial. This Mamdani system is used to regulate the tipping in, for example, a restaurant. It has got two variables in input (food and service) and one in output (tip). FML code for modeling part of knowledge base of this fuzzy system containing variables food and tip is shown below. A special tag that can furthermore be used to define a fuzzy shape is <UserShape>. This tag is used to customize fuzzy shape (custom shape). The custom shape modeling is performed via a set of <Point> tags that lists the extreme points of geometric area defining the custom fuzzy shape. Obviously, the attributes used in <Point> tag are x and y coordinates. As for rule base component, FML allows to define a set of rule bases, each one of them describes a different behavior of system. The root of each rule base is modeled by <RuleBase> tag which defines a fuzzy rule set. The <RuleBase> tag uses five attributes: name, type, activationMethod, andMethod and orMethod. Obviously, the name attribute uniquely identifies the rule base. The type attribute permits to specify the kind of fuzzy controller (Mamdani or TSK) respect to the rule base at issue. The activationMethod attribute defines the method used to implication process; the andMethod and orMethod attribute define, respectively, the and and or algorithm to use by default. In order to define the single rule the <Rule> t
