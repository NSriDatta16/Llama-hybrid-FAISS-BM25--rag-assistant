Valhalla, to which it served as a prequel. Period three In 2022, Ubisoft announced several additional games for the series, including Assassin's Creed Shadows, set in Japan during the Sengoku period, and Assassin's Creed: Codename Hexe, rumoured to be set in Central Europe during the 16th century. Alongside the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows, Ubisoft introduced the Animus Hub, intended to serve as a centralized hub for the Assassin's Creed games from Shadows onward. Originally teased as Assassin's Creed Infinity, the Animus Hub was described by its executive producer, Marc-Alexis Côté, as a "new design philosophy" for the series, as well as a hub that would provide the releases of future games. According to Côté in 2024, the modern-day narrative of the series had become haphazard after the death of Desmond Miles in Assassin's Creed III through the introduction of Layla Hassan in Assassin's Creed Origins due to the lack of a main character and the number of studios involved, and Infinity aimed to re-establish the modern-day side of the series. The Animus Hub is not a launcher, but instead a feature integrated into Shadows, future games, and select games from period two, which incorporates the modern-day storyline of the series. As part of Ubisoft's financial troubles in the early 2020s, Ubisoft and Tencent created a separate subsidiary, Vantage Studios, in 2025 for handling of Assassin's Creed and the other major Ubisoft franchises, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. As part of this, Côté left Ubisoft in October 2025, which he claimed was due to the series lead being transferred from him to a new position within Vantage Studios. Gameplay The Assassin's Creed games are centered around one or more fictional members of the Order of the Assassins. Their memories are experienced by an in-game character in the modern-day period through a device called the Animus and its derivations. The Animus allows the user to explore these memories passed down via genetics. Within the context of the game, this provides a diegetic interface to the real-world player of the game, showing them elements like health bars, a mini-map, and target objectives as if presented by the Animus. Additionally, should the player cause the historical character to die or fail a mission, this is rectified as desynchronization of the genetic memory, allowing the player to try the mission again. Through the Animus interface, the player can retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner, such as by only killing the mission's target. The Animus also imparts special abilities to the modern-day character that helps them to see their target in a crowd or other unique points of interest. While playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a third-person view in an open world environment, focusing on stealth and parkour. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a leap of faith into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of the modern-day character who, by nature of the Animus use, has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe, and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. The games use the concept of active versus passive moves, with active moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping bet
