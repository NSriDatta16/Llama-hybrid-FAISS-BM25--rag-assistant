 different decisions?' That made it for us a much more fun puzzle." Regarding the season finale and setting up the next season, Bell said that "Each year we've tried to reinvent the series in some way ... I think the end [of the finale] really does suggest something quite different." Casting Main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge and Henry Simmons return from previous seasons as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, and Alphonso "Mack" Mackenzie, respectively. They are joined by John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe, promoted from his third season recurring role. Within the Framework reality, Daisy is referred to by her original name, Skye, while Fitz is also known as "The Doctor". Also returning from earlier in the series are Natalia Cordova-Buckley as Elena "Yo-Yo" Rodriguez, Axle Whitehead as J. T. James / Hellfire, Adrian Pasdar as Glenn Talbot, Ava Acres as Katya Belyakov, Patton Oswalt as Billy, Sam and Thurston Koenig, and Briana Venskus, Maximilian Osinski, and Alexander Wraith as Agents Piper, Davis, and Anderson, respectively. Agents of Hydra also sees the return of former series regular Brett Dalton as Grant Ward, along with the return of B. J. Britt as Antoine Triplett, Adam Kulbersh as Kenneth Turgeon, and Simon Kassianides as Sunil Bakshi. Advertisements for the show ahead of the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con featuring a flaming chain led to speculation that the character Ghost Rider would be joining the series during the season, though it was noted that the image could just indicate an increased role for Whitehead after he was introduced as James in the third season, and also wields a flaming chain. When casting for two Latino brothers, "one of whom is always the most dangerous person in the room, the other paralyzed in a wheelchair", was revealed to be underway for the series in June, further speculation pointed to the inclusion of Ghost Rider, with those character descriptions resembling those for Marvel Comics' All-New Ghost Rider Robbie Reyes and his brother Gabe, respectively. At the series' Comic-Con panel, the speculation was confirmed—Gabriel Luna was announced to be cast as Robbie Reyes, and Lorenzo James Henrie was later revealed to be cast as Gabe. Also in June, the series was looking to cast an actress for the recurring role of Aida, a robot whose artificial intelligence was briefly voiced by Amanda Rea during the third-season finale; Mallory Jansen was cast in the role that August. Jansen also portrays Agnes Kitsworth, Radcliffe's former lover and partner after whom he modeled Aida. Within the Framework reality, Aida appears as "Ophelia" / Madame Hydra, portrayed as well by Jansen. Other recurring guests revealed were Lilli Birdsell as Lucy Bauer, a worker at Momentum Energy; Jason O'Mara as Jeffrey Mace / Patriot, the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.; Parminder Nagra as Ellen Nadeer, an anti-Inhuman politician; and Patrick Cavanaugh as S.H.I.E.L.D. PR agent Burrows. In October 2016, José Zúñiga was revealed to be portraying Eli Morrow, the Reyes' uncle, while in January 2017, Zach McGowan was revealed as Anton Ivanov, "The Superior" of the Watchdogs. In April 2017, Jordan Rivera was revealed as Hope Mackenzie, Mack's daughter in the Framework reality. Additionally, Blaise Miller and Ricardo Walker make multiple appearances as S.H.I.E.L.D. lab tech Nathanson and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Prince. In May 2016, Tancharoen said "we're always open" to the possibility of Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood appearing in the season, after they left the series' cast during the third season for the spin-off series Marvel's Most Wanted, which ultimately did not get picked up. Whedon reiterated in January 2017 that "Once an agent, always an agent, so it's always out there in the ether", but stated that the pair were unlikely to return during the fourth season.
