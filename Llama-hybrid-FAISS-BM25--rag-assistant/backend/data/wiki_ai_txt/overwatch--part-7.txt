Character biographies and fake news reports containing story pieces have also been published on Blizzard's website. Chu remarked that Blizzard's method of storytelling with Overwatch demonstrated a "gameplay first" philosophy. Animated projects As part of the original game's announcement, Blizzard released an animated "cinematic trailer" for Overwatch on November 7, 2014. They would repeat this to announce Overwatch 2, releasing the Zero Hour cinematic trailer in 2019. Blizzard also released animated short films to help flesh out "the real meat" of Overwatch's lore. These shorts employed 3D computer-generated animation, and received praise from video game journalists, with some likening their quality to those of works from Disney and Pixar. that Recall, the first of these shorts, was released on March 21, 2016. It was centered around Reaper's attack on Winston at Gibraltar and Winston's following recall of former Overwatch agents. Blizzard released nine more shorts through 2018; Reunion was the last of these shorts until The Wastelander was released in 2022. Aside from short films, Blizzard also released "origin story" videos for Soldier: 76 and each character added to Overwatch's playable roster post-launch. An origin story for King's Row Uprising, a tie-in for an in-game event was also released. These origin story videos are designed to provide players with the background of new characters. Origin stories are animated in the style of motion comics and are shorter than Blizzard's 3D-animated short films.

Another five-issue limited series, New Blood was released from November 2021 to March 2022. Similar in style to London Calling, the series followed Cassidy post-Zero Hour on his journey to recruit members to the newly revived Overwatch. Both London Calling and New Blood also served as tie-ins for in-game seasonal events.
