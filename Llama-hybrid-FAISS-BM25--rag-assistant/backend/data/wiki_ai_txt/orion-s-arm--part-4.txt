rate on the level of normal humans being considered the very baseline of this scale. The latter are referred to as "modosophonts" to distinguish them from those of higher toposophic levels and are the most common form of sapient life (and the only form of known sapient life in the real world). These are generally abbreviated in S-levels based on how many singularities in intelligence the individual has ascended, from SI:0 modosophonts (treating sapience as the zeroth singularity above base animal sentience and intelligence), SI:1 being First Toposophic transsapients, SI:2 being Second Toposophics, etc. The process of ascending to a higher toposophic level is typically described as being exponentially more difficult and time-intensive the higher one goes on the scale, and is also associated with the risk of losing one's current identity due to the inherent changes in how one comprehends themselves and even reality itself. This, in combination with life extension technology/mind uploading that can render one functionally immortal, serves as the explanation for why the vast majority do not choose to ascend quickly, or do so at a very slow rate over a long period of time (if at all). However, it is also insinuated that ascension in itself is the primary reason why those at the highest toposophic levels choose to allow those at a lower level to continue existing whatsoever, since those at the highest toposophic levels do not interact socially with those at lower levels due to the vast differences in how each comprehends existence. This reasoning is kept purposefully vague, but has been described in universe as: the "lower" beings serving some sort of unknown critical function in the continued existence of the high toposophics, that they derive some sort of joy from their continued existence (similar to recreational horticulture or owning a pet), and/or that their existence promotes a more diverse set of high level intelligences to emerge so as to avoid stagnation and provide further insight into new, higher toposophic levels and the means to reach them. Reception Orion's Arm has been reviewed in the role-playing magazine Knights of the Dinner Table, as well as on Boing Boing by transhumanist science fiction author Cory Doctorow. References to the Encyclopaedia Galactica have been made in a book on overcoming Librarian stereotypes. The Orion's Arm website has also been recommended in a children's teaching guide. The Orion's Arm perspective on wormholes has been discussed in various science fiction forums outside the group's own mailing lists, including mention on hardsf.org and discussion in a paper from UC Davis.
