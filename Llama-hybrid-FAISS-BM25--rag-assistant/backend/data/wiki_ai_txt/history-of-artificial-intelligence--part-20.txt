I boom to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, suggesting that investor enthusiasm might be outpacing realistic near-term capabilities and revenue potential. These concerns were amplified by the substantial market capitalizations of AI-focused companies, many of which had yet to demonstrate sustainable profitability models. In March 2024, Anthropic released the Claude 3 family of large language models, including Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. The models demonstrated significant improvements in capabilities across various benchmarks, with Claude 3 Opus notably outperforming leading models from OpenAI and Google. In June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated improved performance compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, particularly in areas such as coding, multistep workflows, and image analysis. 2024 Nobel Prizes In 2024, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Nobel Prizes in recognition of groundbreaking contributions to artificial intelligence. The recipients included: In physics: John Hopfield for his work on physics-inspired Hopfield networks, and Geoffrey Hinton for foundational contributions to Boltzmann machines and deep learning. In chemistry: David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for their advancements in protein folding predictions. See AlphaFold. Further study and development of AI In January 2025, OpenAI announced a new AI, ChatGPT-Gov, which would be specifically designed for US government agencies to use securely. Open AI said that agencies could utilize ChatGPT Gov on a Microsoft Azure cloud or Azure Government cloud, "on top of Microsoft's Azure's OpenAI Service." OpenAI's announcement stated that "Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, FedRAMP High). Additionally, we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data." National policies Countries have invested in policies and funding to deploy autonomous robots in an attempt to address labor shortages and enhancing efficiency, while also implementing regulatory frameworks for ethical and safe development. China In 2025, China invested approximately 730 billion yuan (roughly US$100 billion) to advance AI and robotics in smart manufacturing and healthcare. The "14th Five-Year Plan" (2021â€“2025) prioritized service robots, with AI systems enabling robots to perform complex tasks like assisting in surgeries or automating factory assembly lines. Some funding also supported defense applications, such as autonomous drones. Starting in September 2025, China mandated labeling of AI-generated content to ensure transparency and public trust in these technologies. United States In January 2025, Stargate LLC was formed as a joint venture of OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX, who announced plans to invest US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the United States by 2029. The venture was formally announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on 21 January 2025, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son appointed as chairman. The U.S. government allocated approximately $2 billion to integrate AI and robotics in manufacturing and logistics. State governments supplemented this with funding for service robots, such as those deployed in warehouses to fulfill verbal commands for inventory management or in eldercare facilities to respond to residents' requests for assistance. Some funds were directed to defense, including lethal autonomous weapon and military robot. In January 2025, Executive Order 14179 established an "AI Action Plan" to accelerate innovation and deployment of these technologies with the declared intent of "world domination" and "victory"..
