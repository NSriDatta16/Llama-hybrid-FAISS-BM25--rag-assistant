Charts "Now You're Gone" An English version of "Boten Anna" titled "Now You're Gone", sung by Sebastian Westwood using unrelated lyrics by DJ Mental Theo's Bazzheadz which was originally released in 2006, became the music to a video by Basshunter with the same title in November 2007. The video and the track were met with worldwide chart success and became the most requested record in summer holiday resorts around Europe in early 2008. As people returning from their holidays wanted to hear it again, TV channels in the UK were inundated with requests for the video. On 13 January 2008, "Now You're Gone" entered number one in the UK Singles Chart and spent five weeks at the top of the chart, ending Leon Jackson's three-week run with "When You Believe". In the sixth week after the song's release, it was knocked off the top by Welsh singer Duffy, with her song "Mercy". "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)" Background The previous Basshunter single, "End the Lies", released on 2 September 2022, was a collaboration with Italian duo Alien Cut. In 2023, Basshunter collaborated with Victor Leksell on "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)". The previous Leksell single "Fånga mig när jag faller" was released on 28 April, and reached number three on Swedish singles chart. "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)" was written by Basshunter and Victor Leksell, and produced by Basshunter, Pontus Persson and Robert Uhlmann. Leksell was in talks with Basshunter about working together and originally Basshunter was supposed to remix his 2020 song "Svag", but instead of it they recorded "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)". "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)" was recorded during one weekend in Dubai's studio. Basshunter praised Viktor Leksell and described him as a very talented person. Viktor Leksell said that the song goes well with other songs on his set list, and that he will play it live. However, Liselott Lindberg from LiveNews.se noticed that Leksell did not play the song during Lollapalooza in Stockholm. Basshunter said that while he does not have any concert scheduled in Sweden during the summer, he stated that it is possible for him to perform it during Leksell's summer festival tour. The next Leksell single "Stor man" is a collaboration with Danish singer Tobias Rahim and was released on 7 July. On 28 July, Victor Leksell sang the song at the Amaze Festival in Smögen. Reception and chart performance Tali da Silva from Sveriges Television stated that Victor Leksell made a joke about the original lyrics by singing about the boat at the beginning. Karin Pihl from Göteborgs-Posten described "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)" as a slickly produced version with "silly, buttery vocals and without the brain-dead gaming charm". On 30 June 2023, "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)" entered the Swedish singles chart at number 10. Lars Nylin from Musikindustrin described it as the strongest news of the week. It peaked the next week at fourth. In the third week on the chart for "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)", Victor Leksell's next single "Stor man" debuted on 15th position on Swedish chart. "Ingen kan slå (Boten Anna)" is the first Basshunter single to enter the Swedish chart since "Fest i hela huset" from 2011. The song spent 13 weeks on the chart.
