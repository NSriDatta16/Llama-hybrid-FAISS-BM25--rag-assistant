xample, a diagnostic decision support system may be rated based upon the consistency and accuracy of its classification of disease (as compared to physicians or other decision support systems). An evidence-based medicine system might be rated based upon a high incidence of patient improvement or higher financial reimbursement for care providers. Combining with electronic health records Implementing EHRs was an inevitable challenge. This challenge is because it is a relatively uncharted area, and there are many issues and complications during the implementation phase of an EHR. This can be seen in the numerous studies that have been undertaken. However, challenges in implementing electronic health records (EHRs) have received some attention. Still, less is known about transitioning from legacy EHRs to newer systems. EHRs are a way to capture and utilise real-time data to provide high-quality patient care, ensuring efficiency and effective use of time and resources. Incorporating EHR and CDSS together into the process of medicine has the potential to change the way medicine has been taught and practiced. It has been said that "the highest level of EHR is a CDSS". Since "clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer systems designed to impact clinician decision making about individual patients at the point in time that these decisions are made", it is clear that it would be beneficial to have a fully integrated CDSS and EHR. Even though the benefits can be seen, fully implementing a CDSS integrated with an EHR has historically required significant planning by the healthcare facility/organisation for the CDSS to be successful and effective. The success and effectiveness can be measured by the increased patient care being delivered and reduced adverse events occurring. In addition, there would be a saving of time and resources and benefits in terms of autonomy and financial benefits to the healthcare facility/organisation. Benefits A successful CDSS/EHR integration will allow the provision of best practice, high-quality care to the patient, which is the ultimate goal of healthcare. Three areas that can be addressed with the implementation of CDSS and Electronic Health Records (EHRs), are: Medication prescription errors Adverse drug events Other medical errors CDSSs will be most beneficial in the future when healthcare facilities are "100% electronic" in terms of real-time patient information, thus simplifying the number of modifications that must occur to ensure that all the systems are up to date with each other. The measurable benefits of clinical decision support systems on physician performance and patient outcomes remain the subject of ongoing research. Barriers Implementing electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare settings incurs challenges; none more important than maintaining efficiency and safety during rollout, but in order for the implementation process to be effective, an understanding of the EHR users' perspectives is key to the success of EHR implementation projects. In addition to this, adoption needs to be actively fostered through a bottom-up, clinical-needs-first approach. The same can be said for CDSS. As of 2007, the main areas of concern with moving into a fully integrated EHR/CDSS system have been: Privacy Confidentiality User-friendliness Document accuracy and completeness Integration Uniformity Acceptance Alert desensitisation as well as the key aspects of data entry that need to be addressed when implementing a CDSS to avoid potential adverse events from occurring. These aspects include whether: correct data is being used all the data has been entered into the system current best practice is being followed the data is evidence-based A service oriented architecture has been proposed as a technical means to address some of these barriers. Status in Australia As of July 2015, the planned transition to EHRs in Australia is facing difficulties. Most healthcare facilities are still running completely
