ing video. Some of the major tools that are being used in these processes currently are DALL-E, Mid-journey, and Runway. Way mark Studios utilized the tools offered by both DALL-E and Mid-journey to create a fully AI generated film called The Frost in the summer of 2023. Way mark Studios is experimenting with using these AI tools to generate advertisements and commercials for companies in mere seconds. Yves Bergquist, a director of the AI & Neuroscience in Media Project at USC's Entertainment Technology Center, says post production crews in Hollywood are already using generative AI, and predicts that in the future more companies will embrace this new technology. Music AI has been used to compose music of various genres. David Cope created an AI called Emily Howell that managed to become well known in the field of algorithmic computer music. The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent. In 2012, AI Iamus created the first complete classical album. AIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist), composes symphonic music, mainly classical music for film scores. It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musical professional association. Melomics creates computer-generated music for stress and pain relief. At Sony CSL Research Laboratory, the Flow Machines software creates pop songs by learning music styles from a huge database of songs. It can compose in multiple styles. The Watson Beat uses reinforcement learning and deep belief networks to compose music on a simple seed input melody and a select style. The software was open sourced and musicians such as Taryn Southern collaborated with the project to create music. South Korean singer, Hayeon's, debut song, "Eyes on You" was composed using AI which was supervised by real composers, including NUVO. Writing and reporting Narrative Science sells computer-generated news and reports. It summarizes sporting events based on statistical data from the game. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses. Automated Insights generates personalized recaps and previews for Yahoo Sports Fantasy Football. Yseop, uses AI to turn structured data into natural language comments and recommendations. Yseop writes financial reports, executive summaries, personalized sales or marketing documents and more in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German. TALESPIN made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop. The program started with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals. The story narrated their attempts to satisfy these goals. Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko asserted that the essence of storytelling was experience management, or "how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which is often at odds". While AI storytelling focuses on story generation (character and plot), story communication also received attention. In 2002, researchers developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation. They faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity on stories such as Little Red Riding Hood. In 2016, a Japanese AI co-wrote a short story and almost won a literary prize. South Korean company Hanteo Global uses a journalism bot to write articles. Literary authors are also exploring uses of AI. An example is David Jhave Johnston's work ReRites (2017â€“2019), where the poet created a daily rite of editing the poetic output of a neural network to create a series of performances and publications. Sports writing In 2010, artificial intelligence used baseball statistics to automatically generate news articles. This was launched by The Big Ten Network using software from Narrative Science. After being unable to cover every Minor League Baseball game with a large team, Associated Press collaborated with Automated Insights in 2016 to create game recaps that were automated by artificial intelligence. UOL in Brazil expanded the use of AI in its writing. Rather than just ge
