 the future (this one reprogrammed and sent by the future John Connor), raid Cyberdyne Systems and succeed in destroying the CPU and arm of the first movie's Terminator, along with the majority of research that led to Skynet's development. This also results in the death of Miles Dyson. Skynet had also sent a more advanced T-1000 Terminator back in time to kill John Connor, but it is also destroyed. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Judgment Day was ultimately not prevented, but merely postponed. Cyber Research Systems (CRS), an in-house software developer for the US military which gained access to Cyberdyne's original patents, is developing Skynet as a software system designed to make real-time strategic decisions as well as protect their computer systems from cyber attacks, overseen by US Air Force officer Lieutenant General Robert Brewster. Unknown to CRS, Skynet begins to spread beyond its original computing base through the Internet under the guise of a computer virus. The future Skynet also sends a T-X Terminator back in time to kill John Connor's future subordinates in the human resistance, including his future wife and second-in-command, Kate Brewster, the daughter of Robert. As Skynet penetrates networked machines around the world, CRS attempts to eliminate it from the US defense mainframes by tasking Skynet with removing the infection and effectively deleting itself. Skynet responds by taking control of CRS' various machines and robots and using them to kill the CRS personnel and secure the facility. John Connor and Kate Brewster attempted to attack Skynet's computer core, hoping to stop it before it proceeded to its next attack, only to find that ten years of technological advancement meant that Skynet no longer had such a core, now existing as a distributed software network spread out across thousands of civilian computer systems. From the infected launch systems, Skynet was able to start Judgement Day despite Connor and Brewster's efforts. Terminator Salvation In the post-apocalyptic year of 2018, Skynet controls a global machine network from its heavily guarded fortress-factories and research installations. Outside of its facilities, mechanized units wage a constant war with the Resistance. Airborne units such as Aerostats (smaller versions of the Hunter Killer-aerials), HK-Aerials and Transports survey the skies; HK-Tanks, Mototerminators (high-speed pursuit units using a motorcycle chassis), and various Terminator models patrol cities and roads; and Hydrobots (serpentine aquatic units that move in swarms) patrol the waters. Harvesters (massive bipedal units designed to capture humans and eliminate any attempting to escape) collect survivors and deliver them to large transport craft for delivery to concentration camps for processing, as mentioned in the first movie. Terminator class units such as T-600 and T-700 have been developed and act as hunters and enforcers in disposal camps. Mass production has also begun on the T-800 series in at least one Skynet facility. In its continued battle with the Resistance, Skynet activated Marcus Wright, a forerunner to the humanoid terminators. As a death-row inmate, Wright donated his body in 2003 to a Cyberdyne project run by the brilliant, but terminally ill Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter). After Wright's death by lethal injection, he was transformed into a human cyborg, possessing a human heart and brain with a titanium hyper-alloy endoskeleton and skin similar to the T-800. Skynet developed the plan to use him as an infiltration unit. A Skynet chip was installed at the base of his skull and he was programmed to locate Kyle Reese and John Connor and bring them to a Skynet facility. The programming acted on a subconscious level, allowing him to work towards his goal in a human manner. Skynet also created a signal supposedly capable of deactivating its machines and leaked its existence to the Resistance. The Resistance leader General Ashdown attempted to use the si
