Artificial intelligence marketing is a form of marketing that uses artificial intelligence concepts and models such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to achieve marketing goals. The main difference between artificial intelligence marketing and traditional forms of marketing resides in the reasoning, which is performed through a computer algorithm rather than a human. Each form of marketing has a different technique to the core of the marketing theory. Traditional marketing directly focuses on the needs of consumers; meanwhile some believe the shift AI may cause, will lead marketing agencies to manage consumer needs instead. Artificial Intelligence is used in various digital marketing spaces, such as content marketing, email marketing, online advertisement (in combination with machine learning), social media marketing, affiliate marketing, and beyond. The Potential of Artificial Intelligence is constantly being explored in digital marketing. In real time AI has been used by Marketing professionals because they claim it helps them prioritize customer satisfaction. Marketing Professionals can analyze the performance of rival companies as well as their campaigns, which can reveal the wants and needs of their customers. Historical development Artificial intelligence has been having an impact on marketing for years, and will continuously grow. The impact of AI has become more clear, and noticeable during 2017. More people have become more aware of AI's presence. However, AI has a long history, which goes all the way back to the 1980s. The study of AI started with studies relating to robotics, and systems. Despite the initial research, and the studies that were carried out, AI wasn't exactly becoming widespread. Research on it came to a stop for a while, until research was revived 2 decades later. Different factors such as the advancement in technology, rise of Big Data, and the significant increase in computational power, all opened the door. Eventually Ai became very popular in the marketing world, and caught the eyes of many researchers as well as professionals. A large‐scale bibliometric study covering 1,580 peer‑reviewed papers published between 1982 and 2020 confirms that scholarly output on AI in marketing has surged since 2017, with Expert Systems with Applications emerging as the most prolific outlet. Prior to the application of artificial Intelligence in marketing, there was something called "collaborative filtering". This was used as early as 1998 by Amazon, and one of the first ways companies predicted consumer behavior, which enabled millions of recommendations to different customers. today, when you open Spotify and you see recommended music, or recommended tv shows on Netflix, this is done through AI clustering our behaviors. Based on the data our profile provides, they can make these recommendations. A big milestone in AI marketing happened in 2014, when programmatic ad buying gained much greater popularity. Marketing consists of numerous manual tasks such as researching target markets, insertion orders, and managing high budgets as well as prices. In order to cut costs, and remove the need for these tedious tasks, many companies started to automate the marketing process with AI. In 2015, Google released its most recent algorithm known as RankBrain, which opened new ways to analyzing search inquiries. It's used to accurately determine the reasoning and intent behind users searches. Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in marketing to personalize user experiences and automate decision-making. For example, Netflix uses AI algorithms to recommend content based on viewing history, while Sephora employs chatbots to assist customers with product selection and availability. Programmatic advertising platforms like Google Ads leverage machine learning to optimize bidding strategies and target audiences more effectively. These applications demonstrate how AI enhances efficiency, engag
