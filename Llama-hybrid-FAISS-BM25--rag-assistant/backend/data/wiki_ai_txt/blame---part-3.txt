008. Set an undefined but long time after the events of Blame!, it follows an incarnation of Pcell. After Killy's success in Blame!, humanity has begun to dominate The City once more and began wiping out most Silicon Life. After P-cell escapes the extinction as the sole survivor of her kind (which is beset by humanity and the Safeguard), she is saved from death by Killy. She eventually makes it to the edge of the City, where it is implied she travels to another planet and restarts Silicon Life civilization using the stored gene-data of her dead companions. NSE: NetSphere Engineer NSE: NetSphere Engineer (ネットスフィアエンジニア, Netto Sufia Enjinia) is a sequel to Blame!. It was originally published as a one-shot in the Bessatsu Morning magazine. This one-shot was compiled in one volume with Blame Academy!, titled Blame Academy! and So On in 2008. NSE: NetSphere Engineer follows a "Dismantler", a NetSphere Engineer in charge of disabling the remaining nexus towers that summon Safeguard interference upon its detection of humans without the net terminal genes. Like Blame!2, NSE is set in a long but undefined time period after the events of Blame!. However, it is implied it is even later than Blame!2 as Safeguards are now very rare encounters. Blame! Denki Ryōshi Kiki Kaisō Dasshutsu Sakusen A manga adaptation of the Blame! film illustrated by Kotaro Sekine was serialized in Kodansha's Monthly Shōnen Sirius from April 26 to October 26, 2017, and collected into one volume, released on February 9, 2018. Blame!: The Ancient Terminal City A trailer revealing a special Blame! short, appearing at the beginning of the 8th episode of Knights of Sidonia: Battle for Planet Nine (the second season of the anime adaptation of Knights of Sidonia), was released in November 2014. The episode aired in May 2015. The short is contextualized as a TV program that the people of Sidonia tune in for. Film Plans for a full-length CG animated film were announced in 2007. However, this proposed CG film project was not released before Micott and Basara (the studio hired) filed for bankruptcy in 2011. It was announced in November 2015 that the series would get an anime theatrical film adaptation. The film is directed by Hiroyuki Seshita and written by Tsutomu Nihei and Sadayuki Murai, with animation by Polygon Pictures and character designs by Yuki Moriyama. It was released globally as a Netflix original on May 20, 2017. On October 5, 2017, Viz Media announced at their New York Comic Con panel that they licensed the home video rights to the film. They released it on DVD and Blu-ray on March 27, 2018. Reception Jarred Pine from Mania.com commented "[it] is not an easy task" to talk about the story in the first volume as "it leaves quite a gamut of questions open for the reader, nothing on the surface to give the reader a sense of direction or purpose". Pine said Blame! doesn't have a mass appeal and "there will be quite a strong line dividing those who love and hate Nihei's unique and convoluted cyberpunk journey". In 2006, the Tokyopop distribution was nominated for a Harvey Award in the category "Best American Edition of Foreign Material". Notes References External links Pine, Jarred (November 14, 2005).
