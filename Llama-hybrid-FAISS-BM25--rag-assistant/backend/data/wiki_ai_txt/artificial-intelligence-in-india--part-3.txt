anslation, information extraction/retrieval, automatic summarization, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, intelligent language teaching, and natural language-based document management with Decision Support Systems. These applications are the result of the foundation laid by previous language technology activities. Software firms in the Indian private sector began looking into AI applications, mostly in the area of business process automation. In order to allow machines to read, comprehend, and interpret human languages, the Language Technologies Research Center was founded in October 1999 at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. It focused on the advancements in semantic parsing, information extraction, natural language generation, sentiment analysis, and dialogue systems. Some of the early AI research in India was driven by societal needs. For example; Eklavya, a knowledge-based program created by IIT Madas, helped community health workers deal with toddler illness symptoms by generating systematic case histories, offering basic treatment advice, or indicating when a referral was necessary. The National Centre for Software Technology (NCST) created the Vidya language teaching system, which enhances educational quality through the use of speech-vision processing, ML, and NLP. C-DAC created the Sarani flight-scheduling expert system. TIFR and the Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute created a formant-based speech synthesis system for the Indian Railways. IISc and ISRO built an image processing facility that uses AI and computer vision. Growth phase Around 2003, language technology, computer vision, and data science research groups were established at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. With an emphasis on applied and translational research, the institute has the largest group of AI and machine learning researchers in India as of 2023. They also work on blockchain and quantum computing. In partnership with Intel, they created the Indian Driving Dataset, which contains the largest amount of road data for unstructured driving situations worldwide. The Government of Karnataka established the Machine Intelligence & Robotics CoE (MINRO) at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bengaluru in 2018 with the goal of creating frameworks and regulations for ethical and responsible AI technologies. It researches on human-machine interface, industrial robotics and automation, data science and analysis, pattern recognition, machine intelligence, and AI systems. On September 7, 2018, NITI Aayog, Intel, and TIFR announced their intention to establish International Center for Transformative Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) in Bengaluru to support applied research. Under the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, it will create and implement AI-led application-based research projects on AI foundational frameworks, tools, and assets, such as curated datasets and distinctive AI algorithms in smart mobility, healthcare, and agriculture. On 16 November 2018, the Government of Maharastra signed MoU with the NITI Aayog and Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence to launch ICTAI for rural healthcare in collaboration with PATH, Lords Education and Health Society, Wadhwani Initiative for Sustainable Healthcare, IIT Madras, Sir Ratan Tata Trust, and Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences. It will prioritize study, diagnosis, and treatment of illnesses such as tuberculosis and cancer. NITI Aayog signed partnership agreement with Microsoft in 2018 to help expedite the use of AI for the development and adoption of local language computing, and to create farm advice services. Microsoft-NITI Aayog Problem to Solution Incubation Test Bed will be established. Microsoft will also help develop AI-assisted models for diabetic retinopathy screening. NITI Aayog drafted a proposal in 2019 to establish an institutional framework for AI. A cabinet note
