The Universal Data Element Framework (UDEF) was a controlled vocabulary developed by The Open Group. It provided a framework for categorizing, naming, and indexing data. It assigned to every item of data a structured alphanumeric tag plus a controlled vocabulary name that describes the meaning of the data. This allowed relating data elements to similar elements defined by other organizations. UDEF defined a Dewey-decimal like code for each concept. For example, an "employee number" is often used in human resource management. It has a UDEF tag a.5_12.35.8 and a controlled vocabulary description "Employee.PERSON_Employer.Assigned.IDENTIFIER". UDEF has been superseded by the Open Data Element Framework (ODEF). Examples In an application used by a hospital, the last name and first name of several people could include the following example concepts: Patient Person Family Name – find the word “Patient” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Family” under the UDEF property “Name” Patient Person Given Name – find the word “Patient” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Given” under the UDEF property “Name” Doctor Person Family Name – find the word “Doctor” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Family” under the UDEF property “Name” Doctor Person Given Name – find the word “Doctor” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Given” under the UDEF property “Name” For the examples above, the following UDEF IDs are available: “Patient Person Family Name” the UDEF ID is “au.5_11.10” “Patient Person Given Name” the UDEF ID is “au.5_12.10” “Doctor Person Family Name” the UDEF ID is “aq.5_11.10” “Doctor Person Given Name” the UDEF ID is “aq.5_12.10” See also Data integration ISO/IEC 11179 National Information Exchange Model Metadata Semantic web Data element Representation term Controlled vocabulary References External links UDEF Project of The Open Group UDEF Frequently Asked Questions O-DEF™, the Open Data Element Framework, Version 2.0 O-DEF™, the Open Data Element Framework, Version 3.0
