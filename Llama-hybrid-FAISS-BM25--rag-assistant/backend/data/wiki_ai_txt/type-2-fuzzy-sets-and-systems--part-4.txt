 set—type-1 or type-2—should be used as a model for a word? Mendel has argued, on the basis of Karl Popper's concept of "falsificationism", that using a type-1 fuzzy set as a model for a word is scientifically incorrect. An interval type-2 fuzzy set should be used as a (first-order uncertainty) model for a word. Much research is underway about CWW. Applications Type-2 fuzzy sets were applied in the following areas: Image processing Video processing and computer vision Failure Mode And Effect Analysis Function approximation and estimation Control systems Software Freeware MATLAB implementations, which cover general and interval type-2 fuzzy sets and systems, as well as type-1 fuzzy systems, are available at: Software supporting discrete interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems is available at: DIT2FLS Toolbox - DIT2FLS Library Package - Java libraries including source code for type-1, interval- and general type-2 fuzzy systems are available at: Python library for type 1 and type 2 fuzzy sets is available at: Python library for interval type 2 fuzzy sets and systems is available at: An open source Matlab/Simulink Toolbox for Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems is available at: See also Computational intelligence Expert system Fuzzy control system Fuzzy logic Fuzzy set Granular computing Perceptual Computing Rough set Soft set Vagueness Random-fuzzy variable References External links There are two IEEE Expert Now multi-media modules that can be accessed from the IEEE at: [1] "Introduction to Type-2 Fuzzy Sets and Systems" by Jerry Mendel, sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society "Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers: Towards a New Approach for Handling Uncertainties in Real World Environments" by Hani Hagras, sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society
