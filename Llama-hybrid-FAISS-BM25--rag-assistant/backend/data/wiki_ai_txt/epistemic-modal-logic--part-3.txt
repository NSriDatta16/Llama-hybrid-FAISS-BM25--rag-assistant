th infinite memory capacity), it makes sense for K i {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}_{i}} to be an equivalence relation, since this is the strongest form and is the most appropriate for the greatest number of applications. An equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The accessibility relation does not have to have these qualities; there are certainly other choices possible, such as those used when modeling belief rather than knowledge. The properties of knowledge Assuming that K i {\displaystyle {\mathcal {K}}_{i}} is an equivalence relation, and that the agents are perfect reasoners, a few properties of knowledge can be derived. The properties listed here are often known as the "S5 Properties," for reasons described in the Axiom Systems section below. The distribution axiom This axiom is traditionally known as K. In epistemic terms, it states that if an agent knows φ {\displaystyle \varphi } and knows that φ ⟹ ψ {\displaystyle \varphi \implies \psi } , then the agent must also know ψ {\displaystyle \,\psi } . So, ( K i φ ∧ K i ( φ ⟹ ψ ) ) ⟹ K i ψ {\displaystyle (K_{i}\varphi \land K_{i}(\varphi \implies \psi ))\implies K_{i}\psi } This axiom is valid on any frame in relational semantics. This axiom logically establishes modus ponens as a rule of inference for every epistemically possible world. The knowledge generalization rule Another property we can derive is that if ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is valid (i.e. a tautology), then K i ϕ {\displaystyle K_{i}\phi } . This does not mean that if ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is true, then agent i knows ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } . What it means is that if ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is true in every world that an agent considers to be a possible world, then the agent must know ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } at every possible world. This principle is traditionally called N (Necessitation rule). if ⊨ φ then M ⊨ K i φ . {\displaystyle {\text{if }}\models \varphi {\text{ then }}M\models K_{i}\varphi .\,} This rule always preserves truth in relational semantics. The knowledge or truth axiom This axiom is also known as T. It says that if an agent knows facts, the facts must be true. This has often been taken as the major distinguishing feature between knowledge and belief. We can believe a statement to be true when it is false, but it would be impossible to know a false statement. K i φ ⟹ φ {\displaystyle K_{i}\varphi \implies \varphi } This axiom can also be expressed in its contraposition as agents cannot know a false statement: φ ⟹ ¬ K i ¬ φ {\displaystyle \varphi \implies \neg K_{i}\neg \varphi } This axiom is valid on any reflexive frame. The positive introspection axiom This property and the next state that an agent has introspection about its own knowledge, and are traditionally known as 4 and 5, respectively. The Positive Introspection Axiom, also known as the KK Axiom, says specifically that agents know that they know what they know. This axiom may seem less obvious than the ones listed previously, and Timothy Williamson has argued against its inclusion forcefully in his book, Knowledge and Its Limits. K i φ ⟹ K i K i φ {\displaystyle K_{i}\varphi \implies K_{i}K_{i}\varphi } Equivalently, this modal axiom 4 says that agents do not know what they do not know that they know ¬ K i K i φ ⟹ ¬ K i φ {\displaystyle \neg K_{i}K_{i}\varphi \implies \neg K_{i}\varphi } This axiom is valid on any transitive frame. The negative introspection axiom The Negative Introspection Axiom says that agents know that they do not know what they do not know. ¬ K i φ ⟹ K i ¬ K i φ {\displaystyle \neg K_{i}\varphi \implies K_{i}\neg K_{i}\varphi } Or, equivalently, this modal axiom 5 says that agents know what they do not know that they do not know ¬ K i ¬ K i φ ⟹ K i φ {\displaystyle \neg K_{i}\neg K_{i}\varphi \implies K_{i}\varphi } This axiom is valid on any Euclidean frame. Axiom systems Different modal logics can be derived from taking different subsets of these axioms, and th
