foundation non-reasoning models such as Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, Kimi K2, Claude 4 Opus Non-thinking, and DeepSeek V3.1. There is no dedicated thinking mode for Qwen3-Max as of yet. On September 10, 2025, Qwen3-Next was released under the Apache 2.0 license and made available through chat.qwen.ai, as well as platforms like Hugging Face and Model Scope. Qwen3-Next includes two post-trained Instruct and Thinking models. Qwen3-Next was created with a new model-architecture called Qwen3-Next, in the belief that Context Length Scaling and Total Parameter Scaling are two major trends in the future of large models. Qwen3-Next introduces several key improvements over the Qwen3 architecture: a hybrid attention mechanism, a highly sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) structure, training-stability-friendly optimizations, and a multi-token prediction mechanism for faster inference. Based on the Qwen3-Next architecture, a model with 80B total parameters and 3B active parameters was created. The Qwen3-Next model performs comparable to, or in some cases better than, Qwen3-32b while using less than 10% of its training cost (in GPU hours). In inference, especially with contexts greater than 32K tokens, it reaches greater than 10x higher throughput. Qwen3.5 will use a refined version of the Qwen3-Next architecture. On September 22, 2025, Qwen3-Omni was release under the Apache 2.0 license and made available through chat.qwen.ai, as well as platforms like Hugging Face and Model Scope. Qwen3-Omni is a mixed/multimodal model that can process text, images, audio, and video, and deliver real-time streaming responses in both text and natural speech.
