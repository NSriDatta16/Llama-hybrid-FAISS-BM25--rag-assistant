tue to revive the teammate hands-free, which takes three seconds. Teammates revived by a defibrillator respawn with 50% of their maximum health, however much ammunition was in their gun at the time of death, and incur a short cooldown on their specializations and gadgets. If enough time elapses, a player may choose to respawn themselves at full health. In quick-play games, players can respawn an unlimited number of times, while in Tournament game modes, players have a limited amount of Respawn Tokens, gaining one extra token per round. If an entire team is eliminated before a member can respawn (referred to as a team wipe), all members will respawn together, at the same time, and without consuming respawn tokens. Players who die with no more respawn tokens are forced to wait until a teammate revives them, or until their team is wiped out. At the end of matches, players earn in-game currency, known as "VR", by playing matches. These can be spent to permanently unlock new weapons, specializations, and gadgets, with most items costing 500 VRs to purchase, and items released in the current season costing 2200 VRs to purchase. The maximum holding limit for VRs is 5000, and exceeded VRs will not be returned. As of Season 8, released on September 10, 2025, new players are now presented with a variety of preset loadouts called "Playstyles." Each Playstyle contains a specialization, weapon and 3 gadgets, in addition to a variety of reserve items immediately unlocked upon starting the game. Further gameplay allows new players to obtain "Playstyle Tokens" that can unlock additional playstyles, in addition to purchasing individual items with VRs. Game modes As a live service game, The Finals receives new game modes and revisions to existing ones regularly. Game modes are divided into casual ("quick play") and competitive modes. Cashout In Cashout, four teams each with three players compete against one another to earn as much money as possible. The primary source of money are "cash boxes", which must be unlocked from a vault and transported to a "cashout station." After bringing a cash box to a station, the team that deposited it instantly earns 20% of its value, then must hold control of the station until the cashout timer expires to earn the remaining 80%. Other teams can "steal" a cashout in progress with 7 seconds of continuous interaction, claiming ownership of the station and its remaining potential payout. Two cash boxes or activated cashouts will always be in play at a given time, and a new vault spawns every time a team completes a cashout. Each vault that appears on the map is more valuable than the last, ranging anywhere from $10,000 to $22,000, enabling teams at the bottom of the scoreboard to overtake first place if they claim enough money at the very end of a round. Multiple vaults can be brought to a single cashout station, combining their payouts under one timer. Additional bonus money can be earned by killing enemy players ($500 each), starting vaults ($1000 each), and stealing cashouts ($1000 each). Players start with 2 respawn token, and gain an additional token at the end of each round. Aspects of Cashout take inspiration from traditional capture the flag and king of the hill game types, requiring teams to obtain, hold and then defend different objectives to complete the main objective. Rounds last 9 minutes, with the possibility of an additional 1-minute "overtime" if a vault is deposited into an empty cashout station within the last 60 seconds of the round. Players cannot change their contestant once the round starts, but they can swap items from their reserve loadout after death. However, players revived by teammates will keep their current loadout, whether or not they changed it. In World Tour and Ranked Tournaments, Cashout is played in a tournament-style bracket with 8 teams: In the first round, teams compete against each other in groups of four, with the top two teams from each group moving to the second round.
