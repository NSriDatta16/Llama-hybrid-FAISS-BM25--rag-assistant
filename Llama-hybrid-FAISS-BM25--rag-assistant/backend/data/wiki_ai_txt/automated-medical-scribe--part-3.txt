ccuracy concerns. Extracting information from the conversation to autopopulate a form, for instance, may be problematic, with symptoms incorrectly auto-labelled as "absent" even if they were repeatedly discussed. Models failed to extract many indirect descriptions of symptoms, like a patient saying they could only sleep for four hours (instead of using the word "insomnia"). LLMs are not trained to produce facts, but things which look like facts. The use of templates and rules can make them more reliable at extracting semantic information, but "confabulations" or "hallucinations" (convincing but wrong output) are an intrinsic part of the technology. Pricing With the exception of fully open-source programs, which are free, medical scribe computer programs are rented rather than sold ("software as a service"). Monthly fees vary from mid-two figures to four figures, in US dollars. Some companies run on a freemium model, where a certain number of transcriptions per month are free. Scribes that integrate into Electronic Health Records, removing the need for copy-pasting, typically cost more. Fully open-source scribes provide the software for free. The user can install it on hardware of their choice, or pay to have it installed. Some open-source scribes can be installed on the local device (that is, the one recording the audio) or on a local server (for instance, one serving a single clinic). They can typically be set not to send any information externally, and can indeed be used with no internet connection. Impact in healthcare AI medical scribes are transforming the healthcare industry by directly addressing some of the most pressing challenges clinicians face, especially the administrative burden that contributes to burnout. Reducing clinician burnout One of the most significant impacts of AI scribes is their ability to alleviate the overwhelming documentation workload that healthcare professionals face. By automating the transcription and summarization of consultations, AI scribes free up valuable time that clinicians would otherwise spend on administrative tasks. Studies have shown that the average clinician spends a significant portion of their workday on documentation, leading to fatigue and diminishing patient interaction. For example, in the UK's largest clinical rollout of ambient AI, 4 in 5 GPs using the tool said it saved them time, with the same number reporting that it enabled them to build a better rapport with patients. By automating these repetitive tasks, AI scribes create a healthier work-life balance for clinicians, allowing them to focus on patient care and reduce after-hours charting. This reduction in administrative burden directly contributes to lower levels of stress and burnout, a concern that has been exacerbated in healthcare settings in recent years. The ability to offload routine documentation tasks helps clinicians reclaim their time and mental energy, leading to improved overall job satisfaction. Enhancing job satisfaction In addition to reducing burnout, AI scribes also improve job satisfaction among clinicians by allowing them to focus on the aspects of their work that they find most meaningful: patient interaction and clinical decision-making. Clinicians have reported feeling more present with their patients, as they are no longer distracted by the need to constantly type or dictate notes during consultations. This shift allows for more meaningful conversations with patients, improving the quality of care provided. By streamlining workflows and making documentation more efficient, AI scribes also empower healthcare workers to take on more fulfilling tasks and foster a greater sense of purpose in the work they do. Improving healthcare worker conditions The rise of AI scribes is part of a broader trend of AI and automation being integrated into healthcare to improve worker conditions. AI's role is not just to replace human effort but to support it by allowing clinicians to focus on the core elements o
