ure of the data that has been either collected or sold. Education on tracking tools (such as cookies) presents a critical issue. If businesses or online services are unwilling to define cookies, or educate their users as to why they are being used, many may unwillingly accept them. The issue stemming from companies and other agencies which collect personal data and information is that they have now engaged in the practices of data brokering. Data brokers, such as Acxiom, collect users' information, and are known for often selling that information to third parties. While companies may disclose that they are collecting data or online activity from their users, it is usually not comprehensible by everyday users. It is difficult for everyday people to spot this disclosure, since it is hidden by jargon and writing most often understood by lawyers. This is now becoming a new source of revenue for companies. In terms of predictive policing, the proper use of crime data and the combination of offline practices and technology have also become the challenges for police institutions. Too much reliance on results brought up by big data may lead to the subjective judgement of police. It also may reduce the amount of real-time on site communication between local police officers and residents in particular areas, thus decreasing the opportunity for the police to investigate and cruise in local communities at a frequent basis. Secondly, data security still remains to be a huge dilemma, considering the access to crime data and the potential use of these data for negative purposes. Last but not least, discrimination towards certain community might be developed due to the findings of data analysis, which could lead to improper behaviours or over-reaction of surveillance. One of the major issues with dataveillance is the removal of a human actors from the loop. Computer systems which oversee data and construct representations. This can allow for greater risk of false representations being created, as they are based on the data that has been surveilled. Computer systems can only use the data they have, wand if this is not an accurate depiction of individuals or their situations then false representations can be created. Dataveillance is highly automated through computer systems which observe our interactions and activities. Highly automated systems and technology eliminates human understanding of our activities. Resistance With such an increase in data collection and surveillance, many individuals are now attempting to reduce the concerns which have risen alongside it. Countersurveillance is perhaps the most significant concept focused on the tactics to prevent dataveillance. There are various tools associated with the concept of countersurveillance, which disrupt the effectiveness and possibilities of dataveillance. Privacy-enhancing technologies, otherwise known as PETs, have been utilized by individuals to reduce data collection and decrease the possibility for dataveillance. PETs, such as adblocker, attempt to prevent other actors from collecting users data. In the case of adblock, the web browser extension is able to prevent the display of advertisements, which disrupts data collection about users online interactions. For businesses that may limit their opportunity to provide online users with tailored advertisements. Recently, the European Union demanded companies to indicate that their website uses cookies. This law has become basic practice by many online services and companies, however, education on tracking tools with the general public differs and therefore can prevent the effectiveness of this sort of ruling. However, many companies are launching new PETs initiatives within their products. For example, Mozilla's Firefox Focus in pre-enabled with customizable privacy features, which allows for better online privacy. A few of the tools featured in Firefox Focus are also mimicked by other web browsers such as Apple's Safari. Some of the v
