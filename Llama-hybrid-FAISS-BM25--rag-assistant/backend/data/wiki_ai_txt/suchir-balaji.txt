Suchir Balaji (November 21, 1998 – November 26, 2024) was an American artificial intelligence researcher who died several weeks after accusing his former employer, OpenAI, of violating United States copyright law. Balaji's death drew widespread attention due to claims of foul play made by his parents and others, as well as his purported whistleblower status. The San Francisco Police Department investigation found "no evidence of foul play," and the Chief Medical Examiner concluded the death was a suicide. Early life and education Balaji was born in Florida on November 21, 1998, into an Indian-American family. He grew up in Cupertino, California, where both of his parents worked in the technology sector. He started coding with the children's educational tool Scratch at the age of 11 and had built his own computer by the time he was 13. Balaji attended Monta Vista High School and was a finalist for the 2015–16 season of the United States of America Computing Olympiad. In 2017, he ranked 7th place in a Kaggle "Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge" sponsored by the TSA, for which he earned $100,000. He also won first place in both the 2017 Pacific Northwest Regional and Berkeley Programming Contests, and placed 31st in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest 2018 World Finals. He wrote a paper about chip design at 14 years old, and at 17, took a gap year to work as a software developer at Quora. Following his gap year, Balaji attended and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a BA in computer science. While in college, he interned at Scale AI in 2019, and subsequently joined OpenAI upon graduation in 2021. Career John Schulman, a cofounder of OpenAI, recruited Balaji right out of college. He spent nearly four years working at the company as an artificial intelligence researcher. Among other projects, he was involved in gathering and organizing the internet data used to train GPT-4, a language model used by the company's online chatbot, ChatGPT. He also worked on a precursor model called WebGPT. Writing in an online eulogy, Schulman claimed that "Suchir’s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn’t have succeeded without him." Balaji left the company in August 2024 after becoming disillusioned with its business practices, saying "If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company." After leaving OpenAI, he said he had been working on "personal projects." According to one interview with his mother, he planned to create a non-profit centered on machine learning and neurosciences. Balaji's mother also said that "He felt AI is a harm to humanity." New York Times article In an October 23, 2024 New York Times interview, Balaji alleged that products like ChatGPT violate United States copyright law because they are trained on the products of business competitors, and because the chatbots' outputs can then imitate and substitute those products. He said that ChatGPT and similar chatbots are ruining the commercial viability of the individuals and organizations who produced the data that the AI systems are trained on. The New York Times piece contains a summary of Balaji's essay "When does generative AI qualify for fair use?", published on his personal website earlier that week. In the essay, he mathematically analyzed the outputs of chatbots such as ChatGPT, and argued that they fail the four-factor test for determining fair use under U.S. copyright law. He further suggests that the argument could be applied to other generative AI products as well. At the time, OpenAI was being sued for copyright infringement by prominent authors and news publishers, including The New York Times. In a November 18, 2024 court filing, Balaji was identified by the New York Times's attorneys as one of a number of people who might have "relevant documents" in the copyright case against OpenAI. Several of the people named in the news service's court filings as potentially having relevant document
