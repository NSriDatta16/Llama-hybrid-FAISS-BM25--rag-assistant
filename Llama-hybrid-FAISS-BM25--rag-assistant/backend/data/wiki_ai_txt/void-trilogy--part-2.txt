while, Accelerator agents make a deal with Ethan, agreeing to give the Living Dream movement Ultra Drives to power their ships. Accelerator plans are halted when the Delivery Man, a Conservative party agent, destroys valuable FTL Drive tech. Troblum, an Accelerator physicist, also defects, further slowing the Accelerators plans. The Temporal Void The Temporal Void picks up after The Dreaming Void. The Intersolar Commonwealth faces mounting turmoil as the deadline for Living Dream's Pilgrimage into the Void approaches. An Ocisen Empire fleet advances on a mission of genocide, while an internecine war erupts among post-human factions over humanity's future. Amidst the chaos, investigator Paula Myo struggles to counter the increasingly desperate actions of various agents and factions. Relentless in her pursuit, she contends with adversaries from her distant past and colleagues of uncertain loyalty, all while racing against time. At the center of the unfolding crisis is Edeard the Waterwalker, a figure from the distant past who lived deep within the Void. As the messiah of Living Dream, his life—broadcast through visions—captivates and inspires billions. His story fuels the Pilgrimage's momentum, a force seemingly impossible to stop. As Edeard approaches his ultimate victory, the true nature of the Void is finally revealed. The Evolutionary Void The Evolutionary Void picks up after The Temporal Void. Exposed as the Second Dreamer, Araminta has become the target of a galaxy-wide search by government agent Paula Myo and the psychopath known as the Cat, along with others equally determined to prevent, or facilitate, the pilgrimage of the Living Dream cult into the heart of the Void. An indestructible microuniverse, the Void may contain paradise, as the cultists believe, but it is also a deadly threat. For the miraculous reality that exists inside its boundaries demands energy, energy drawn from everything outside those boundaries: from planets, stars, galaxies, and everything that lives, for the Pilgrimage will trigger a super-massive expansion of the Void. Meanwhile, the parallel story of Edeard, the Waterwalker, as told through a series of dreams communicated to the gaiafield via Inigo, the First Dreamer, continues to unfold. But the inspirational tale of this idealistic young man takes a darker and more troubling turn as he finds himself faced with powerful new enemies, and temptations more powerful still, to reach fulfilment in the end. Named a Silfen Friend like her ancestress Mellanie, Araminta chooses to face her unwanted responsibilities, with no guarantee of success or survival. She takes on the role of Second Dreamer to lead the first wave of Living Dream, 24 million people, into the Void, leaving everyone confused and lost by her actions. However, in actuality, she is playing a double game. Using her original body to lead the Living Dream as a diversion, she borrows one of her fiancé's (Mr. Bovey) bodies to set out to destroy the Void. She is able to connect with a Skylord and travel the Silfen Paths. With time running out, a repentant Inigo decides to release Edeard's final dream whose message is scarcely less dangerous than the pilgrimage promises to be, where perfection is achieved, so that nothing else is left to strive for and the human race in the Void has started to devolve. He goes to the Spike to meet Ozzie and stays there to meet with Araminta, who is using one of her fiancé's bodies, and Oscar. Third Dreamer Gore Burnelli has a plan to reason with the Heart, the core of the Void. He secures the help of the Delivery Man and travels to the Anomine homeworld to retrieve the mechanism that allowed them to go post-physical. He is able to connect with Justine, his daughter, who is currently in the Void, by way of Dreams. The monomaniacal Ilanthe, leader of the breakaway Accelerator Faction, seeks dominion in the Void. It is not Fusion with the Void to attain post-physical status that she wants, but to have control ove
