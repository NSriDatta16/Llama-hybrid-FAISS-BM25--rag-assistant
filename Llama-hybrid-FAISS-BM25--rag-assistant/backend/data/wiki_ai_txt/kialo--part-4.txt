lored questions to investigate and report on. It could be used for legal cases. Websites could embed read-only argument trees (or branches) from the site. More broadly, the site's content could be used for reflective brainstorming, and as a crowdsourcing resource for points to use in other media (e.g. long-form text). It enables detailed exploration of some theses or topics as the visual reasoning through tree-based structure allows for many levels of depth and for follow-up questions in the discussion tab of each claim. The founder stated that "The public debates are basically supposed to become a site where people can go and inform themselves. If a debate has over 2,000 unique arguments, it's going to be hard to find an argument that's not in there already. You can go there, similar to Wikipedia, and read." Research Kialo is a subject of research studies and its data has been used in research as there are datasets of its contents and the site allows exporting CSV files as well as crawling and filtering debates. Computational research on argumentation The platform has gained attention in computational research on argumentation because of its high-quality arguments and elaborate argument trees. Its data has been used to train and to evaluate natural language processing AI systems such as, most commonly, BERT and its variants. This includes argument extraction, conclusion generation, argument form quality assessment, machine argumentative debate generation or participation, surfacing most relevant previously overlooked viewpoints or arguments, argumentative writing support (incl. sentence attackability scores), automatic real-time evaluation of how truthful or convincing a sentence is (similar to fact-checking), language model fine tuning (incl. chatbots), argument impact prediction, argument classification and polarity prediction. Content analysis in social science and belief studies The contents can also be analyzed to e.g. show the most common Con rationale-types and factors in general, or reveal the most contested arguments where ratings diverge the most for a given topic. The site's founder proposed the types of arguments and ways people reason could be investigated as well as the "performance of Kialo versus long-form text in making people change their minds". One study suggests arguers seem to change their viewpoints more readily when a fact they believe has evidence and is undermined when compared to prior beliefs without any specified supporting data. The platform as a subject A study showed that when evaluating policies via Kialo debates, "reading comments from most to least liked, on average, displays more [winning arguments] than reading comments earliest first". Kialo has a set of different permissions that participants can have in a given debate. A preprint study makes suggestions regarding "interface design as a scalable solution to conflict management" to prevent adversarial beliefs and values of moderators to have negative impacts on the site. Reception, motivation and distinction from alternatives In 2022, MakeUseOf named the site as one of the five best "debate sites to civilly and logically argue online about opinions" and in 2019 as one of the "100+ best websites on the Internet". Online discourse quality The site aims to be a hub for civilized debate where shouting, rudeness or irrationality aren't allowed. This has been described as remarkable in an "age of Trumpian tweeting". The site's founder stated that he noticed early on that the Web became "ideal for bad conversations, with prominence given to the most outrageous conversations" and that he "wondered if there wasn't a better method of online discourse", claiming the site's mission is to "empower reason and to make the world more thoughtful", describing it as a "platform where people with opposing views can meet and understand each other's thinking". As of 2023, there are major concerns about online irrational or misinformation-fueled debate â€“ for ex
