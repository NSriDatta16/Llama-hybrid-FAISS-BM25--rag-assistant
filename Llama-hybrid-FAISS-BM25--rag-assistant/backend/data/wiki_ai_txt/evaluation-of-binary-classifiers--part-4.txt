nterpretation – as an odds ratio – and is prevalence-independent. Likelihood ratio is generally considered to be prevalence-independent and is easily interpreted as the multiplier to turn prior probabilities into posterior probabilities. An F-score is a combination of the precision and the recall, providing a single score. There is a one-parameter family of statistics, with parameter β, which determines the relative weights of precision and recall. The traditional or balanced F-score (F1 score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: F 1 = 2 ⋅ p r e c i s i o n ⋅ r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n + r e c a l l {\displaystyle F_{1}=2\cdot {\frac {\mathrm {precision} \cdot \mathrm {recall} }{\mathrm {precision} +\mathrm {recall} }}} . F-scores do not take the true negative rate into account and, therefore, are more suited to information retrieval and information extraction evaluation where the true negatives are innumerable. Instead, measures such as the phi coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient, informedness or Cohen's kappa may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier. As a correlation coefficient, the Matthews correlation coefficient is the geometric mean of the regression coefficients of the problem and its dual. The component regression coefficients of the Matthews correlation coefficient are markedness (deltap) and informedness (Youden's J statistic or deltap'). Choosing the appropriate form of evaluation Hand has highlighted the importance of choosing an appropriate method of evaluation. However, of the many different methods for evaluating the accuracy of a classifier, there is no general method for determining which method should be used in which circumstances. Different fields have taken different approaches. Cullerne Bown has distinguished three basic approaches to evaluation: ° Mathematical - such as the Matthews Correlation Coefficient, in which both kinds of error are axiomatically treated as equally problematic; ° Cost-benefit - in which a currency is adopted (e.g. money or Quality Adjusted Life Years) and values assigned to errors and successes on the basis of empirical measurement; ° Judgemental - in which a human judgement is made about the relative importance of the two kinds of error; typically this starts by adopting a pair of indicators such as sensitivity and specificity, precision and recall or positive predictive value and negative predictive value. In the judgemental case, he has provided a flow chart for determining which pair of indicators should be used when, and consequently how to choose between the Receiver Operating Characteristic and the Precision-Recall Curve. Evaluation of underlying technologies Often, we want to evaluate not a specific classifier working in a specific way but an underlying technology. Typically, the technology can be adjusted through altering the threshold of a score function, the threshold determining whether the result is a positive or negative. For such evaluations a useful single measure is "area under the ROC curve", AUC. Accuracy aside Apart from accuracy, binary classifiers can be assessed in many other ways, for example in terms of their speed or cost. Evaluation of probabilistic classifiers Probabilistic classification models go beyond providing binary outputs and instead produce probability scores for each class. These models are designed to assess the likelihood or probability of an instance belonging to different classes. In the context of evaluating probabilistic classifiers, alternative evaluation metrics have been developed to properly assess the performance of these models. These metrics take into account the probabilistic nature of the classifier's output and provide a more comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness in assigning accurate probabilities to different classes. These evaluation metrics aim to capture the degree of calibration, discrimination, and overall accuracy of the probabilistic classifier's predictions. In
