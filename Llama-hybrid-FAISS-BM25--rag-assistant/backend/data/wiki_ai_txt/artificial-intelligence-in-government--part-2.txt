a's trade mark search) Scheduling appointments Various governments, including those of Australia and Estonia, have implemented virtual assistants to aid citizens in navigating services, with applications ranging from tax inquiries to life-event registrations. Gerrymandering Gerrymandering is an insidious method of influencing political process. Depending on the objective of its use, the application of artificial intelligence to redraw districts based on voter distribution and demographic datasets can either contribute to impartiality, or sustain partisan gains for interested stakeholders in the election process. Other uses Other uses of AI in government include: Translation Language interpretation pioneered by the European Commission's Directorate General for Interpretation and Florika Fink-Hooijer. Drafting documents Potential benefits AI offers potential efficiencies and costs savings for the government. For example, Deloitte has estimated that automation could save US Government employees between 96.7 million to 1.2 billion hours a year, resulting in potential savings of between $3.3 billion to $41.1 billion a year. The Harvard Business Review has stated that while this may lead a government to reduce employee numbers, "Governments could instead choose to invest in the quality of its services. They can re-employ workers' time towards more rewarding work that requires lateral thinking, empathy, and creativity â€” all things at which humans continue to outperform even the most sophisticated AI program." Risks Risks associated with the use of AI in government include AI becoming susceptible to bias, a lack of transparency in how an AI application may make decisions, and the accountability for any such decisions. AI in governance and the economic world might make the market more difficult for companies to keep up with the increases in technology. Large U.S. companies like Apple and Google are able to dominate the market with their latest and most advanced technologies. This gives them an advantage over smaller companies that do not have the means of advancing as far in the digital technology fields with AI.
