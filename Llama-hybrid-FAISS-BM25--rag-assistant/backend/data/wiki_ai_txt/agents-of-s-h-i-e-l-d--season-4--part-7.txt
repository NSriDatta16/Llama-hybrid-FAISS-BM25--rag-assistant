 the season, McCreary used "searing synths" over the regular symphonic orchestra. Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins In March 2016, Tancharoen stated that there was a possibility the season could continue the story of Agent Carter (2015–2016) in some way, given it was not renewed for the 2016–17 season. Whedon added that "We are linked to them through history [but] whether or not we'll tell their stories remains to be seen." The Momentum Energy Labs group introduced in the season is eventually revealed to be a successor to the Isodyne Energy company from the second season of Agent Carter. The two companies are connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU, and deal with supernatural entities: Isodyne discovered the extra-dimensional Darkforce, while Momentum is shown experimenting on extra-dimensional energy using the Darkhold, the Book of Sins from the comics. In December, Whedon said that Peggy Carter "is a part of the universe, and she's a character we care about", and that there was a good chance of having bigger connections to her show moving forward after the Ghost Rider pod. The season's exploring of supernatural and mystical concepts ties-in with the release of Doctor Strange (2016), the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that "the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe is moving into new waters [with the upcoming release of Doctor Strange]. We felt that [Ghost Rider] was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift." Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes "very direct", and other times "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of [Doctor Strange], less an interweaving plot." He added, "Hopefully some of the questions that we're asking will be answered by [the film, which can] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange. On the season having a big crossover in early 2017 like previous seasons, Bell said that any crossover will not be as large scale as the first season crossover with Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), which changed the premise of the series, and noted that the MCU film being released at that time is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), which would be difficult to tie-in with as it is not set on Earth, and takes place earlier in the MCU continuity than the season is set. Marketing In July 2016, members of the cast and the executive producers attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the season. The trolly used to transport attendees at San Diego Comic-Con was covered in advertisements for the series, highlighting the addition of Ghost Rider. Also, Ghost Rider's 1969 Dodge Charger was revealed on the show floor. The first teaser trailer for the season was released in early September 2016, as "found footage" showing Ghost Rider's car "peeling out", followed shortly after by a teaser with actual footage from the series. The premiere episode "The Ghost" was first screened on September 19, 2016, and the episode "Uprising" was screened on October 7, when Gregg, Bennet, and Luna were promoting the series at New York Comic Con. A six-part web series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot, debuted on ABC.com on December 13, 2016. It follows Elena "Yo–Yo" Rodriguez on a secret mission, with Cordova-Buckley reprising her role, shortly before the start of season four. Gregg, O'Mara, Simmons, Bennet, Wen, De Caestecker and Henstridge all reprise their roles in the series. In March 2017, Marvel re-released previous posters for the series
