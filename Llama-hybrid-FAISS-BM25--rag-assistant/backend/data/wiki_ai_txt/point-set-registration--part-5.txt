 can be dualized into a sum of weighted least squares and a so-called outlier process function on the weights that determine the confidence of the optimization in each pair of measurements. Using Black-Rangarajan duality and GNC tailored for the Geman-McClure function, Zhou et al. developed the fast global registration algorithm that is robust against about 80 % {\displaystyle 80\%} outliers in the correspondences. More recently, Yang et al. showed that the joint use of GNC (tailored to the Geman-McClure function and the truncated least squares function) and Black-Rangarajan duality can lead to a general-purpose solver for robust registration problems, including point clouds and mesh registration. Certifiably robust registration Almost none of the robust registration algorithms mentioned above (except the BnB algorithm that runs in exponential-time in the worst case) comes with performance guarantees, which means that these algorithms can return completely incorrect estimates without notice. Therefore, these algorithms are undesirable for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. Very recently, Yang et al. has developed the first certifiably robust registration algorithm, named Truncated least squares Estimation And SEmidefinite Relaxation (TEASER). For point cloud registration, TEASER not only outputs an estimate of the transformation, but also quantifies the optimality of the given estimate. TEASER adopts the following truncated least squares (TLS) estimator:which is obtained by choosing the TLS robust cost function ρ ( x ) = min ( x 2 , c ¯ 2 ) {\displaystyle \rho (x)=\min(x^{2},{\bar {c}}^{2})} , where c ¯ 2 {\displaystyle {\bar {c}}^{2}} is a pre-defined constant that determines the maximum allowed residuals to be considered inliers. The TLS objective function has the property that for inlier correspondences ( ‖ s i − l R m i − t ‖ 2 2 / σ i 2 < c ¯ 2 {\displaystyle \Vert s_{i}-lRm_{i}-t\Vert _{2}^{2}/\sigma _{i}^{2}<{\bar {c}}^{2}} ), the usual least square penalty is applied; while for outlier correspondences ( ‖ s i − l R m i − t ‖ 2 2 / σ i 2 > c ¯ 2 {\displaystyle \Vert s_{i}-lRm_{i}-t\Vert _{2}^{2}/\sigma _{i}^{2}>{\bar {c}}^{2}} ), no penalty is applied and the outliers are discarded. If the TLS optimization (cb.7) is solved to global optimality, then it is equivalent to running Horn's method on only the inlier correspondences. However, solving (cb.7) is quite challenging due to its combinatorial nature. TEASER solves (cb.7) as follows : (i) It builds invariant measurements such that the estimation of scale, rotation and translation can be decoupled and solved separately, a strategy that is inspired by the original Horn's method; (ii) The same TLS estimation is applied for each of the three sub-problems, where the scale TLS problem can be solved exactly using an algorithm called adaptive voting, the rotation TLS problem can relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP) where the relaxation is exact in practice, even with large amount of outliers; the translation TLS problem can solved using component-wise adaptive voting. A fast implementation leveraging GNC is open-sourced here. In practice, TEASER can tolerate more than 99 % {\displaystyle 99\%} outlier correspondences and runs in milliseconds. In addition to developing TEASER, Yang et al. also prove that, under some mild conditions on the point cloud data, TEASER's estimated transformation has bounded errors from the ground-truth transformation. Simultaneous pose and correspondence registration Iterative closest point The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was introduced by Besl and McKay. The algorithm performs rigid registration in an iterative fashion by alternating in (i) given the transformation, finding the closest point in S {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}} for every point in M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}} ; and (ii) given the correspondences, finding the best rigid transformation by solving the least squares problem (cb.2). As such, it works b
