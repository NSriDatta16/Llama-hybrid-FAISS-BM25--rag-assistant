le Pony: Friendship Is Magic using 15.ai and pitched them up to make them sound unrecognizable, a violation of 15.ai's terms of service, which explicitly prohibited commercial use and required proper attribution. When confronted with evidence, Voiceverse stated that their marketing team had used 15.ai without proper attribution while rushing to create a demo. In response, 15 tweeted "Go fuck yourself," which went viral, amassing hundreds of thousands of retweets and likes on Twitter in support of the developer. The tweets showcasing the stolen voices were subsequently deleted. Aftermath The controversy raised concerns about NFT projects, which, according to critics, were frequently associated with intellectual property theft and questionable business practices. The incident was documented in the AI Incident Database (AIID) and the AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies (AIAAIC) repository, and was also featured in Molly White's Web3 Is Going Just Great website. Pavel Khibchenko of Skillbox listed the incident as an example of fraud in NFTs. Voice actor and YouTuber Yong Yea criticized voice NFTs for their potential impact on the voice acting industry and stated in a YouTube video that Voiceverse deliberately plagiarized 15.ai's superior technology to falsely market voice NFTs. In a 2024 class action lawsuit filed against LOVO, Inc., the parent company of Voiceverse, court documents cited the company's prior theft of 15.ai's technology as part of the case. Voice actor Troy Baker, who had announced his partnership with Voiceverse alongside their promotion of the stolen AI voices, faced mounting criticism for supporting an NFT project and for his confrontational announcement tone. Following continued backlash and the plagiarism revelation, Baker acknowledged that his original tweet was "antagonistic" and on January 31, announced that he would discontinue his partnership with Voiceverse. 2022–present: Inactivity and revival In September 2022, 15.ai was taken offline due to legal issues surrounding artificial intelligence and copyright. In a post on Twitter, 15 suggested a future version that would better address copyright concerns from the outset. During this time, voice AI startups continued to cite 15.ai as a major influence to the field. On May 18, 2025, 15 launched 15.dev as the official sequel to 15.ai. Fandom news site Equestria Daily reported that the website included "almost every voiced pony in the show" with "a dropdown for various emotions you want to generate." Features 15.ai is non-commercial, has no advertisements, generates no revenue, and operates without requiring user registration or accounts. Users are able to generate speech by inputting text and selecting a character voice, with optional parameters for emotional contextualizers and phonetic transcriptions. Each request produces three audio variations with distinct emotional deliveries. Characters available included multiple characters from Team Fortress 2 and My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, including the Mane Six and Derpy Hooves; GLaDOS, Wheatley, and the Sentry Turret from the Portal series; SpongeBob SquarePants; Kyu Sugardust from HuniePop, Rise Kujikawa from Persona 4; Daria Morgendorffer and Jane Lane from Daria; Carl Brutananadilewski from Aqua Teen Hunger Force; Steven Universe from Steven Universe; Sans from Undertale; Madeline and multiple characters from Celeste; the Tenth Doctor Who; the Narrator from The Stanley Parable; and HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Silent characters like Chell and Gordon Freeman were able to be selected and would emit silent audio files when any text was submitted. Characters from Undertale and Celeste did not produce spoken words but instead generated their games' distinctive beeps when text was entered. From 2020, 15.ai has generated audio at 44.1 kHz sampling rate—higher than the 16 kHz standard used by most deep learning text-to-speech systems of that period. This higher fidelity creates
