Estonia In Estonia, the digital transformation dubbed as the 4th Industrial Revolution by Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum in 2015 started with the restoration of independence in 1991. Although a latecomer to the information revolution due to 50 years of Soviet occupation, Estonia leapfrogged to the digital era, while skipping the analogue connections almost completely. The early decisions made by Prime Minister Mart Laar on the course of the country's economic development led to the establishment of what is today known as e-Estonia, one of the worlds most digitally advanced nations.

A nationwide survey of 577 lecturers in Technical Engineering at 52 TVET college campuses across South Africa found that 52.3% of participants were unaware of technological advancements in their area of specialization and their potential impact on technical training. These findings indicate that South African TVET lecturers have limited awareness of the technological advancements needed to participate effectively in the 4IR era. Accordingly, South African Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande, placed the upskilling of TVET lecturers' 4IR-related skills high on the ministry's agenda.
