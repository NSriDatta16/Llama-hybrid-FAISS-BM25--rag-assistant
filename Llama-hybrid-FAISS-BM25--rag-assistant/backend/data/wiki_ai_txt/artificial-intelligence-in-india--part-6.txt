 discussed responsible AI, data governance, and the future of work. Other Indian agencies, such as the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), are also working on AI policies. BIS has established a committee to propose draft standards for AI, focusing on safety, reliability, and ethical considerations. India has not yet enacted specific AI regulations. However, the government has introduced measures to promote innovation and address ethical concerns and risks associated with AI. These efforts aim to support the growth of India's AI ecosystem and ensure responsible AI deployment. India has launched an AI Data Bank aimed at fostering innovation and enhancing national security. This initiative is designed to harness the power of artificial intelligence by providing a centralized repository of data that can be utilized across various sectors, including governance, business, healthcare, education, and space exploration. By facilitating access to crucial information, the AI Data Bank will support research and development efforts, stimulate technological advancements, and bolster the countryâ€™s security framework. This strategic move underscores India's commitment to leveraging AI for national progress and safeguarding its interests in an increasingly digital world. Bharat GPT initiative The Bharat GPT is a non-profit initiative, started in February 2023. The goal is to develop India focused multilingual, multimodal large language models and generative pre-trained transformer. Together with the applications and implementation frameworks, the Bharat GPT Consortium intends to publish a series of foundation models in order to meet the needs of developers and businesses. The Bharat GPT Consortium was established in 2022 under the public-private partnership with IIT Bombay, Jio Platforms, NASSCOM, Seetha Mahalaxmi Healthcare, Digital India Bhashini Division (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology), IIT Madras, IIT Mandi, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Kanpur, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and Indian Institute of Management Indore as members. The Bharat GPT development team is led by Professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan of IIT Bombay as principal investigator, with support from Professor Mohan Raghavan and Professor Maunendra Sankar Desarkar of IIT Hyderabad, Professor Rohit Saluja of IIT Mandi, Professor V Kamakoti of IIT Madras, Professor Arnab Bhattacharya of IIT Kanpur, Professor Kshitij Jadhav of IIT Bombay, Professor Aditya Maheshwari of IIM Indore, and Professor Ravi Kiran of IIIT-Hyderabad. The text-based foundation model will be released first, followed by speech and video models. In addition to licensing commercial use, the effort has been open-sourcing a large portion of its work. Bharat GPT is anticipated to be activated by speech and gesture recognition. On December 27, 2023, Akash Ambani announced that Jio Platforms and IIT Bombay were collaborating on Bharat GPT program. Jio Platforms will assist Bharat GPT with specialized downstream telecom and retail applications by developing smaller, customized models. By investigating the potential of AI to foster innovation across a range of goods and services, Jio hopes to achieve its larger goal of establishing a whole ecosystem of growth through Bharat GPT. Bharat GPT Consortium is assisting in the interpretation of official documents, such as court orders, in close collaboration with the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances. India's first ChatGPT-style service, will be launched in March 2024 by Bharat GPT Consortium, with assistance from the Department of Science and Technology, and Reliance Industries. The four primary areas in which Bharat GPT sees its model operating are healthcare, financial services, governance, and education, supporting 11 Indian languages. Hanooman series Seetha Mahalaxmi Healthcare (SML) revealed the Hanooman series LLM in February 2024 in collaboration with the Bharat GPT Consortium. Among the Hanooman series, the f
