 it's best to respect them. For example, code files are best chunked and vectorized as whole functions or classes. HTML files should leave <table> or base64 encoded <img> elements intact. Similar considerations should be taken for pdf files. Libraries such as Unstructured or Langchain can assist with this method. Hybrid search Sometimes vector database searches can miss key facts needed to answer a user's question. One way to mitigate this is to do a traditional text search, add those results to the text chunks linked to the retrieved vectors from the vector search, and feed the combined hybrid text into the language model for generation. Evaluation and benchmarks RAG systems are commonly evaluated using benchmarks designed to test retrievability, retrieval accuracy and generative quality. Popular datasets include BEIR, a suite of information retrieval tasks across diverse domains, and Natural Questions or Google QA for open-domain QA. Challenges RAG does not prevent hallucinations in LLMs. According to Ars Technica, "It is not a direct solution because the LLM can still hallucinate around the source material in its response." While RAG improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), it does not eliminate all challenges. One limitation is that while RAG reduces the need for frequent model retraining, it does not remove it entirely. Additionally, LLMs may struggle to recognize when they lack sufficient information to provide a reliable response. Without specific training, models may generate answers even when they should indicate uncertainty. According to IBM, this issue can arise when the model lacks the ability to assess its own knowledge limitations. RAG systems may retrieve factually correct but misleading sources, leading to errors in interpretation. In some cases, an LLM may extract statements from a source without considering its context, resulting in an incorrect conclusion. Additionally, when faced with conflicting information RAG models may struggle to determine which source is accurate. The worst case outcome of this limitation is that the model may combine details from multiple sources producing responses that merge outdated and updated information in a misleading manner. According to the MIT Technology Review, these issues occur because RAG systems may misinterpret the data they retrieve. == References ==
