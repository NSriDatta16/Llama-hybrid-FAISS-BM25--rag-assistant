ld prevent high-consequence failures in the future. "Inner" interpretability research aims to make ML models less opaque. One goal of this research is to identify what the internal neuron activations represent. For example, researchers identified a neuron in the CLIP artificial intelligence system that responds to images of people in Spider-Man costumes, sketches of Spider-Man, and the word 'spider'. It also involves explaining connections between these neurons or 'circuits'. For example, researchers have identified pattern-matching mechanisms in transformer attention that may play a role in how language models learn from their context. "Inner interpretability" has been compared to neuroscience. In both cases, the goal is to understand what is going on in an intricate system, though ML researchers have the benefit of being able to take perfect measurements and perform arbitrary ablations. Detecting trojans Machine learning models can potentially contain "trojans" or "backdoors": vulnerabilities that malicious actors maliciously build into an AI system. For example, a trojaned facial recognition system could grant access when a specific piece of jewelry is in view; or a trojaned autonomous vehicle may function normally until a specific trigger is visible. Note that an adversary must have access to the system's training data in order to plant a trojan. This might not be difficult to do with some large models like CLIP or GPT-3 as they are trained on publicly available internet data. Researchers were able to plant a trojan in an image classifier by changing just 300 out of 3 million of the training images. In addition to posing a security risk, researchers have argued that trojans provide a concrete setting for testing and developing better monitoring tools. A 2024 research paper by Anthropic showed that large language models could be trained with persistent backdoors. These "sleeper agent" models could be programmed to generate malicious outputs (such as vulnerable code) after a specific date, while behaving normally beforehand. Standard AI safety measures, such as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning and adversarial training, failed to remove these backdoors. Alignment Systemic safety and sociotechnical factors It is common for AI risks (and technological risks more generally) to be categorized as misuse or accidents. Some scholars have suggested that this framework falls short. For example, the Cuban Missile Crisis was not clearly an accident or a misuse of technology. Policy analysts Zwetsloot and Dafoe wrote, "The misuse and accident perspectives tend to focus only on the last step in a causal chain leading up to a harm: that is, the person who misused the technology, or the system that behaved in unintended ways... Often, though, the relevant causal chain is much longer." Risks often arise from 'structural' or 'systemic' factors such as competitive pressures, diffusion of harms, fast-paced development, high levels of uncertainty, and inadequate safety culture. In the broader context of safety engineering, structural factors like 'organizational safety culture' play a central role in the popular STAMP risk analysis framework. Inspired by the structural perspective, some researchers have emphasized the importance of using machine learning to improve sociotechnical safety factors, for example, using ML for cyber defense, improving institutional decision-making, and facilitating cooperation. Others have emphasized the importance of involving both AI practitioners and domain experts in the design process to address structural vulnerabilities. Cyber defense Some scholars are concerned that AI will exacerbate the already imbalanced game between cyber attackers and cyber defenders. This would increase 'first strike' incentives and could lead to more aggressive and destabilizing attacks. In order to mitigate this risk, some have advocated for an increased emphasis on cyber defense. In addition, software security is essenti
