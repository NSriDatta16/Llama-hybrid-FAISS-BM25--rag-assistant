hrm {\sim } B).} Additional t-norm conjunctions and residual implications. Some expressively strong t-norm logics, for instance the logic ŁΠ, have more than one strong conjunction or residual implication in their language. In the standard real-valued semantics, all such strong conjunctions are realized by different t-norms and the residual implications by their residua. Well-formed formulae of propositional t-norm logics are defined from propositional variables (usually countably many) by the above logical connectives, as usual in propositional logics. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence: Unary connectives (bind most closely) Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely) First-order variants of t-norm logics employ the usual logical language of first-order logic with the above propositional connectives and the following quantifiers: General quantifier ∀ {\displaystyle \forall } Existential quantifier ∃ {\displaystyle \exists } The first-order variant of a propositional t-norm logic L {\displaystyle L} is usually denoted by L ∀ . {\displaystyle L\forall .} Semantics Algebraic semantics is predominantly used for propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, with three main classes of algebras with respect to which a t-norm fuzzy logic L {\displaystyle L} is complete: General semantics, formed of all L {\displaystyle L} -algebras — that is, all algebras for which the logic is sound. Linear semantics, formed of all linear L {\displaystyle L} -algebras — that is, all L {\displaystyle L} -algebras whose lattice order is linear. Standard semantics, formed of all standard L {\displaystyle L} -algebras — that is, all L {\displaystyle L} -algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0, 1] with the usual order. In standard L {\displaystyle L} -algebras, the interpretation of strong conjunction is a left-continuous t-norm and the interpretation of most propositional connectives is determined by the t-norm (hence the names t-norm-based logics and t-norm L {\displaystyle L} -algebras, which is also used for L {\displaystyle L} -algebras on the lattice [0, 1]). In t-norm logics with additional connectives, however, the real-valued interpretation of the additional connectives may be restricted by further conditions for the t-norm algebra to be called standard: for example, in standard L ∼ {\displaystyle L_{\sim }} -algebras of the logic L {\displaystyle L} with involution, the interpretation of the additional involutive negation ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } is required to be the standard involution f ∼ ( x ) = 1 − x , {\displaystyle f_{\sim }(x)=1-x,} rather than other involutions that can also interpret ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } over t-norm L ∼ {\displaystyle L_{\sim }} -algebras. In general, therefore, the definition of standard t-norm algebras has to be explicitly given for t-norm logics with additional connectives.
