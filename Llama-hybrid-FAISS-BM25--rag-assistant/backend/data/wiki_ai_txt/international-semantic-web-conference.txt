The International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) is a series of academic conferences and the premier international forum for the Semantic Web, Linked Data and Knowledge Graph Community. Here, scientists, industry specialists, and practitioners meet to discuss the future of practical, scalable, user-friendly, and game changing solutions. Its proceedings are published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science by Springer-Verlag. The annual ISWC conference series was established in 2002 by the Semantic Web Science Association (SWSA) after the success of the Semantic Web Working Symposium, a three-day conference held at Stanford University in the summer of 2001. SWSA continues to oversee the ISWC conference and choose organizers for future ISWC instances based on bids. Overview == References ==
