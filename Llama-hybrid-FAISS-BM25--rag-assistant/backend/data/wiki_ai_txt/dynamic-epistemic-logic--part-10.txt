that players A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} show their card to each other. As it turns out, C {\displaystyle C} noticed that A {\displaystyle A} showed her card to B {\displaystyle B} but did not notice that B {\displaystyle B} did so to A {\displaystyle A} . Players A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} know this. This event is represented below in the event model ( E , e ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {E}},e)} . The possible event e {\displaystyle e} corresponds to the actual event ‘players A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} show their and cards respectively to each other’ (with precondition A ∧ B {\displaystyle {\color {red}{A}}\land {\color {green}{B}}} ), f {\displaystyle f} stands for the event ‘player A {\displaystyle A} shows her green card’ (with precondition A {\displaystyle {\color {green}{A}}} ) and g {\displaystyle g} stands for the atomic event ‘player A {\displaystyle A} shows her red card’ (with precondition A {\displaystyle {\color {red}{A}}} ). Players A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} show their cards to each other, players A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} know this and consider it possible, while player C {\displaystyle C} considers possible that player A {\displaystyle A} shows her red card and also considers possible that player A {\displaystyle A} shows her green card, since he does not know her card. In fact, that is all that player C {\displaystyle C} considers possible because she did not notice that B {\displaystyle B} showed her card. Another example of event model is given below. This second example corresponds to the event whereby Player A {\displaystyle A} shows her red card publicly to everybody. Player A {\displaystyle A} shows her red card, players A {\displaystyle A} , B {\displaystyle B} and C {\displaystyle C} ‘know’ it, players A {\displaystyle A} , B {\displaystyle B} and C {\displaystyle C} ‘know’ that each of them ‘knows’ it, etc. In other words, there is common knowledge among players A {\displaystyle A} , B {\displaystyle B} and C {\displaystyle C} that player A {\displaystyle A} shows her red card. Product Update The DEL product update is defined below. This update yields a new pointed epistemic model ( M , w ) ⊗ ( E , e ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},w)\otimes ({\mathcal {E}},e)} representing how the new situation which was previously represented by ( M , w ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},w)} is perceived by the agents after the occurrence of the event represented by ( E , e ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {E}},e)} . Let M = ( W , R 1 , … , R n , I ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}=(W,R_{1},\ldots ,R_{n},I)} be an epistemic model and let E = ( W α , R 1 α , … , R n α , I α ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=(W^{\alpha },R_{1}^{\alpha },\ldots ,R_{n}^{\alpha },I^{\alpha })} be an event model. The product update of M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}} and E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} is the epistemic model M ⊗ E = ( W ⊗ , R 1 ⊗ , … , R n ⊗ , I ⊗ ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}\otimes {\mathcal {\mathcal {E}}}=(W^{\otimes },R_{1}^{\otimes },\ldots ,R_{n}^{\otimes },I^{\otimes })} defined as follows: for all v ∈ W {\displaystyle v\in W} and all f ∈ W α {\displaystyle f\in W^{\alpha }} , If w ∈ W {\displaystyle w\in W} and e ∈ W α {\displaystyle e\in W^{\alpha }} are such that M , w ⊨ I α ( e ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}},w\models I^{\alpha }(e)} then ( M , w ) ⊗ ( E , e ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},w)\otimes ({\mathcal {E}},e)} denotes the pointed epistemic model ( M ⊗ E , ( w , e ) ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}}\otimes {\mathcal {E}},(w,e))} . This definition of the product update is conceptually grounded. Card Example: As a result of the first event described above (Players A {\displaystyle A} and B {\displaystyle B} show their cards to each other in front of player C {\displaystyle C} ), the agents update their beliefs. We get the situation represented in the pointed epistemic model ( M , w ) ⊗ ( E , e ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},w
