mals, and artificial neural networks use past learning in present situations of learning if the conditions in the situations are regarded as similar. generalization error For supervised learning applications in machine learning and statistical learning theory, generalization error (also known as the out-of-sample error or the risk) is a measure of how accurately a learning algorithm is able to predict outcomes for previously unseen data. generative adversarial network (GAN) A class of machine learning systems. Two neural networks contest with each other in a zero-sum game framework. generative artificial intelligence Generative artificial intelligence is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics, typically using transformer-based deep neural networks. generative pretrained transformer (GPT) A large language model based on the transformer architecture that generates text. It is first pretrained to predict the next token in texts (a token is typically a word, subword, or punctuation). After their pretraining, GPT models can generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the token that they would expect to follow. GPT models are usually also fine-tuned, for example with reinforcement learning from human feedback to reduce hallucination or harmful behaviour, or to format the output in a conversationnal format. genetic algorithm (GA) A metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. genetic operator An operator used in genetic algorithms to guide the algorithm towards a solution to a given problem. There are three main types of operators (mutation, crossover and selection), which must work in conjunction with one another in order for the algorithm to be successful. glowworm swarm optimization A swarm intelligence optimization algorithm based on the behaviour of glowworms (also known as fireflies or lightning bugs). gradient boosting A machine learning technique based on boosting in a functional space, where the target is pseudo-residuals instead of residuals as in traditional boosting. graph (abstract data type) In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics; specifically, the field of graph theory. graph (discrete mathematics) In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called an arc or line). graph database (GDB) A database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship), which directly relates data items in the store a collection of nodes of data and edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships within a graph database is fast because they are perpetually stored within the database itself. Relationships can be intuitively visualized using graph databases, making it useful for heavily inter-connected data. graph theory The study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. graph traversal Als
