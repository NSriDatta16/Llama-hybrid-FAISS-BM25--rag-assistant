ad trend. Many different players in the semiconductor world are helping to create and use these technologies. This includes companies that sell EDA tools and develop software with AI, semiconductor design companies and foundries that use these tools to make and manufacture chips, and very large technology companies that might design their own chips using AI driven methods. EDA tool vendors Major EDA companies are leading the way in adding AI to their tool suites to handle growing design complexity. Their strategies often involve creating complete AI platforms. These platforms use machine learning in many different steps of the design and manufacturing process. Synopsys provides a set of tools in its Synopsys.ai initiative. This initiative aims to improve design metrics and productivity from the system architecture stage all the way to manufacturing. A main component uses reinforcement learning to improve power, performance, and area (PPA) during the process that goes from the initial design description to the final manufacturing file (DSO.ai). Other parts use AI to speed up verification, optimize test pattern generation for manufacturing, and improve the design of analog circuits in different conditions. Cadence has created its Cadence.AI platform. The company says it uses "agentic AI workflows" to cut down on the design engineering time for complex SoCs. Key platforms use AI to optimize the digital design flow (Cadence Cerebrus), improve verification productivity (Verisium), design custom and analog ICs (Virtuoso Studio), and analyze systems at a high level (Optimality Intelligent System Explorer). Siemens EDA directs its AI strategy at improving its current software engines and workflows to give engineers better design insights. AI is used inside its Calibre platform to speed up manufacturing tasks like Design for Manufacturability (DFM), Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET), and Optical Proximity Correction (OPC). AI is also used in its Questa suite to close coverage faster in digital verification and in its Solido suite to lessen the characterization work for analog designs. Semiconductor design and FPGA companies Companies that design semiconductor chips, like FPGAs and adaptive SoCs, are major users and creators of EDA methods that are improved with AI to make their design processes more efficient. AMD offers a suite of tools for its adaptive hardware that uses different AI approaches. The AMD Vitis platform is an environment for developing designs on its SoCs and FPGAs. It includes a component, Vitis AI, which has libraries and pre trained models to speed up AI inference. The related Vivado Design Suite uses machine learning methods to improve the quality of results (QoR) and help with achieving timing goals and estimating power for the hardware design. NVIDIA has a specific Design Automation Research group to look into new EDA methods. The group focuses on EDA tools that are accelerated by GPUs and using AI methods like Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning for EDA problems. One example of their research is AutoDMP, a tool that automates macro placement using multi objective Bayesian optimization and a GPU accelerated placer. Cloud providers and hyperscalers Large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies have two main roles. They provide the powerful and flexible computing power needed to run difficult AI and EDA tasks, and many also design their own custom silicon, often using AI in their internal design processes. Google Cloud, for example, provides a platform that supports EDA workloads with flexible computing resources, special storage solutions, and high speed networking. At the same time, Google's internal chip design teams have contributed to EDA research, especially by using reinforcement learning for physical design tasks like chip floorplanning. IBM provides infrastructure on its cloud platform that is focused on EDA, with a strong emphasis on secure environments for foundries and high p
