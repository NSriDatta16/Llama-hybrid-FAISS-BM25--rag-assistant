GitHub Copilot is a code completion and programming AI-assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI that assists users of Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs) by autocompleting code. Currently available by subscription to individual developers and to businesses, the generative artificial intelligence software was first announced by GitHub on 29 June 2021. Users can choose the large language model used for generation. History On June 29, 2021, GitHub announced GitHub Copilot for technical preview in the Visual Studio Code development environment. GitHub Copilot was released as a plugin on the JetBrains marketplace on October 29, 2021. October 27, 2021, GitHub released the GitHub Copilot Neovim plugin as a public repository. GitHub announced Copilot's availability for the Visual Studio 2022 IDE on March 29, 2022. On June 21, 2022, GitHub announced that Copilot was out of "technical preview", and is available as a subscription-based service for individual developers. GitHub Copilot is the evolution of the "Bing Code Search" plugin for Visual Studio 2013, which was a Microsoft Research project released in February 2014. This plugin integrated with various sources, including MSDN and Stack Overflow, to provide high-quality contextually relevant code snippets in response to natural language queries. Features When provided with a programming problem in natural language, Copilot is capable of generating solution code. It is also able to describe input code in English and translate code between programming languages. Copilot enables developers to utilize a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading LLM providers, including various versions of OpenAI's GPT (including GPT-5 and GPT-5 Mini), Anthropic's Sonnet, and Google's Gemini. According to its website, GitHub Copilot includes assistive features for programmers, such as the conversion of code comments to runnable code, and autocomplete for chunks of code, repetitive sections of code, and entire methods and/or functions. GitHub reports that Copilot's autocomplete feature is accurate roughly half of the time; with some Python function header code, for example, Copilot correctly autocompleted the rest of the function body code 43% of the time on the first try and 57% of the time after ten attempts. GitHub states that Copilot's features allow programmers to navigate unfamiliar coding frameworks and languages by reducing the amount of time users spend reading documentation. Implementation GitHub Copilot was initially powered by the OpenAI Codex, which is a modified, production version of GPT-3. The Codex model is additionally trained on gigabytes of source code in a dozen programming languages. Copilot's OpenAI Codex was trained on a selection of the English language, public GitHub repositories, and other publicly available source code. This includes a filtered dataset of 159 gigabytes of Python code sourced from 54 million public GitHub repositories. OpenAI's GPT-3 is licensed exclusively to Microsoft, GitHub's parent company. In November 2023, Copilot Chat was updated to use OpenAI's GPT-4 model. In 2024, Copilot began allowing users to choose between different large language models, such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5. On 6 February 2025, GitHub announced "agent mode", which is a more autonomous mode of operation for the Copilot. Given a programming task, it attempts to accomplish it by executing commands on a Visual Studio instance on the user's computer. The agent mode can connect to different LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash. On 17 May 2025, GitHub announced "coding agent", which is a more autonomous mode of operation for the Copilot. The user would assign a task or issue to Copilot, which would then initialize a development environment in the cloud (powered by GitHub Actions) and perform the request. It would compose a draft pull request and pushes commits to the draft as it wor
