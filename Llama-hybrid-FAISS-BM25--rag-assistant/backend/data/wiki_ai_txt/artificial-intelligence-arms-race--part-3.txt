ility to track, tag and spy on targets without human involvement. Initially the effort was led by Robert O. Work who was concerned about China's military use of the emerging technology. Reportedly, Pentagon development stops short of acting as an AI weapons system capable of firing on self-designated targets. The project was established in a memo by the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense on 26 April 2017. Also known as the Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team, it is, according to Lt. Gen. of the United States Air Force Jack Shanahan in November 2017, a project "designed to be that pilot project, that pathfinder, that spark that kindles the flame front of artificial intelligence across the rest of the [Defense] Department". Its chief, U.S. Marine Corps Col. Drew Cukor, said: "People and computers will work symbiotically to increase the ability of weapon systems to detect objects." Project Maven has been noted by allies, such as Australia's Ian Langford, for the ability to identify adversaries by harvesting data from sensors on UAVs and satellite. At the second Defense One Tech Summit in July 2017, Cukor also said that the investment in a "deliberate workflow process" was funded by the Department [of Defense] through its "rapid acquisition authorities" for about "the next 36 months". Project Artemis The U.S. Department of Defense is partnering with Ukraine on "Project Artemis" to develop advanced drones that can withstand electronic warfare, blending Ukrainian simplicity and adaptability with American precision. Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Ukraine has emerged as a leader in drone production and warfare, creating cost-effective systems that challenge traditional approaches. Countries like Turkey, China, and Iran are also producing affordable drones, reducing America's monopoly and reshaping warfare dynamics. U.S. efforts are focused on integrating AI, drone swarm technology, and hybrid drone systems to maintain military dominance. The democratization of drone technology raises issues, such as autonomous decision-making, counter-drone defenses, and dual-use concerns, that challenge ethical and security norms. Stargate Project The Stargate Project is a joint venture announced in 2025 by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, U.S. President Donald Trump, Oracle Corporation, MGX, SoftBank Group, and other partners. The initiative aims to develop large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the United States, with a projected $500 billion investment by 2029. The project focuses on building advanced data centers, custom AI hardware, and sustainable energy systems, while also supporting research, workforce development, and national AI competitiveness. It is considered an effort to position the U.S. as a global leader in AI technology. The program has been compared to the Manhattan Project because of its large scale. China China is pursuing a strategic policy of military-civil fusion on AI for global technological supremacy. According to a February 2019 report by Gregory C. Allen of the Center for a New American Security, China's leadership – including General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping – believes that being at the forefront in AI technology is critical to the future of global military and economic power competition. Chinese military officials have said that their goal is to incorporate commercial AI technology to "narrow the gap between the Chinese military and global advanced powers." The close ties between Silicon Valley and China, and the open nature of the American research community, has made the West's most advanced AI technology easily available to China; in addition, Chinese industry has numerous home-grown AI accomplishments of its own, such as Baidu passing a notable Chinese-language speech recognition capability benchmark in 2015. As of 2017, Beijing's roadmap aims to create a $150 billion AI industry by 2030. Before 2013, Chinese defense procurement was mainly restricted to a few conglomerates; h
