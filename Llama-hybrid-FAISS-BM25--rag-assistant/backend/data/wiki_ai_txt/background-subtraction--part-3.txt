, as follows: μ t = ρ I t + ( 1 − ρ ) μ t − 1 {\displaystyle \mu _{t}=\rho I_{t}+(1-\rho )\mu _{t-1}} σ t 2 = d 2 ρ + ( 1 − ρ ) σ t − 1 2 {\displaystyle \sigma _{t}^{2}=d^{2}\rho +(1-\rho )\sigma _{t-1}^{2}} d = | ( I t − μ t ) | {\displaystyle d=|(I_{t}-\mu _{t})|} Where ρ {\displaystyle \rho } determines the size of the temporal window that is used to fit the pdf (usually ρ = 0.01 {\displaystyle \rho =0.01} ) and d {\displaystyle d} is the Euclidean distance between the mean and the value of the pixel. We can now classify a pixel as background if its current intensity lies within some confidence interval of its distribution's mean: | ( I t − μ t ) | σ t > k ⟶ foreground {\displaystyle {\frac {|(I_{t}-\mu _{t})|}{\sigma _{t}}}>k\longrightarrow {\text{foreground}}} | ( I t − μ t ) | σ t ≤ k ⟶ background {\displaystyle {\frac {|(I_{t}-\mu _{t})|}{\sigma _{t}}}\leq k\longrightarrow {\text{background}}} where the parameter k {\displaystyle k} is a free threshold (usually k = 2.5 {\displaystyle k=2.5} ). A larger value for k {\displaystyle k} allows for more dynamic background, while a smaller k {\displaystyle k} increases the probability of a transition from background to foreground due to more subtle changes. In a variant of the method, a pixel's distribution is only updated if it is classified as background. This is to prevent newly introduced foreground objects from fading into the background. The update formula for the mean is changed accordingly: μ t = M μ t − 1 + ( 1 − M ) ( I t ρ + ( 1 − ρ ) μ t − 1 ) {\displaystyle \mu _{t}=M\mu _{t-1}+(1-M)(I_{t}\rho +(1-\rho )\mu _{t-1})} where M = 1 {\displaystyle M=1} when I t {\displaystyle I_{t}} is considered foreground and M = 0 {\displaystyle M=0} otherwise. So when M = 1 {\displaystyle M=1} , that is, when the pixel is detected as foreground, the mean will stay the same. As a result, a pixel, once it has become foreground, can only become background again when the intensity value gets close to what it was before turning foreground. This method, however, has several issues: It only works if all pixels are initially background pixels (or foreground pixels are annotated as such). Also, it cannot cope with gradual background changes: If a pixel is categorized as foreground for a too long period of time, the background intensity in that location might have changed (because illumination has changed etc.). As a result, once the foreground object is gone, the new background intensity might not be recognized as such anymore. Background mixture models Mixture of Gaussians method approaches by modelling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and uses an on-line approximation to update the model. In this technique, it is assumed that every pixel's intensity values in the video can be modeled using a Gaussian mixture model. A simple heuristic determines which intensities are most probably of the background. Then the pixels which do not match to these are called the foreground pixels. Foreground pixels are grouped using 2D connected component analysis. At any time t, a particular pixel ( x 0 , y 0 {\displaystyle x_{0},y_{0}} )'s history is: X 1 , … , X t = { V ( x 0 , y 0 , i ) : 1 ⩽ i ⩽ t } {\displaystyle X_{1},\ldots ,X_{t}=\{V(x_{0},y_{0},i):1\leqslant i\leqslant t\}} This history is modeled by a mixture of K Gaussian distributions: P ( X t ) = ∑ i = 1 K ω i , t N ( X t ∣ μ i , t , σ i , t ) {\displaystyle P(X_{t})=\sum _{i=1}^{K}\omega _{i,t}N\left(X_{t}\mid \mu _{i,t},\sigma _{i,t}\right)} where: N ( X t ∣ μ i , t , σ i , t ) = 1 ( 2 π ) D / 2 1 | σ i , t | 1 / 2 exp ⁡ ( − 1 2 ( X t − μ i , t ) T σ i , t − 1 ( X t − μ i , t ) ) {\displaystyle N\left(X_{t}\mid \mu _{i,t},\sigma _{i,t}\right)={\dfrac {1}{(2\pi )^{D/2}}}{1 \over |\sigma _{i,t}|^{1/2}}\exp \left(-{1 \over 2}(X_{t}-\mu _{i,t})^{T}\sigma _{i,t}^{-1}\left(X_{t}-\mu _{i,t}\right)\right)} First, each pixel is characterized by its intensity in RGB color space. Then probability of observing the current pixel is given by the following
