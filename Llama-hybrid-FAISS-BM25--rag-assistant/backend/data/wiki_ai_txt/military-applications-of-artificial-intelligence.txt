Artificial intelligence (AI) has many applications in warfare, including in communications, intelligence, and munitions control. Warfare which is algorithmic or controlled by artificial intelligence, with little to no human decision-making, is called hyperwar, a term coined by Amir Husain and John R. Allen as a portmanteau of the Ancient Greek preposition and prefix hyper (ὑπέρ, 'beyond') and the English "war". Due to its autonomous nature, AI could rapidly increase the speed of warfare, especially if more than one side is relying on AI. AI is not limited to new weapons such as drones or cyberwar, it can affect all forms of military planning. Uses AI can enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human operated and autonomous. AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Iran and Israel. An AI-powered Automatic Target Classifying System, which employs sensors and algorithms to automatically identify and classify targets on radar, was patented by the Indian Army in 2025. It swiftly and precisely compares real-time data—like pictures or radar signals—to a database of stored data. It can be used for disposable purposes, such guiding missiles. Autonomous armament Military drones capable of autonomous action are in wide use. Command and control In 2024 a Chinese laboratory at the Joint Operations College of the National Defense University in Shijiazhuang has created an AI military commander, for use in large-scale war simulations in the role of the commander-in-chief. In 2024, the Ukrainian Army developed autonomous Kamikaze drones in order to make Russian interference during flight ineffective. During the 2025 India–Pakistan conflict, the Indian military’s AI-enabled Meteorological Reporting System (Project Anumaan) was fed IMD data to assist the Artillery Combat Command and Control System with planning and accurate targeting with extended range artillery shells. Up to 200 kilometres (120 miles) inside Pakistan's borders, the system can predict exact wind speed and other meteorological conditions 48-72 hours ahead of time. The AI also aided in long-range missile trajectory calculations. Military intelligence In 2023, the United States Department of Defense tested generative AI based on large language models to digitize and integrate data across the military. In the Gaza war, Israel used two AI systems to generate targets to strike: Habsora (translated: "the gospel") was used to compile a list of buildings to target, while "Lavender" produced a list of people. "Lavender" produced a list of 37,000 people to target. The list of buildings to target included Gazan private homes of people that were suspected of affiliation to Hamas operatives. The combination of AI targeting technology with policy shift away from avoiding civilian targets resulted in unprecedented numbers of civilian deaths. IDF officials say the program addresses the previous issue of the air force running out of targets. Using Habsora, officials say that suspected and junior Hamas members homes significantly expand the "AI target bank." An internal source describes the process as a “mass assassination factory”. In 2024, the U.S. military trained artificial intelligence to identify airstrike targets during its operations in Iraq and Syria. In 2025 India–Pakistan conflict, the Indian Army employed AI to create shared operational picture, analyze intelligence, evaluate threats, and create predictive models for long-range attacks. Twenty-three applications were developed for different purposes that handled inputs and data for real-time multi-sensor and multi-source data fusion. Applications include the Electronic Intelligence Collation and Analysis System, which has b
