satisfy long-time viewers and gave the leads a happy ending. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked the show #36 on its list of the "40 Best Science Fiction TV Shows of All Time". "Bury your gays" controversy In 2016, the series and showrunner Jason Rothenberg faced widespread controversy when Lexa, the leader of the Grounders and a lesbian character, was killed off in the third-season episode "Thirteen". Some critics and fans considered the death and the way it was written a continuation of the bury your gays trope in television, in which LGBT characters, especially queer women, are killed off far more often than others, implicitly portraying them as disposable and existing primarily to serve the stories of straight characters or to attract viewers. Lexa's death occurring immediately after having sex with Clarke received particular criticism. With The 100, along with shows like The Walking Dead and Supernatural all containing examples of the "bury your gays" trope around the same time, many were left upset. Fans of the show rallied behind the phrase "Lexa Deserved Better" as a way to show their disapproval of the character's death. A debate about the trope among media, writers and viewers ensued, with Lexa's death cited by some as a prime example of the trope and why it should end. Rothenberg eventually wrote in response, "I [...] write and produce television for the real world where negative and hurtful tropes exist. And I am very sorry for not recognizing this as fully as I should have." Additionally, Debnam-Carey's concurrent role in the series Fear the Walking Dead was presented as an off-screen reason for Lexa's death. Ratings An estimated 2.7 million American viewers watched the series premiere, which received an 18â€“49 rating of 0.9, making it the most-watched show in its time slot on the CW since 2010, with the series Life Unexpected.
