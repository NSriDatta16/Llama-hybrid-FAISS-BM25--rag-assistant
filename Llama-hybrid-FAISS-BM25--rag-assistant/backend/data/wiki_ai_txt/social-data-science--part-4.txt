usal Inference: The social sciences are often interested in finding causal relationships between variables. This is of special interest to social data science, where multiple fields of research try to establish appropriate policy responses to contemporary societal issues. Often, drawing from research from Judea Pearls directed acyclical graph approach and the Neymann-Rubin Causal model to inform whether there exists a causal relationship between two (or more) variables. Furthermore, incorporating machine learning into causal inference is of great interest. Natural Language Processing: Applied natural language processing is the adaptation and repurposing of methods from natural language processing and the application of these methods to questions of social behavior. Themes Algorithmic Bias and Fairness: Considering how algorithms play a still larger role in humans everyday life, the study of fairness in this context has grown as a field. Especially whether miniorieties are negatively or positively impacted by these algorithms. Polarization and Misinformation: Many scholars use enormous amounts of granular data generated by social media and political agents to study social contagion, the spread of misinformation and disinformation. These studies often use text or social media interactions to explore how politicians and/or the public behave and interact in the digital and physical arena. Climate Social Data Science: The intersection between climate science, and digital (behavioral) data. This includes climate activism on social media and using digital trace data to investigate how people and societies are impacted by rising temperatures (CITE: Rising Temperature Erode Human Sleep Globally). == References ==
