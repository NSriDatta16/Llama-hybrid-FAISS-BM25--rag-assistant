odels variable-length segmentations of the label sequence Y {\displaystyle Y} . This provides much of the power of higher-order CRFs to model long-range dependencies of the Y i {\displaystyle Y_{i}} , at a reasonable computational cost. Finally, large-margin models for structured prediction, such as the structured Support Vector Machine can be seen as an alternative training procedure to CRFs. Latent-dynamic conditional random field Latent-dynamic conditional random fields (LDCRF) or discriminative probabilistic latent variable models (DPLVM) are a type of CRFs for sequence tagging tasks. They are latent variable models that are trained discriminatively. In an LDCRF, like in any sequence tagging task, given a sequence of observations x = x 1 , … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}} , the main problem the model must solve is how to assign a sequence of labels y = y 1 , … , y n {\displaystyle y_{1},\dots ,y_{n}} from one finite set of labels Y. Instead of directly modeling P(y|x) as an ordinary linear-chain CRF would do, a set of latent variables h is "inserted" between x and y using the chain rule of probability: P ( y | x ) = ∑ h P ( y | h , x ) P ( h | x ) {\displaystyle P(\mathbf {y} |\mathbf {x} )=\sum _{\mathbf {h} }P(\mathbf {y} |\mathbf {h} ,\mathbf {x} )P(\mathbf {h} |\mathbf {x} )} This allows capturing latent structure between the observations and labels. While LDCRFs can be trained using quasi-Newton methods, a specialized version of the perceptron algorithm called the latent-variable perceptron has been developed for them as well, based on Collins' structured perceptron algorithm. These models find applications in computer vision, specifically gesture recognition from video streams and shallow parsing.
