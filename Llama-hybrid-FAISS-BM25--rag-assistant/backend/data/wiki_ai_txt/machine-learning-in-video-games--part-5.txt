calculates the fitness of current items based on player usage and other gameplay metrics, this fitness score is then used decide which CPPNs will reproduce to create a new item. The ending result is the generation of new weapon effects based on the player's preference. Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. has been used by several researchers to simulate PCG level creation. Various attempts having used different methods. A version in 2014 used n-grams to generate levels similar to the ones it trained on, which was later improved by making use of MCTS to guide generation. These generations were often not optimal when taking gameplay metrics such as player movement into account, a separate research project in 2017 tried to resolve this problem by generating levels based on player movement using Markov Chains. These projects were not subjected to human testing and may not meet human playability standards. The Legend of Zelda PCG level creation for The Legend of Zelda has been attempted by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This attempt made use of a Bayesian Network to learn high level knowledge from existing levels, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to represent the different low level features of these levels. The researchers used PCA to compare generated levels to human made levels and found that they were considered very similar. This test did not include playability or human testing of the generated levels. Deep learning for content generation in games The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks first, and then of diffusion models allows for generating in-game content at runtime using non-procedural approaches. Examples include: The 3D printer available in InZOI (available in early access), a life simulation game developed by InZOI Studio and published by Krafton. Given a 2D image file provided by the user, the 3D printer generates the corresponding 3D object, which the user can then place in the game or use to decorate its avatar. The terrain generation solution implemented in Prologue: Go Wayback! (early access: to be announced, with play tests undergoing in early 2025), a survival game developed by PlayerUnknown Productions. The approach allows to generate a new game map every time the game is launched. Music generation Music is often seen in video games and can be a crucial element for influencing the mood of different situations and story points. Machine learning has seen use in the experimental field of music generation; it is uniquely suited to processing raw unstructured data and forming high level representations that could be applied to the diverse field of music. Most attempted methods have involved the use of ANN in some form. Methods include the use of basic feedforward neural networks, autoencoders, restricted boltzmann machines, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and compound architectures that use multiple methods. VRAE video game melody symbolic music generation system The 2014 research paper on "Variational Recurrent Auto-Encoders" attempted to generate music based on songs from 8 different video games. This project is one of the few conducted purely on video game music. The neural network in the project was able to generate data that was very similar to the data of the games it trained off of. The generated data did not translate into good quality music. References == External links ==
