 the sudden aha! solution to a problem, the birth of a new idea to simplify a complex situation. Solutions found through insight are often more incisive than those from step-by-step analysis. A quick solution process requires insight to select productive moves at different stages of the problem-solving cycle. Unlike Newell and Simon's formal definition of a move problem, there is no consensus definition of an insight problem. Some problem-solving strategies include: Abstraction solving the problem in a tractable model system to gain insight into the real system Analogy adapting the solution to a previous problem which has similar features or mechanisms Brainstorming (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found Bypasses transform the problem into another problem that is easier to solve, bypassing the barrier, then transform that solution back to a solution to the original problem. Critical thinking analysis of available evidence and arguments to form a judgement via rational, skeptical, and unbiased evaluation Divide and conquer breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems Help-seeking obtaining external assistance to deal with obstacles Hypothesis testing assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption Lateral thinking approaching solutions indirectly and creatively Means-ends analysis choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal Morphological analysis assessing the output and interactions of an entire system Observation / Question in the natural sciences an observation is an act or instance of noticing or perceiving and the acquisition of information from a primary source. A question is an utterance which serves as a request for information. Proof of impossibility try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it Reduction transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist Research employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems Root cause analysis identifying the cause of a problem Trial-and-error testing possible solutions until the right one is found Problem-solving methods A3 problem solving – Structured problem improvement approach Design thinking – Processes by which design concepts are developed Eight Disciplines Problem Solving – Eight disciplines of team-oriented problem solving methodPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets GROW model – Method for goal setting and problem solving Help-seeking – Theory in psychology How to Solve It – Book by George Pólya Lateral thinking – Manner of solving problems OODA loop – Observe–orient–decide–act cycle PDCA – Iterative design and management method Root cause analysis – Method of identifying the fundamental causes of faults or problems RPR problem diagnosis TRIZ – Problem-solving tools Scientific method – is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science. Swarm intelligence – Collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems System dynamics – Study of non-linear complex systems Common barriers Common barriers to problem solving include mental constructs that impede an efficient search for solutions. Five of the most common identified by researchers are: confirmation bias, mental set, functional fixedness, unnecessary constraints, and irrelevant information. Confirmation bias Confirmation bias is an unintentional tendency to collect and use data which favors preconceived notions. Such notions may be incidental rather than motivated by important personal beliefs: the desire to be right may be sufficient motivation. Scientific and technical professionals also experience confirmation bias. One online experiment, for example, suggested that professionals within the field of psychol
