 ∗ = ∧ {\displaystyle \ast =\wedge } ), all MV-algebras, all BL-algebras, etc. Since the residuation condition can equivalently be expressed by identities, MTL-algebras form a variety. Interpretation of the logic MTL in MTL-algebras The connectives of MTL are interpreted in MTL-algebras as follows: Strong conjunction by the monoidal operation ∗ {\displaystyle \ast } Implication by the operation ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } (which is called the residuum of ∗ {\displaystyle \ast } ) Weak conjunction and weak disjunction by the lattice operations ∧ {\displaystyle \wedge } and ∨ , {\displaystyle \vee ,} respectively (usually denoted by the same symbols as the connectives, if no confusion can arise) The truth constants zero (top) and one (bottom) by the constants 0 and 1 The equivalence connective is interpreted by the operation ⇔ {\displaystyle \Leftrightarrow } defined as x ⇔ y ≡ ( x ⇒ y ) ∧ ( y ⇒ x ) {\displaystyle x\Leftrightarrow y\equiv (x\Rightarrow y)\wedge (y\Rightarrow x)} Due to the prelinearity condition, this definition is equivalent to one that uses ∗ {\displaystyle \ast } instead of ∧ , {\displaystyle \wedge ,} thus x ⇔ y ≡ ( x ⇒ y ) ∗ ( y ⇒ x ) {\displaystyle x\Leftrightarrow y\equiv (x\Rightarrow y)\ast (y\Rightarrow x)} Negation is interpreted by the definable operation − x ≡ x ⇒ 0 {\displaystyle -x\equiv x\Rightarrow 0} With this interpretation of connectives, any evaluation ev of propositional variables in L uniquely extends to an evaluation e of all well-formed formulae of MTL, by the following inductive definition (which generalizes Tarski's truth conditions), for any formulae A, B, and any propositional variable p: e ( p ) = e v ( p ) e ( ⊥ ) = 0 e ( ⊤ ) = 1 e ( A ⊗ B ) = e ( A ) ∗ e ( B ) e ( A → B ) = e ( A ) ⇒ e ( B ) e ( A ∧ B ) = e ( A ) ∧ e ( B ) e ( A ∨ B ) = e ( A ) ∨ e ( B ) e ( A ↔ B ) = e ( A ) ⇔ e ( B ) e ( ¬ A ) = e ( A ) ⇒ 0 {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcl}e(p)&=&e_{\mathrm {v} }(p)\\e(\bot )&=&0\\e(\top )&=&1\\e(A\otimes B)&=&e(A)\ast e(B)\\e(A\rightarrow B)&=&e(A)\Rightarrow e(B)\\e(A\wedge B)&=&e(A)\wedge e(B)\\e(A\vee B)&=&e(A)\vee e(B)\\e(A\leftrightarrow B)&=&e(A)\Leftrightarrow e(B)\\e(\neg A)&=&e(A)\Rightarrow 0\end{array}}} Informally, the truth value 1 represents full truth and the truth value 0 represents full falsity; intermediate truth values represent intermediate degrees of truth. Thus a formula is considered fully true under an evaluation e if e(A) = 1. A formula A is said to be valid in an MTL-algebra L if it is fully true under all evaluations in L, that is, if e(A) = 1 for all evaluations e in L. Some formulae (for instance, p → p) are valid in any MTL-algebra; these are called tautologies of MTL. The notion of global entailment (or: global consequence) is defined for MTL as follows: a set of formulae Γ entails a formula A (or: A is a global consequence of Γ), in symbols Γ ⊨ A , {\displaystyle \Gamma \models A,} if for any evaluation e in any MTL-algebra, whenever e(B) = 1 for all formulae B in Γ, then also e(A) = 1. Informally, the global consequence relation represents the transmission of full truth in any MTL-algebra of truth values. General soundness and completeness theorems The logic MTL is sound and complete with respect to the class of all MTL-algebras (Esteva & Godo, 2001): A formula is provable in MTL if and only if it is valid in all MTL-algebras. The notion of MTL-algebra is in fact so defined that MTL-algebras form the class of all algebras for which the logic MTL is sound. Furthermore, the strong completeness theorem holds: A formula A is a global consequence in MTL of a set of formulae Γ if and only if A is derivable from Γ in MTL. Linear semantics Like algebras for other fuzzy logics, MTL-algebras enjoy the following linear subdirect decomposition property: Every MTL-algebra is a subdirect product of linearly ordered MTL-algebras. (A subdirect product is a subalgebra of the direct product such that all projection maps are surjective. An MTL-algebra is linea
