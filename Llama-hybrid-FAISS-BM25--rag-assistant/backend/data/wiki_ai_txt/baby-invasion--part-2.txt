Cast Anonymous as Yellow Juan Bofill as Blue Shawn Thomas as Red Steven Rodriguez as Green Antonio Jackson as Orange Tej Limlas Ly as Purple Scott Ference as Wheelchair Man Production In an interview with Variety, Korine characterized Baby Invasion as well as his previous EDGLRD production Aggro Dr1ft as works of "post-cinema." He termed "blinx" for their unconventional nature. British electronic producer Burial created an original score for the film. Of the score, Korine said, "I never actually met Burial and I never actually spoke with Burial. So it was all done through Discord messages, and we'd kind of talk on PS5. And then the music was sent through PS5." The cast have little or no acting experience, apart from Scott Ference who played a little person in Aggro Dr1ft. Visual effects for Baby Invasion were created using artificial intelligence and video game engines. The film credits two "AI artists," three "AI engineers," and four "AI whisperers." According to the film assets available via the EDGLRD website, the clips featuring the white rabbit were made using Runway's Gen-3 Alpha video generation. Release Baby Invasion premiered out of competition at the 81st Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2024. During the Venice press conference, Korine sat next to visual effects artist Joao Rosa and fellow filmmaker Gaspar Noé, who was wearing a neon green mask, and smoked a cigar, causing smoke to fill the conference room. He expressed that "Hollywood ... would be smart to — encourage the youth, the kids. Why we're starting to see Hollywood crumble creatively is because they’re losing a lot of the most creative minds to gaming and to streaming. They're so locked in on convention and then all those kids who are so creative are now just going to find other pathways and go to other places because movies are no longer the dominant art form." He also revealed that, "When we release the film, there'll be a way to watch it through your phone, but there'll be certain codes within the movie that'll take you to other movies. So the film, what you're seeing, is just a base layer film. There'll be three or four other sub films." The film was released on video on demand on March 21, 2025. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 15 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5/10. On Metacritic, the film holds an average score of 36 out of 100 based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing "though little more than a gimmick, the baby angle gives Korine a hook for an experiment that’s only intermittently engaging for much of its running time."
