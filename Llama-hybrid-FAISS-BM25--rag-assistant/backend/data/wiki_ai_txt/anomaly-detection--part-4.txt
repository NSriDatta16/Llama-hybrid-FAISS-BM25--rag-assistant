omaly detection and segmentation. Methods utilizing pretrained foundation models include using the alignment of image and text embeddings (CLIP, etc.) for anomaly localization, while others may use the inpainting ability of generative image models for reconstruction-error based anomaly detection. Cluster-based Clustering: Cluster analysis-based outlier detection Deviations from association rules and frequent itemsets Fuzzy logic-based outlier detection Ensembles Ensemble techniques, using feature bagging, score normalization and different sources of diversity Others Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS) uses value histograms and assumes feature independence for fast predictions. Anomaly detection in dynamic networks Dynamic networks, such as those representing financial systems, social media interactions, and transportation infrastructure, are subject to constant change, making anomaly detection within them a complex task. Unlike static graphs, dynamic networks reflect evolving relationships and states, requiring adaptive techniques for anomaly detection. Types of anomalies in dynamic networks Community anomalies Compression anomalies Decomposition anomalies Distance anomalies Probabilistic model anomalies Explainable anomaly detection Many of the methods discussed above only yield an anomaly score prediction, which often can be explained to users as the point being in a region of low data density (or relatively low density compared to the neighbor's densities). In explainable artificial intelligence, the users demand methods with higher explainability. Some methods allow for more detailed explanations: The Subspace Outlier Degree (SOD) identifies attributes where a sample is normal, and attributes in which the sample deviates from the expected. Correlation Outlier Probabilities (COP) compute an error vector of how a sample point deviates from an expected location, which can be interpreted as a counterfactual explanation: the sample would be normal if it were moved to that location.
