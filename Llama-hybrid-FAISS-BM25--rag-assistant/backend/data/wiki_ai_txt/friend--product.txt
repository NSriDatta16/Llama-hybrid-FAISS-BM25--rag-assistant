Friend (stylized as friend) is a wearable artificial intelligence device released by a startup company with the same name. Avi Schiffmann, a Harvard University dropout, designed and released its first product in October 2023. Friend received significant backlash following a marketing campaign in 2025 that featured 11,000 advertisements in New York City. History Founder Avi Schiffmann began pitching his idea for the product in 2023, at the age of 21. The project was initially called "Tab" and had received over $250,000 in investments by the end of the year. In 2024, Schiffmann spent $1.8 million on the domain "friend.com", which had been unclaimed for 17 years. Products While Friend offers an online, LLM-powered chatbot, its flagship product is a pendant with a microphone that incorporates the chatbot. The device is just under two inches in size. The product has drawn comparisons to Tamagotchis. The device does not speak back, rather it communicates by sending text messages to the user's phone in real time. Reception 2025 New York subway campaign Friend spent over $1 million on advertisements with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the corporation in charge of public transportation in New York City. In total, the campaign included advertisements in over 11,000 rail cars, over 1,000 platform posters, and 130 urban panels. Schiffmann claimed it was the largest marketing campaign in NYC subway history, describing it as a "takeover", saying further that "it almost felt illegal". People vandalized many of the ads with criticism of the product. == References ==
