ments, including DOJ–HUD, IRS–SSA, and HHS–DoD collaborations. Government use of commercial data providers extends mosaic-style aggregation by leveraging credit histories, employment information, utility bills, and address records to reconstruct social and familial connections not visible in government files alone. Despite the risks, Marion Royal, director of Data.gov at the General Services Administration, claimed the U.S. government had encountered few actual incidents of agencies publishing overly sensitive data. Royal described the mosaic effect as akin to assembling puzzle pieces—each harmless alone, but together exposing vulnerabilities. The ability to correlate just two data points can act as a foundation for wider inferences across massive datasets. When malicious use is theoretically possible, actual redaction due to the mosaic effect has occurred only once. The .json format used by Data.gov enabled automated aggregation, making the site a proving ground for mosaic-style recombination threats. Software services now aggregate information from thousands of public websites, social media profiles, and external databases, enabling authorities to generate risk assessments and behavioral profiles using patterns invisible in any single dataset. The spread of social media and search data, Royal argued, makes true anonymization nearly impossible, and that traditional consent-based models of privacy are outdated in a world of sensor-driven, passively collected data. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's David McClure noted that while the mosaic effect poses risks, it also allows innovative public-private partnerships to make use of underutilized sensor data. NOAA generates over a terabyte of environmental data daily, of which only a fraction is used internally, leaving the rest vulnerable or useful depending on interpretation. McClure noted the challenge of balancing unrealized data value against unseen disclosure risks in open data systems. FOIA and transparency Under Executive Order 12,356 in 1982, President Reagan formally integrated mosaic theory into U.S. classification policy, authorizing the withholding of information based on potential cumulative threats from aggregated disclosures, even if individual pieces appeared innocuous. This contrasted sharply with earlier policies, particularly under Truman and Eisenhower, who mandated classifying documents strictly on their independent content rather than their combined implications. President Reagan briefly extended the mosaic theory beyond classification law through a short-lived campaign targeting unclassified data in private databases, before it faded from executive discourse until its revival after 9/11. During the 1980s and 1990s, the mosaic theory gained broad acceptance in FOIA national security cases across multiple federal courts, where agencies' withholding claims were routinely upheld over the objections of FOIA applicants, without detailed judicial scrutiny or engagement with potential conflicts between the theory and FOIA principles. President Clinton's Executive Order 12958 of 1995 replaced the broader mosaic theory language from Reagan's classification policy with a more restrictive standard focused on whether compiled, unclassified information reveals a new association warranting classification, though courts largely ignored the change and continued applying earlier doctrine. The mosaic theory attained a privileged status under FOIA prior to 9/11, with courts granting agencies broad deference and rarely scrutinizing the plausibility or scope of their claims. After 9/11, the George W. Bush administration invoked the mosaic theory more frequently to expand classification and resist FOIA disclosures, leading to increased judicial scrutiny and divided views on executive secrecy. In 2013, the Obama administration through the Office of Management and Budget reiterated prior definitions of the mosaic effect in the context of government data, and requir
