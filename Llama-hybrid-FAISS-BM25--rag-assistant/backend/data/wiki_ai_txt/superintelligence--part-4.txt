g humanity's coherent extrapolated volition, one could try to build an AI to do what is morally right, relying on the AI's superior cognitive capacities to figure out just which actions fit that description. We can call this proposal "moral rightness" (MR) ... MR would also appear to have some disadvantages. It relies on the notion of "morally right", a notoriously difficult concept, one with which philosophers have grappled since antiquity without yet attaining consensus as to its analysis. Picking an erroneous explication of "moral rightness" could result in outcomes that would be morally very wrong ... One might try to preserve the basic idea of the MR model while reducing its demandingness by focusing on moral permissibility: the idea being that we could let the AI pursue humanity's CEV so long as it did not act in morally impermissible ways. Recent developments Since Bostrom's analysis, new approaches to AI value alignment have emerged: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) – This technique aims to infer human preferences from observed behavior, potentially offering a more robust approach to value alignment. Constitutional AI – Proposed by Anthropic, this involves training AI systems with explicit ethical principles and constraints. Debate and amplification – These techniques, explored by OpenAI, use AI-assisted debate and iterative processes to better understand and align with human values. Transformer LLMs and ASI The rapid advancement of transformer-based LLMs has led to speculation about their potential path to ASI. Some researchers argue that scaled-up versions of these models could exhibit ASI-like capabilities: Emergent abilities – As LLMs increase in size and complexity, they demonstrate unexpected capabilities not present in smaller models. In-context learning – LLMs show the ability to adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning, potentially mimicking general intelligence. Multi-modal integration – Recent models can process and generate various types of data, including text, images, and audio. However, critics argue that current LLMs lack true understanding and are merely sophisticated pattern matchers, raising questions about their suitability as a path to ASI. Other perspectives on artificial superintelligence Additional viewpoints on the development and implications of superintelligence include: Recursive self-improvement – I. J. Good proposed the concept of an "intelligence explosion", where an AI system could rapidly improve its own intelligence, potentially leading to superintelligence. Orthogonality thesis – Bostrom argues that an AI's level of intelligence is orthogonal to its final goals, meaning a superintelligent AI could have any set of motivations. Instrumental convergence – Certain instrumental goals (e.g., self-preservation, resource acquisition) might be pursued by a wide range of AI systems, regardless of their final goals. Challenges and ongoing research The pursuit of value-aligned AI faces several challenges: Philosophical uncertainty in defining concepts like "moral rightness" Technical complexity in translating ethical principles into precise algorithms Potential for unintended consequences even with well-intentioned approaches Current research directions include multi-stakeholder approaches to incorporate diverse perspectives, developing methods for scalable oversight of AI systems, and improving techniques for robust value learning. Al research is rapidly progressing towards superintelligence. Addressing these design challenges remains crucial for creating ASI systems that are both powerful and aligned with human interests. Potential threat to humanity The development of artificial superintelligence (ASI) has raised concerns about potential existential risks to humanity. Researchers have proposed various scenarios in which an ASI could pose a significant threat: Intelligence explosion and control problem Some researchers argue that through recursive self-improvement, an ASI could rapidly become
