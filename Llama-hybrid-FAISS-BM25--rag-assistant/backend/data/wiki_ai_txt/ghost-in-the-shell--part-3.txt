Video games Ghost in the Shell was developed by Exact and released for the PlayStation on July 17, 1997, in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is a third-person shooter featuring an original storyline where the character plays a rookie member of Section 9. The video game's soundtrack Megatech Body features various techno artists, such as Takkyu Ishino, Scan X and Mijk Van Dijk. Several video games were also developed to tie into the Stand Alone Complex television series, in addition to a first-person shooter by Nexon and Neople titled Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online, released in 2016. A virtual reality game entitled Ghost in the Shell Arise: Stealth Hounds, was made available at Bandai Namco's arcade VR Zone Shinjuku in 2017. Legacy Ghost in the Shell influenced some prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis, creators of The Matrix and its sequels, showed it to producer Joel Silver, saying, "We wanna do that for real." The Matrix series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of Ghost in the Shell, and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's Avatar, Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Jonathan Mostow's Surrogates. James Cameron cited Ghost in the Shell as a source of inspiration, citing it as an influence on Avatar. Bungie's 2001 third-person action game Oni draws substantial inspiration from Ghost in the Shell's setting and characters. Ghost in the Shell also influenced video games such as the Metal Gear Solid series, Deus Ex, and Cyberpunk 2077. The track The Ballade of Puppets: The Ghost Awaits in the World Beyond written and arranged by Kenji Kawai for the movie Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence was used as the opening number of the ice show Ice Explosion 2023, produced by Japanese figure skater, Olympic bronze medallist and former world champion Daisuke Takahashi. The performance included an ensemble of 24 elite figure skaters (including Takahashi, Olympic champion Shizuka Arakawa, former world silver medallists Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje and Olympic team bronze medallist Jason Brown) and was choreographed by retired ice dancer Massimo Scali. Takahashi said about the song "I've been obsessed with this song since I was 18 and wanted to skate to it myself one day... It's over four minutes long, so I didn't really get the chance, but I thought it would be cool to use it for the opening." Echoes of Life, a solo ice show tour by Japanese figure skater and two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu, included a program with the song Utai IV Reawakening arranged by Kenji Kawai for the live-action American film Ghost in the Shell. The programs of Echoes of Life are woven into a story that questions the meaning of life following the journey of an enhance human being in a devastated, imaginary near future.
