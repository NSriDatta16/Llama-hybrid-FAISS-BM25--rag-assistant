loyee at Nvidia, therefore commented on the problem in a blog post in 2019 and promised that they were working on improving the technology and clarified that the DLSS AI algorithm was mainly trained with 4K image material. That the use of DLSS leads to particularly blurred images at lower resolutions, such as Full HD, is due to the fact that the algorithm has far less image information available to calculate an appropriate image compared to higher resolutions like 4K. The use of DLSS Frame Generation may lead to increased input latency, as well as visual artifacts. It has also been criticized that by implementing DLSS in their games, game developers no longer have an incentive to optimize them so that they also run smoothly in native resolution on modern PC hardware. For example, for the game Alan Wake 2 in 4K resolution at the highest graphics settings with ray tracing enabled, the use of DLSS in Performance mode is recommended even with graphics cards such as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 in order to achieve 60 fps. The transformer-based AI upscaling model introduced with DLSS 4 received moderate praise for its improved image quality with regard to increased stability, reduced ghosting, better anti-aliasing, and higher level of detail, as well as its backward compatability and higher training scalability regarding future improvements.
