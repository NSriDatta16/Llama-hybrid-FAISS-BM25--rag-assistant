 become its own meme outside the context of Italian brainrot. In May 2025, Indonesian production house Dee Company expressed interest in making a film based on it. Ballerina Cappuccina A female ballerina wearing a tutu and pointe shoes with a cappuccino mug as a head. The original meme featured her pirouetting gracefully. She is married to a ninja named Cappuccino Assassino, who kidnapped her prior to their marriage, and also has a sister named Espressona Signora. Chimpanzini Bananini An ape with a banana as a body, who has been described as "indestructible" and considered one of the genre's "main characters". Lirili Larila A bipedal cactus-elephant hybrid wearing sandals who has the ability to control time. Trippi Troppi Often depicted as a cat with a shrimp's body, though some videos use the name to describe an obese bear with the head of a fish. The latter design has been nicknamed the "King of the Sea", having gained its massive weight from eating everything it sees underwater. Reception The likenesses of some Italian brainrot characters have been used to sell toys and non-fungible tokens, as well as being the centerpiece of the popular Roblox game Steal a Brainrot. Italian brainrot also inspired a variety of volatile meme coins, such as "Italianrot", which was launched in March 2025. Italian brainrot gained notoriety in many regions such as the United States, South Korea, and Germany. Various brands have replicated the memes for use in marketing content on social media. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán released a TikTok video where a 3D model of Tung Tung Tung Sahur is seen dancing in a government meeting. In Italy, several newsstands began selling "Skifidol Italian Brainrot Trading Card Games", inspired by the memes and commercialized for a younger audience. The release led to a noticeable rise in Gen Alpha consumers, with L'Espresso comparing the surge to the popularity of Garbage Pail Kids cards during their Italian debut. Polish radio channel Polskie Radio noted that the meme is popular among Generation Alpha "because it's stupid, funny, and veeeery [sic] addictive". Polskie Radio highlighted how the meme has been adapted into other media, such as Roblox games, music remixes, and quizzes. Radio France Internationale called the usage of pseudo-Italian names amongst characters "a bit problematic". Daily German newspaper Die Tageszeitung called Italian brainrot a "creative approach to technology, language, and pop culture". Controversial audios Tralalero Tralala and Bombardiro Crocodilo memes have been accused of being Islamophobic, as lyrics of Tralalero Tralala videos mock Allah in Italian, although some Italian users have pointed out that blasphemy is often used as a filler word in Italian, and that the videos had no Islamophobic intent. On the other hand, Bombardiro Crocodilo has been criticized for making light of the Gaza genocide, since some videos using his Italian narration describe the character bombing children in the Gaza Strip and the rest of Palestine. This has caused concerns regarding casual cruelty and desensitization. The full narration of Bombardiro is as follows: See also Shitposting – Intentionally posting poor-quality social media posts Skibidi Toilet – 2020s webseries also known for its surreal humor YouTube Poop – Web video genre also known for surreal humor Steal a Brainrot – A video game based on Italian brainrot Notes References External links Media related to Italian brainrot at Wikimedia Commons The dictionary definition of Italian brainrot at Wiktionary Quotations related to Italian brainrot at Wikiquote
