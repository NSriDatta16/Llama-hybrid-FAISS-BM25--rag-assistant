tional Intelligence Society two years later by including new areas of interest such as fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation. The NNC helped organize the first IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence in Orlando, Florida in 1994. On this conference the first clear definition of Computational Intelligence was introduced by Bezdek: A system is computationally intelligent when it: deals with only numerical (low-level) data, has pattern-recognition components, does not use knowledge in the AI sense; and additionally when it (begins to) exhibit (1) computational adaptivity; (2) computational fault tolerance; (3) speed approaching human-like turnaround and (4) error rates that approximate human performance. Today, with machine learning and deep learning in particular utilizing a breadth of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches, the CI landscape has been greatly enhanced, with novell intelligent approaches. The main algorithmic approaches of CI and their applications The main applications of Computational Intelligence include computer science, engineering, data analysis and bio-medicine. Fuzzy logic Unlike conventional Boolean logic, fuzzy logic is based on fuzzy sets. In both models, a property of an object is defined as belonging to a set; in fuzzy logic, however, the membership is not sharply defined by a yes/no distinction, but is graded gradually. This is done using membership functions that assign a real number between 0 and 1 to each element as the degree of membership. The new set operations introduced in this way define the operations of an associated logic calculus that allows the modeling of inference processes, i.e. logical reasoning. Therefore, fuzzy logic is well suited for engineering decisions without clear certainties and uncertainties or with imprecise data - as with natural language-processing technologies but it doesn't have learning abilities. This technique tends to apply to a wide range of domains such as control engineering, image processing, fuzzy data clustering and decision making. Fuzzy logic-based control systems can be found, for example, in the field of household appliances in washing machines, dish washers, microwave ovens, etc. or in the area of motor vehicles in gear transmission and braking systems. This principle can also be encountered when using a video camera, as it helps to stabilize the image when the camera is held unsteadily. Other areas such as medical diagnostics, satellite controllers and business strategy selection are just a few more examples of today's application of fuzzy logic. Neural networks An important field of CI is the development of artificial neural networks (ANN) based on the biological ones, which can be defined by three main components: the cell-body which processes the information, the axon, which is a device enabling the signal conducting, and the synapse, which controls signals. Therefore, ANNs are very well suited for distributed information processing systems, enabling the process and the learning from experiential data. ANNs aim to mimic cognitive processes of the human brain. The main advantages of this technology therefore include fault tolerance, pattern recognition even with noisy images and the ability to learn. Concerning its applications, neural networks can be classified into five groups: data analysis and classification, associative memory, data clustering or compression, generation of patterns, and control systems. The numerous applications include, for example, the analysis and classification of medical data, including the creation of diagnoses, speech recognition, data mining, image processing, forecasting, robot control, credit approval, pattern recognition, face and fraud detection and dealing with nonlinearities of a system in order to control it. ANNs have the latter area of application and data clustering in common with fuzzy logic. Generative systems based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks, su
