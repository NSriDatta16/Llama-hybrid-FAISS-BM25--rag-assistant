the codes above (i.e., (length/head)/length(data) â‰¤ 40%). This process is called head/tail breaks 1.0. But sometimes a larger threshold, for example 50% or more, can be used, as Jiang and Yin (2014) noted in another article: "this condition can be relaxed for many geographic features, such as 50 percent or even more". However, all heads' percentage on average must be smaller than 40% (or 41, 42%), indicating far more small things than large ones. Many real-world data cannot be fit into a perfect long tailed distribution, therefore its threshold can be relaxed structurally. In head/tail breaks 2.0 the threshold only applies to the overall heads' percentage. This means that the percentages of all heads related to the tails should be around 40% on average. Individual classes can have any percentage spit around the average, as long as this averages out as a whole. For example, if there is data distributed in such a way that it has a clearly defined head and tail during the first and second iteration (length(head)/(length(data)<20%) but a much less well defined long tailed distribution for the third iteration (60% in the head), head/tail breaks 2.0 allows the iteration to continue into the fourth iteration which can be distributed 30% head - 70% tail again and so on. As long as the overall threshold is not surpassed the head/tail breaks classification holds. Rank-size plot and RA index A good tool to display the scaling pattern, or the heavy-tailed distribution, is the rank-size plot, which is a scatter plot to display a set of values according to their ranks. With this tool, a new index termed as the ratio of areas (RA) in a rank-size plot was defined to characterize the scaling pattern. The RA index has been successfully used in the estimation of traffic conditions. However, the RA index can only be used as a complementary method to the ht-index, because it is ineffective to capture the scaling structure of geographic features. Other Indices based on the head/tail breaks In addition to the ht-index, the following indices are also derived with the head/tail breaks. CRG-index. It is developed as a more sensitive ht-index to capture the slight changes of geographic features. In contrast to the ht-index, which is an integer, CRG-index is a real number. Unified metrics. Two unified metrics (UM1 and UM2) were proposed in an AAAG paper for characterizing the fractal nature of geographic features. One can be used to answer the question of "I know there are far more small things than large ones, but how small (or large) are these small (or large) things?", whereas the other one to answer "I know there are far more small things than large ones, but how many more?" Fht-index: It is a fractional ht-index, which is able to capture fractional hierarchy. The fht-index might be of help for creating an intermediate scale between two consecutive map scales, leading to so called continuous map scales. Applications Instead of more or less similar things, there are far more small things than large ones surrounding us. Given the ubiquity of the scaling pattern, head/tail breaks is found to be of use to statistical mapping, map generalization, cognitive mapping and even perception of beauty . It helps visualize big data, since big data are likely to show the scaling property of far more small things than large ones. Essentially geographic phenomena can be scaleful or scale-free. Scaleful phenomena can be explained by conventional mathematical or geographical operations, but scale-free phenomena can not. Head/tail breaks can be used to characterize the scale-free phenomena, which are in the majority. The visualization strategy is to recursively drop out the tail parts until the head parts are clear or visible enough. In addition, it helps delineate cities or natural cities to be more precise from various geographic information such as street networks, social media geolocation data, and nighttime images.
