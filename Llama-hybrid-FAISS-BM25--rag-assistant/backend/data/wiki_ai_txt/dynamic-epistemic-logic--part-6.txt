s of an epistemic logic obviously display the way the agents reason. For example, the axiom K together with the rule of inference Nec entail that if I know ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } ( K ϕ {\displaystyle K\phi } ) and I know that ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } implies ψ {\displaystyle \psi } ( K ( ϕ → ψ ) ) {\displaystyle K(\phi \rightarrow \psi ))} then I know that ψ {\displaystyle \psi } ( K ψ {\displaystyle K\psi } ). Stronger constraints can be added. The following proof systems for L EL {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\textsf {EL}}} are often used in the literature. We define the set of proof systems L EL := { K , KD45 , S4 , S4.2 , S4.3 , S4.3.2 , S4.4 , S5 } {\displaystyle \mathbb {L} _{\textsf {EL}}:=\{{\textsf {K}},{\textsf {KD45}},{\textsf {S4}},{\textsf {S4.2}},{\textsf {S4.3}},{\textsf {S4.3.2}},{\textsf {S4.4}},{\textsf {S5}}\}} . Moreover, for all H ∈ L EL {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}\in \mathbb {L} _{\textsf {EL}}} , we define the proof system H C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{\textsf {C}}} by adding the following axiom schemes and rules of inference to those of H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} . For all A ⊆ A G T S {\displaystyle A\subseteq AGTS} , The relative strength of the proof systems for knowledge is as follows: S4 ⊂ S4.2 ⊂ S4.3 ⊂ S4.3.2 ⊂ S4.4 ⊂ S5 . {\displaystyle {\textsf {S4}}\subset {\textsf {S4.2}}\subset {\textsf {S4.3}}\subset {\textsf {S4.3.2}}\subset {\textsf {S4.4}}\subset {\textsf {S5}}.} So, all the theorems of S4.2 {\displaystyle {\textsf {S4.2}}} are also theorems of S4.3 , S4.3.2 , S4.4 {\displaystyle {\textsf {S4.3}},{\textsf {S4.3.2}},{\textsf {S4.4}}} and S5 {\displaystyle {\textsf {S5}}} . Many philosophers claim that in the most general cases, the logic of knowledge is S4.2 {\displaystyle {\textsf {S4.2}}} or S4.3 {\displaystyle {\textsf {S4.3}}} . Typically, in computer science and in many of the theories developed in artificial intelligence, the logic of belief (doxastic logic) is taken to be KD45 {\displaystyle {\textsf {KD45}}} and the logic of knowledge (epistemic logic) is taken to be S5 {\displaystyle {\textsf {S5}}} , even if S5 {\displaystyle {\textsf {S5}}} is only suitable for situations where the agents do not have mistaken beliefs. Br {\displaystyle {\textsf {Br}}} has been propounded by Floridi as the logic of the notion of 'being informed’ which mainly differs from the logic of knowledge by the absence of introspection for the agents. For all H ∈ L EL {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}\in \mathbb {L} _{\textsf {EL}}} , the class of H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} –models or H C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{\textsf {C}}} –models is the class of epistemic models whose accessibility relations satisfy the properties listed above defined by the axioms of H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} or H C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{\textsf {C}}} . Then, for all H ∈ L EL {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}\in \mathbb {L} _{\textsf {EL}}} , H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} is sound and strongly complete for L EL {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\textsf {EL}}} w.r.t. the class of H {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}} –models, and H C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{\textsf {C}}} is sound and strongly complete for L EL C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\textsf {EL}}^{\textsf {C}}} w.r.t. the class of H C {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}^{\textsf {C}}} –models. Decidability and Complexity The satisfiability problem for all the logics introduced is decidable. We list below the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem for each of them. Note that it becomes linear in time if there are only finitely many propositional letters in the language. For n ≥ 2 {\displaystyle n\geq 2} , if we restrict to finite nesting, then the satisfiability problem is NP-complete for all the modal logics considered. If we then further restrict the language to having only finitely many primitive propositions, the complexity goes down to linear in time in all cases. The computational complexity of the model checking problem is in
