ed titles, which would reportedly "allow [Ubisoft] to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them". Guillemot stated that this decision stemmed from the fact that "There are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich". Assassin's Creed Jade Assassin's Creed Jade is an upcoming title for Android and iOS devices. Set in Ancient China during the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century BC, the game will allow players to create their own custom character and will feature the same style of gameplay as the main console and PC releases. The game was first leaked as Project Jade on September 6, 2022, and reported by Try Hard Guides. A teaser trailer was showcased at Ubisoft Forward on September 10, which revealed the game's working title of Assassin's Creed: Codename Jade. In July 2023, a closed beta test for the game was announced, which required players to sign up between August 3 and 11 to participate. At Gamescom 2023, a gameplay trailer was shown and the game's official title was revealed to be Assassin's Creed Jade. Assassin's Creed: Codename Hexe Assassin's Creed: Codename Hexe was announced at Ubisoft Forward in September 2022 as the next flagship title in the series, following Shadows. Development is being led by Clint Hocking at Ubisoft Montreal. Marc-Alexis Côté described the title as "a very different type of Assassin's Creed game". While little on its setting was shown in its initial trailer, Bloomberg News reported that the game is set in Central Europe during the 16th century, at the height of the Holy Roman Empire, and will focus on witch hunts and other paranormal fears. Animus Hub The Animus Hub is a feature which made its debut in Assassin's Creed Shadows, intended to connect multiple installments of the Assassin's Creed franchise. Initially announced as a standalone launcher under the name Assassin's Creed Infinity, Ubisoft revealed more details about the Animus Hub in January 2025, ahead of Shadows' release, including the fact that it would be a component present in all upcoming Assassin's Creed titles, meant to help immerse players in the games' fictional universe. From the Animus Hub, players can launch all Assassin's Creed games installed on their system, complete "Projects" to earn in-game rewards, and access an extensive database called "the Vault", which also contains elements related to the overarching modern-day narrative. At launch, the only games to be included in the Animus Hub were Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, Mirage, and Shadows, with more titles set to be added over time. The Animus Hub was first announced as a new live-service title codenamed Assassin's Creed Infinity in April 2021. Following another round of sexual misconduct allegations and internal investigations across Ubisoft in 2020 and 2021, which saw the departure of many top-level executives as well as attrition from its studios, Ubisoft opted to merge operations of the Montreal and Quebec studios under one administrative body, with Quebec taking the lead on the Assassin's Creed series. This led to a collaboration to develop the "most ambitious game" in the series to date: Assassin's Creed Infinity. Infinity was initially envisioned to be similar to Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto Online, in that it would be more of a service, rather than a game, intended to be an entry point for future Assassin's Creed titles for players as well as to simplify the development of these games across Ubisoft's studios. Marc-Alexis Côté, from Ubisoft Quebec, was announced to serve as Infinity's executive producer. According to Côté, Infinity would be used to present the modern-day setting of the Assassin's Creed games involving the Animus, while each game would be focused on the historical setting. Clint Hocking and Jonathan Dumont serve as the creative directors, leading the Montreal and Quebec divisions, respectively. Étienne Allonier and Julien Laferrière, both from Montreal, serve as brand director and se
