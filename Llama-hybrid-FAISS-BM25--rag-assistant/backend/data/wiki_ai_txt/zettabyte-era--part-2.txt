 uses current and past global IP traffic statistics to forecast future trends. The report predicts trends between 2016 and 2021. Some of the predictions for 2021 found in the report are: Global IP traffic will triple and is estimated to reach 3.3 ZB per annum. In 2016 video traffic (e.g. Netflix and YouTube) accounted for 73% of total traffic. In 2021 this will increase to 82%. The number of devices connected to IP networks will be more than three times the global population. The amount of time it would take for one person to watch the entirety of video that will traverse global IP networks in one month is 5 million years. PC traffic will be exceeded by smartphone traffic. PC traffic will account for 25% of total IP traffic while smartphone traffic will be 33%. There will be a twofold increase in broadband speeds. Factors There are many factors that brought about the rise of the Zettabyte Era. Increases in video streaming, mobile phone usage, broadband speeds and data center storage are all contributing factors that led to the rise (and continuation) of data consumption, creation and replication. Increased video streaming There is a large, and ever-growing consumption of multimedia, including video streaming, on the Internet that has contributed to the rise of the Zettabyte Era. In 2011 it was estimated that roughly 25%â€“40% of IP traffic was taken up by video streaming services. Since then, video IP traffic has nearly doubled to an estimated 73% of total IP traffic. Furthermore, Cisco has predicted that this trend will continue into the future, estimating that by 2021, 82% of total IP traffic will come from video traffic. The amount of data used by video streaming services depends on the quality of the video. Thus, Android Central breaks down how much data is used (on a smartphone) with regards to different video resolutions. According to their findings, per hour video between 240p and 320p resolution uses roughly 0.3 GB. Standard video, which is clocked in at a resolution of 480p, uses approximately 0.7 GB per hour. High-definition video which varies between 720p and 2k resolution uses about 0.9 GB (720p), 1.5 GB (1080p) and 3 GB (2k) per hour. Finally, 4K video, known as ultra-high-definition video, uses about 7.2 GB per hour. Netflix and YouTube are at the top of the list in terms of the most globally streamed video services online. In 2016, Netflix represented 32.72% of all video streaming IP traffic, while YouTube represented 17.31%. The third spot is taken up by Amazon Prime Video where global data usage comes in at 4.14%. Netflix Currently, Netflix is the largest paid video streaming service in the world, accessible in over 200 countries and with more than 80 million subscribers. Streaming high definition video content through Netflix uses roughly 3 GB of data per hour, while standard definition takes up around 1 GB of data per hour. In North America, during peak bandwidth consumption hours (around 8 PM) Netflix uses about 40% of total network bandwidth. The vast amount of data marks an unparalleled period in time and is one of the major contributing factors that has led the world into the Zettabyte Era. YouTube YouTube is another major video streaming (and video uploading) service, whose data consumption rate across both fixed and mobile networks remains quite large. In 2016, the service was responsible for using up about 20% of total Internet traffic and 40% of mobile traffic. As of 2018, 300 hours of YouTube video content is uploaded every minute. Increased wireless and mobile traffic The usage of mobile technologies to access IP networks has resulted in an increase in overall IP traffic in the Zettabyte Era. In 2016, the majority of devices that moved IP traffic and other data streams were hard-wired devices. Since then, wireless and mobile traffic have increased and are predicted to continue to increase rapidly. Cisco predicts that by the year 2021, wired devices will account for 37% of total traffic while the rema
