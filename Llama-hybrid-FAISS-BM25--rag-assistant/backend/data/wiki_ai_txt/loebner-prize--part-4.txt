018 Loebner Prize was held at Bletchley Park on 8 September 2018. This was the final time it would be held in its traditional Turing Test format and its final time at Bletchley Park. The ranks were as follows: 1st place: Mitsuku 2nd place: Tutor 3rd place: Colombina 4th place: Uberbot 2019 The 2019 Loebner Prize was held at the University of Swansea from 12th–15th September, as part of a larger exhibition which looked at creativity in computers. The format of the contest changed from being a traditional Turing Test, with selected judges and humans, into a 4 day testing session where members of the general public, including schoolchildren, could interact with the bots, knowing in advance that the bots were not humans. Seventeen bots took part instead of the usual 4 finalists. Steve Worswick won for a record 5th time with Mitsuku, which enabled him to be included in the Guinness Book of Records. A selected jury of judges also examined and voted for the ones they liked best. The ranks were as follows: Most humanlike chatbot: 1st place: Mitsuku – 24 points 2nd place: Uberbot – 6 points 3rd place: Anna – 5 points Best overall chatbot 1st place: Mitsuku – 19 points 2nd place: Uberbot – 5 points 3rd place: Arckon – 4 points Winners Official list of winners.
