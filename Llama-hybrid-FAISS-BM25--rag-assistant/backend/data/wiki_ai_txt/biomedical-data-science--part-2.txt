s the data in the HGP, as the human genome contains over 6 billion DNA base pairs. Scientists constructed the genome by piecing together small fragments of DNA, and computing overlaps between these sequences alone required over 10,000 CPU hours. At this massive data scale, scientists relied on advanced algorithms to perform data processing steps such as sequence assembly and sequence alignment for quality control. Some of these algorithms, such as BLAST, are still used in modern bioinformatics. Scientists in the HGP also had to address complexities often associated with biomedical data including noisy data, such as DNA read errors, and privacy rights of the research subjects. The HGP, completed in 2004, has had immense impact both biologically, shedding light on human evolution, and medically, launching the field of bioinformatics and leading to technologies such as genetic screening and gene therapy. == References ==
