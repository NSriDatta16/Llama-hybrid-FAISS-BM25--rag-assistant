Fall is a 2022 survival psychological thriller film directed by Scott Mann, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jonathan Frank. The film stars Grace Caroline Currey, Virginia Gardner, Mason Gooding, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It follows two women who climb a 2,000-foot (610 m) decommissioned television tower, only to become stranded at the top with limited supplies and no means of communication. Produced on a budget of $3 million, Fall was released theatrically in the United States on August 12, 2022, by Lionsgate Films. It emerged as a commercial success, grossing $21 million worldwide. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the central performances by Currey and Gardner and the film's suspenseful premise, although some criticism was directed at the visual effects and screenplay. Plot Becky, her husband Dan, and their friend Hunter are rock climbing when Dan loses his footing and falls to his death. A year later, Becky has become reclusive and withdrawn, struggling with grief and contemplating suicide. She has also become estranged from her father, who believes Dan would not have mourned her in the same way. On the anniversary of Dan's death, Hunter invites Becky to climb the decommissioned 2,000-foot (610 m) B-67 TV tower in the desert. Hunter suggests scattering Dan's ashes from the top as a form of closure. Though hesitant, Becky agrees. After reaching the base, the two ascend via a series of rusted ladders to a small platform at the summit. There, Hunter encourages Becky to briefly free-hang from the platform while recording the moment for social media. Becky scatters Dan's ashes, and they begin their descentâ€”but a ladder segment breaks off, leaving them stranded at the top with no way down. Becky is slightly injured in the fall, and their backpack, containing water and a drone, lands on a satellite dish far below. With no cellular signal due to interference from the tower's communications equipment, the pair attempt various methods to attract help. Hunter places her phone in a shoe and drops it beyond the interference range, but it fails to result in rescue. They later spot two men with a dog nearby and signal them with a flare gun, but the men steal their car instead. Becky then discovers a tattoo on Hunter's ankle with the numbers "1-4-3," a code Dan used to say "I love you." Hunter admits to having had an affair with Dan before Becky's wedding. The next day, Hunter climbs down using their rope to retrieve the backpack. Though injured, she succeeds in tying the bag to the rope, and Becky hauls her back up. With power drawn from a warning light on the tower, Becky recharges the drone and sends it toward a nearby motel with a written message, but it is struck by a truck and destroyed. Becky realizes that Hunter fell and died as she was hauling her and the backpack up, and that she has been imagining Hunter's presence ever since. As Becky grows weaker from dehydration, a vulture attacks her wounded leg. She kills it and consumes part of it for nourishment. Regaining strength, Becky descends to Hunter's body, hides a phone with a text message to her father inside Hunter's shoe, and pushes the body along with the shoe off the tower. The message is transmitted upon impact. Rescue personnel are alerted and arrive shortly after. Becky is rescued and reunites with her father. Cast Production Development Fall was originally conceived as a short film. Director Scott Mann developed the idea while filming Final Score (2018) at a stadium in the United Kingdom. During production, Mann and his crew discussed the universal fear of heights and falling, which inspired him to create a narrative centered on vertical isolation and psychological tension. The project was later expanded into a feature-length survival thriller, with a screenplay co-written by Mann and Jonathan Frank. Casting Grace Caroline Currey and Virginia Gardner were cast in the lead roles of Becky and Hunter, respectively. Mason Gooding and Jeff
