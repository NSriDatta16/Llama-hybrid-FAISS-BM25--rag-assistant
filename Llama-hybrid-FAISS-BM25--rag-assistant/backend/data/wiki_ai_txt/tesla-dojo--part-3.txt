le packages 25 D1 chips into a 5×5 array. Each tile supports 36 TB/sec of aggregate bandwidth via 40 input/output (I/O) chips - half the bandwidth of the chip mesh network. Each tile supports 10 TB/sec of on-tile bandwidth. Each tile has 11 GB of SRAM memory (25 D1 chips × 360 cores/D1 × 1.25 MB/core). Each tile achieves 9 petaflops at BF16/CFloat8 precision (25 D1 chips × 376 TFLOP/D1). Each tile consumes 15 kilowatts; 288 amperes at 52 volts. System Tray Six tiles are aggregated into a System Tray, which is integrated with a host interface. Each host interface includes 512 x86 cores, providing a Linux-based user environment. Previously, the Dojo System Tray was known as the Training Matrix, which includes six Training Tiles, 20 Dojo Interface Processor cards across four host servers, and Ethernet-linked adjunct servers. It has 53,100 D1 cores. Dojo Interface Processor Dojo Interface Processor cards (DIP) sit on the edges of the tile arrays and are hooked into the mesh network. Host systems power the DIPs and perform various system management functions. A DIP memory and I/O co-processor hold 32 GB of shared HBM (either HBM2e or HBM3) – as well as Ethernet interfaces that sidestep the mesh network. Each DIP card has 2 I/O processors with 4 memory banks totaling 32 GB with 800 GB/sec of bandwidth. The DIP plugs into a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 slot that offers 32 GB/sec of bandwidth per card. Five cards per tile edge offer 160 GB/sec of bandwidth to the host servers and 4.5 TB/sec to the tile. Tesla Transport Protocol Tesla Transport Protocol (TTP) is a proprietary interconnect over PCI-Express. A 50 GB/sec TTP protocol link runs over Ethernet to access either a single 400 Gb/sec port or a paired set of 200 Gb/sec ports. Crossing the entire two-dimensional mesh network might take 30 hops, while TTP over Ethernet takes only four hops (at lower bandwidth), reducing vertical latency. Cabinet and ExaPOD Dojo stacks tiles vertically in a cabinet to minimize the distance and communications time between them. The Dojo ExaPod system includes 120 tiles, totaling 1,062,000 usable cores, reaching 1 exaflops at BF16 and CFloat8 formats. It has 1.3 TB of on-tile SRAM memory and 13 TB of dual in-line high bandwidth memory (HBM). Software Dojo supports the framework PyTorch, "Nothing as low level as C or C++, nothing remotely like CUDA". The SRAM presents as a single address space. Because FP32 has more precision and range than needed for AI tasks, and FP16 does not have enough, Tesla has devised 8- and 16-bit configurable floating point formats (CFloat8 and CFloat16, respectively) which allow the compiler to dynamically set mantissa and exponent precision, accepting lower precision in return for faster vector processing and reduced storage requirements.
