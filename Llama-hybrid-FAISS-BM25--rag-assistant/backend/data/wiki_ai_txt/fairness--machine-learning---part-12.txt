to be biased, so a different threshold may be required for each protected group to achieve fairness. A way to do this is plotting the true positive rate against the false negative rate at various threshold settings (this is called ROC curve) and find a threshold where the rates for the protected group and other individuals are equal. Reject option based classification Given a classifier let P ( + | X ) {\textstyle P(+|X)} be the probability computed by the classifiers as the probability that the instance X {\textstyle X} belongs to the positive class +. When P ( + | X ) {\textstyle P(+|X)} is close to 1 or to 0, the instance X {\textstyle X} is specified with high degree of certainty to belong to class + or – respectively. However, when P ( + | X ) {\textstyle P(+|X)} is closer to 0.5 the classification is more unclear. We say X {\textstyle X} is a "rejected instance" if m a x ( P ( + | X ) , 1 − P ( + | X ) ) ≤ θ {\textstyle max(P(+|X),1-P(+|X))\leq \theta } with a certain θ {\textstyle \theta } such that 0.5 < θ < 1 {\textstyle 0.5<\theta <1} . The algorithm of "ROC" consists on classifying the non-rejected instances following the rule above and the rejected instances as follows: if the instance is an example of a deprived group ( X ( A ) = a {\displaystyle X(A)=a} ) then label it as positive, otherwise, label it as negative. We can optimize different measures of discrimination (link) as functions of θ {\textstyle \theta } to find the optimal θ {\textstyle \theta } for each problem and avoid becoming discriminatory against the privileged group.
