Plot Set in the future, the plot follows Zoichi Kanoe and his AI companion Fuyu Kanoe, whose luminous form is integrated into the system of his motorcycle. They are agents sent by TOA Heavy Industries to retrieve humans with the ability to resist and transmute the N5S infection originating from Mars, which is spreading across the world fast, turning humans into "Drones"; disfigured, zombie-like beings. Organizations and characters TOA Heavy Industries TOA Heavy Industries (東亜重工, Tō-A Jūkō; "East-Asia Industries") is the main rival to the DRF. They are the creators of synthetic humans and have made it their priority to collect those who have adapted to the N5S virus before the DRF does. On February 26, 3006 A.D. TOA Heavy Industries's headquarters self-destructs, leaving the synthetic humans on their own. Zoichi Kanoe (庚 造一, Kanoe Zōichi) A synthetic human created by TOA Heavy Industries, and is on a mission to find humans that have adapted to the N5S virus.

He then starts to track her down. His weapon is a powerful pistol able to rapid firing and he rides a HDC-08B-3 TOA Industries Motorcycle. He is also equipped with a linear accelerator rifle and an axe for close combat. Fuyu Kanoe (カノエ·フユ, Kanoe Fuyu) A holographic AI personality of the large black motorcycle ridden by Zoichi.

She has similar weapons and vehicle as Zoichi. Shin Mizunoe (ミズノエ·シン, Mizunoe Shin) The male AI belonging to Nishu. Go Hinoto (丁 五宇, Hinoto Gō) He was killed early by Higuide after an otherwise successful intrusion of a Maximum Security Containment Facility, as depicted in the "Interlink" chapter. In there he discovered the new, less virulent pseudo-N5S virus and sent his AI into orbit with this information just before his death. Tyra Hinoto (ヒノト·タイラ, Hinoto Taira) A female AI that belonged to the now-deceased TOA Heavy Industries's synthetic human Go Hinoto and his destroyed motorcycle. She was sent into orbit by Go, and later fell down to Earth and was saved from DRF forces by Kozlov Leifnovic Grebnev. Soon after, she joins the Mizunoe unit. Data Recovery Foundation The Data Recovery Foundation (技術文化遺産復興財団, Gijutsu-Bunka-Isan-Fukkō-Zaidan; "Technology, Culture, and Heritage Restoration Foundation"), also known as the "DRF", was founded in 2272 under the name "Microvolt Corporation" and houses the main antagonists of the manga. They are trying to find all existing humans who have adapted to the N5S virus to use them to create their own immortals. They believe that all humans should be infected with the N5S virus, believing that it will remake some of them into the "new human race" and kill off the rest. They call this process "the baptism". After the destruction of TOA Heavy Industries's headquarters, they proclaim themselves the new world government. Niardi (ニアルディ, Niarudi) The overlord (or, "Matriarch") of the DRF and also the second oldest person in the world.
