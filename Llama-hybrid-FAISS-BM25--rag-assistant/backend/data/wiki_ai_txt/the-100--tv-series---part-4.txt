 generally admirable." In a review of the third-season finale, Mariya Karimjee of Vulture wrote: "Every moment of this finale is pitch-perfect: the choreography of the fight scenes, the plotting and pacing, and the stunning way in which the episode finally reaches it apex. [The episode] elevates the season's themes and pulls together its disparate story lines, setting us up nicely for season four." In his review of the finale and the season overall, Fowle of The A.V. Club stated: "This has been a rocky season. The first half of it was defined by shoddy character motivations and oversized villains. The second half has done some work to bring the show back from the brink, [...] paying off with "a thrilling, forward-thinking finale that provides some necessary closure to this season." The fourth season received a 93 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.22/10 based on 14 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "Season 4 of The 100 rewards longtime viewers with a deeper look at their favorite characters, as well as adding exceptional nuance and depth to their thrilling circumstances." The latter half of the fourth season received better reception than the first, with the episodes "Die All, Die Merrily" and "Praimfaya" often cited as the best episodes of the season. "Die All, Die Merrily" has a 9.5/10 rating from IGN, a 5/5 rating from Vulture, and an A rating from The AV Club. "Praimfaya" has a 9.0/10 from IGN and an A rating from The AV Club. On Rotten Tomatoes, the fifth season has a 100 percent with an average of 8.31/10, based on 13 reviews. The site's consensus is, "Five years in, The 100 manages to top itself once again with a audacious, addicting season." In a 4.5/5 review from Den of Geek, the third episode "Sleeping Giants" is described as a "good ol' fashioned episode of The 100", praising its balance of action, humour, and rich relationships. The sixth season also has a 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, averaging a score of 7.20/10 based on 10 reviews. The site's consensus is, "The 100 successfully resets its game, proving that conflict lies within these characters rather than their environment, and sows the seeds for a killer final season." In particular, the sixth season's change of scenery was the subject of a range of reactions. Nicolene Putter of Cultured Vultures praised the new storylines, stating "the cutthroat plotlines will always have you sitting on the edge of your seat", and Selina Wilken of Hypable praised the season premiere for, despite introducing a lot of new information, overall being "a solid opening hour of a semi-reset version of The 100". On the other hand, Yana Grebenyuk of TV Fanatic criticized the various subplots, referring to the season finale "The Blood of Sanctum" as "a collective statement on what happens when there's too much plot and not enough time found to pace it". The seventh season has a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.50/10 based on 8 reviews. While the earlier episodes of season seven, such as the backdoor pilot to the cancelled prequel series "Anaconda", were generally met with praise, the later episodes and in particular the season and series finale received backlash. The 13th episode, "Blood Giant", was panned by critics and fans alike for its killing of Bellamy, one of the show's leads since the first season. Grebenyuk called the episode out for "undermin[ing] the two leads, their love for one another, and the show's entire message"; Den of Geek reviewer Delia Harrington viewed his re-characterization and subsequent death as "baffling". The season's final episode and series finale, "The Last War", was also widely criticized as an ineffective end to the series. Zack Giaimo of FanSided writes "despite some good scenes, the series finale of The 100 wastes a lot of the character development of the last seven seasons". In a more positive review, a SpoilerTV reviewer said that while the finale was not without mistakes, it was enough to
