n U {\displaystyle U} (ordinal in the sense that only the sign of the differences between two utilities, and not the level of each utility, is meaningful), depending on the amounts of commodities x 1 , x 2 , … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n}} consumed. The model further assumes that the consumer has a budget M {\displaystyle M} which is used to purchase a vector x 1 , x 2 , … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n}} in such a way as to maximize U ( x 1 , x 2 , … , x n ) . {\displaystyle U(x_{1},x_{2},\dots ,x_{n}).} The problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes a mathematical optimization problem, that is: max U ( x 1 , x 2 , … , x n ) {\displaystyle \max \,U(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n})} subject to: ∑ i = 1 n p i x i ≤ M , {\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}p_{i}x_{i}\leq M,} x i ≥ 0 for all i = 1 , 2 , … , n . {\displaystyle x_{i}\geq 0\;\;\;{\text{ for all }}i=1,2,\dots ,n.} This model has been used in a wide variety of economic contexts, such as in general equilibrium theory to show existence and Pareto efficiency of economic equilibria. Neighbour-sensing model is a model that explains the mushroom formation from the initially chaotic fungal network. In computer science, mathematical models may be used to simulate computer networks. In mechanics, mathematical models may be used to analyze the movement of a rocket model. See also References Further reading Books Aris, Rutherford [ 1978 ] ( 1994 ).
