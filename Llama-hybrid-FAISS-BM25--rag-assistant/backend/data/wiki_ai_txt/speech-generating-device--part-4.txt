sages relating to sport, then press the symbol showing a scoreboard to utter the phrase "What's the score?". Advantages of dynamic display devices include the availability of a much larger vocabulary, and the ability to see the sentence under construction A further advantage of dynamic display devices is that the underlying operating system is capable of providing options for multiple communication channels, including cell phone, text messaging and e-mail. Work by Link√∂ping University has shown that such email writing practices allowed children who were SGD users to develop new social skills and increase their social participation. Talking keyboards Low-cost systems can also include a keyboard and audio speaker combination without a dynamic display or visual screen. This type of keyboard sends typed text direct to an audio speaker. It can permit any phrase to be spoken without the need for a visual screen that is not always required. One simple benefit is that a talking keyboard, when used with a standard telephone or speakerphone, can enable a voice-impaired individual have two-way conversation over a telephone. Output The output of a SGD may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded words or phrases while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits the user to speak novel messages by typing new words. Today, individuals use a combination of recorded messages and text-to-speech techniques on their SGDs. However, some devices are limited to only one type of output. Digitized speech Words, phrases or entire messages can be digitized and stored onto the device for playback to be activated by the user. This process is formally known as Voice Banking. Advantages of recorded speech include that (a) it provides natural prosody and speech naturalness for the listener (e.g., person of the same age and gender as the AAC user can be selected to record the messages), and (b) it provides for additional sounds that may be important for the user such as laughing or whistling. Moreover, digitized SGDs provide a degree of normalcy both for the patient and for their families when they lose their ability to speak on their own. A major disadvantage of using only recorded speech is that users are unable to produce novel messages; they are limited to the messages pre-recorded into the device. Depending on the device, there may be a limit to the length of the recordings. Synthesized speech SGDs that use synthesized speech apply the phonetic rules of the language to translate the user's message into voice output (speech synthesis). Users have the freedom to create novel words and messages and are not limited to those that have been pre-recorded on their device by others. The use of synthesized speech has increased due to the creation of software that takes advantage of the user's existing computers and smartphones. AAC apps like Spoken or Avaz are available on Android and iOS, providing a way to use a speech-generating device without having to visit a doctor's office or learn to use specialized machinery. In many cases, these options are also more affordable than a dedicated device. Synthesized SGDs may allow multiple methods of message creation that can be used individually or in combination: messages can be created from letters, words, phrases, sentences, pictures, or symbols. With synthesized speech there is virtually unlimited storage capacity for messages with few demands on memory space. Synthesized speech engines are available in many languages, and the engine's parameters, such as speech rate, pitch range, gender, stress patterns, pauses, and pronunciation exceptions, can be manipulated by the user. Selection set and vocabulary The selection set of a SGD is the set of all messages, symbols and codes that are available to a person using that device. The content, organization, and updating of this selection set are areas of active research and are influen
