 have conflicting results in the overall success in detecting deepfakes, research has indicated that critical thinking and a skeptical outlook toward a presented piece of media are effective at assisting an individual in determining a deepfake. Media literacy frameworks promote critical analysis of media and the motivations behind the presentation of the associated content. Media literacy shows promise as a potential cognitive countermeasure when interacting with malicious deepfakes. Controversies In March 2024, a video clip was released by Buckingham Palace announcing that Kate Middleton had cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy. The appearance of a ring worn by Middleton in the clip fueled rumors that the clip was a deepfake. Johnathan Perkins, UCLA's Director of Race and Equity, doubted Middleton had cancer, and further speculated that she could be in critical condition or dead. Politics Recently, the use of deepfakes has inspired research on deepfake's capability and effects when used in disinformation campaigns. This capability has raised concerns, partly due to the potential of deepfakes to circumvent a person's skepticism and influence their views on an issue. Due to the continued advancement in technology that improves deceptive capabilities of deepfakes, some scholars believe that deepfakes could pose a significant threat to democratic societies. Studies have investigated the effects of political deepfakes. In two separate studies focusing on Dutch participants, it was found that deepfakes have varying effects on an audience. As a tool of disinformation, deepfakes did not necessarily produce stronger reactions or shifts in viewpoints than traditional textual disinformation. However, deepfakes did produce a reassuring effect on individuals who held preconceived notions that aligned with the viewpoint promoted by the deepfake disinformation in the study. Additionally, deepfakes are effective when designed to target a specific demographic segment related to a particular issue. "Microtargeting" involves understanding nuanced political issues of a specific demographic to create a targeted deepfake. The targeted deepfake is then used to connect with and influence the viewpoint of that demographic. Targeted deepfakes were found to be notably effective by the researchers. Research has also found that the political effects of deepfakes are not necessarily as straightforward or assured. Researchers in the United Kingdom uncovered that deepfake political disinformation does not have a guaranteed effect on populations beyond indications that it may sow distrust or uncertainty in a source that provides the deepfake. The implications of distrust in sources led researchers to conclude that deepfakes may have outsized effect in a "low-trust" information environment where public institutions are not trusted by the public. Across the world, there are key instances where deepfakes have been used to misrepresent well-known politicians and other public figures. Example events Barack Obama On 17 April 2018, American actor Jordan Peele, BuzzFeed, and Monkeypaw Productions posted a deepfake of Barack Obama to YouTube, which depicted Barack Obama cursing and calling Donald Trump names. In this deepfake, Peele's voice and face were transformed and manipulated into those of Obama. The intent of this video was to portray the dangerous consequences and power of deepfakes, and how deepfakes can make anyone say anything. Donald Trump On 5 May 2019, Derpfakes posted a deepfake of Donald Trump to YouTube, based on a skit Jimmy Fallon performed on The Tonight Show. In the original skit (aired 4 May 2016), Jimmy Fallon dressed as Donald Trump and pretended to participate in a phone call with Barack Obama, conversing in a manner that presented him to be bragging about his primary win in Indiana. In the deepfake, Jimmy Fallon's face was transformed into Donald Trump's face, with the audio remaining the same. This deepfake video was produced by Derpfakes
