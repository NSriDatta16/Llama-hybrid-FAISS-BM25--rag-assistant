often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real-time processing is emphasized by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software. It also implies that external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms. There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with the processing and analysis of images. For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications. Progress in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has improved the accurate detection of disease in medical images, particularly in cardiology, pathology, dermatology, and radiology. Finally, pattern recognition is a field that uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks. A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data. Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs. computer stereo vision. Applications Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them. The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap. Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields. Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications. In many computer-vision applications, computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for: Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applications; Assisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification system; Controlling processes, e.g., an industrial robot; Detecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industry; Interaction, e.g., as the input to a device for computer-human interaction; monitoring agricultural crops, e.g. an open-source vision transformers model has been developed to help farmers automatically detect strawberry diseases with 98.4% accuracy. Modeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modeling; Navigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robot; Organizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences. Tracking surfaces or planes in 3D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences. Analyzing the condition of facilities in industry or construction. Automatic real-time lip-reading for devices and apps to assist people with disabilities. For 2024, the leading areas of computer vision were industry (market size US$5.22 billion), medicine (market size US$2.6 billion), military (market size US$996.2 million). Medicine One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient. An example of this is the detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes, and a variety of dental pathologies; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc. are another example. It also supports medical research by providing new information: e.g., about the structure of the brain or the quality of medical treatments. Applications of computer vision in the medical area also include enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or X-ray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise. Machin
