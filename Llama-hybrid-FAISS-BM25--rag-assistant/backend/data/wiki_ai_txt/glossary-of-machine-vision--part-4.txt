or photographic images. K Kell factor. It is a parameter used to determine the effective resolution of a discrete display device. L Laser. In physics, a laser is a device that emits light through a specific mechanism for which the term laser is an acronym: light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Lens. A lens is a device that causes light to either converge and concentrate or to diverge, usually formed from a piece of shaped glass. Lenses may be combined to form more complex optical systems as a Normal lens or a Telephoto lens. Lens Controller. A lens controller is a device used to control a motorized (ZFI) lens. Lens controllers may be internal to a camera, a set of switches used manually, or a sophisticated device that allows control of a lens with a computer. Lighting. Lighting refers to either artificial light sources such as lamps or to natural illumination. M Metrology. Metrology is the science of measurement. There are many applications for machine vision in metrology. machine vision. MV is the application of computer vision to industry and manufacturing. Motion perception. MP is the process of inferring the speed and direction of objects and surfaces that move in a visual scene given some visual input. N Neural network. A NN is an interconnected group of artificial neurons that uses a mathematical or computational model for information processing based on a connectionist approach to computation. In most cases an ANN is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network. Normal lens. In machine vision a normal or entrocentric lens is a lens that generates images that are generally held to have a "natural" perspective compared with lenses with longer or shorter focal lengths. Lenses of shorter focal length are called wide-angle lenses, while longer focal length lenses are called telephoto lenses. O Optical character recognition. Usually abbreviated to OCR, involves computer software designed to translate images of typewritten text (usually captured by a scanner) into machine-editable text, or to translate pictures of characters into a standard encoding scheme representing them in (ASCII or Unicode). Optical resolution. Describes the ability of a system to distinguish, detect, and/or record physical details by electromagnetic means. The system may be imaging (e.g., a camera) or non-imaging (e.g., a quad-cell laser detector). Optical transfer function. P Pattern recognition. This is a field within the area of machine learning. Alternatively, it can be defined as the act of taking in raw data and taking an action based on the category of the data. It is a collection of methods for supervised learning. Pixel. A pixel is one of the many tiny dots that make up the representation of a picture in a computer's memory or screen. Pixelation. In computer graphics, pixelation is an effect caused by displaying a bitmap or a section of a bitmap at such a large size that individual pixels, small single-colored square display elements that comprise the bitmap, are visible. Prime lens. Mechanical assembly of lenses whose focal length is fixed, as opposed to a zoom lens, which has a variable focal length. Q Q-Factor (Optics). In optics, the Q factor of a resonant cavity is given by Q = 2 π f o E P {\displaystyle Q={\frac {2\pi f_{o}{\mathcal {E}}}{P}}} , where f o {\displaystyle f_{o}} is the resonant frequency, E {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}} is the stored energy in the cavity, and P = − d E d t {\displaystyle P=-{\frac {dE}{dt}}} is the power dissipated. The optical Q is equal to the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth of the cavity resonance. The average lifetime of a resonant photon in the cavity is proportional to the cavity's Q. If the Q factor of a laser's cavity is abruptly changed from a low value to a high one, the laser will emit a pulse of light that is much more intense than the laser's normal continuous output. This technique is
