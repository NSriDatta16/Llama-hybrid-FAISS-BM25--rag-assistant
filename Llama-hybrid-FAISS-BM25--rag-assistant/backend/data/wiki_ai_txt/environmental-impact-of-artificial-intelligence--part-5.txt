Labor and Commerce Committee unanimously voted against the bill, expressing concerns that it might deter data center investments in the state. Additionally, House Bill 2035, introduced in the Virginia General Assembly, would require data centers to report quarterly on water and energy use to the Department of Environmental Quality, with the information made publicly accessible. European Union The European Union (EU) intends to regulate the environmental impact of artificial intelligence on multiple levels of government. The European Green Deal (EGD), set forth by the European Commission and approved in 2020, states its intention to utilize AI and other information and communication technology (ICT) to advance sustainability goals. Partnerships between the Commission and various European environmental and IT groups culminated in the development of the Green Deal Data Space (GDDS). As part of the European Data Portal, the GDDS project aims to aggregate cross-sectorial data in environmental and climate science to support the policy goals set forth in the EGD. AI agents can use the portal to find trends in the data and make recommendations to policymakers. Policy research undertaken at the request of the European Commission recommends the EU take a bolder stance against the environmental costs of AI. One ethics report advocates that AI systems "should take into account the environment, including other living beings, and their social and societal impact should be carefully considered." Other reports by EU sources and independent watchdogs point to the lack of environmental considerations in AI model prohibitions set forth in the European Artificial Intelligence Act, and advocate for the assessment of environmental risks posed by the proliferation of AI systems. A 2022 case study recommends the EU restrict market access for AI systems that fail to implement global emissions monitoring or reduction strategies, along with mandated efficiency improvements, industry-wide sustainability reporting, and standardized life-cycle assessments (LCAs). EU member states maintain individualized national AI strategies, many of which include sustainability goals. France France devises general environmental priorities in its national AI strategy report. Notably, it advocates that AI and data system development should be sustainably designed from the onset to support "the ecological transition of the European cloud industry." Furthermore, the report advocates for the publication of "ecological data" to promote AI-driven environmental solutions. The report also includes France's intention to support the adoption of AI for a more efficient grid and renewable energy transition. Germany Germany published its national AI strategy in December 2020 which includes dedicated sections on the environmental impacts of AI. These begin with the federal government's intention to thoroughly research and develop AI systems that can be used to promote energy efficiency, conservation, a circular economy, partnerships with higher education, natural resource management, and progress toward United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A subsequent section emphasizes the need for a reduction of energy consumption and a standardized environmental impact assessment (EIA) to create a net carbon-negative AI ecosystem. Germany also operates the "AI Lighthouses" program which issues grants directly to businesses, non-profits, and researchers utilizing AI to develop environmental solutions. As of 2024, the German German Federal Environmental Ministry (BMUv) has disbursed upwards of 70 million euros in funding through the initiative. Italy The Italian national strategy for AI, crafted by a dedicated working group appointed by the Ministry of Economic Development (MISE), aims to leverage Italy's advantage in AI research and development to regain momentum in achieving its SDGs. The report principally advocates for government-backed stimulus in the development of AI for sustai
