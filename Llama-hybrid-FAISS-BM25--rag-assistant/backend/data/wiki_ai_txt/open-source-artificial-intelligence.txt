Open-source artificial intelligence is an AI system that is freely available to use, study, modify, and share. These attributes extend to each of the system's components, including datasets, code, and model parameters, promoting a collaborative and transparent approach to AI development. Free and open-source software (FOSS) licenses, such as the Apache License, MIT License, and GNU General Public License, outline the terms under which open-source artificial intelligence can be accessed, modified, and redistributed. The open-source model provides wider access to AI technology, allowing more individuals and organizations to participate in AI research and development. In contrast, closed-source artificial intelligence is proprietary, restricting access to the source code and internal components. Companies often develop closed products in an attempt to keep a competitive advantage in the marketplace. However, some experts suggest that open-source AI tools may have a development advantage over closed-source products and have the potential to overtake them in the marketplace. Popular open-source artificial intelligence project categories include large language models, machine translation tools, and chatbots. For software developers to produce open-source artificial intelligence (AI) resources, they must trust the various other open-source software components they use in its development. Open-source AI software has been speculated to have potentially increased risk compared to closed-source AI as bad actors may remove safety protocols of public models as they wish. Similarly, closed-source AI has also been speculated to have an increased risk compared to open-source AI due to issues of dependence, privacy, opaque algorithms, corporate control and limited availability while potentially slowing beneficial innovation. There also is a debate about the openness of AI systems as openness is differentiated â€“ an article in Nature suggests that some systems presented as open, such as Meta's Llama 3, "offer little more than an API or the ability to download a model subject to distinctly non-open use restrictions". Such software has been criticized as "openwashing" systems that are better understood as closed. There are some works and frameworks that assess the openness of AI systems as well as a new definition by the Open Source Initiative about what constitutes open source AI. Some large language models are released as open-weight, which means that their trained parameters are publicly available, even if the training code and data aren't. History The history of open-source artificial intelligence is intertwined with both the development of AI technologies and the growth of the open-source software movement. Open-source AI has evolved significantly over the past few decades, with contributions from various academic institutions, research labs, tech companies, and independent developers. This section explores the major milestones in the development of open-source AI, from its early days to its current state. 1990s: Early development of AI and open-source software The concept of AI dates back to the mid-20th century, when computer scientists like Alan Turing and John McCarthy laid the groundwork for modern AI theories and algorithms. An early form of AI, the natural language processing "doctor" ELIZA, was re-implemented and shared in 1977 by Jeff Shrager as a BASIC program, and soon translated to many other languages. Early AI research focused on developing symbolic reasoning systems and rule-based expert systems. During this period, the idea of open-source software was beginning to take shape, with pioneers like Richard Stallman advocating for free software as a means to promote collaboration and innovation in programming. The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985 by Stallman, was one of the first major organizations to promote the idea of software that could be freely used, modified, and distributed. The ideas from this movement eventually
