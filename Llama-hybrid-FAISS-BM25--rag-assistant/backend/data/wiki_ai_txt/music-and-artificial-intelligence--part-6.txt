nt audio representations and thereby generate completely novel instrumental sounds. Music information retrieval (MIR) Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is the extraction of musically relevant information from audio recordings to be utilized in applications such as genre classification, instrument recognition, mood recognition, beat detection, and similarity estimation. CNNs on spectrogram features have been very accurate on these tasks. SVMs and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) are also used for classification on features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Hybrid and interactive systems Hybrid systems combine symbolic and sound-based methods to draw on their respective strengths. They can compose high-level symbolic compositions and synthesize them as natural sound. Interactive systems in real-time allow for AI to instantaneously respond to human input to support live performance. Reinforcement learning and rule-based agents tend to be utilized to allow for human–AI co-creation in improvisation contexts. Affective computing and emotion-aware music systems Affective computing techniques enable AI systems to classify or create music based on some affective content. The models use musical features such as tempo, mode, and timbre to classify or influence listener emotions. Deep learning models have been trained for classifying music based on affective content and even creating music intended to have affective impacts. AI-based music recommendation systems Music recommenders employ AI to suggest tracks to users based on what they have heard, their tastes, and information available in context. Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering are most widely applied, deep learning being utilized for fine-tuning. Graph-based and matrix factorization methods are used within commercial systems like Spotify and YouTube Music to represent complex user-item relationships. AI for automatic mixing and mastering AI is also used in audio engineering automation such as mixing and mastering. Such systems level, equalize, pan, and compress to give well-balanced sound outputs. Software such as LANDR and iZotope Ozone utilize machine learning in emulating professional audio engineers' decisions. Lyrics generation and songwriting aid Natural language generation also applies to songwriting assistance and lyrics generation. Transformer language models like GPT-3 have also been proven to be able to generate stylistic and coherent lyrics from input prompts, themes, or feeling. There even exist AI programs that assist with rhyme scheme, syllable count, and poem form. Multimodal and cross-modal systems Recent developments include multimodal AI systems that integrate music with other media, e.g., dance, video, and text. These can generate background scores in synchronization with video sequences or generate dance choreography from audio input. Cross-modal retrieval systems allow one to search for music using images, text, or gestures.
