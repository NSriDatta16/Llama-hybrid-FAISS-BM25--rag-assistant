pipeline components and workspace, MLCask can skip unchanged preprocessing steps to address the frequent retraining challenges. Its non-linear version control semantics and merge operation facilitate effective collaborative development of the pipeline. In-Database Model Selection Starting from version 4.1.0, Apache SINGA provides support for in-database model selection and inference in PostgreSQL. The system implements a resource-efficient two-phase model selection algorithm that incorporates both training-free and training-based model selection techniques. This model selection algorithm is integrated non-intrusively into PostgreSQL via stored procedures with optimizations on execution latency and memory consumption. The inclusion of in-database model selection empowers users to obtain high-performing models within their specified response time requirements. Applications Apache SINGA is in use at organizations such as NetEase, Carnegie Technologies, CBRE, Citigroup, JurongHealth Hospital, National University of Singapore, National University Hospital, Noblis, Shentilium Technologies, Singapore General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, YZBigData, and others. Apache SINGA is used across applications in banking, education, finance, healthcare, real estate, software development, and other categories. Apache SINGA and Social Good The Ng Teng Fong General Hospital collaborated with the Apache SINGA team to develop an application for people diagnosed with pre-diabetes, a condition where blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. The application called JurongHealth Food Log (JHFoodLg) app, uses Apache SINGA to match photos of food to a database of local dishes - including nasi padang, laksa and char siew rice - and utilises nutrition data from the Health Promotion Board, JurongHealth Campus, and the Australian Food and Nutrient Database. After comprehensive data cleaning (e.g., consistent formatting, deduplication, foodness classification, human calibration), the database contains 209, 861 images, covering 13 food groups and 233 food categories. The app allows users from the hospital's Lifestyle Intervention (Liven) programme to set weight loss and exercise goals. A six-month study shows that almost all 20 patients who used the app lost between 4 and 5 percent of their initial bodyweight.
