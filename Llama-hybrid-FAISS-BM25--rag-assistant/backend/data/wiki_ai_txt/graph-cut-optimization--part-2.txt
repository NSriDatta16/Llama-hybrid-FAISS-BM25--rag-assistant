tions to two variables, obtained by fixing the value of the remaining variable, are submodular. For higher-order functions, regularity is a necessary condition for representability. Graph construction Graph construction for a representable function is simplified by the fact that the sum of two representable functions f ′ {\displaystyle f'} and f ″ {\displaystyle f''} is representable, and its graph G = ( V ′ ∪ V ″ , E ′ ∪ E ″ ) {\displaystyle G=(V'\cup V'',E'\cup E'')} is the union of the graphs G ′ = ( V ′ , E ′ ) {\displaystyle G'=(V',E')} and G ″ = ( V ″ , E ″ ) {\displaystyle G''=(V'',E'')} representing the two functions. Such theorem allows to build separate graphs representing each term and combine them to obtain a graph representing the entire function. The graph representing a quadratic function of n {\displaystyle n} variables contains n + 2 {\displaystyle n+2} vertices, two of them representing the source and sink and the others representing the variables. When representing higher-order functions, the graph contains auxiliary nodes that allow to model higher-order interactions. Unary terms A unary term w i {\displaystyle w_{i}} depends only on one variable x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} and can be represented by a graph with one non-terminal node v i {\displaystyle v_{i}} and one edge s → v i {\displaystyle s\rightarrow v_{i}} with weight w i ( 1 ) − w i ( 0 ) {\displaystyle w_{i}(1)-w_{i}(0)} if w i ( 1 ) ≥ w i ( 0 ) {\displaystyle w_{i}(1)\geq w_{i}(0)} , or v i → t {\displaystyle v_{i}\rightarrow t} with weight w i ( 0 ) − w i ( 1 ) {\displaystyle w_{i}(0)-w_{i}(1)} if w i ( 1 ) < w i ( 0 ) {\displaystyle w_{i}(1)<w_{i}(0)} . Binary terms A quadratic (or binary) term w i j {\displaystyle w_{ij}} can be represented by a graph containing two non-terminal nodes v i {\displaystyle v_{i}} and v j {\displaystyle v_{j}} . The term can be rewritten as w i j ( x i , x j ) = w i j ( 0 , 0 ) + k i x i + k j x j + k i j ( ( 1 − x i ) x j + x i ( 1 − x j ) ) {\displaystyle w_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j})=w_{ij}(0,0)+k_{i}x_{i}+k_{j}x_{j}+k_{ij}\left((1-x_{i})x_{j}+x_{i}(1-x_{j})\right)} with k i = 1 2 ( w i j ( 1 , 0 ) − w i j ( 0 , 0 ) ) k j = 1 2 ( w i j ( 1 , 1 ) − w i j ( 1 , 0 ) ) k i j = 1 2 ( w i j ( 0 , 1 ) + w i j ( 1 , 0 ) − w i j ( 0 , 0 ) − w i j ( 1 , 1 ) ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}k_{i}&={\frac {1}{2}}(w_{ij}(1,0)-w_{ij}(0,0))\\k_{j}&={\frac {1}{2}}(w_{ij}(1,1)-w_{ij}(1,0))\\k_{ij}&={\frac {1}{2}}(w_{ij}(0,1)+w_{ij}(1,0)-w_{ij}(0,0)-w_{ij}(1,1)).\end{aligned}}} In this expression, the first term is constant and it is not represented by any edge, the two following terms depend on one variable and are represented by one edge, as shown in the previous section for unary terms, while the third term is represented by an edge v i → v j {\displaystyle v_{i}\rightarrow v_{j}} with weight w i j ( 0 , 1 ) + w i j ( 1 , 0 ) − w i j ( 0 , 0 ) − w i j ( 1 , 1 ) {\displaystyle w_{ij}(0,1)+w_{ij}(1,0)-w_{ij}(0,0)-w_{ij}(1,1)} (submodularity guarantees that the weight is non-negative). Ternary terms A cubic (or ternary) term w i j k {\displaystyle w_{ijk}} can be represented by a graph with four non-terminal nodes, three of them ( v i {\displaystyle v_{i}} , v j {\displaystyle v_{j}} and v k {\displaystyle v_{k}} ) associated to the three variables plus one fourth auxiliary node v i j k {\displaystyle v_{ijk}} . A generic ternary term can be rewritten as the sum of a constant, three unary terms, three binary terms, and a ternary term in simplified form. There may be two different cases, according to the sign of p = w i j k ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) + w i j k ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) + w i j k ( 1 , 0 , 1 ) + w i j k ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) {\displaystyle p=w_{ijk}(0,0,0)+w_{ijk}(0,1,1)+w_{ijk}(1,0,1)+w_{ijk}(1,1,0)} . If p > 0 {\displaystyle p>0} then w i j k ( x i , x j , x k ) = w i j k ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) + p 1 ( x i − 1 ) + p 2 ( x j − 1 ) + p 3 ( x k − 1 ) + p 23 ( x j − 1 ) x k + p 31 x i ( x k − 1 ) + p 12 ( x i − 1 ) x j − p x i x j x k {\displaystyle w_{ijk}(x_{i},x_{
