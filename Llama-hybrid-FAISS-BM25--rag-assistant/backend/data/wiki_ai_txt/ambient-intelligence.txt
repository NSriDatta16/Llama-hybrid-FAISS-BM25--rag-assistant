Ambient intelligence (AmI) refers to environments with electronic devices that are aware of and can recognize the presence of human beings and adapt accordingly. This concept encompasses various technologies in consumer electronics, telecommunications, and computing. Its primary purpose is to enhance user interactions through context-aware systems. AmI aims to create environments where devices communicate seamlessly with users, leveraging data from interconnected systems. A common example of Aml is the Internet of things (IoT), which integrates everyday devices into networks that provide intelligent responses based on user behavior. The term "ambient intelligence" was coined in the late 1990s by Eli Zelkha and his team at Palo Alto Ventures. The project envisioned a future where technology would seamlessly blend with daily life. In the early 2000s, the concept gained further attention when the Information Society and Technology Advisory Group (ISTAG) of the European Commission published a series of reports on the topic. Ambient intelligence has been characterized as a speculative or imaginary concept. Overview The concept of ambient intelligence builds upon pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing, profiling, context awareness, and human-centered computer interaction design. It is characterized by systems and technologies that are: Embedded: Networked devices are integrated into their environment. Transparent: The devices themselves are invisible to users, providing unobtrusive interaction. Context aware: The devices can sense people and their situations. Personalized: They can be tailored to meet the user's needs. Adaptive: They are capable of changing in response to human use. Anticipatory: They can calculate a user's preferences based on their past behavior. The implementation of ambient intelligence requires several technologies to exist. These include hidden hardware that benefit from miniaturisation, nanotechnology, and smart devices, along with human-centered computer interfaces (intelligent agents, multimodal interaction, context awareness, etc.). These systems and devices operate through a seamless mobile or fixed communication and computing infrastructure characterized by interoperability, wired and wireless networks, and service-oriented architecture. Systems and devices must also be dependable and secure. This could be achieved through self-testing and self-repairing software and privacy-ensuring technology. Ambient intelligence has a relationship with and depends on advances in sensor technology and sensor networks. User experience became more important to developers in the late 1990s as a result of experiences with digital products that were difficult to understand or use. In response, user experience design emerged to create new technologies and media around the user's personal experience. Ambient intelligence is influenced by user-centered design, in which the user is placed in the centre of design activity and gives feedback to the designer. History and invention In 1998, the management board of Philips Research commissioned a series of presentations and internal workshops organized by Eli Zelkha and Brian Epstein of Palo Alto Ventures. They investigated future scenarios and how consumer devices might advance over the next quarter-century. Zelkha and Epstein described the high-volume consumer electronics industry of the 1990s as "fragmented with features", contrasted by what they envisioned as the emergence of industry trends where user-friendly devices would support ubiquitous information, communication, and entertainment by 2020. As a result, the term "ambient intelligence" was coined. While developing the ambient intelligence concept, Palo Alto Ventures created the keynote address for Roel Pieper of Philips for the Digital Living Room Conference of 1998, which included Eli Zelkha, Brian Epstein, Simon Birrell, Doug Randall and Clark Dodsworth. In 2000, there were plans to construct a feasible and usable fa
