identity map inside the interval. The module Q ( I ) {\displaystyle Q(I)} is sometimes referred to as an interval module. Then for any R {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } -indexed persistence module M {\displaystyle M} of finite type, there exists a multiset B M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{M}} of intervals such that M ≅ ⨁ I ∈ B M Q ( I ) {\displaystyle M\cong \bigoplus _{I\in {\mathcal {B}}_{M}}Q(I)} , where the direct sum of persistence modules is carried out index-wise. The multiset B M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}_{M}} is called the barcode of M {\displaystyle M} , and it is unique up to a reordering of the intervals. This result was extended to the case of pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules indexed over an arbitrary totally-ordered set by William Crawley-Boevey and Magnus Botnan in 2020, building upon known results from the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a PID, as well as the work of Cary Webb for the case of the integers. == References ==
