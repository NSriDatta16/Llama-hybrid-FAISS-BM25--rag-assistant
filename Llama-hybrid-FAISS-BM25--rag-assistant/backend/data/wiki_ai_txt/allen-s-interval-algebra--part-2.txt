whether Harold II was killed at the beginning or during or at the end of the battle, i.e. whether X m Y {\displaystyle X\mathbf {\operatorname {m} } Y} , X o Y {\displaystyle X\mathbf {\operatorname {o} } Y} or X fi Y {\displaystyle X\mathbf {\operatorname {fi} } Y} applies (disjunctions such as { m , o , fi } {\displaystyle \mathbf {\{\operatorname {m} ,\operatorname {o} ,\operatorname {fi} \}} } cannot be expressed in CIDOC CRM, except in queries). If it is relevant for a particular historical question, it can be specified later by adding e.g. ends after the start of. CIDOC CRM distinguishes between events and their corresponding time intervals. Allen relations and temporal primitives are statements between events and only as a consequence between their time intervals. Another difference is that temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal entities in CIDOC CRM are seen as having fuzzy borders. Especially statements about exact simultaneity are otherwise extremely rare. Implementations A simple java library implementing the concept of Allen's temporal relations and the path consistency algorithm Java library implementing Allen's Interval Algebra (incl. data and index structures, e.g., interval tree) OWL-Time Time Ontology in OWL an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal properties of resources in the world or described in Web pages. GQR is a reasoner for Allen's interval algebra (and many others) qualreas is a Python framework for qualitative reasoning over networks of relation algebras, such as RCC-8, Allen's interval algebra, and Allen's algebra integrated with Time Points and situated in either Left- or Right-Branching Time. SparQ is a reasoner for Allen's interval algebra (and many others) EveXL is a small domain-specific language for the detection of events that implements the Interval Algebra's operators via ASCII art patterns.
