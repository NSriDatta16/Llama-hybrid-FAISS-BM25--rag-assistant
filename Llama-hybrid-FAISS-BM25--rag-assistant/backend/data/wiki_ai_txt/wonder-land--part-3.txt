trieve the phone. Luke agrees to meet her at the school gates. Matt and Bianca wonder if they should reconcile ("Man of Broken Glass"). At the school, Luke is reluctant to get involved; Aly decides to break into the office anyway. Luke contacts the girls who bullied Aly and tells them about Ms Manxome playing on Aly's stolen phone. They decide to spread the word that it is not Aly ("Fabulous (Reprise)"). Bianca goes to the police because Aly is missing, and gives her phone to Matt. Aly is likely to also be in Wonder.land. The avatars prepare for war against Alice but disagree about a strategy. At the police station, Matt hacks into Wonder.land sees Alice, and realizes that she is controlled by someone other than Aly. The White Rabbit appears (delighting Alice), but Ms Manxome makes Alice push him aside. The borderline between Wonder.land and reality begins to merge. Aly, in Ms Manxome's office, grabs the phone and they fight. In Wonder.land, Alice fights herself and the Red Queen. In her confusion she beheads the White Rabbit with the vorpal sword, and the MC declares that she will be deleted. Ms Manxome grabs the phone back, and the fight resumes. Matt and Bianca realize that Aly is in Ms Manxome's office. Online, the three girls and Luke watch. Luke hacks Wonder.land to include zombies from Zombie Swarm. Ms Manxome is about to guillotine Aly in her office. Alice aims the vorpal sword at Luke and innocently kisses him, appalling him. Ms Manxome makes Alice kill Luke ("Who is Alice?"), realizes the error of her way after being horrified by what she does, Alice finally snaps and fights off the Red Queen, which causes them to glitch away. Before Alice is deleted, she apologises for her behavior, and says that her quest was to help Aly understand who she was. Aly thanks her and says goodbye, and Alice disappears. Wonder.land and reality separate, and Aly is reunited with Matt and Bianca; Luke livestreams Ms Manxome as evidence. Ms Manxome thinks she is innocent ("I'm Right (Reprise)"), and will expel Aly and Luke. Matt finds Aly's phone and reminds Ms Manxome that she spent Aly's money on purchases for Wonder.land. PC Rook arrests Ms Manxome, while Aly finds herself in Alice, who lives on in her memory ("Secrets (Reprise)"), Several months later, Aly, now living in new life, goes online and learns that her friends in Wonder.land want her back. Aly decides not to because she now cares about her family ("Wonder. land (Reprise)").
