rmovement organizations; and consciousness raising during episodes of collective action". History Word-selection has been a component of rhetoric. Most commentators attribute the concept of framing to the work of Erving Goffman on frame analysis and point to his 1974 book, Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience. Goffman used the idea of frames to label "schemata of interpretation" that allow individuals or groups "to locate, perceive, identify, and label" events and occurrences, thus rendering meaning, organizing experiences, and guiding actions. Goffman's framing concept evolved out of his 1959 work, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, a commentary on the management of impressions. These works arguably depend on Kenneth Boulding's concept of image. Social movement theory Sociologists have utilized framing to explain the process of social movements. Movements act as carriers of beliefs and ideologies (compare memes). In addition, they operate as part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers. Sociologists deem the mobilization of mass-movements "successful" when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. Ultimately, effective framing can shape movement outcomes by influencing public perception, strengthening collective identity, and opening political opportunities. Framing is not a static process but an ongoing negotiation shaped by discursive, strategic, and contested processes. Movements create narratives through discussion and storytelling, strategically align their messages with broader cultural themes, and continuously adapt to opposition. Strategies such as bridging (connecting with related movements), amplification (emphasizing key themes), extension (broadening issues to attract new supporters), and transformation (redefining societal meanings) all play a role in shaping movement discourse. However, movements must also contend with counterframing from opponents, internal frame disputes, and the evolving relationship between frames and real-world events. The success of a movementâ€™s framing efforts is influenced by external factors such as political opportunities, cultural resonance, and audience reception. Political conditions can facilitate or constrain framing efforts, while cultural narratives determine how well movement messages resonate with the public. Additionally, movements often tailor their frames to appeal to different audiences, from policymakers and the media to grassroots activists and potential recruits. Frame alignment Snow and Benford (1988) regard frame-alignment as an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, "frame alignment" occurs, producing "frame resonance", a catalyst in the process of a group making the transition from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts prove successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts include the following: "The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort". Snow and Benford (1988) identify three core framing-tasks, and state that the degree to which framers attend to these tasks will determine participant mobilization. They characterize the three tasks as the following: diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief-system; centrality: the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness, if the framer links the frame to only one core belief or value that, in itself, has a limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted.
