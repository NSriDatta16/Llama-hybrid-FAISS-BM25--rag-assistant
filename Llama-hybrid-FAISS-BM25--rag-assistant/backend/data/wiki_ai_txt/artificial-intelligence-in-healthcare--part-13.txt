ce the data and make comparability difficult. However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data. A final source of algorithmic bias, which has been called "label choice bias", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. Solutions to the "label choice bias" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program. History Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system, known as Dendral. While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN, considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, Bayesian networks, and artificial neural networks, have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing Growth of genomic sequencing databases Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision, enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery Increased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors Improvements in deep learning techniques and data logs for rare diseases See also External links Artificial Intelligence in healthcare on europa.eu Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Medical Devices on fda.gov References == Further reading ==
