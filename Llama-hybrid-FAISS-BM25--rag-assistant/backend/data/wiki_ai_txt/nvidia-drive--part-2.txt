er CPU/iGPU devices and two Turing generation dGPUs. The companies stated the third generation Drive PX system would be capable of Level 5 autonomous driving, with a total of 320 INT8 TOPS of AI computational power and a 500 Watts TDP. Ampere based DRIVE AGX Orin The Drive AGX Orin board family was announced on December 18, 2019, at GTC China 2019. On May 14, 2020, Nvidia announced that Orin would be utilizing the new Ampere GPU microarchitecture and would begin sampling for manufacturers in 2021 and be available for production in 2022. Follow up variants are expected to be further equipped with chip models and/or modules from the Tegra Orin SoC. Ada Lovelace based DRIVE Atlan (Cancelled) Nvidia announced the SoC codenamed Atlan on April 12, 2021 at GTC 2021. Nvidia announced the cancellation of Atlan on September 20, 2022, which was supposed to be equipped with a Grace-Next CPU, and an Ada Lovelace based GPU, and Nvidia announced that their next SoC was called Thor. Blackwell based DRIVE AGX Thor Announced on September 20, 2022, Nvidia DRIVE AGX Thor comes equipped with an Arm Neoverse V3AE CPU, and a Blackwell based GPU, which was announced on March 18, 2024. It features 8-bit floating point support (FP8) and delivers 1000 Sparse INT8 TOPS, 1000 Sparse FP8 TFLOPS or 500 Sparse FP16 TFLOPS of performance. Two Thor SoCs can be connected via NVLink-C2C. BYD, Hyper, XPENG, Li Auto and ZEEKR have said to be use DRIVE AGX Thor in their vehicles. The Lynk & Co 900 is the first production vehicle to feature the DRIVE AGX Thor SoC. Software and bundling With the label Hyperion added to their reference platform series Nvidia promotes their mass products so that others can easily test drive and then create their own automotive grade products on top. Especially the feature rich software part of the base system is meant to be a big help for these others to quickly go ahead into developing their application specific solutions. Third-party companies, such as DeepRoute.ai, have publicly indicated using these software platform as their base of choice. The whole design is concentrating on UNIX/Posix compatible or derived runtime environments (Linux, Android, QNX - aka the DRIVE OS variants) with special support for the semiconductors mentioned before in form of internal (CUDA, Vulkan) and external support (special interfaces and drivers for camera, lidar, CAN and many more) of the respective reference boards. For clearness Nvidia bundles the core of the developer needed software as Drive SDK that is sub-divided into DRIVE OS, DriveWorks, DRIVE AV, and DRIVE IX components. Note: As of now the above table is still 'fresh' and thus might be incomplete. Developer kit comparison Note: dGPU and memory are stand-alone semiconductors; all other components, especially ARM CPU cores, iGPU, DLA and PVA are integrated components of the listed main computing device(s). Tesla 2.0 and 2.5 are products, not developer kits. == References ==
