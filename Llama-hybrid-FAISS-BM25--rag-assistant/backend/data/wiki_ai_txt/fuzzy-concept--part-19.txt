a finished, unchangeable system. Mathematical theory and language are ways of understanding the world which keep developing and changing, in response to new discoveries (without certainty about what the future could bring). Zalta's metaphysics In his meta-mathematical metaphysics, Edward N. Zalta has claimed that for every set of properties of a concrete object, there always exists exactly one abstract object that encodes exactly that set of properties and no others — a foundational assumption or axiom for his ontology of abstract objects By implication, for every fuzzy object there would always exist at least one defuzzified concept which encodes it exactly. It is a modern interpretation of Plato's metaphysics of knowledge, which expresses confidence in the ability of science to conceptualize the world exactly. However, such a theory — like any metaphysical theory — is impossible to test definitively. According to the Dutch computational linguist Kees van Deemter, "The fact that vagueness abounds in the presentation of mathematical results suggests that vagueness plays an important role in our thinking, even when the concepts about which we think are completely crisp." Platonism versus cognitive realism The Platonic-style interpretation of concepts was critiqued by Hartry H. Field. Mark Balaguer argues that we do not really know whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether Platonic realism is definitely true or false. Defending a cognitive realism, Scott Soames argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution of the meaning of concepts and propositions was misconceived. Traditionally, it was thought that concepts can be truly representational, because ultimately they are related to intrinsically representational Platonic complexes of universals and particulars (see theory of forms). However, once concepts and propositions are regarded as cognitive-event types, it is possible to claim that they are able to be representational, because they are constitutively related to intrinsically representational cognitive acts in the real world. As another philosopher put it, "The question of how we can know the world around us is not entirely unlike the question of how it is that the food our environment provides happens to agree with our stomachs. Either can become a mystery if we forget that minds, like stomachs, originated in and have been conditioned by a pre-existent natural order." The idea here is, that we can know the world and represent it realistically, because we are ourselves part of the world and within the world. Along these lines, it could be argued that reality, and the human cognition of reality, will inevitably contain some fuzzy characteristics, which can perhaps be represented only by concepts which are themselves fuzzy to some or other extent. Hongxing Li et al. comment that: "Fuzzy concepts derive from fuzzy phenomena that commonly occur in the natural world. The concepts formed in human brains for perceiving, recognizing, and categorizing natural phenomena are often fuzzy concepts. Boundaries of these concepts are vague. (…) For example, “rain” is a common natural phenomenon that is difficult to describe precisely since it can “rain” with varying intensity anywhere from a light sprinkle to a torrential downpour. (…) The concepts formed in human brains for perceiving, recognizing, and categorizing natural phenomena are often fuzzy. (...) If it is raining today, you can call it light rain, or moderate rain, or heavy rain based on the relative amount of rainfall: This is fuzzy judging. If you are predicting a good, fair, or poor harvest based on the results of fuzzy judging, you are using fuzzy reasoning. The human brain has the incredible ability of processing fuzzy classification, fuzzy judgment, and fuzzy reasoning. The natural languages are ingeniously permeated with inherent fuzziness so that we can express rich info
