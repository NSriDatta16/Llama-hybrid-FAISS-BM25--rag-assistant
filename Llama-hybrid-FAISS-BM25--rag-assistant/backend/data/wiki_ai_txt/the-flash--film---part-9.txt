gation into the on-set behavior of Justice League's replacement director, Joss Whedon. The role of Cyborg was not expected to be recast. At that time, the Muschiettis were preparing for production in the United Kingdom, with filming set to begin in April at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, after Miller finished on The Secrets of Dumbledore. Construction of the sets at Leavesden Studios had begun by February, with the production creating a life-sized replica of the Batcave from scratch while the Batmobile used in Keaton's films was transported to the set from Los Angeles using an airport cargo truck, due to a global shortage of shipping containers at the time. Paul Austerberry served as the production designer while Alexandra Byrne served as the costume designer. Sasha Calle was cast as Kara Zor-El / Supergirl later in February 2021, and signed a multi-film contract for the DCEU. Calle was chosen from a group of more than 425 actresses that also included Bruna Marquezine and Rachel Zegler, who were later cast in the DCEU as Jenny Kord for Blue Beetle (2023) and Anthea for Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023). All auditions for the role, as well as chemistry tests with Miller, took place over Zoom. At that time, Crudup was confirmed to be returning as Henry Allen, but was forced to drop out of the film the following month because of scheduling conflicts with his series The Morning Show (2019–present). Ron Livingston was subsequently cast to replace Crudup as Henry Allen, alongside Maribel Verdú as Barry's mother, Nora Allen, while Clemons signed a new deal to star as Iris West in the film after her role in Justice League was cut, but that cameo was restored in the director's cut, Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021). Other actors cast then were Ian Loh as a young Barry Allen, Saoirse-Monica Jackson as Patty Spivot, and Rudy Mancuso as Albert Desmond. At the end of the month, Keaton said he had received an older version of the script but had not yet read it and would have to read the latest draft before deciding if he would commit to the film. He also cited the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom as a concern for his involvement, as well as balancing his other commitments. Before filming began, Keaton was reaffirmed to be starring in the film after his prior comments cast some doubt about his involvement, with Muschietti believing Keaton's decision to commit to The Flash was due to the script that he had been sent. Muschietti said Keaton felt honored to play Batman again. The Muschiettis formed a production company, Double Dream, to co-produce the film, and Marianne Jenkins was revealed as an executive producer. Fisher said he would be disappointed if the situation surrounding his involvement in the film was not resolved, and that he was open to returning to the role of Cyborg for the film if Warner Bros. were to make amends with him. Filming Principal photography began on April 19, 2021, at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, in Watford, England, under the working title Baby Shower. Henry Braham served as cinematographer after previously working on DC's The Suicide Squad (2021). He described the film as "technically complex" despite not being based in reality. In early May, filming took place at Burghley House in Stamford, Lincolnshire, which doubled for Wayne Manor. In mid-June, Miller, Clemons, Keaton, and Calle filmed scenes at St Paul's Cathedral in London, with the surrounding locations designed to portray Central City. Filming was also set to occur later that month in Edinburgh and Glasgow—doubling for Gotham City—for scenes with Affleck and Keaton. In late July, filming continued in Glasgow at Ingram Street, George Square, John Street, and Cochrane Street and involved several vehicles, while filming with the Batmobile occurred in George Square, but was temporarily halted after a camera operator on a motorcycle shooting behind the Batcycle on Renfield Street collided with it near West George Street. The operator was injured but n
