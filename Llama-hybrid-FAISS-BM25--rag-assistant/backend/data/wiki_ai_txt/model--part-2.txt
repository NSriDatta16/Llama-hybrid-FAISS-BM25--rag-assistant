ry and important forces, for example, using Froude number or Reynolds number scaling (see Similitude). In the pre-computer era, the UK economy was modelled with the hydraulic model MONIAC, to predict for example the effect of tax rises on employment. Conceptual model A conceptual model is a theoretical representation of a system, e.g. a set of mathematical equations attempting to describe the workings of the atmosphere for the purpose of weather forecasting. It consists of concepts used to help understand or simulate a subject the model represents. Abstract or conceptual models are central to philosophy of science, as almost every scientific theory effectively embeds some kind of model of the physical or human sphere. In some sense, a physical model "is always the reification of some conceptual model; the conceptual model is conceived ahead as the blueprint of the physical one", which is then constructed as conceived. Thus, the term refers to models that are formed after a conceptualization or generalization process. Examples Conceptual model (computer science), an agreed representation of entities and their relationships, to assist in developing software Economic model, a theoretical construct representing economic processes Language model, a probabilistic model of a natural language, used for speech recognition, language generation, and information retrieval Large language models are artificial neural networks used for generative artificial intelligence (AI), e.g. ChatGPT Mathematical model, a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language Statistical model, a mathematical model that usually specifies the relationship between one or more random variables and other non-random variables Model (CGI), a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions via specialized software Medical model, a proposed "set of procedures in which all doctors are trained" Mental model, in psychology, an internal representation of external reality Model (logic), a set along with a collection of finitary operations, and relations that are defined on it, satisfying a given collection of axioms Model (MVC), information-representing component of a software, distinct from the user interface (the "view"), both linked by the "controller" component, in the context of the model–view–controller software design Model act, a law drafted centrally to be disseminated and proposed for enactment in multiple independent legislatures Standard model (disambiguation) Properties of models, according to general model theory According to Herbert Stachowiak, a model is characterized by at least three properties: 1. Mapping A model always is a model of something—it is an image or representation of some natural or artificial, existing or imagined original, where this original itself could be a model. 2. Reduction In general, a model will not include all attributes that describe the original but only those that appear relevant to the model's creator or user. 3. Pragmatism A model does not relate unambiguously to its original. It is intended to work as a replacement for the original a) for certain subjects (for whom?) b) within a certain time range (when?) c) restricted to certain conceptual or physical actions (what for?). For example, a street map is a model of the actual streets in a city (mapping), showing the course of the streets while leaving out, say, traffic signs and road markings (reduction), made for pedestrians and vehicle drivers for the purpose of finding one's way in the city (pragmatism). Additional properties have been proposed, like extension and distortion as well as validity. The American philosopher Michael Weisberg differentiates between concrete and mathematical models and proposes computer simulations (computational models) as their own class of models. Uses of models According to Bruce Edmonds, there are at least 5 general uses for models: Prediction: reliably anticipating unknown data, including data with
