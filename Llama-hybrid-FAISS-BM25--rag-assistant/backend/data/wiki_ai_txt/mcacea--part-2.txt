ely evaluated solutions of the previous generation to the other EAs instead of our current best only individual objective evaluated one. Nevertheless, that approach introduces a bias toward outdated completely evaluated trajectories, while MCACEA does it toward currently good individual objective evaluated ones. Applications MCACEA has been used for finding and optimizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) trajectories when flying simultaneously in the same scenario.
