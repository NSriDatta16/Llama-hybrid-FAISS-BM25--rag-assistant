ed in neuroimaging research to identify abnormalities in brain scans associated with conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and PTSD. However, deep learning models require extensive, high-quality datasets to function effectively. The limited availability of large, diverse mental health datasets poses a challenge, as patient privacy regulations restrict access to medical records. Additionally, deep learning models often operate as "black boxes", meaning their decision-making processes are not easily interpretable by clinicians, raising concerns about transparency and clinical trust. Natural language processing Natural language processing allows AI systems to analyze and interpret human language, including speech, text, and tone of voice. In mental health, NLP is used to extract meaningful insights from conversations, clinical notes, and patient-reported symptoms. NLP can assess sentiment, speech patterns, and linguistic cues to detect signs of mental distress. This is crucial because many of the diagnoses and DSM-5 mental health disorders are diagnosed via speech in doctor-patient interviews, utilizing the clinician's skill for behavioral pattern recognition and translating it into medically relevant information to be documented and used for diagnoses. As research continues, NLP models must address ethical concerns related to patient privacy, consent, and potential biases in language interpretation. Advancements in NLP such as sentiment analysis identifies distinctions in tone and speech to detect anxiety and depression. "Woebot", uses sentiment analysis to scrutinize and detect patterns for depression or despair and suggests professional help to patients. Similarly, "Cogito", an AI platform uses voice analysis to find changes in pitch and loudness to identify symptoms of depression or anxiety. The application of NLP can contribute to early diagnosis and improved treatment strategies. Computer vision Computer vision enables AI to analyze visual data, such as facial expressions, body language, and micro expressions, to assess emotional and psychological states. This technology is increasingly used in mental health research to detect signs of depression, anxiety, and PTSD through facial analysis. Computer vision tools have been explored for their ability to detect nonverbal cues, such as hesitation or changes in eye contact, which may correlate with emotional distress. Despite its potential, computer vision in mental health raises ethical and accuracy concerns. Facial recognition algorithms can be influenced by cultural and racial biases, leading to potential misinterpretations of emotional expressions. Additionally, concerns about informed consent and data privacy must be addressed before widespread clinical adoption. LLMs and generative AI From the introduction of LLMs in the field of AI in correlation to mental health care, a lot of developments have come about. Popular examples of LLMs are ChatGPT and Gemini. LLMs have been trained on a lot of data which has made it capable of being considerate and even mimic how a human behaves but chatbots are only fed scripted data which gives it the lack of empathy when dealing with patients. This kind of LLM technology is very useful for people who hesitate to ask for assistance or do not have access to get treatment. But at the same time, LLMs have not exactly been known to be as effective as they seem capable of being. LLMs can experience a condition called hallucination where they can possibly give wrong medical advice to the patients that can be extremely dangerous. LLMs do not exhibit the required level of compassion or empathy needed specially in difficult situations. Applications Diagnosis AI with the use of NLP and ML can be used to help diagnose individuals with mental health disorders. It can be used to differentiate closely similar disorders based on their initial presentation to inform timely treatment before disease progression. For example, it may be able to differen
