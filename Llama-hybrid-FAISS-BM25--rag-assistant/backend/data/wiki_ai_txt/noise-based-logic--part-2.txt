sality of a Boolean logic. Computation by noise-based logic The string verification work over a slow communication channel shows a powerful computing application where the methods is inherently based on calculating the hash function. The scheme is based on random telegraph waves and it is mentioned in the paper that the authors intuitively conclude that the intelligence of the brain is using similar operations to make a reasonably good decision based on a limited amount of information. The superposition of the first D(N) = 2N integer numbers can be produced with only 2N operations, which the authors call "Achilles ankle operation" in the paper. Computer chip realization of noise-based logic Preliminary schemes have already been published to utilize noise-based logic in practical computers. However, it is obvious from these papers that this young field has yet a long way to go before it will be seen in everyday applications.
