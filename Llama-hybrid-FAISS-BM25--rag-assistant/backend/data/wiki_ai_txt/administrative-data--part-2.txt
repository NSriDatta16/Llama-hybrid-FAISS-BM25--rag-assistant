Examination is mostly focused on creating projects for political and economic gain and less on implementation, sustainability, user ability, and ingrained politics. Concerns Some disadvantages of administrative data are that the information collected is not always open and is restricted to certain users. There is also a lack of control over content, for example Statistics Canada uses administrative data to enrich, replace survey data, or to increase the efficiency of statistical operations. These types of data do not have background information and sometimes have missing data. Changes in methodology can result in altercations to the data collected, for example when using these data to assess health care quality introductions of new diagnosis and advances in technology can affect the identification and recording of diagnoses on administrative claims. Issues with data protection is concern as more administrative data is becoming open data. Statistics Canada seeks to reduce privacy invasiveness of personal identifiers by having them removed for the linked file. The personal information, such as name, health number, or Social Insurance Number is then stored separately. However, access to linked files with personal identifiers is allowed in cases with authorization and have security, such as encryption, applied. == References ==
