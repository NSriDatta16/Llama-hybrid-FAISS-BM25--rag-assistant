In an effort to strengthen ties between NITI Aayog and METI, India and Japan signed a broad statement of intent on AI under "Society 5.0" that included the exploration of potential institutional collaborations, such as joint projects between IIT Hyderabad and Artificial Intelligence Research Centre (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology), related to machine learning, deep learning, data mining, and other AI themes. Joint scientific and technological cooperation in ML, and probabilistic logic techniques for various data types and combinations were added to the extended MoU on December 24, 2021. In 2021, the Indian Department of Science and Technology and the United States Department of State were designated as the nodal agencies for the US India Artificial Intelligence Initiative launched under Indo-US Science and Technology Forum. It will provide a forum for bilateral research and development cooperation. It will also facilitate AI innovation, exchange ideas for building an AI workforce, and suggest ways to promote collaborations. The United States and India expanded their joint cyber training and exercises in 2022 and initiated the Defense Artificial Intelligence Dialogue. According to Cleo Paskal, a non-resident senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Indian community has influenced AI research and development in the US for many years. Things are taken to the next level by the Defense Artificial Intelligence Dialogue. In the same year, the US intends to join six of India's Technology Innovation Hubs to support collaborative research projects in fields including AI, advanced wireless technologies, and data science to further advancements in applications like agriculture, health, and climate. Thirty-five projects have been selected for implementation by the DST and U.S. National Science Foundation. As part of the United Statesâ€“India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, the US and India announced setting aside more than $2 million in 2024 for collaborative research initiatives that will advance AI and quantum technology. In order to develop advanced driver-assistance systems and vehicular automation technologies that can be used in different parts of the world, the Japanese business Honda began collaborative research on AI technologies with IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay in 2024. This was done in order to further advance the company's own Honda Cooperative Intelligence AI platform. To create safe, open, secure, and reliable AI, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Emmanuel Macron announced the India-France Roadmap on Artificial Intelligence on February 12, 2025.
