This allows practitioners to integrate digital workflows for patient-specific modeling without requiring complex scanning equipment. Structured light technology: A new type of high-productivity structured light scanner has been introduced, the Hexagon's SmartScan VR800, built on a reengineered platform. It is the first optical 3D scanner to feature a motorized zoom lens, allowing users to adjust data resolution and measurement volume entirely through software settings. Designed for quality inspection and to address the challenges of modern metrology, from the most sterile quality room to the dustiest shop floor. Industrial Optical Metrology Systems (ATOS) from GOM GmbH utilize Structured Light technology to achieve high accuracy and scalability in measurements. These systems feature self-monitoring for calibration status, transformation accuracy, environmental changes, and part movement to ensure high-quality measuring data. Google Project Tango SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) using depth technologies, including Structured Light, Time of Flight, and Stereo. Time of Flight require the use of an infrared (IR) projector and IR sensor; Stereo does not. MainAxis srl produces a 3D Scanner utilizing an advanced patented technology that enables 3d scanning in full color and with an acquisition time of a few microseconds, used in medical and other applications. A technology by PrimeSense, used in an early version of Microsoft Kinect, used a pattern of projected infrared points to generate a dense 3D image. (Later on, the Microsoft Kinect switched to using a time-of-flight camera instead of structured light.) Occipital Structure Sensor uses a pattern of projected infrared points, calibrated to minimize distortion to generate a dense 3D image. Structure Core uses a stereo camera that matches against a random pattern of projected infrared points to generate a dense 3D image. Intel RealSense camera projects a series of infrared patterns to obtain the 3D structure. Face ID system works by projecting more than 30,000 infrared dots onto a face and producing a 3D facial map. VicoVR sensor uses a pattern of infrared points for skeletal tracking. Chiaro Technologies uses a single engineered pattern of infrared points called Symbolic Light to stream 3D point clouds for industrial applications Software 3DUNDERWORLD SLS – OPEN SOURCE DIY 3D scanner based on structured light and stereo vision in Python language SLStudio—Open Source Real Time Structured Light See also Depth map Kinect Laser Dynamic Range Imager (LDRI) Light stage Range imaging Virtual cinematography References Sources Further reading Fringe, 2005, The 5th International Workshop on Automatic Processing of Fringe Patterns, Berlin: Springer, 2006.
