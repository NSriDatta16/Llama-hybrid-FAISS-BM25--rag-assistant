s originally developed to train EleutherAI's GPT-Neo models but has become widely used to train other models, including Microsoft's Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation, Meta AI's Open Pre-trained Transformers, LLaMA, and Galactica, Stanford University's BioMedLM 2.7B, the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence's Chinese-Transformer-XL, and Yandex's YaLM 100B. Compared to other datasets, the Pile's main distinguishing features are that it is a curated selection of data chosen by researchers at EleutherAI to contain information they thought language models should learn and that it is the only such dataset that is thoroughly documented by the researchers who developed it. GPT models EleutherAI's most prominent research relates to its work to train open-source large language models inspired by OpenAI's GPT-3. EleutherAI's "GPT-Neo" model series has released 125 million, 1.3 billion, 2.7 billion, 6 billion, and 20 billion parameter models. GPT-Neo (125M, 1.3B, 2.7B): released in March 2021, it was the largest open-source GPT-3-style language model in the world at the time of release. GPT-J (6B): released in March 2021, it was the largest open-source GPT-3-style language model in the world at the time of release. GPT-NeoX (20B): released in February 2022, it was the largest open-source language model in the world at the time of release. Pythia (13B): While prior models focused on scaling larger to close the gap with closed-sourced models like GPT-3, the Pythia model suite goes in another direction. The Pythia suite was designed to facilitate scientific research on the capabilities of and learning processes in large language models. Featuring 154 partially trained model checkpoints, fully public training data, and the ability to reproduce the exact training order, Pythia enables research on verifiable training, social biases, memorization, and more. VQGAN-CLIP Following the release of DALL-E by OpenAI in January 2021, EleutherAI started working on text-to-image synthesis models. When OpenAI did not release DALL-E publicly, EleutherAI's Katherine Crowson and digital artist Ryan Murdock developed a technique for using CLIP (another model developed by OpenAI) to convert regular image generation models into text-to-image synthesis ones. Building on ideas dating back to Google's DeepDream, they found their first major success combining CLIP with another publicly available model called VQGAN and the resulting model is called VQGAN-CLIP. Crowson released the technology by tweeting notebooks demonstrating the technique that people could run for free without any special equipment. This work was credited by Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque as motivating the founding of Stability AI. Public reception Praise EleutherAI's work to democratize GPT-3 won the UNESCO Netexplo Global Innovation Award in 2021, InfoWorld's Best of Open Source Software Award in 2021 and 2022, was nominated for VentureBeat's AI Innovation Award in 2021. Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and noted critic of deep learning companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind, has repeatedly praised EleutherAI's dedication to open-source and transparent research. Maximilian Gahntz, a senior policy researcher at the Mozilla Foundation, applauded EleutherAI's efforts to give more researchers the ability to audit and assess AI technology. "If models are open and if data sets are open, that'll enable much more of the critical research that's pointed out many of the flaws and harms associated with generative AI and that's often far too difficult to conduct." Criticism Technology journalist Kyle Wiggers has raised concerns about whether EleutherAI is as independent as it claims, or "whether the involvement of commercially motivated ventures like Stability AI and Hugging Face—both of which are backed by substantial venture capital—might influence EleutherAI's research".
