Apple Intelligence is an artificial intelligence system developed by Apple Inc. Relying on a combination of on-device and server processing, it was announced on June 10, 2024, at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, as a built-in feature of Apple's iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, which were announced alongside Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is free for all users with supported devices. Models Apple Intelligence consists of an on-device model as well as a cloud model running on servers primarily using Apple silicon. Both models consist of a generic foundation model, as well as multiple adapter models that are more specialized to particular tasks like text summarization and tone adjustment. It was launched for developers and testers on July 29, 2024, in U.S. English, with the developer betas of iOS 18.1, macOS 15.1, and iPadOS 18.1, released partially on October 28, 2024, and will fully launch by 2026. According to a human evaluation done by Apple's machine learning division, the on-device foundation model beat or tied equivalent small models by Mistral AI, Microsoft, and Google, while the server foundation models beat the performance of OpenAI's GPT-3, while roughly matching the performance of GPT-4. Apple's cloud models are built on a Private Cloud Compute platform which is allegedly designed with user privacy and end-to-end encryption in mind. Unlike other generative AI services like ChatGPT which use servers from third-parties, Apple Intelligence's cloud models are run entirely on Apple servers with custom Apple silicon hardware built for end-to-end encryption. It was also designed to make sure that the software running on said servers matches the independently verifiable software accessible to researchers. In case of a software mismatch, Apple devices will refuse to connect to the servers. On June 10, 2025, Apple announced that Apple's on-device foundation models will be available to third-party applications as part of the Foundation Models API, with support for structured data response and tool calling. International release United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South African localized versions of English gained support on December 11, 2024. On March 31, 2025, Chinese (simplified), English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese localized versions were added as part of iOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, and iPadOS 18.4. It also rolled out in the European Union, and brought support to the Apple Vision Pro. Apple Intelligence support for the Vision Pro, currently, is only available in U.S. English. As of July 2025, it is not available yet on devices purchased in mainland China or on any device using an Apple ID set to mainland China, even if the device was bought elsewhere. Functionality and features Writing Tools Apple Intelligence features writing tools that are powered by LLMs. Selected text can be proofread, rewritten, made more friendly, concise or professional, similar to Grammarly's AI writing features. It can also be used to generate summaries, key points, tables, and lists from an article or piece of writing. In iOS 18.2 and macOS 15.2, a ChatGPT integration was added to Writing Tools through "Compose" and "Describe your change" features. Writing Tools has been replicated by Xiaomi, and an open-source PC program brings similar functionality to Windows, Linux, and older Macs. Image Playground Apple Intelligence can be used to generate images on-device with the Image Playground app. Similarly to OpenAI's DALL-E, it can be used to generate images using AI, using phrases and descriptions to create an image with customizable styles such as Animation and Sketch. In Notes, users can access Image Playground on iPad through the Image Wand tool in the Apple Pencil palette without having to open the Image Playground app. Rough sketches made with Apple Pencil can be transformed into images. As part of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS 26, Ima
