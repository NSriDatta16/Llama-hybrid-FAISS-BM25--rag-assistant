rly ordered if its lattice order is linear.) In consequence of the linear subdirect decomposition property of all MTL-algebras, the completeness theorem with respect to linear MTL-algebras (Esteva & Godo, 2001) holds: A formula is provable in MTL if and only if it is valid in all linear MTL-algebras. A formula A is derivable in MTL from a set of formulae Γ if and only if A is a global consequence in all linear MTL-algebras of Γ. Standard semantics Standard are called those MTL-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0, 1]. They are uniquely determined by the real-valued function that interprets strong conjunction, which can be any left-continuous t-norm ∗ {\displaystyle \ast } . The standard MTL-algebra determined by a left-continuous t-norm ∗ {\displaystyle \ast } is usually denoted by [ 0 , 1 ] ∗ . {\displaystyle [0,1]_{\ast }.} In [ 0 , 1 ] ∗ , {\displaystyle [0,1]_{\ast },} implication is represented by the residuum of ∗ , {\displaystyle \ast ,} weak conjunction and disjunction respectively by the minimum and maximum, and the truth constants zero and one respectively by the real numbers 0 and 1. The logic MTL is complete with respect to standard MTL-algebras; this fact is expressed by the standard completeness theorem (Jenei & Montagna, 2002): A formula is provable in MTL if and only if it is valid in all standard MTL-algebras. Since MTL is complete with respect to standard MTL-algebras, which are determined by left-continuous t-norms, MTL is often referred to as the logic of left-continuous t-norms (similarly as BL is the logic of continuous t-norms).
