pendent clinical trials were successful with specificity (97,15%) and accuracy/sensitivity (86,86%), for CT (Cycle Threshold) assumed at 25, which is in line with the guidelines set out by the World Health Organization. Moreover, ML System in partnership with Rzeszów–Jasionka Airport published a statement indicating their intention to test the device at the airport. Similar plans exist between the manufacturer and the Warsaw Chopin Airport. Two large networks of laboratories in Poland, "Diagnostyka" and "ALAB Laboratoria", have signed a letter of intent with ML System. In agreement with ALAB, the parties declared cooperation in the implementation of the product named "COVID DETECTOR" on the Polish, German and Ukrainian markets. In addition, the companies declared joint activities aimed at extending the diagnosis with the use of "COVID Detector" to include mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, differentiate the stage of the disease and other pathogens, including tuberculosis. Cooperation with laboratories Diagnostyka, including detection of mutations of SARS-CoV-2 virus or other pathogens, also involves the diagnosis of cancer with the use of the device. United Kingdom In January 2021, Exhalation Technology Ltd (ETL) in Cambridge announced a clinical trial study for a cohort of up to 150 patients for its CoronaCheck breath test for COVID-19. United States In 2020, research teams at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Ohio State University received funding to investigate the potential of breath analysis for SARS-CoV-2 detection. These investigations included exploring technologies that might enable rapid diagnosis, potentially within 15 seconds, by analyzing specific volatile organic compounds present in exhaled breath. "The goal in this research is to develop cheap, massively deployable, rapid diagnostic and sentinel systems for detecting respiratory illness and airborne viral threats," says Prof. Pirouz Kavehpour of UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, whose research team received a one-year, $150,000 research grant from the National Science Foundation. In April 2022, the FDA authorized for emergency use the first COVID-19 diagnostic test using breath samples. "The InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer uses a technique called gas chromatography gas mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) to separate and identify chemical mixtures and rapidly detect five Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in exhaled breath," said the FDA. Researchers at the Washington University in St. Louis in 2023 reported developing a point-of-care COVID-19 test device using a sensor to directly detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in exhaled breath. In early testing, the experimental breathalyzer design provided results with high accuracy in about a minute. It functions by collecting a breath sample and directing it towards an electrochemical biosensor coated with antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the virus is present, the sensor produces a signal, indicating a positive test. This approach directly detects the virus itself, unlike some breath tests that identify indirect markers of infection. In late 2023, the researchers announced they had been awarded a $3.6 million grant to investigate the possibility of adapting the device to include testing for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, and to further develop and commercialize their breathalyzer technology.
