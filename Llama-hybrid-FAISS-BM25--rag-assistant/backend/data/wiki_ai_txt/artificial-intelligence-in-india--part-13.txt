d for the industry. This platform can support any framework, neural network, or foundational model for any workload. In 2021, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IISc announced their intention to establish the Kotak-IISc AI-ML Center for research and innovation in fintech, as well as to cultivate the necessary talent pool to satisfy industry demands. Private businesses are attempting to create smaller, less expensive large language model. Examples of these include AI4Bharat's Airawat series, Sarvam AI's OpenHathi series, CoRover.ai's BharatGPT, Tech Mahindra's Indus project, Ola's Krutrim, TWO AI's Sutra series, and SML's series. IIT Delhi's Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence and an Indian deep tech firm KnowDis are working together to create AI models that could find possible antibodies to treat a variety of illnesses. In part of its $1 billion pledge to accelerate AI-led innovation for the ai360 ecosystem, Wipro announced on August 18, 2023, the opening of a Center of Excellence in Generative Artificial Intelligence in collaboration with IIT Delhi. To study AI, the Adani Group and the International Holding Company established a joint venture on 28 December 2023. On August 29, 2024, Mukesh Ambani revealed the creation of an application agnostic suite of tools and platforms called Jio Brain, to hasten the Reliance Group's adoption of AI and set the stage for 6G development with plans to offer services to vendors. JioBrain combines high speed and low latency of 5G with automation, anomaly detection, and predictive forecasting. Reliance intends to use it to optimize processes in education, healthcare, entertainment, retail, and agriculture. JioBrain includes over 500 REST APIs and data APIs. It can be used for NLP, image-to-video, text-to-music, text-to-image and video, speech-to-speech, speech-to-text translation, code generation, explanation, optimization, and debugging. Additionally, it contains feature engineering, model chaining, and hyperparameter optimization. Jio Brain offers mobile and enterprise-ready LLM-as-a-service capability for GenAI. AI has been used in medical devices, medical reports, predicting advertising & marketing results, do product design & development, healthcare & cognitive testing with diagnostic AI. GenAI is being used by Indian brands for product ideation, visual concept development, social post creation. In 2025, Citadel Securities and IIT Kanpur announced a collaboration to construct the Translational and Transformative Training and Investigations Laboratory, an advanced GPU research facility for work on machine learning, intelligent systems, data science, data visualization, translational AI, and high-performance computing. Project Waterworth, a 50,000 km undersea cable for high-speed connectivity required to propel AI innovation, was unveiled by Meta on February 14, 2025. It will link South Africa, Brazil, India, the United States, and other regions. India is among the nations with the highest usage of Meta AI on WhatsApp and Instagram. Defence A task force for the Strategic Implementation of AI for National Security and Defence was established in February 2018 by the Ministry of Defense's Department of Defence Production. The process of getting the military ready for AI use was started by the MoD in 2019. The Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics was approved to develop AI solutions for signal intelligence to improve intelligence collection and analysis capabilities at a cost of ₹73.9 crore and Energy Harvesting Based Infrared Sensor Network for Automated Human Intrusion Detection (EYESIRa) at a cost of ₹1.8 crore. In 2021, the Indian Army, with assistance from the National Security Council, began operating the Quantum Lab and Artificial Intelligence Center at the Military College of Telecommunication Engineering. With an emphasis on robotics and artificial intelligence, Defence Research and Development Organisation and Indian Institute of Science established the Joint Advanced Technology Pr
