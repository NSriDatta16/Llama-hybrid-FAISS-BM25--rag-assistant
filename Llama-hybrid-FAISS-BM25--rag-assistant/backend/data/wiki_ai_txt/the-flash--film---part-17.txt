tial for Miller to reprise their role in the new DCU franchise, but a decision on the character had not been made. Gunn confirmed that The Flash would reset the continuity of the DCEU and lead into the DCU's first film, Superman (2025). Andy and Barbara Muschietti intended for Miller to return for a potential sequel because they preferred the actor for the role, while the director also expressed interest in featuring Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash as an antagonist for a sequel after the character was responsible for Nora Allen's death in the film. Ahead of The Flash's release in June 2023, TheWrap reported that a sequel was "on the table" with the potential for it to be greenlit being dependent on the film's box-office performance; The Flash needed to earn around the box-office gross of DC's The Batman ($770 million) for a sequel to move forward. The poor box-office performance of The Flash led many commentators to question and doubt the prospects of a sequel being made, and in October 2023, Variety reported that no actors from Zack Snyder's DCEU films, including Miller, would reprise their roles in the DCU.
