ortition to get a representative sample of participants. The project is named in honor of Jürgen Habermas. In one experiment, the participants rated the summaries by the AI higher than the human moderator 56% of the time. Generative AI Video generation In May 2024, a multimodal video generation model called Veo was announced at Google I/O 2024. Google claimed that it could generate 1080p videos beyond a minute long. In December 2024, Google released Veo 2, available via VideoFX. It supports 4K resolution video generation, and has an improved understanding of physics. In April 2025, Google announced that Veo 2 became available for advanced users on Gemini App. In May 2025, Google released Veo 3, which not only generates videos but also creates synchronized audio — including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient noise — to match the visuals. Google also announced Flow, a video-creation tool powered by Veo and Imagen. Music generation Google DeepMind developed Lyria, a text-to-music model. As of August 2025, it is available on Vertex AI and the Gemini API. Environment generation In March 2024, DeepMind introduced "Genie" (Generative Interactive Environments), an AI model that can generate game-like, action-controllable virtual worlds based on textual descriptions, images, or sketches. Built as an autoregressive latent diffusion model, Genie enables frame-by-frame interactivity without requiring labeled action data for training. Its successor, Genie 2, released in December 2024, expanded these capabilities to generate diverse and interactive 3D environments. Robotics Released in June 2023, RoboCat is an AI model that can control robotic arms. The model can adapt to new models of robotic arms, and to new types of tasks. In March 2025, DeepMind launched two AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, aimed at improving how robots interact with the physical world. Others Football DeepMind researchers have applied machine learning models to the sport of football, often referred to as soccer in North America, modelling the behaviour of football players, including the goalkeeper, defenders, and strikers during different scenarios such as penalty kicks. The researchers used heat maps and cluster analysis to organize players based on their tendency to behave a certain way during the game when confronted with a decision on how to score or prevent the other team from scoring. The researchers mention that machine learning models could be used to democratize the football industry by automatically selecting interesting video clips of the game that serve as highlights. This can be done by searching videos for certain events, which is possible because video analysis is an established field of machine learning. This is also possible because of extensive sports analytics based on data including annotated passes or shots, sensors that capture data about the players movements many times over the course of a game, and game theory models. Archaeology Google has unveiled a new archaeology document program, named Ithaca after the Greek island in Homer's Odyssey. This deep neural network helps researchers restore the empty text of damaged Greek documents, and to identify their date and geographical origin. The work builds on another text analysis network that DeepMind released in 2019, named Pythia. Ithaca achieves 62% accuracy in restoring damaged texts and 71% location accuracy, and has a dating precision of 30 years. The authors claimed that the use of Ithaca by "expert historians" raised the accuracy of their work from 25 to 72 percent. However, Eleanor Dickey noted that this test was actually only made of students, saying that it wasn't clear how helpful Ithaca would be to "genuinely qualified editors". The team is working on extending the model to other ancient languages, including Demotic, Akkadian, Hebrew, and Mayan. Materials science In November 2023, Google DeepMind announced an Open Source Graph Network for Materials Exploration (GNoME).
