mp look more realistically like Trump. Release "Sermon on the 'Mount" was first broadcast on July 23, 2025, on Comedy Central. The episode premiered less than a day after Stone and Parker signed a $1.5 billion deal with Paramount. In a thank you message to the CEO and COO of Paramount, Parker said that they are "focused on building something special and doing whatever it takes to bring championships to this city." While 430,000 viewers watched the original airing on Comedy Central, the episode reached number one status on Paramount+ as word began to spread about its content. Cross-platform, the episode's ratings were reportedly a record high since 1999. Reception Stuart Heritage from The Guardian called the episode a "grand dare" from Parker and Stone for Trump to sue them. He added: "Considering that South Park has always been known for its unvarnished satire, and for an extraordinarily responsive production process that allows it to comment on events almost until the moment of broadcast, the first episode of its 27th season always had the potential to sting. And since that first episode – entitled Sermon on the 'Mount – is a scorching critique of both Paramount's cowardice and Trump's eagerness to ride roughshod over his own voters, sting it does." Rolling Stone writer Alan Sepinwall lauded the episode's scathing critique of the American president, writing "At precarious moments like this, certain things need to be said out loud, even if they're being packaged with juvenile dick jokes. When so many of their peers are too scared to offer even a mealy-mouthed version of criticism, Parker, Stone, and South Park just went for it." Joe Rogan praised the episode on his podcast, "describing it as 'hilarious' and [called South Park] 'the greatest show of all time.'" Trump administration response The Trump administration was highly critical of the episode. An administration source reported to Deadline Hollywood that Trump was "seething over the childish attack by South Park". Taylor Rogers, the White House Assistant Press Secretary, issued a statement to Rolling Stone and USA Today in response to the episode: "The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show. Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak."
