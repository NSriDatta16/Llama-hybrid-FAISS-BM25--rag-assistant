 as part of an ongoing feud with fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar, the artist Drake released the diss track "Taylor Made Freestyle", which featured AI-generated vocals imitating the voices of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. Shakur's estate threatened to sue over the use of Shakur's likeness, saying that it constituted a violation of Shakur's personality rights. On May 20, 2024, following the release of a demo of updates to OpenAI's ChatGPT Voice Mode feature a week earlier, actor Scarlett Johansson issued a statement in relation to the "Sky" voice shown in the demo, accusing OpenAI of producing it to be very similar to her own, and her portrayal of the artificial intelligence voice assistant Samantha in the film Her (2013), despite Johansson refusing an earlier offer from the company to provide her voice for the system. The agent of the unnamed voice actress who voiced Sky stated that she had recorded her lines in her natural speaking voice and that OpenAI had not mentioned the movie Her nor Johansson. Several incidents involving sharing of non-consensual deepfake pornography have occurred. In late January 2024, deepfake images of American musician Taylor Swift proliferated. Several experts have warned that deepfake pornography is more quickly created and disseminated, due to the relative ease of using the technology. Canada introduced federal legislation targeting sharing of non-consensual sexually explicit AI-generated photos; most provinces already had such laws. In the United States, the DEFIANCE Act was introduced in March 2024. Environment A large amount of electricity is needed to power generative AI products, making it more difficult for companies to achieve net zero emissions. From 2019 to 2024, Google's greenhouse gas emissions increased by 50%. Biosecurity and cybersecurity AI is expected by researchers of the Center for AI Safety to improve the "accessibility, success rate, scale, speed, stealth and potency of cyberattacks", potentially causing "significant geopolitical turbulence" if it reinforces attack more than defense. Concerns have been raised about the potential capability of future AI systems to engineer particularly lethal and contagious pathogens. The AI boom is said to have started an arms race in which large companies are competing against each other to have the most powerful AI model on the market, with speed and profit prioritized over safety and user protection. Sentience and human extinction Coverage of advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have coincided with discussions of digital sentience and morality, such as whether A.I. programs should be granted rights. Industry leaders and others have signed the Statement on AI Risk, arguing that humanity might irreversibly lose control over a sufficiently advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI). Financial concerns and potential bubble Much of the AI boom has been funded by loans and venture capital, but many commercial AI services remain of questionable practical utility or quality for business. Despite more than 60 billion in corporate investment in AI in 2025, 95% of business AI projects are unprofitable, according to research from MIT. Producers of generative AI, such as OpenAI, also themselves currently have costs greatly exceeding their revenue. As other major tech companies such as Nvidia are both heavily invested into AI and dependent on the AI ecosystem and its hardware demands for their own ongoing growth, this has raised speculation of a wider economic bubble in the tech industry.
