Nondestructive Evaluation 4.0 (NDE 4.0) has been defined by Vrana et al. as "the concept of cyber-physical non-destructive evaluation (including nondestructive testing) arising from Industry 4.0 digital technologies, physical inspection methods, and business models. It seeks to enhance inspection performance, integrity engineering and decision making for safety, sustainability, and quality assurance, as well as provide timely and relevant data to improve design, production, and maintenance characteristics." NDE 4.0 arose in response to the emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which can be traced to the development of a high-tech strategy for the German government in 2015, under the term Industrie 4.0. The term became widely known in 2016 following its adoption as the theme of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos. The concept gained strength following the opening of the Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2016 in San Francisco. NDE 4.0 evolved in conjunction with Industry 4.0. It is recognized as a future goal by several global NDE organizations: the International Committee for Nondestructive Testing (ICNDT) has a Specialist international Group (SIG) on NDE 4.0, and the European Federation for Nondestructive Testing (EFNDT) created a working group designated as "EFNDT Working Group 10: NDE 4.0" (WG10). The importance of NDE 4.0 is reflected in the activities of NDE organizations throughout the world, including the American Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT), the British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing (BINDT), and the German Society for Non-Destructive Testing (DGZfP), through publications and training. History Leading to NDE 4.0, just as those leading to Industry 4.0 were prior developments that are divided into prior revolutions based on distinct technological and historical markers. These are usually defined for industry and hence for nondestructive evaluation. NDE 1.0 The first revolution in nondestructive evaluation coincides with the first industrial revolution and refers to the period between approximately 1770 (following the invention of the Watt’s steam engine in 1769) and 1870. The transition from hand and artisanal production and “muscle power” to mechanized production and steam- and hydro-power necessitated the introduction of nondestructive testing. Prior to this period, people have tested objects for thousands of years through simple methods based human sensory perception – feeling, smelling listening and observing as appropriate. The development in the first industrial revolution gave birth to non-destructive inspection through the introduction of tools that sharpened the human senses, and through tentative attempts at standardized procedures. Simple tools such as lenses, stethoscopes, tap and listen procedures and others, improved detection capabilities by enhancing human senses. Establishing procedures, made the outcome of the inspection comparable over time. At the same time, industrialization also made it necessary to expand quality assurance measures, a process that continues to this day. NDE 2.0 The second revolution in NDE is commonly referred to as the period between 1870, with the appearance of first means of mass production, marked by the introduction of the conveyor belt, and 1969. As with the second revolution in industry, it is characterized by use of physical, chemical, mechanical and electrical knowledge to improve testing and evaluation. The transformation of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, which lie outside the range of human perception, into signals that can be interpreted by humans, resulted in means of interrogating components for better visualization of material inhomogeneities at or close to the surface. Following the discovery of X-rays in 1895, it became a dominant method for testing, followed by gamma-ray testing and later, electromagnetic means of testing. With the introduction of the transistor into electronics, testing methods such as ult
