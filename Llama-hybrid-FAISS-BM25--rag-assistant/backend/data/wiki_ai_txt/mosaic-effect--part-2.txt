o-metric domains. Mosaics of personal data present not only individual privacy risks but also national security concerns, as adversaries may exploit aggregated, seemingly innocuous information to identify strategic vulnerabilities across political, institutional, and geopolitical domains. Mosaic risks extend beyond classified government data, encompassing commercial threats such as the re-identification of anonymized personally identifiable information through dataset fusion. The expression "mosaic effect" has recently entered confidentiality scholarship to describe aggregation-based re-identification threats. The mosaic effect can emerge when behavioral and identifying records—harmless in isolation—are computationally merged to re-identify individuals. Concerns about mosaic effects were raised in 1973 when the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) warned about bureaucratic "technicians as record keepers" who could use computer technology to invade individual privacy. HEW officials warned that structural inter-agency sharing could promote indiscriminate scrutiny of citizens' private lives. In 1974, Senator Sam Ervin warned that the combination of mass data collection and political discretion created a systemic threat to privacy requiring congressional restraint. Historian Richard H. Immerman described the mosaic effect and theory as, "if you can find A, somehow you can connect the dots to a really big Z." Analysis and debate Some commentary emphasizes the contradiction between public demands for privacy and widespread participation in data-reliant systems. In The New Yorker, William Brennan criticized government reliance on the mosaic effect, calling it a "precept that the intelligence community often invokes in the alleged and legally tenuous interest of national security". Federal privacy practices have often relied on informal discretion by government personnel rather than enforceable systemic constraints. The mosaic theory has been described as the idea that large-scale and long-running data collection reveals personal details in qualitatively different ways than isolated observations, requiring a distinct legal approach for "big data" surveillance. Contemporary policy debates frequently hinge on concerns related to privacy, even when not explicitly stated. Some scholars have noted a paradox in privacy discourse, as society simultaneously expresses concern over both excessive and insufficient privacy. Media outlets have characterized recent years as periods of increasing exposure and weakening privacy norms. Rather than restricting data collection itself, some frameworks prioritize assessing the risk of harm and potential misuse for the individual. Proponents of open data emphasize the constructive potential of the mosaic effect to generate novel insights by linking datasets across domains. Academic journals and funding agencies increasingly require that researchers share supporting data, and government bodies regularly publish datasets as part of open data efforts. Because most research data are not regulated by comprehensive federal standards, questions persist about whether de-identification measures like HIPAA Safe Harbor provide adequate privacy protection in these circumstances. This risk persists even when explicit identifiers are removed, and is amplified when external datasets are combined. Contrasting past doctrines of "practical obscurity" with modern surveillance, Paul Rosenzweig noted that "GPS systems are much much cheaper than having officers tail a suspect." Rosenzweig cited DOJ v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to illustrate the Court's earlier endorsement of "practical obscurity", in which a FOIA request for a compiled database of public records was rejected 9–0. Quoting Justice Alito in United States v. Jones, Rosenzweig emphasized that long-term digital monitoring introduces "a qualitative difference" in surveillance capability beyond what was possible in analog settings.
