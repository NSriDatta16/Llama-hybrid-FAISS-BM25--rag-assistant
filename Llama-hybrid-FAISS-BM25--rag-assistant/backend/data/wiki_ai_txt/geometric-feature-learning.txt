Geometric feature learning is a technique combining machine learning and computer vision to solve visual tasks. The main goal of this method is to find a set of representative features of geometric form to represent an object by collecting geometric features from images and learning them using efficient machine learning methods. Humans solve visual tasks and can give fast response to the environment by extracting perceptual information from what they see. Researchers simulate humans' ability of recognizing objects to solve computer vision problems. For example, M. Mata et al.(2002) applied feature learning techniques to the mobile robot navigation tasks in order to avoid obstacles. They used genetic algorithms for learning features and recognizing objects (figures). Geometric feature learning methods can not only solve recognition problems but also predict subsequent actions by analyzing a set of sequential input sensory images, usually some extracting features of images. Through learning, some hypothesis of the next action are given and according to the probability of each hypothesis give a most probable action. This technique is widely used in the area of artificial intelligence. Introduction Geometric feature learning methods extract distinctive geometric features from images. Geometric features are features of objects constructed by a set of geometric elements like points, lines, curves or surfaces. These features can be corner features, edge features, Blobs, Ridges, salient points image texture and so on, which can be detected by feature detection methods. Geometric features Primitive features Corners: Corners are a very simple but significant feature of objects. Especially, Complex objects usually have different corner features with each other. Corners of an object can be extracted through Corner detection. Cho and Dunn used a different way to define a corner by the distance and angle between two straight line segments. This is a new way by defining features as a parameterized composition of several components. Edges: Edges are one-dimensional structure features of an image. They represent the boundary of different image regions. The outline of an object can be easily detected by finding the edge using the technique of edge detection. Blobs: Blobs represent regions of images, which can be detected using blob detection method. Ridges: From a practical viewpoint, a ridge can be thought of as a one-dimensional curve that represents an axis of symmetry. Ridges detection method-see ridge detection salient points-see Kadir–Brady saliency detector image texture Compound features Geometric composition Geometric component feature is a combination of several primitive features and it always consists more than 2 primitive features like edges, corners or blobs. Extracting geometric feature vector at location x can be computed according to the reference point, which is shown below: x i = x i − 1 + σ i − 1 d i [ cos ⁡ ( θ i − 1 + ϕ i ) sin ⁡ ( θ i − 1 + ϕ i ) ] {\displaystyle \textstyle \ x_{i}=x_{i-1}+\sigma _{i-1}d_{i}{\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\theta _{i-1}+\phi _{i})\\\sin(\theta _{i-1}+\phi _{i})\end{bmatrix}}} θ i = θ i − 1 + Δ θ i {\displaystyle \textstyle \ \theta _{i}=\theta _{i-1}+\Delta \theta _{i}} σ i = σ i − 1 Δ σ i {\displaystyle \textstyle \ \sigma _{i}=\sigma _{i-1}\Delta \sigma _{i}} x means the location of the location of features, θ {\displaystyle \textstyle \theta } means the orientation, σ {\displaystyle \textstyle \sigma } means the intrinsic scale. Boolean Composition Boolean compound feature consists of two sub-features which can be primitive features or compound features. There are two type of boolean features: conjunctive feature whose value is the product of two sub-features and disjunctive features whose value is the maximum of the two sub-features. Feature space Feature space was firstly considered in computer vision area by Segen. He used multilevel graph to represent the geometric relations of local features.
