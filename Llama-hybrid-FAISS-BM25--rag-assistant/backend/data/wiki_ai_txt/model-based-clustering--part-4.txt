eserves credit as the inventor of model-based clustering for continuous data. Murtagh and Raftery (1984) developed a model-based clustering method based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the component covariance matrices. McLachlan and Basford (1988) was the first book on the approach, advancing methodology and sparking interest. Banfield and Raftery (1993) coined the term "model-based clustering", introduced the family of parsimonious models, described an information criterion for choosing the number of clusters, proposed the uniform model for outliers, and introduced the mclust software. Celeux and Govaert (1995) showed how to perform maximum likelihood estimation for the models. Thus, by 1995 the core components of the methodology were in place, laying the groundwork for extensive development since then. Further reading Scrucca, L.; Fraley, C.; Murphy, T.B.; Raftery, A.E.
