gcup }}R_{j}} : we have that v ∈ ( ⋃ j ∈ A R j ) + ( w ) {\displaystyle v\in \left({\underset {j\in A}{\bigcup }}R_{j}\right)^{+}(w)} if, and only if, there are w 0 , … , w m ∈ M {\displaystyle w_{0},\ldots ,w_{m}\in {\mathcal {M}}} and j 1 , … , j m ∈ A {\displaystyle j_{1},\ldots ,j_{m}\in A} such that w 0 = w , w m = v {\displaystyle w_{0}=w,w_{m}=v} and for all i ∈ { 1 , … , m } {\displaystyle i\in \{1,\ldots ,m\}} , w i − 1 R j i w i {\displaystyle w_{i-1}R_{j_{i}}w_{i}} . Despite the fact that the notion of common belief has to be introduced as a primitive in the language, we can notice that the definition of epistemic models does not have to be modified in order to give truth value to the common knowledge and distributed knowledge operators. Card Example: Players A {\displaystyle A} , B {\displaystyle B} and C {\displaystyle C} (standing for Ann, Bob and Claire) play a card game with three cards: a red one, a green one and a blue one. Each of them has a single card but they do not know the cards of the other players. Ann has the red card, Bob has the green card and Claire has the blue card. This example is depicted in the pointed epistemic model ( M , w ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},w)} represented below. In this example, A G T S := { A , B , C } {\displaystyle AGTS:=\{A,B,C\}} and P R O P := { A , B , C , B , C , A , C , A , B } {\displaystyle PROP:=\{{\color {red}{A}},{\color {green}{B}},{\color {blue}{C}},{\color {red}{B}},{\color {green}{C}},{\color {blue}{A}},{\color {red}{C}},{\color {green}{A}},{\color {blue}{B}}\}} . Each world is labelled by the propositional letters which are true in this world and w {\displaystyle w} corresponds to the actual world. There is an arrow indexed by agent j ∈ { A , B , C } {\displaystyle j\in \{A,B,C\}} from a possible world u {\displaystyle u} to a possible world v {\displaystyle v} when ( u , v ) ∈ R j {\displaystyle (u,v)\in R_{j}} . Reflexive arrows are omitted, which means that for all j ∈ { A , B , C } {\displaystyle j\in \{A,B,C\}} and all v ∈ M {\displaystyle v\in {\mathcal {M}}} , we have that ( v , v ) ∈ R j {\displaystyle (v,v)\in R_{j}} . A {\displaystyle {\color {red}{A}}} stands for : " A {\displaystyle A} has the red card'' C {\displaystyle {\color {blue}{C}}} stand for: " C {\displaystyle C} has the blue card'' B {\displaystyle {\color {green}{B}}} stands for: " B {\displaystyle B} has the green card'' and so on... When accessibility relations are equivalence relations (like in this example) and we have that ( w , v ) ∈ R j {\displaystyle (w,v)\in R_{j}} , we say that agent j {\displaystyle j} cannot distinguish world w {\displaystyle w} from world v {\displaystyle v} (or world w {\displaystyle w} is indistinguishable from world v {\displaystyle v} for agent j {\displaystyle j} ). So, for example, A {\textstyle A} cannot distinguish the actual world w {\displaystyle w} from the possible world where B {\displaystyle B} has the blue card ( B {\displaystyle {\color {blue}{B}}} ), C {\displaystyle C} has the green card ( C {\displaystyle {\color {green}{C}}} ) and A {\displaystyle A} still has the red card ( A {\displaystyle {\color {red}{A}}} ). In particular, the following statements hold: M , w ⊨ ( A ∧ K A A ) ∧ ( C ∧ K C C ) ∧ ( B ∧ K B B ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}},w\models ({\color {red}{A}}\land K_{A}{\color {red}{A}})\land ({\color {blue}{C}}\land K_{C}{\color {blue}{C}})\land ({\color {green}{B}}\land K_{B}{\color {green}{B}})} 'All the agents know the color of their card'. M , w ⊨ K A ( B ∨ B ) ∧ K A ( C ∨ C ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}},w\models K_{A}({\color {blue}{B}}\vee {\color {green}{B}})\land K_{A}({\color {blue}{C}}\vee {\color {green}{C}})} ' A {\displaystyle A} knows that B {\displaystyle B} has either the blue or the green card and that C {\displaystyle C} has either the blue or the green card'. M , w ⊨ E ( A ∨ A ∨ A ) ∧ C ( A ∨ A ∨ A ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}},w\models E({\color {red}{A}}\vee {\color {blue}{A}}\vee {\color {green}{A
