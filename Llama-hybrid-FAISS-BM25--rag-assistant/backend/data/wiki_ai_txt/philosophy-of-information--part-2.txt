o be so powerful that given the right level of abstraction, anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system, and any process could be simulated computationally. Then, however, pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions: how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems? what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be an informational system (or a computational system, if computation is the same as information processing)?
