ere volume (for very small regions) is given by Lebesgue measure in m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional tangent space. By making the regions infinitessimally small, the factor relating the two densities is the ratio of volumes, which we term the differential volume ratio. To obtain concrete formulas for volume on the m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional manifold, we construct U {\displaystyle U} by mapping an m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional rectangle in (local) coordinate space to the manifold via a smooth embedding function: R m → R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} . At very small scale, the embedding function becomes essentially linear so that U {\displaystyle U} is a parallelotope (multidimensional generalization of a parallelogram). Similarly, the flow transform, f {\displaystyle f} becomes linear, so that the image, V = f ( U ) {\displaystyle V=f(U)} is also a parallelotope. In R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} , we can represent an m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional parallelotope with an m -by- m {\displaystyle m{\text{-by-}}m} matrix whose column-vectors are a set of edges (meeting at a common vertex) that span the paralellotope. The volume is given by the absolute value of the determinant of this matrix. If more generally (as is the case here), an m {\displaystyle m} -dimensional paralellotope is embedded in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} , it can be represented with a (tall) n -by- m {\displaystyle n{\text{-by-}}m} matrix, say V {\displaystyle \mathbf {V} } . Denoting the parallelotope as / V / {\displaystyle /\mathbf {V} \!/} , its volume is then given by the square root of the Gram determinant: volume ⁡ / V / = | det ⁡ ( V ′ V ) | {\displaystyle \operatorname {volume} /\mathbf {V} \!/={\sqrt {\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {V} '\mathbf {V} )\right|}}} In the sections below, we show various ways to use this volume formula to derive the differential volume ratio. Simplex flow As a first example, we develop expressions for the differential volume ratio of a simplex flow, q = f ( p ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =f(\mathbf {p} )} , where p , q ∈ M = Δ n − 1 {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ,\mathbf {q} \in {\mathcal {M}}=\Delta ^{n-1}} . Define the embedding function: e : p ~ = ( p 1 … , p n − 1 ) ↦ p = ( p 1 … , p n − 1 , 1 − ∑ i = 1 n − 1 p i ) {\displaystyle e:{\tilde {\mathbf {p} }}=(p_{1}\dots ,p_{n-1})\mapsto \mathbf {p} =(p_{1}\dots ,p_{n-1},1-\sum _{i=1}^{n-1}p_{i})} which maps a conveniently chosen, ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle (n-1)} -dimensional representation, p ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {p} }}} , to the embedded manifold. The n -by- ( n − 1 ) {\displaystyle n{\text{-by-}}(n-1)} Jacobian is E = [ I n − 1 − 1 ′ ] {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} ={\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf {I} _{n-1}\\-{\boldsymbol {1}}'\end{bmatrix}}} . To define U {\displaystyle U} , the differential volume element at the transformation input ( p ∈ Δ n − 1 {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} \in \Delta ^{n-1}} ), we start with a rectangle in p ~ {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {p} }}} -space, having (signed) differential side-lengths, d p 1 , … , d p n − 1 {\displaystyle dp_{1},\dots ,dp_{n-1}} from which we form the square diagonal matrix D {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} } , the columns of which span the rectangle. At very small scale, we get U = e ( D ) = / E D / {\displaystyle U=e(\mathbf {D} )=/\mathbf {ED} \!/} , with: volume ⁡ ( U ) = | det ⁡ ( D E ′ E D ) | = | det ⁡ ( E ′ E ) | | det ⁡ D ) | = n ∏ i = 1 n − 1 | d p i | {\displaystyle \operatorname {volume} (U)={\sqrt {\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {DE} '\mathbf {ED} )\right|}}={\sqrt {\left|\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {E} '\mathbf {E} )\right|}}\,\left|\operatorname {det} \mathbf {D} )\right|={\sqrt {n}}\prod _{i=1}^{n-1}\left|dp_{i}\right|} To understand the geometric interpretation of the factor n {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}} , see the example for the 1-simplex in the diagram at right.
