gn of the AI box. Difficulties Shutdown avoidance Shutdown avoidance is a hypothetical self-preserving quality of artificial intelligence systems. Shutdown-avoiding systems would be incentivized to prevent humans from shutting them down, such as by disabling off-switches or running copies of themselves on other computers. In 2024, researchers in China demonstrated what they claimed to be shutdown avoidance in actual artificial intelligence systems, the large language models Llama 3.1 (Meta) and Qwen 2.5 (Alibaba). One workaround suggested by computer scientist Stuart J. Russell is to ensure that the AI interprets human choices as important information about its intended goals. Alternatively, Laurent Orseau and Stuart Armstrong proved that a broad class of agents, called safely interruptible agents, can learn to become indifferent to whether their off-switch gets pressed. This approach has the limitation that an AI which is completely indifferent to whether it is shut down or not is also unmotivated to care about whether the off-switch remains functional, and could incidentally disable it in the course of its operations. Escaping containment Researchers have speculated that a superintelligent AI would have a wide variety of methods for escaping containment. These hypothetical methods include hacking into other computer systems and copying itself like a computer virus, and the use of persuasion and blackmail to obtain aid from human confederates. The more intelligent a system grows, the more likely the system would be able to escape even the best-designed capability control methods. In order to solve the overall "control problem" for a superintelligent AI and avoid existential risk, AI capability control would at best be an adjunct to "motivation selection" methods that seek to ensure the superintelligent AI's goals are compatible with human survival.
