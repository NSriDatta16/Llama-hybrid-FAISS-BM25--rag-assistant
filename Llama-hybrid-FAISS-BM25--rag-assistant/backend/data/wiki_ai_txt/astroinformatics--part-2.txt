 have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future. Informatics has been recently defined as "the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation". However the usual, or commonly used definition is "informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support." Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., taxonomies, ontologies, folksonomies, and/or collaborative tagging) plus Astrostatistics will also be heavily involved. Citizen science projects (such as Galaxy Zoo) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments. In 2007, the Galaxy Zoo project was launched for morphological classification of a large number of galaxies. In this project, 900,000 images were considered for classification that were taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for the past 7 years. The task was to study each picture of a galaxy, classify it as elliptical or spiral, and determine whether it was spinning or not. The team of Astrophysicists led by Kevin Schawinski in Oxford University were in charge of this project and Kevin and his colleague Chris Linlott figured out that it would take a period of 3â€“5 years for such a team to complete the work. There they came up with the idea of using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques for analyzing the images and classifying them. In 2012, two position papers were presented to the Council of the American Astronomical Society that led to the establishment of formal working groups in astroinformatics and Astrostatistics for the profession of astronomy within the US and elsewhere. Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research. The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow data literacy through the easy re-use of data. It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others. Methodology The data retrieved from the sky surveys are first brought for data preprocessing. In this, redundancies are removed and filtrated. Further, feature extraction is performed on this filtered data set, which is further taken for processes. Some of the renowned sky surveys are listed below: The Palomar Digital Sky Survey (DPOSS) The Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey (SMSS) The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (PanSTARRS) The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) The size of data from the above-mentioned sky surveys ranges from 3 TB to almost 4.6 EB. Further, data mining tasks that are involved in the management and manipulation of the data involve methods like classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and time-series analysis. Several approaches and applications for each of these methods are involved in the task accomplishments. Classification Classification is used for specific identifications and categorizations of astronomical data such as Spectra
