 In the equation above, α {\displaystyle \alpha } is the "forgetting" time scale constant, typically associated to memory volatility, while χ = R off − R on R off {\displaystyle \chi ={\frac {R_{\text{off}}-R_{\text{on}}}{R_{\text{off}}}}} is the ratio of off and on values of the limit resistances of the memristors, S → {\displaystyle {\vec {S}}} is the vector of the sources of the circuit and Ω {\displaystyle \Omega } is a projector on the fundamental loops of the circuit. The constant β {\displaystyle \beta } has the dimension of a voltage and is associated to the properties of the memristor; its physical origin is the charge mobility in the conductor. The diagonal matrix and vector X = diag ⁡ ( X → ) {\displaystyle X=\operatorname {diag} ({\vec {X}})} and X → {\displaystyle {\vec {X}}} respectively, are instead the internal value of the memristors, with values between 0 and 1. This equation thus requires adding extra constraints on the memory values in order to be reliable. It has been recently shown that the equation above exhibits tunneling phenomena and used to study Lyapunov functions. Neuromorphic sensors The concept of neuromorphic systems can be extended to sensors (not just to computation). An example of this applied to detecting light is the retinomorphic sensor or, when employed in an array, the event camera. An event camera's pixels all register changes in brightness levels individually, which makes these cameras comparable to human eyesight in their theoretical power consumption. In 2022, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research reported an organic artificial spiking neuron that exhibits the signal diversity of biological neurons while operating in the biological wetware, thus enabling in-situ neuromorphic sensing and biointerfacing applications. Military applications The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, a branch of the U.S. military, is a center dedicated to the procurement and implementation of AI software and neuromorphic hardware for combat use. Specific applications include smart headsets/goggles and robots. JAIC intends to rely heavily on neuromorphic technology to connect "every sensor (to) every shooter" within a network of neuromorphic-enabled units. Ethical and legal considerations While the interdisciplinary concept of neuromorphic engineering is relatively new, many of the same ethical considerations apply to neuromorphic systems as apply to human-like machines and artificial intelligence in general. However, the fact that neuromorphic systems are designed to mimic a human brain gives rise to unique ethical questions surrounding their usage. However, the practical debate is that neuromorphic hardware as well as artificial "neural networks" are immensely simplified models of how the brain operates or processes information at a much lower complexity in terms of size and functional technology and a much more regular structure in terms of connectivity. Comparing neuromorphic chips to the brain is a very crude comparison similar to comparing a plane to a bird just because they both have wings and a tail. The fact is that biological neural cognitive systems are many orders of magnitude more energy- and compute-efficient than current state-of-the-art AI and neuromorphic engineering is an attempt to narrow this gap by inspiring from the brain's mechanism just like many engineering designs have bio-inspired features. Social concerns Significant ethical limitations may be placed on neuromorphic engineering due to public perception. Special Eurobarometer 382: Public Attitudes Towards Robots, a survey conducted by the European Commission, found that 60% of European Union citizens wanted a ban of robots in the care of children, the elderly, or the disabled. Furthermore, 34% were in favor of a ban on robots in education, 27% in healthcare, and 20% in leisure. The European Commission classifies these areas as notably "human." The report cites increased public concern with robots that are
