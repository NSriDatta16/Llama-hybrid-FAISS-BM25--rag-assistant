Allen's interval algebra is a calculus for temporal reasoning that was introduced by James F. Allen in 1983. The calculus defines possible relations between time intervals and provides a composition table that can be used as a basis for reasoning about temporal descriptions of events. Formal description Relations The following 13 base relations capture the possible relations between two intervals. To see that the 13 relations are exhaustive, note that each point of X {\displaystyle X} can be at 5 possible locations relative to Y {\displaystyle Y} : before, at the start, within, at the end, after. These give 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 {\displaystyle 5+4+3+2+1=15} possible relative positions for the start and the end of X {\displaystyle X} . Of these, we cannot have X 0 = X 1 = Y 0 {\displaystyle X_{0}=X_{1}=Y_{0}} since X 0 < X 1 {\displaystyle X_{0}<X_{1}} , and similarly we cannot have X 0 = X 1 = Y 1 {\displaystyle X_{0}=X_{1}=Y_{1}} , thus giving us 13 possible relations. In general, the number of different relations between n intervals, starting with n = 0, is 1, 1, 13, 409, 23917, 2244361... OEIS A055203. The special case shown above is for n = 2. Composition of relations between intervals For reasoning about the relations between temporal intervals, Allen's interval algebra provides a composition table. Given the relation between X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} and the relation between Y {\displaystyle Y} and Z {\displaystyle Z} , the composition table allows for concluding about the relation between X {\displaystyle X} and Z {\displaystyle Z} . Together with a converse operation, this turns Allen's interval algebra into a relation algebra. Using this calculus, given facts can be formalized and then used for automatic reasoning. Relations between intervals are formalized as sets of base relations. The sentences During dinner, Peter reads the newspaper. Afterwards, he goes to bed. are formalized in Allen's Interval Algebra as follows: newspaper { d } dinner {\displaystyle {\mbox{newspaper }}\mathbf {\{\operatorname {d} \}} {\mbox{ dinner}}} dinner { < } bed {\displaystyle {\mbox{dinner }}\mathbf {\{\operatorname {<} \}} {\mbox{ bed}}} For the example, one can infer newspaper { < } bed {\displaystyle {\mbox{newspaper }}\mathbf {\{\operatorname {<} \}} {\mbox{ bed}}} . Extensions Allen's interval algebra can be used for the description of both temporal intervals and spatial configurations. For the latter use, the relations are interpreted as describing the relative position of spatial objects. This also works for three-dimensional objects by listing the relation for each coordinate separately. The study of overlapping markup uses a similar algebra (see ). Its models have more variations depending on whether endpoints of document structures are permitted to be truly co-located, or merely [tangent]. Temporal primitives In the cultural heritage ontology CIDOC CRM, Allen relations are replaced by so-called temporal primitives, which facilitate the formulation of attestable statements as well as reasoning about these statements. Temporal primitives split up the Allen relations into individual statements about the start or end of the intervals. For example, X overlaps with Y ( X o Y {\displaystyle X\mathbf {\operatorname {o} } Y} ) can be split as follows: X o Y {\displaystyle X\mathbf {\operatorname {o} } Y} ⇔ starts before the start of ( X {\displaystyle X} , Y {\displaystyle Y} ) ∧ ends after the start of ( X {\displaystyle X} , Y {\displaystyle Y} ) ∧ ends before the end of ( X {\displaystyle X} , Y {\displaystyle Y} ) In addition, the equal to of the Allen relations is replaced by before or with and after or with. A simple example: The reign of King Harold II starts before the start of the Battle of Hastings The reign/life of Harold II ends after or with the start of the Battle of Hastings The reign/life of Harold II ends before or with the end of the Battle of Hastings In the example, it is not necessary to specify
