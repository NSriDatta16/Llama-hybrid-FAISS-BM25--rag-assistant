cts about the everyday world, such as "Lemons are sour", that all humans are expected to know. The first AI program to address common sense knowledge was Advice Taker in 1959 by John McCarthy. commonsense reasoning A branch of artificial intelligence concerned with simulating the human ability to make presumptions about the type and essence of ordinary situations they encounter every day. computational chemistry A branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. computational complexity theory Focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm. computational creativity Also artificial creativity, mechanical creativity, creative computing, or creative computation. A multidisciplinary endeavour that includes the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and the arts. computational cybernetics The integration of cybernetics and computational intelligence techniques. computational humor A branch of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence which uses computers in humor research. computational intelligence (CI) Usually refers to the ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation. computational learning theory In computer science, computational learning theory (or just learning theory) is a subfield of artificial intelligence devoted to studying the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms. computational linguistics An interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective, as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions. computational mathematics The mathematical research in areas of science where computing plays an essential role. computational neuroscience Also theoretical neuroscience or mathematical neuroscience. A branch of neuroscience which employs mathematical models, theoretical analysis and abstractions of the brain to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology, and cognitive abilities of the nervous system. computational number theory Also algorithmic number theory. The study of algorithms for performing number theoretic computations. computational problem In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a mathematical object representing a collection of questions that computers might be able to solve. computational statistics Also statistical computing. The interface between statistics and computer science. computer-automated design (CAutoD) Design automation usually refers to electronic design automation, or Design Automation which is a Product Configurator. Extending Computer-Aided Design (CAD), automated design and computer-automated design are concerned with a broader range of applications, such as automotive engineering, civil engineering, composite material design, control engineering, dynamic system identification and optimization, financial systems, industrial equipment, mechatronic systems, steel construction, structural optimisation, and the invention of novel systems. More recently, traditional CAD simulation is seen to be transformed to CAutoD by biologically inspired machine learning, including heuristic search techniques such as evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence algorithms. computer audition (CA) See machine listening. computer science The theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It involves the study of algorithms that process, store, and communicate digital information. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. computer vision An interdisciplinary scientific fi
