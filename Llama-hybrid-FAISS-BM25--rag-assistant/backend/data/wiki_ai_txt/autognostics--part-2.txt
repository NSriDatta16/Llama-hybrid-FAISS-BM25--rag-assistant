 utilization, capacity, quality of service/application/user experience, etc. In order to achieve autognosis, networks need a means to: Continuously monitor/test the network for application-specific performance Analyze the monitoring/test data to detect problems (e.g., performance degradation) Diagnose, identify and localize sources of degradation Automatically take actions to resolve problems via remediation/provisioning Verify the problems have been resolved (potentially rolling back changes if ineffective) Subsequently, continue to monitor/test for performance References Liang Cheng and Ivan Marsic, Piecewise Network Awareness Service for Wireless/Mobile Pervasive Computing, Mobile Networks and Applications (ACM/Springer MONET), Vol. 7, No. 4, pp. 269â€“278, 2002. paper available here Michael Bednarczyk, Claudia Giuli and Jason Bednarczyk, Network Awareness: Adopting a Modern Mindset, white paper Evan Hughes and Anil Somayaji, Towards Network Awareness, paper Network Awareness on Windows Vista See also Autonomic Computing Autonomic Networking Autonomic Systems
