ted sound effects and music, the fact that most computer opponents could be defeated by repeatedly using a simple flying kick, and the static background graphics. Andy Nuttall of The One Amiga echoed these sentiments, stating that "[e]xcept on 'Hard' level, all but the Supervisor and one other opponent can be slaughtered by trapping them in the corner and inflicting repeated jump kicks." Nuttall criticized the game for its short length and added that "there aren't enough characters." A reviewer for Next Generation remarked, "Although the glossy rendered images make the seven different warriors look truly remarkable, the actual playability of the game suffers from the same lack of control plaguing most PC fighting games." He further criticized the poorly designed opponent AI and labeled the game "one of the biggest disappointments of the year." GamePro panned the Game Gear version, summarizing that "the bad control, weak gameplay, and choppy animation infest this cart from start to finish." They particularly criticized the moves as boringly basic and limited, noting that the choppy animation makes the player feel disconnected from what is happening on screen. Reviewing the Super NES version, Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that the graphics are excellent, but the poor control and limited number of moves cripple the game. GamePro labeled it "one of the most unappealing fighting games ever made for the SNES," citing the dark and bland color scheme and the "extremely weak and choppy" controls. Electronic Gaming Monthly was even more condemnatory of the 3DO version, with one reviewer calling it "by far the worst fighting game I've ever seen." All four of their reviewers criticized it for having overlong cinemas, a severely limited number of moves, difficulty executing even basic punches and kicks, and long load times. GamePro also panned the 3DO version, commenting that "Rise offers deceptively good graphicsâ€”the rendered cinemas, characters, and backgrounds do their best to gloss over the choppy gameplay animation and lack of moves." Next Generation reviewed the Super NES version of the game, stating, "In the end, Robots is just another forgettable 'me-too' brawler." According to Mirage, the Amiga CD32 version of Rise of the Robots sold to more than 45% of the Amiga CD32's installed base. Power Unlimited's review of the CD-i version remarked that while the PC and Super Nintendo versions were at least playable, the CD-i version was intolerably slow. Retrospective Next Generation's 1998 retrospective on the failure of Rise of the Robots commented, "Most gamers now know not to trust packaging graphics, but this was a lesson that had to be learned the hard way. In hindsight, it's obvious that nothing could look that good (and Rise of the Robots certainly looked really good) and simultaneously offer great gameplay ... But back in 1994, no one was aware that such high-resolution 'rendered graphics' came with such a price tag, and no one was expecting the game to fail." In 2014, GamesRadar staff named Rise of the Robots the 100th worst video game ever made. They discussed the propensity for bad 2D fighting games in the 1990s and criticized its "aged" rendered 3D graphics, poor character balance, poor combo system, and difficulty spikes. Kevin Green of Nintendo Life listed Rise of the Robots as one of the "games we hope to never see on the Virtual Console service." Green criticized the game for its monotonous gameplay, non-existent game balance, and limited controls, stating it "was a horrible mess from start to finish, clearly rushed out to make money from the beat-em-up craze." Reviewing the Super NES version, Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame cited the game as "one of the most boring 16-bit fighting games," although he praised the game's soundtrack as "riveting and distinctive." Mirage's managing director Peter Jones has stated that he stands by the game's quality, arguing that the negative response to Rise of the Robots was primarily due to
