nt2\wedge Obs2} (fault model) The semantics of these formulae is the following: if the behaviour of the system is not abnormal (i.e. if it is normal), then the internal (unobservable) behaviour will be I n t 1 {\displaystyle Int1\,} and the observable behaviour O b s 1 {\displaystyle Obs1\,} . Otherwise, the internal behaviour will be I n t 2 {\displaystyle Int2\,} and the observable behaviour O b s 2 {\displaystyle Obs2\,} . Given the observations O b s {\displaystyle Obs\,} , the problem is to determine whether the system behaviour is normal or not ( Â¬ A b ( S ) {\displaystyle \neg Ab(S)\,} or A b ( S ) {\displaystyle Ab(S)\,} ). This is an example of abductive reasoning. Diagnosability A system is said to be diagnosable if whatever the behavior of the system, we will be able to determine without ambiguity a unique diagnosis. The problem of diagnosability is very important when designing a system because on one hand one may want to reduce the number of sensors to reduce the cost, and on the other hand one may want to increase the number of sensors to increase the probability of detecting a faulty behavior. Several algorithms for dealing with these problems exist. One class of algorithms answers the question whether a system is diagnosable; another class looks for sets of sensors that make the system diagnosable, and optionally comply to criteria such as cost optimization. The diagnosability of a system is generally computed from the model of the system. In applications using model-based diagnosis, such a model is already present and doesn't need to be built from scratch. Bibliography Hamscher, W.; L. Console; J. de Kleer (1992).
