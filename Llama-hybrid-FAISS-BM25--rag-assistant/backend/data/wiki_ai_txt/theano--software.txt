Theano is a Python library and optimizing compiler for manipulating and evaluating mathematical expressions, especially matrix-valued ones. In Theano, computations are expressed using a NumPy-esque syntax and compiled to run efficiently on either CPU or GPU architectures. History Theano is an open source project primarily developed by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) at the Université de Montréal. The name of the software references the ancient philosopher Theano, long associated with the development of the golden mean. On 28 September 2017, Pascal Lamblin posted a message from Yoshua Bengio, Head of MILA: major development would cease after the 1.0 release due to competing offerings by strong industrial players. Theano 1.0.0 was then released on 15 November 2017. On 17 May 2018, Chris Fonnesbeck wrote on behalf of the PyMC development team that the PyMC developers will officially assume control of Theano maintenance once the MILA development team steps down. On 29 January 2021, they started using the name Aesara for their fork of Theano. On 29 Nov 2022, the PyMC development team announced that the PyMC developers will fork the Aesara project under the name PyTensor. Sample code The following code is the original Theano's example. It defines a computational graph with 2 scalars a and b of type double and an operation between them (addition) and then creates a Python function f that does the actual computation. Examples Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product) The following code demonstrates how to perform matrix multiplication using Theano, which is essential for linear algebra operations in many machine learning tasks. Gradient Calculation The following code uses Theano to compute the gradient of a simple operation (like a neuron) with respect to its input. This is useful in training machine learning models (backpropagation). Building a Simple Neural Network The following code shows how to start building a simple neural network. This is a very basic neural network with one hidden layer. Broadcasting in Theano The following code demonstrates how broadcasting works in Theano. Broadcasting allows operations between arrays of different shapes without needing to explicitly reshape them.
