press that all occurrences of card and code should mean the same card and the same code, ACE provides anaphoric references via the definite article: A customer enters a card and a code. If the code is valid then SimpleMat accepts the card. During the processing of the ACE text, all anaphoric references are replaced by the most recent and most specific accessible noun phrase that agrees in gender and number. As an example of "most recent and most specific", suppose an ACE parser is given the sentence: A customer enters a red card and a blue card. Then: The card is correct. refers to the second card, while: The red card is correct. refers to the first card. Noun phrases within if-then sentences, universally quantified sentences, negations, modality, and subordinated sentences cannot be referred to anaphorically from subsequent sentences, i.e. such noun phrases are not "accessible" from the following text. Thus for each of the sentences: If a customer owns a card then he enters it. Every customer enters a card. A customer does not enter a card. A customer can enter a card. A clerk believes that a customer enters a card. we cannot refer to a card with: The card is correct. Anaphoric references are also possible via personal pronouns: A customer enters a card and a code. If it is valid then SimpleMat accepts the card. or via variables: A customer enters a card X and a code Y. If Y is valid then SimpleMat accepts X. Anaphoric references via definite articles and variables can be combined: A customer enters a card X and a code Y. If the code Y is valid then SimpleMat accepts the card X. Note that proper names like SimpleMat always refer to the same object.
