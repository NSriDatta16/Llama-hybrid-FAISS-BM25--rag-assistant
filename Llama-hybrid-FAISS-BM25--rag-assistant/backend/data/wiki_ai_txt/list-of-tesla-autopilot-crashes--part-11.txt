South Lake Tahoe, California, US (July 5, 2023) On July 5, 2023, at approximately 5:30 p.m. (PDT), the driver of a Subaru Impreza traveling north on Pioneer Trail at 55 mph (89 km/h) collided head-on with a Tesla Model 3 traveling south at 45 mph (72 km/h). The collision happened just south of the intersection with Fair Meadow Trail. The driver of the Subaru was taken to Barton Memorial Hospital, where he died from his injuries.

Opal, Virginia, US (July 19, 2023) While traveling north on the concurrent US 15/17/29 (James Madison Highway) at approximately 6:31 p.m. (EDT) on July 19, 2023, the driver of a Tesla Model Y collided with and continued under the side of the trailer of a combination truck pulling out of the Quarles Truck Stop fuel station near Opal, Virginia, south of Warrenton. The Tesla driver was killed and the truck driver was cited for reckless driving. Two days later, the Fauquier County Sheriff's Office executed a search warrant for data from the Tesla, based on witness reports that said the Tesla driver did not attempt to brake before the collision. The reckless driving charge against the truck driver was dropped in November, after the sheriff's office found the Tesla was travelling at 70 mph (110 km/h) prior to impact, exceeding the 45 mph (72 km/h) speed limit in that area. That August, NHTSA sent a team to investigate the collision; the Tesla is suspected of being operated under Autopilot. Telemetry data indicate that an automated driving system was in use at the time of the crash. The sheriff's office concluded that Autopilot was in use, based on data obtained from the vehicle's event data recorder; the system had warned the driver to take control because it had detected an obstacle ahead, and the driver applied the brakes approximately one second before impact, but it was not clear if that was sufficient to disengage Autopilot. Had the vehicle been traveling at the speed limit, the sheriff's office determined the driver would have had adequate time to avoid the collision. Flagstaff, Arizona, US (November 27, 2023) The driver of a Tesla Model Y was travelling down the Interstate 17 from Flagstaff to Phoenix, Arizona.
