Italian brainrot is a series of Internet memes that emerged in early 2025 characterized by surrealist and absurd images of AI-generated creatures who are given pseudo-Italian names. The phenomenon quickly spread across social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, owing to its combination of synthesized "Italian" voiceovers, grotesque or humorous visuals, abstractism, and nonsensical narrative. Description Italian brainrot is characterized by absurd images or videos created by generative artificial intelligence. It typically features hybrids of animals with everyday objects, food, and weapons. They are given Italianized names or use stereotypical cultural markers and are accompanied by AI-generated audio of an Italian man's narration, which is often nonsensical. The names of these characters often have Italian suffixes, such as -ini or -ello. These characters combine elements of surrealism, visual anxiety (uncanny valley) and internet irony, reflecting the post-ironic humor of Generation Z. The term brain rot was Oxford Word of the Year in 2024, and refers to the deteriorating effect on one's mental state when overconsuming "trivial or unchallenging content" online. It can also refer to the content itself. Online users often use this label to acknowledge the ridiculousness of Italian brainrot, while recognising the growing amount of AI slop present online. Fans have created various stories featuring characters from Italian brainrot, forming a type of Internet folklore with overly dramatic storylines and voices. Origin In October 2023, Internet users created various Italian memes about American actor and wrestler Dwayne Johnson in which he rhymes about absurd topics. In one video, Johnson would use the nonsense word "Tralalero tralala", and would later rhyme it with "smerdo pure nell'aldilà" ("I shit even in the afterlife"). The phrase would later be used to create the basis of Italian brainrot. Although the exact origin of Italian brainrot is hard to pinpoint, the character Tralalero Tralala is widely considered to be the first example of the trend. The creation of the character is often attributed to the TikTok user @eZburger401, who reportedly posted a video featuring the character in January 2025. The user was banned after posting, potentially due to its accompanying audio containing profanity and blasphemy against the Abrahamic God in Italian. Later, user @elchino1246 posted a video using Tralalero Tralala's audio, accompanied with an image of a shark mixed with a pigeon. Lastly, on 13 January 2025, user @amoamimandy.1a created a now deleted post using the audio, instead using an AI-generated image of a shark with shoes. This video gained 7 million views. Alternatively, American website Vulture claimed that TikTok user @burgermerda created the audio in September 2024, and that @eZburger401 was merely a re-uploader. Characters Italian brainrot features various AI-generated characters. Several characters are hybrids, often combining animals with everyday objects and various fruits. Other characters are combinations of pre-existing ones, resulting in excessively long names. Tralalero Tralala The first viral character of the genre – a three-"legged" shark in Nike sneakers described as athletic, being able to run at superhuman speeds and jump high. Bombardiro Crocodilo A hybrid creature with the head of a crocodile and the body of a World War II-era twin-engine bomber. Closely related to it is a goose with fighter jet wings named Bombombini Gusini. Tung Tung Tung Sahur An anthropomorphic wood plank who holds a baseball bat. Although considered part of Italian brainrot, it has Indonesian origin. The "Tung Tung Tung" in its name is onomatopoeia of how Indonesians traditionally beat kentungan slit drums to commence suhur, the pre-dawn meal that Muslims eat before fasting during Ramadan. The word tung also means "rumbling" in Sundanese, spoken in Indonesia. @noxaasht originally made the character in February 2025, and it has
