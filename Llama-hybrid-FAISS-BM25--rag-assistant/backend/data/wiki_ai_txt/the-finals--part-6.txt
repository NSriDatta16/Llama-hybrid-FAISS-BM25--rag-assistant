This game mode follows Deathmatch rules with some modifications: The first team to earn 35 kills, or which team has the most kills before the timer runs out, wins the round. Every player is locked to playing as a Medium, with no access to specializations. Additionally, every player receives the CL-40, APS Turret, Bounce Pad and RPG as gadgets. For aesthetics, the graphics and sound quality of the game are reduced, new sound effects for weapons were added, and a new announcer was used for the game mode. Super Cashball Super Cashball was a limited-time event game mode that lasted from July 24 to August 7, 2025. The gamemode is an entirely new mode that pits two teams of 5 against each other. The objective is to claim a "Cashball" at the center of an arena, and toss it into the enemy's goal to earn points. Throwing the ball to an ally who catches it "charges" the Cashball, adding one more point to its value up to a maximum of 3 points. The gamemode lasts 10 minutes with a brief intermission at the 5-minute mark to allow players to regroup and change their loadouts. Players can choose from three preset loadouts, one for each class.

The modified spear could repel opponents with both its primary and secondary attacks. Additionally, the secondary attack spun for only one round, down from three in the normal version. The modified spear also could deal more damage to buildings, typically requiring only two or three hits to destroy a wall. The physical law was also modified - the lower HP players had, the easier it was for them to be repelled over a long distance. In exchange, players could not be eliminated by damage - only by dropping outside of the map would truly eliminate them.
