Applications of machine learning (ML) in earth sciences include geological mapping, gas leakage detection and geological feature identification. Machine learning is a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence aimed at developing programs that are able to classify, cluster, identify, and analyze vast and complex data sets without the need for explicit programming to do so. Earth science is the study of the origin, evolution, and future of the Earth. The earth's system can be subdivided into four major components including the solid earth, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. A variety of algorithms may be applied depending on the nature of the task. Some algorithms may perform significantly better than others for particular objectives. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are good at interpreting images, whilst more general neural networks may be used for soil classification, but can be more computationally expensive to train than alternatives such as support vector machines. The range of tasks to which ML (including deep learning) is applied has been ever-growing in recent decades, as has the development of other technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ultra-high resolution remote sensing technology, and high-performance computing. This has led to the availability of large high-quality datasets and more advanced algorithms. Significance Complexity of earth science Problems in earth science are often complex. It is difficult to apply well-known and described mathematical models to the natural environment, therefore machine learning is commonly a better alternative for such non-linear problems. Ecological data are commonly non-linear and consist of higher-order interactions, and together with missing data, traditional statistics may underperform as unrealistic assumptions such as linearity are applied to the model. A number of researchers found that machine learning outperforms traditional statistical models in earth science, such as in characterizing forest canopy structure, predicting climate-induced range shifts, and delineating geologic facies. Characterizing forest canopy structure enables scientists to study vegetation response to climate change. Predicting climate-induced range shifts enable policy makers to adopt suitable conversation method to overcome the consequences of climate change. Delineating geologic facies helps geologists to understand the geology of an area, which is essential for the development and management of an area. Inaccessible data In Earth Sciences, some data are often difficult to access or collect, therefore inferring data from data that are easily available by machine learning method is desirable. For example, geological mapping in tropical rainforests is challenging because the thick vegetation cover and rock outcrops are poorly exposed. Applying remote sensing with machine learning approaches provides an alternative way for rapid mapping without the need of manually mapping in the unreachable areas. Reduce time costs Machine learning can also reduce the efforts done by experts, as manual tasks of classification and annotation etc. are the bottlenecks in the workflow of the research of earth science. Geological mapping, especially in a vast, remote area is labour, cost and time-intensive with traditional methods. Incorporation of remote sensing and machine learning approaches can provide an alternative solution to eliminate some field mapping needs. Consistent and bias-free Consistency and bias-free is also an advantage of machine learning compared to manual works by humans. In research comparing the performance of human and machine learning in the identification of dinoflagellates, machine learning is found to be not as prone to systematic bias as humans. A recency effect that is present in humans is that the classification often biases towards the most recently recalled classes. In a labelling task of the research, if one kind of dinoflagellates occurs rarely in th
