mbination potential of system position 1, 8 and 9 make ICC to a self-networking system which complies with the present scientific development. In matrix form The first two levels of ICC can be represented by following matrix. The first hierarchical level of the 9 subject categories results from the first vertical array under codes 1-9. The second hierarchical level of subject categories is structured by the 9 functionally ordered form categories, listed in the first horizontal line under codes 01-09. Some exceptions are mentioned in principle 7. Research Exploration of automatic classification For classifying web documents as conceived by Jens Hartmann, University of Karlsruhe, Prof.Walter Koch, University of Graz, has explored in his Institute for Applied Information Technology Research Society (AIT) the application of ICC to automatically classifying metadata of some 350.000 documents. This was facilitated by data generated within the framework of an EU-supported project "EuropeanaLocal". For this exploration, three ICC hierarchical levels have been used for some 5000 terms. The result is described in the report of Christoph Mak. Prof.Koch regarded a classification degree of almost 50% as a good result, considering that only a shortened version of ICC had been used. In order to reach a better result one would have needed 1–2 years. Also an index of all terms with their codes could be achieved under these explorations. Data Linkage Motivated by the work of an Italian research Group in Trento on Revising the Wordnet Domains Hierarchy: semantics, coverage and balancing, by which the DDC codes were used, Prof. Ernesto William De Luca et al. showed in a study that for such case the use of ICC could lead to essentially better results. This was shown in two contributions: Including knowledge domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud (LLD) and Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung?, in which the LLD was used in a meta-model which contains all resources with the possibility of retrieval and navigation of data from different aspects. By this, the existing work about many thousand knowledge fields (of ICC) can be combined with the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud, based on RDF/OWL representation of EuroWordNet and similar integrated lexical resources (MultiWordNet, MEMODATA and the Hamburg Metapher BD). Semantic Web structuring In October 2013, the computer scientist Hermann Bense, Dortmund, explored the possibilities for structuring the Semanic Web with ICC codes. He developed two approaches for a pictorial presentation of knowledge fields with their possible subdivisions. A graphic representation of those knowledge fields pertaining to the first two levels can be found under Ontology4. The inclusion of the third hierarchical level has been envisaged as the next step. Some potential applications of ICC in its present form Possibility to roughly structure documents, especially bibliographies and reference works. Structuring personal repertories, e.g. a Who's Who in Who's Who in Classification and Indexing Supporting the recollection of statistics by knowledge fields, e.g. also concerning university professors, statistics of academies, of institutions, of teachers in special education Publishing houses could take up ICC codes for their products to help later sorting by knowledge fields. As a standard classification ICC may be used in many cases, especially in industry, knowledge management and knowledge engineering. With the definition of all its terms a lexicon of knowledge fields could be published. This could also be used for such lexica in other languages. As an example, ICC could be used to compare ongoing scientific activities on a European or world-wide scale. ICC can also be an appropriate tool for switching between extant universal classification systems. ICC can also be a suitable „hang-up system“ for special classification systems, e.g. for special termin
