Micah Xavier Johnson (July 2, 1991 – July 7, 2016) was an American Army reserve Afghan war veteran and Black nationalist who carried out the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers during a Black lives matter protest. He ambushed and killed five officers and wounded nine others in Downtown, Dallas, Texas. He was killed by police during a standoff after expressing anger over police killings of Black men. The attack was one of the deadliest incidents against law enforcement. Early Life Micah Xavier Johnson was born in Magee, Mississippi, on July 2, 1991, and he was raised in Mesquite, Texas. When he was four years old, his parents divorced. At 17, Johnson enrolled at John Horn High School, where he joined the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, as reported by the Mesquite Independent school district. He faced academic challenges, graduating in 2009 with a 1.98 GPA and ranking 430th out of 453 students in his class. In Spring 2011, Johnson registered for four courses at Richland college but did not complete any. Evidence suggests his enrollment at Richland gave him access to El Centro College, due to his pre-planned and coordinated movements throughout Building B during his standoff with police in 2016. Military service Enlistment and early service Micah Xavier Johnson enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in March 2009 at the age of 18, shortly after graduating high school in Mesquite, Texas. His initial service was primarily stateside, where he trained as a carpentry and masonry specialist (military occupational specialty 51B). This role involved engineering tasks such as construction and repair in support of military operations. During his reserve tenure, Johnson served part-time while living at home, and he was described by family and friends as initially idealistic about the military, even aspiring to become a police officer. Deployment to Afghanistan In September 2013, Johnson was activated for full-time duty and deployed to Afghanistan as part of the 420th Engineer Brigade, a unit based in Seagoville, Texas. His tour began in November 2013 and lasted approximately eight months, ending in July 2014. During this period, he performed non-combat engineering duties, though the stresses of serving in a combat zone were noted by those close to him. Associates from his service later suggested he experienced significant psychological strain, including the loss of friends and general disillusionment with military life, which contrasted with his pre-deployment enthusiasm. His mother later reflected that "the military was not what Micah thought it would be." Sexual harassment allegation and early return About six months into his deployment, in May 2014, Johnson faced a serious accusation of sexual harassment from a higher-ranking female soldier. She filed for a military protective order against him, prompting an investigation. As a result, his chain of command recommended an "other than honorable" discharge—the most severe administrative separation short of a court-martial—and he was sent back to the United States ahead of schedule. Despite this, Johnson was not court-martialed, and the case did not lead to criminal charges. A military lawyer who represented him described the handling as unusual, noting that "someone really screwed up" in allowing him to avoid harsher consequences. Post-deployment and discharge Upon returning stateside in August 2014, Johnson resumed reserve duties with his engineering brigade until April 2015. He was honorably discharged at the rank of private first class (E-3), a relatively low junior enlisted rank after six years of service, which military sources attributed partly to the unresolved harassment allegation impacting his promotions and evaluations. Friends and family observed a marked change in his demeanor post-deployment: he became more reclusive, resentful toward the government, and withdrawn, with some speculating that the Afghanistan experience and the scandal contributed to a "small breakdown."
