by Gary Leach, who had experience in martial arts. Leach also ported the AI tables to the PC version. The game features a soundtrack by Queen's guitarist Brian May, whose solo album Back to the Light caught Mirage's attention. Musical tracks from the album, "The Dark" and "Resurrection", were selected to fit the game's style and tone. Although the game featured May's soundtrack, only "The Dark" appeared in the final release, while the actual in-game score was composed by Richard Joseph. While May did indeed record a full soundtrack for the game, it was postponed by his record company, prompting Mirage to proceed without May's musical contributions, except for short guitar sounds. Release Rise of the Robots was unveiled at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in 1993. Mirage's public relations manager, Julia Coombs, stated that Rise of the Robots would be published by Time Warner Interactive, with Mirage serving as the developer. Rise of the Robots was propelled by a multimillion-pound marketing campaign, which led to a novel from Penguin Books, and discussions were held regarding toys, comics, an animated series, and a feature film. In addition to the Amiga and PC DOS computer versions, Rise of the Robots was ported to various video game consoles, including the Super NES, Mega Drive, Game Gear, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Amiga CD32, and Philips CD-i. The Mega Drive, Game Gear, and Super NES versions were developed and programmed by Data Design Interactive. Absolute Entertainment initially owned the rights to the 3DO, Mega Drive, Game Gear, and Super NES versions of the game but later sold all Rise of the Robots rights back to developer Mirage, except for the 3DO version rights. Mirage then sold the Super NES rights to Acclaim Entertainment. In a reversal of the usual pattern for video games, the home versions were all developed and released first, with the enhanced arcade version coming later. Coombs stated that Rise of the Robots was originally developed with the Amiga in mind, while the PC version was a "conversion 'upwards,' meaning additions could be made." She added that problems arose with the console versions, and porting the game from one platform to another was not straightforward. Rise of the Robots was originally scheduled for release in February 1994, but was delayed because the developers wanted to "continue to perfect the graphics and enhance the gameplay as much as possible." Rise of the Robots was ultimately released on November 18, 1994, for Amiga and PC platforms. The Super NES version was released in December, in North America by Acclaim Entertainment, and in Japan by T&E Soft. The Mega Drive version was scheduled for a December 1994 release in Europe, but it was delayed until February 1995. The arcade version was released in May 1995 in the United Kingdom; it represented the main effort by the slot machine manufacturer Bell-Fruit to create an arcade machine using PC architecture. A "Director's Cut" edition was released on PC. It includes a second disc featuring work-in-progress footage, interactive pre-production animations, still image galleries, and other behind-the-scenes material. A version for the Atari Jaguar CD was in development by Art Data Interactive and was planned to be published by Time Warner Interactive in 1995, but it was never released for unknown reasons. Game Boy and Master System versions were also planned. Reception Reviewing the Amiga version for Amiga Power, Jonathan Davies noted that review copies had been released to the press only a few days before the game's launch. He concluded that "it's probably because the graphics are [so] good that the game plays so poorlyâ€”every move the robots make takes so many frames of animation, and so much memory, and so many months of rendering with 3D Studio, that it simply wouldn't have been possible to make the gameplay any more complicated than it is." Davies highlighted several flaws, including the inability for players to turn around, the limi
