and humanitarian work. Examples of such use cases include predicting dengue fever outbreaks more quickly in Pakistan, using rapid and near real-time assessment of population displacement following the Nepal earthquake. Modelling epidemics – since human mobility is the main component of large-scale spatial transmission of infectious diseases, it is critical to model and quantify human mobility in order to improve epidemic control. Examples: analysing Malaria transmission in Senegal, responding to Ebola outbreak, monitoring the spread of cholera outbreaks. Poverty and wealth – accurate and timely estimates of population characteristics are a critical input to social and economic research and policy. An example of a use case here is predicting wealth throughout Rwanda using mobile positioning data. Seasonal mobility – analysing human movement patterns and monitoring changes in them are important for decision-making. For example, in MPD-based research carried out in Senegal, the movement patterns of different population groups were extracted and visualised. Official statistics Mobile positioning data can be used in the production of official statistics. As at 2021, there are two countries in the world where statistics providers use passive mobile positioning data as part of the regular production of official tourism statistics: Estonia and Indonesia. Eesti Pank, the central bank of Estonia, produces official tourism travel statistics based on passive mobile positioning data since 2008 and the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism produces MPD-based inbound cross-border visitor arrival statistics since 2016. Advantages of mobile positioning data For statistical purposes, mobile positioning data provides new possibilities in terms of the quality of the data. Statistics based on MPD can be compiled automatically, in some cases almost in real time, and it requires less manual labour. The job of analysing and interpreting the resulting statistical indicators is left for statisticians and researchers, but the new concept of fast and expansive data collection improves the quality of decision-making processes and results in public and private sectors. Mobile positioning data is said to have better spatial and temporal precision than regular tourism statistics. The precision of antennae offers more perspectives of research than accommodation statistics does. Digital records on the movements of tourists make it possible to analyse their space-time behaviour. This allows the linking of routes used by tourists with the places they visited and the connecting of sites of interest with points of entry or with final destinations in the country etc. Space-time precision enables the investigation of single events and their geography more than had previously been possible. This allows studying the extent and impacts of events such as fairs, concerts, sports events and also managing crowds of visitors. Mobile positioning data is also touted to be suitable for studying tourism in less visited natural areas where it is difficult to use other methods such as accommodation statistics or questionnaires. The timeliness of statistics (up to near real-time) and the possibility of producing unconfirmed quick indicators are further features provided by mobile positioning data. On the other hand, researchers might also face difficulty in assessing the quality of statistics based on MPD because the prevalence of mobile phone usage during travel is largely unknown and the methodology might not be firm. A relative lack of information on the purpose of the trip, expenditure, type of accommodation and means of transport used are also cited as common issues. Nevertheless, passive mobile positioning data has several advantages, which can substantiate its use and even open up new perspectives in tourism studies and management tools. One of the biggest advantages of positioning data is the possibility of monitoring tourism in real time. The data can be gathered regularly and v
