is always too busy contributing his work to maintain the settlement's survival and progress. Eric finds himself in a room where he manipulates code to show him his desired view: Earth. The earth Eric is staring at is 490 years behind the Earth's present day, around the time Columbus started sailing the New World. Eric looks at Earth and wonders if somewhere there was a young man, like him, looking up to the sky. The stars in the night sky bring the three stories together by giving each boy hope that someone out there is wondering about him and holding the same astronomical curiosities. "Superdisappointed" “Superdisappointed” explores the challenges of being the first Ojibwe superhero. Initially, protagonist Kyle Muncy is excited when he spontaneously develops superpowers, attempting to change the world for the better. But six months later, his life is irrevocably worse. As Kyle “can only come out of so many closets at once,” and is unwilling to both come “out of the superhero closet” and announce his homosexuality to the world, his relationship with his boyfriend Raymond is destroyed. He is burdened by lawsuits, from banks that have been damaged during foiled robberies to sports teams contesting his use of the name Thunderbird, a symbol appropriated from First Nations culture. (To the Ojibwe, whose five clans are each represented by animals, the Thunderbird would have represented a sixth clan, but the great being meant to found it was so powerful that it killed its people instead.) All of this leaves Kyle depressed and isolated. Kyle's white doctor reluctantly reveals that the causes of Kyle's superpowers are most likely due to his poisonous living conditions, common to First Nation reserves: unclean water on the reserve, radon gas, and toxic mould. Kyle posits that his abilities are really the symptoms of a polluted and exploited “Earth fighting back...the first casualty of a war to come.” The story ends with the defeated Kyle adrift in slumber, social and environmental injustice continuing unabated, with no one to stop them. As his doctor muses, “If you have all the money in the world but no place to spend it, is there a point?” "Take Us to Your Chief" Three old Ojibwe friends, Teddy, Tarzan, and Cheemo (meaning “big shit”) have spent so much time together that they are able to communicate without speaking. The trio are drinking beer at Otter Lake Reserve, when a spacecraft with mysterious dimensions and blinking lights descends from the sky. An ambiguously shaped extraterrestrial emerges from the ship. Its body temperature runs hot, it leaves a trail of slime as it moves, and it smells of methane, presumably because of a methane-heavy atmosphere on its home planet. The alien identifies itself as a member of the Kaaw Wiyaa and asks to communicate with the trio's leader. Knowing nobody in a higher position of power, the trio introduce the Kaaw Wiyaa to the Chief of the Otter Lake First Nation. Using diplomatic tactics he learned from his experience at an Assembly of First Nations, Chief Angus attempts to negotiate with the aliens. The situation reminds him of the Beothuk and Mi’kmaq experiences during the first contact with Europeans hundreds of years before. To begin negotiations, the Kaaw Wiyaa offer to build monuments reminiscent of ancient world wonders, suggesting that structures such as the pyramids or Stonehenge had also been constructed by aliens. Instead, the Chief wishes the aliens could clean the reserve's drinking water but, assuming they could not navigate the governmental restrictions, settles on relieving the reservation of the trio by sending them to the Kaaw Wiyaa's planet as diplomats. The story ends as the trio hitch a ride to the Kaaw Wiyaa's planet in the spaceship's impossibly large cabin. The aliens compliment the humans on their ability to meta-communicate, citing this neurological advancement as the reason they approached Earth. The trio begin to regret their decision, until the extraterrestrials offe
