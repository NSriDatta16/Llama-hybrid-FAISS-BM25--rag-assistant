The AI boom is an ongoing period of technological progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that started in the late 2010s before gaining international prominence in the 2020s. Examples include generative AI technologies, such as large language models and AI image generators by companies like OpenAI, as well as scientific advances, such as protein folding prediction led by Google DeepMind. This period is sometimes referred to as an AI spring, to contrast it with previous AI winters. As of 2025, ChatGPT is the 5th most visited website globally behind Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. History In 2012, a University of Toronto research team used artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques to lower the error rate below 25% for the first time during the ImageNet challenge for object recognition in computer vision. The event catalyzed the AI boom later that decade, when many alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, marking the first time a computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. This match led to an increase in public interest in AI. The generative AI race began in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and advances made in graphics processing units (GPUs), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures. In 2018, the AI Index, an initiative organized by Stanford University, reported an acceleration of research and commercial services using AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and may improve the process of drug development. Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently. ChatGPT, a chatbot based on a large language model created by OpenAI, was released in November 2022. ChatGPT had over 100 million users in two months, and according to investment bank UBS, was the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. Several other companies have released competitors. At a similar time, text-to-image-models such as DALL-E and Midjourney become popular as a way to generate complicated photo-like illustrations. Speech synthesis software also became able to replicate the voices and speech of specific people. Advances Biomedical In 2020, DeepMind's AlphaFold program, which is designed to predict protein folding, scored more than 90 in CASP's Global distance test (GDT). The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result "a stunning advance on the protein folding problem". The ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence may accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases. Images and videos AI modified images started to be widely circulated on the internet following the public release of Google's DeepDream in 2015. OpenAI released DALL-E, a model capable of generating relatively crude images based on text descriptions, in January 2021. A successor capable of generating more complex and realistic images, DALL-E 2, was released in April 2022. Notable examples of other text-to-image models include NovelAI in 2021, and Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, both released in 2022. Examples of text-to-video platforms include Runway's Gen-1 model released in February 2023, and by OpenAI's Sora in December 2024. Language GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating human-like text. A new version called GPT-4 was released on March 14, 2023, and was used in the Microsoft Bing search engine. Other language models have been released, such as PaLM and Gemini by Google and LLaMA by Meta Platforms. Music and voice In 2016, Google DeepMind unveiled WaveNet, a deep learning network th
