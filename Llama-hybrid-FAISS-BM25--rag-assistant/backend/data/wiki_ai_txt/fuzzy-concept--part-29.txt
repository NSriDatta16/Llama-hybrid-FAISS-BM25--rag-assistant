ribing the concepts using the terms of fuzzy logic or other substructural logics. With the rapid development of computer programming languages and digital processing capacity since the 1970s, it is now accepted in the sciences that there isn't just one "correct" way to formalize items of knowledge. Innovators realized that concepts and processes can be represented using many different kinds of tools, methods and systems — according to what happens to be the most useful, effective or efficient method for a given purpose. Aided by new software and artificial intelligence, many traditional and new sorts of techniques can be applied to clarify ideas, such as: Contextualizing the concept by defining the setting or situation in which the concept is used, or how it is used appropriately (context, Contextualization, Contextual inquiry, Context-based learning). Identifying the intention, purpose, aim, function or goal associated with the concept (teleology, causality and design). Comparing and contrasting the concept with related ideas in the present or the past (comparative and comparative research). Creating a model, likeness, analogy, metaphor, prototype or narrative which shows what the concept is about or how it is applied (isomorphism, simulation or successive approximation [137]). Probing the assumptions on which a concept is based, or which are associated with its use (critical thought, tacit assumption). Mapping or graphing the applications of the concept using some basic parameters, or using some diagrams or flow charts to understand the relationships between elements involved (visualization, Operationalization and concept map). Examining how likely it is that the concept applies, statistically or intuitively (probability theory). Specifying relevant conditions to which the concept applies, as a procedure (computer programming, formal concept analysis). Concretizing the concept – finding specific examples, illustrations, details or cases to which it applies (exemplar, exemplification). Reducing or restating fuzzy concepts in terms which are simpler or similar, and which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy (simplification, dimensionality reduction, plain language, KISS principle or concision). Trying out, signalling, gesturing or acting out a concept, by using/expressing it in interactions, practical work or in communication, and assessing the feedback to understand how the boundaries and distinctions of the concept are being drawn (mimesis, trial and error or pilot experiment). Engaging in a structured dialogue or repeated discussion, to exchange ideas about how to get specific about what it means and how to clear it up (scrum method). Allocating different applications of the concept to different but related sets (Boolean logic). Identifying operational rules defining the use of the concept, which can be stated in a language and which cover all or most cases (material conditional). Classifying, categorizing, grouping, or inventorizing all or most cases or uses to which the concept applies (taxonomy, cluster analysis and typology). Applying a meta-language which includes fuzzy concepts in a more inclusive categorical system which is not fuzzy (meta). Creating a measure or scale of the degree to which the concept applies (metrology). Examining the distribution patterns or distributional frequency of (possibly different) uses of the concept (statistics). Specifying a series of logical operators or inferential system which captures all or most cases to which the concept applies (algorithm). Relating the fuzzy concept to other concepts which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy, or simply by replacing the fuzzy concept altogether with another, alternative concept which is not fuzzy yet "works the same way" (proxy) Engaging in meditation, taking a pause to relax, or taking the proverbial "run around the block" to clarify the mind, and thus improve precision of thought about the definitional issue (self-care). In this way, we can obtain a more exact
