 even when they appear in different lighting conditions, at different angles, or in partially occluded views. In particular, solutions based on this approach have achieved real-time efficiency on mobile devices' GPUs and found its usage within augmented reality applications. Evolutionary algorithm Evolutionary algorithms at the training stage try to learn the method of correct determination of landmarks. This phase is an iterative process and, accordingly, is performed in several iterations. As a result of the completion of the last iteration, a system will be obtained that can correctly determine the landmark with a certain accuracy. In the particle swarm optimization method, there are particles that search for landmarks, and each of them uses a certain formula in each iteration to optimize landmark detection.
