w-dependent information. A lightweight, more efficient MLP is then used to produce view-dependent residuals to modify the color and opacity. To enable this compressive baking, small changes to the NeRF architecture were made, such as running the MLP once per pixel rather than for each point along the ray. These improvements make SNeRG extremely efficient, outperforming Plenoctrees. Instant NeRFs In 2022, researchers at Nvidia enabled real-time training of NeRFs through a technique known as Instant Neural Graphics Primitives. An innovative input encoding reduces computation, enabling real-time training of a NeRF, an improvement orders of magnitude above previous methods. The speedup stems from the use of spatial hash functions, which have O ( 1 ) {\displaystyle O(1)} access times, and parallelized architectures which run fast on modern GPUs. Related techniques Plenoxels Plenoxel (plenoptic volume element) uses a sparse voxel representation instead of a volumetric approach as seen in NeRFs. Plenoxel also completely removes the MLP, instead directly performing gradient descent on the voxel coefficients. Plenoxel can match the fidelity of a conventional NeRF in orders of magnitude less training time. Published in 2022, this method disproved the importance of the MLP, showing that the differentiable rendering pipeline is the critical component. Gaussian splatting Gaussian splatting is a newer method that can outperform NeRF in render time and fidelity. Rather than representing the scene as a volumetric function, it uses a sparse cloud of 3D gaussians. First, a point cloud is generated (through structure from motion) and converted to gaussians of initial covariance, color, and opacity. The gaussians are directly optimized through stochastic gradient descent to match the input image. This saves computation by removing empty space and foregoing the need to query a neural network for each point. Instead, simply "splat" all the gaussians onto the screen and they overlap to produce the desired image. Photogrammetry Traditional photogrammetry is not neural, instead using robust geometric equations to obtain 3D measurements. NeRFs, unlike photogrammetric methods, do not inherently produce dimensionally accurate 3D geometry. While their results are often sufficient for extracting accurate geometry (ex: via cube marching), the process is fuzzy, as with most neural methods. This limits NeRF to cases where the output image is valued, rather than raw scene geometry. However, NeRFs excel in situations with unfavorable lighting. For example, photogrammetric methods completely break down when trying to reconstruct reflective or transparent objects in a scene, while a NeRF is able to infer the geometry. Applications NeRFs have a wide range of applications, and are starting to grow in popularity as they become integrated into user-friendly applications. Content creation NeRFs have huge potential in content creation, where on-demand photorealistic views are extremely valuable. The technology democratizes a space previously only accessible by teams of VFX artists with expensive assets. Neural radiance fields now allow anyone with a camera to create compelling 3D environments. NeRF has been combined with generative AI, allowing users with no modelling experience to instruct changes in photorealistic 3D scenes. NeRFs have potential uses in video production, computer graphics, and product design. Interactive content The photorealism of NeRFs make them appealing for applications where immersion is important, such as virtual reality or videogames. NeRFs can be combined with classical rendering techniques to insert synthetic objects and create believable virtual experiences. Medical imaging NeRFs have been used to reconstruct 3D CT scans from sparse or even single X-ray views. The model demonstrated high fidelity renderings of chest and knee data. If adopted, this method can save patients from excess doses of ionizing radiation, allowing for safer diagnosis
