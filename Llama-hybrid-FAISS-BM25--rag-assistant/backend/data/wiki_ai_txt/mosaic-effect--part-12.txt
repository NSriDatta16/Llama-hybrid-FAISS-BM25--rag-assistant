ed all agencies to assess and mitigate against the effect before releasing potentially sensitive data. Matthew Connelly of Columbia University launched the Declassification Engine, a project of computer scientists, historians, and classification experts working to un-redact the black bars on redacted government documents. Connelly noted that the project's participants remained aware of the national security implications their work might raise, including concerns related to the mosaic effect. Legal challenges Agencies routinely withheld information citing mosaics, with courts seldom scrutinizing or challenging these claims. In CIA v. Sims (1985), the U.S. Supreme Court endorsed the mosaic theory to justify broad judicial deference under FOIA Exemption 3, allowing the CIA to withhold seemingly innocuous details about Project MKUltra on grounds that aggregated disclosures could expose intelligence sources, a rationale that has since granted the agency near-total immunity from FOIA and been broadly applied by lower courts. In Muniz v. Meese (1987), the D.C. District Court became the first to reject a mosaic theory claim, dismissing the DEA's argument that employment records could reveal sensitive operational structures, though the case had no lasting influence on mosaic theory jurisprudence. In Center for National Security Studies v. Department of Justice (2003), the D.C. Circuit upheld the Department's refusal to disclose records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regarding individuals detained after the September 11 attacks. The district court had initially rejected the mosaic theory's relevance under FOIA Exemption 7(A), warning that its broad application risked transforming the exemption into "an exemption dragnet" for routine disclosures. The court accepted the government's argument that releasing the requested information would, when compiled, reveal "a comprehensive diagram of the law enforcement investigation after September 11". The case marked a post-9/11 application of the mosaic theory, with the D.C. Circuit reversing a lower court and permitting the DOJ to withhold all requested information—including detainees' names and legal representation—on the grounds that even minimal disclosures could compromise ongoing investigations through aggregation. According to David E. Pozen, the D.C. Circuit's decision in the case was an extreme application of the mosaic theory, based on limited evidence and marked by judicial deference that allowed the government to withhold all detainee information despite strong public interest. The case has been cited as a turning point in national security law, illustrating how the mosaic effect and mosaic theory shaped judicial deference toward executive secrecy. Following the split in Center for National Security Studies v. Department of Justice, related appellate cases—North Jersey Media Group v. Ashcroft (Third Circuit) and Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft (Sixth Circuit)—also addressed the mosaic theory's use by the government to limit transparency after 9/11. The Third Circuit broadly deferred to government secrecy, effectively relinquishing judicial oversight, while the Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of greater disclosure. The Supreme Court declined to hear North Jersey Media, and Pozen argued this division exemplifies how long-settled mosaic theory doctrine became contested during the Bush Administration's expansion of secrecy powers. The government closed 9/11-related "special interest" deportation hearings to the public and press, citing the mosaic theory to argue that disclosure could help terrorists evade detection by revealing investigative gaps. Faced with mosaic theory claims, the Third Circuit deferred to government secrecy despite acknowledging speculative risks, while the Sixth Circuit rejected broad closures as overbroad and demanded concrete evidence of harm to justify restricting public access, which Pozen said reflected a key judicial split over mosaic theory's scope aft
