s were former or current OpenAI employees. Balaji had said that he would testify against OpenAI. Unlike other OpenAI whistleblowers, Balaji did not reveal any new information about the company. The New York Times article cites Stanford University law professor Mark Lemley, who disagreed that generative AI services violate copyright law, and intellectual property (IP) attorney Bradley Hulbert, who said a new law might be necessary to settle the question of legality. Months after Balaji's death, which attracted significant public attention, Hulbert told Fortune magazine that Balaji's essay "[reads like] the argument of a really smart non-lawyer who read up on the subject but does not have a thorough understanding." Another IP attorney, quoted anonymously by the magazine due to concerns about conspiracy theories surrounding Balaji's death, said Balaji's analysis "misunderstands the law in some fundamental ways." OpenAI argued that its software was "grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation," and was "trained on publicly available data." Death Balaji's parents say they last heard from their son on November 22, 2024. After he stopped responding to text messages, they asked San Francisco police to enter his home to conduct a well-being check. On November 26, 2024, the police found Balaji dead in his apartment from a single gunshot wound to the head. He was 26 years old. The gun that was recovered was registered to Balaji, who purchased it in January 2024. A San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) autopsy report was released on February 14, 2025, stating that Balaji died of a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound on the day that the police found him. The police noted that the only entrance to the apartment was dead-bolted from the inside, and that Balaji had recently researched brain anatomy on his computer. Toxicology results showed he had alcohol, amphetamine and GHB in his system at the time of his death. Due to his purported whistleblower status as a "custodial witnesses" in The New York Times's lawsuit against OpenAI, and his claims that OpenAI violated AI copyright laws and maintained poor AI ethics standards, Balaji's death attracted public and media interest. The news coverage also drew attention to his original essay outlining his legal arguments against OpenAI. Skepticism and calls for further investigation Despite the preliminary statements from San Francisco authorities describing the death as a suicide, the circumstances of the death and an initial lack of detailed information from authorities led to widespread speculation and conspiracy theories suggesting Balaji had been deliberately silenced before he could testify against OpenAI. Prior to the official autopsy report being released in February, doubts were raised by Balaji's parents about the cause of his death. They campaigned publicly to raise awareness of what they claimed was an inaccurate verdict from San Francisco authorities. Among other factors for their claim, they described Balaji's mood as "cheerful" about two weeks prior to his death and the "lack of a suicide note [as well as] blood spatter anomalies" in his apartment. His parents announced in December 2024 that they had hired private investigators and had a second autopsy performed. They said that this showed evidence of homicide, claiming that Balaji was shot "in the back of the head from an angle at which he could not have shot himself", although they did not provide a copy of the autopsy and their lawyer said he "would not characterize it as conclusively proving murder". Claims of foul play gained momentum after Elon Musk (who has publicly feuded with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman) stated that the death "doesn't seem like a suicide" in response to a tweet by Balaji's mother. In January, Tucker Carlson discussed the death with Balaji's mother on his podcast. On the same day, Silicon Valley Congressman Ro Khanna called
