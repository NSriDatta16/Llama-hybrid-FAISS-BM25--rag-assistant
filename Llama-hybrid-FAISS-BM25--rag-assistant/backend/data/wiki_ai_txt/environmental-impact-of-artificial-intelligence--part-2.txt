ecade. Environmental debates have raged in both Virginia and France about whether a "moratorium" should be called for additional data centers. In 2024 at the World Economic Forum, Sam Altman gave a speech in which he said that the AI industry can only grow if there is a major technology breakthrough to increase energy development. In 2024, Google failed to reach key goals from their net zero plan as a result of their work with AI, and had a 48% increase in greenhouse gas emission attributable to their growth in AI. A request made via ChatGPT, an AI-based virtual assistant, uses 10 times as much electricity as a Google Search. Microsoft and Meta had similar increases in their carbon footprint, similarly attributed to AI. Carbon footprints of AI models depends on the energy source used, with data centers using renewable energy lowering their footprint. Many tech companies claim to offset energy usage by buying energy from renewable sources, though some experts argue that utilities simply replace the claimed renewable energy with increased non-renewable sources for their other customers. Analysis of the carbon footprint of AI models remains difficult to determine, as they are aggregated as part of datacenter carbon footprints, and some models may help reduce carbon footprints of other industries, or due to differences in reporting from companies. Some applications of ML, such as for fossil fuel discovery and exploration, may worsen climate change. Use of AI for personalized marketing online may also lead to increased consumption of goods, which could also increase global emissions. Energy use and efficiency AI chips, (i.e. GPUs) use more energy and emit more heat than traditional CPU chips. AI models with inefficiently implemented architectures, or trained on less efficient chips may use more energy. Since the 1940's the energy efficiency of computation has doubled every 1.6 years. In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear Reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation. In 2025, Microsoft unveiled plans to invest $80 billion in the development and expansion of data centers designed to support AI technologies. These facilities, critical to the advancement of AI, depend on vast networks of interconnected chip clusters and significant electrical power to operate efficiently. The International Energy Agency (IEA) released its 2025 Electricity Analysis and Forecast in February 2025, projecting 4% growth in global electricity demand over the next three years due to data center growth, increased industrial production, increased electrification, and increased use of air conditioning. By 2027, the US's energy consumption is expected to grow by an amount equivalent to California's entire annual power usage, largely driven by energy-hungry data centers and manufacturing operations. In 2024, U.S. electricity generation rose by 3%, wit
