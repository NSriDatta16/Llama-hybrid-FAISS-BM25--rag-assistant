s a means to improve the quality of machine translation. A more recent and popular approach for representing sentences is Sentence-BERT, or SentenceTransformers, which modifies pre-trained BERT with the use of siamese and triplet network structures. Software Software for training and using word embeddings includes Tomáš Mikolov's Word2vec, Stanford University's GloVe, GN-GloVe, Flair embeddings, AllenNLP's ELMo, BERT, fastText, Gensim, Indra, and Deeplearning4j. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) are both used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and clusters. Examples of application For instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for text corpora in Sketch Engine that are available online. Ethical implications Word embeddings may contain the biases and stereotypes contained in the trained dataset, as Bolukbasi et al. points out in the 2016 paper "Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings" that a publicly available (and popular) word2vec embedding trained on Google News texts (a commonly used data corpus), which consists of text written by professional journalists, still shows disproportionate word associations reflecting gender and racial biases when extracting word analogies. For example, one of the analogies generated using the aforementioned word embedding is "man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker". Research done by Jieyu Zhou et al. shows that the applications of these trained word embeddings without careful oversight likely perpetuates existing bias in society, which is introduced through unaltered training data. Furthermore, word embeddings can even amplify these biases. See also Embedding (machine learning) Brown clustering Distributional–relational database == References ==
