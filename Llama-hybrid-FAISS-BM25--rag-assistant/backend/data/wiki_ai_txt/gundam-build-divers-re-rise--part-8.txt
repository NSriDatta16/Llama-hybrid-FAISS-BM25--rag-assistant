f GBN and leader of the Force group "Avalon" (アヴァロン, Avaron), where Hiroto was formerly affiliated with before he left the group 2 years ago. It was he who invited Hiroto into Avalon when he met Hiroto by mere chance a few years before he met Riku. For the past two years he kept Hiroto's loss, burden, all data on him and Eve secret. Unwilling to delete their photos and logs, he attempted to bury them. Along with Karuna and Emilia, he was glad to see him again, and return to the fold. He was also happy to see Hiroto being social once more and that he was more stable than he was when he last saw him. In the final episode when he was talking to the game master and Ms. Tori in a real world meeting, more details are revealed from when he was a beta tester while GBN was still being developed. He appears in the BUILD DiVERS' special battle piloting the AGE-TRYMAG Gundam TRY AGE Magnum, which its design is inspired and based on the AGE series units from Mobile Suit Gundam AGE and utilizes the TRY-AGE system on its weaponry including the ability to use cards based on the Gundam AGE mobile suits for enhancements. During the Gunpla Battle Royal, he pilots an unmodified ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom Gundam from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny equipped with the METEOR support system. Karuna (カルナ) Voiced by: Yoshiki Nakajima (Japanese); Sean Chiplock (English) One of the two Sub-Leaders of Avalon, who is a close friend and former senior of Hiroto while he was affiliated with the group 2 years ago, implying that Hiroto was in Avalon for years, along with the time Hiroto spent with Eve. He personally likes acting superior to Hiroto whenever he is trying to help Hiroto train. During the EL-Diver incident, Hiroto knew he would have accepted and understood his situation with losing Eve, however he knows he is terrible at keeping secrets. During the celebratory party at the Build Divers' Nest for the birth of Re:Rising Gundam and Hiroto's first special move, he reminds Hiroto that he is still part of Avalon, even if he is not in the actual force, and to come visit them. He pilots the AGMF-X56S/l Impulse Gundam Lancier, a customised ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam, from the last few episodes of the previous series. Since He and Emilia could always beat Hiroto two on one, and they were both a strong duo at backing up and supporting the champion, this concept inspired their Impulses' gimmicks. Riku Mikami (ミカミ・リク, Mikami Riku) / Riku (リク) Voiced by: Yūsuke Kobayashi (Japanese); Erik Scott Kimerer (English) The protagonist of the previous series and the founder, leader, and ace of the original "Build Divers" on which the name of Hiroto's group have originated from. During Hiroto's time in Avalon, he attempted to shoot him down after a heated battle between him and Kyoya while he allied with Ogre, for personal reasons. He was shocked and apologetic over Hiroto's loss before the battle with the Second Coalition of Volunteers, May having told him, Sarah, and his team about it. Only Sarah went with him when he went to reconcile and resolve things with Hiroto, considering he needed to offer to return her to him. However, Hiroto, remembering he already has May and having no real grudge against him, ended up thanking him and Sarah instead, knowing she has been in good hands all along and assured that Eve's loss was her own choice. The two befriended each other, promising to keep having gunpla battles again, with an eventual rematch. He also takes part in defending GBN against Alus, dealing the killing shot alongside Hiroto. He makes no appearance in Battlelog however it's implied that both teams ended up merging into one force and he gave Hiroto leadership of the overall force, though he remains the leader of his own team. In the special battle against BUILD DiVERS and the final battle with Alus and his fleet he used the GN-0000DVR/SM Gundam 00 Sky Moebius as his main Gunpla which is an upgraded Gundam 00 Sky with newer parts and weapons.
