 Modularity – Different components of AI systems can be improved or replaced independently. Memory – AI systems can have perfect recall and vast knowledge bases. It is also much less constrained than humans when it comes to working memory. Multitasking – AI can perform multiple tasks simultaneously in ways not possible for biological entities. Potential path through transformer models Recent advancements in transformer-based models have led some researchers to speculate that the path to ASI might lie in scaling up and improving these architectures. This view suggests that continued improvements in transformer models or similar architectures could lead directly to ASI. Some experts even argue that current large language models like GPT-4 may already exhibit early signs of AGI or ASI capabilities. This perspective suggests that the transition from current AI to ASI might be more continuous and rapid than previously thought, blurring the lines between narrow AI, AGI, and ASI. However, this view remains controversial. Critics argue that current models, while impressive, still lack crucial aspects of general intelligence such as true understanding, reasoning, and adaptability across diverse domains. The debate over whether the path to ASI will involve a distinct AGI phase or a more direct scaling of current technologies is ongoing, with significant implications for AI development strategies and safety considerations. Challenges and uncertainties Despite these potential advantages, there are significant challenges and uncertainties in achieving ASI: Ethical and safety concerns – The development of ASI raises numerous ethical questions and potential risks that need to be addressed. Computational requirements – The computational resources required for ASI might be far beyond current capabilities. Fundamental limitations – There may be fundamental limitations to intelligence that apply to both artificial and biological systems. Unpredictability – The path to ASI and its consequences are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. As research in AI continues to advance rapidly, the question of the feasibility of ASI remains a topic of intense debate and study in the scientific community. Feasibility of biological superintelligence Carl Sagan suggested that the advent of Caesarean sections and in vitro fertilization may permit humans to evolve larger heads, resulting in improvements via natural selection in the heritable component of human intelligence. By contrast, Gerald Crabtree has argued that decreased selection pressure is resulting in a slow, centuries-long reduction in human intelligence and that this process instead is likely to continue. There is no scientific consensus concerning either possibility and in both cases, the biological change would be slow, especially relative to rates of cultural change. Selective breeding, nootropics, epigenetic modulation, and genetic engineering could improve human intelligence more rapidly. Bostrom writes that if we come to understand the genetic component of intelligence, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis could be used to select for embryos with as much as 4 points of IQ gain (if one embryo is selected out of two), or with larger gains (e.g., up to 24.3 IQ points gained if one embryo is selected out of 1000). If this process is iterated over many generations, the gains could be an order of magnitude improvement. Bostrom suggests that deriving new gametes from embryonic stem cells could be used to iterate the selection process rapidly. A well-organized society of high-intelligence humans of this sort could potentially achieve collective superintelligence. Alternatively, collective intelligence might be constructed by better organizing humans at present levels of individual intelligence. Several writers have suggested that human civilization, or some aspect of it (e.g., the Internet, or the economy), is coming to function like a global brain with capacities far exceeding its component agents.
