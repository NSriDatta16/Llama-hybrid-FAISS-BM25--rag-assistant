d in the New York Times as "a sort of combinatorial Fantasia. 2019–2021: Machine Hallucinations: NYC, Machine Hallucinations: Nature Dreams, Machine Memories: Space, Quantum Memories Anadol began thinking about the work that would become the Machine Hallucinations series while in residence at Google. In 2019, he completed the first work in the series, Machine Hallucinations: NYC, which used 300 million photos of New York City and 113 million additional data points, including subway sounds, radio snippets, and traffic noises, To address privacy concerns, the photos were publicly available through social media, search engines, digital maps, and library sites. Dreams were generated using a StyleGAN algorithm to retrieve and process images. A recurrent neural network absorbed and integrated audio. Machine Hallucinations: NYC inaugurated Artechouse, a 6000-square-foot gallery in New York City in September 2019. In a review of Machine Hallucinations: NYC in Art in America, Sophie Haigney wrote that that the piece mimicked the quality of human memory "almost perfectly." 2020's Quantum Memories was produced for the National Gallery of Victoria's Triennial exhibition. The work utilized Google AI's quantum computing software in combination with a supercomputer and open-source algorithms to 3D map a parallel world. Anadol won the IF Design Award for Quantum Memories in 2022. The data sculpture Machine Hallucinations: Nature Dreams incorporated pigments, shapes, and patterns associated with nature culled from more than 300 million publicly accessible images of flowers, trees, mushrooms, landscapes, and clouds. Then the largest raw dataset of nature gathered for an artwork, Anadol worked with the Google AI Quantum team to merge AI-induced latent space with a quantum hyperspace to produce dreams that correlated technology, humanity, and culture. Nature Dreams was created for the Konig Gallery in Berlin and first exhibited in 2021; an excerpt from the work later served as the backdrop for the Grammy Awards. Machine Memoir: Space was also first exhibited in 2021; it was the most visited exhibition ever recorded in Istanbul. Anadol became the first artist-in-residence at Casa Batlló in Barcelona in 2021. During his residency, he created In the Mind of Gaudi, a six-sided cube room It was one of a series of immersive rooms that Anadol created at Casa Batlló, a UNESCO World Heritage site. 2022–2023: Living Architecture: Casa Batlló, Machine Hallucinations: Unsupervised and MoMA A year after his residency, in May 2022, Anadol used the facade of Casa Batlló as a canvas for the 360-degree piece, Living Architecture: Casa Batlló. Trained on real-time climate data collected by sensors placed around the building and a dataset of approximately one billion images consisting of Gaudí's sketches, visual archives of the building's history, academic archives, and publicly available photos, the piece drew an audience of 65,000 people. Machine Hallucinations: Unsupervised was among the first AI-generated artworks to be exhibited at MoMA. The exhibition opened in November 2022. "Pondering what a machine might dream about after seeing more than 200 years of art in MoMA’s collection," the exhibition opened in November 2022; it was extended four times and ultimately ran for almost a year. A 24' x 24' data sculpture, Unsupervised was acquired by MoMA in October 2023, becoming the first generative artwork in the museum's permanent collection. Unsupervised utilized 138,151 freely available records MoMA uploaded to GitHub in 2016. The records, which represented all of the work in the museum's permanent collection, contained basic metadata: title, maker, medium, dimensions, date made, and date acquired. It also included categorization, which required a human perspective. Anadol was interested in what would happen without categorization, stating that without categories, Unsupervised could find a new form. A custom machine learning algorithm, created a map of MoMA's coll
