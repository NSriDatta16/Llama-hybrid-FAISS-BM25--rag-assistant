nted in a mycelium network, and an interface is realized via fruit bodies. Connecting cerebral organoids (including computer-like wetware) with other nerve tissues may become feasible in the future, as is the connection of physical artificial neurons (not necessarily organic) and the control of muscle tissue. External modules of biological tissue could trigger parallel trains of stimulation back into the brain. All-organic devices could be advantageous because it could be biocompatible which may allow it to be implanted into the human body. This may enable treatments of certain diseases and injuries to the nervous system. Prototypes In late 2021, scientists, including two from Cortical Labs, demonstrated that grown brain cells integrated into digital systems can carry out goal-directed tasks with performance-scores. In particular, the human brain cells learned to play a simulated (via electrophysiological stimulation) Pong which they learned faster than known machine intelligence systems, albeit to a lower skill-level than both AI and humans each. Moreover, the study suggests it provides "first empirical evidence" of differences in an information-processing capacity between neurons from different species as the human brain cells performed better than mouse cells. Also in December 2021, researchers from Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research reported the development of organic low-power neuromorphic electronics which they built into a robot, enabling it to learn sensorimotorically within the real world, rather than via simulations. For the chip, polymers were used and coated with an ion-rich gel to enable the material to carry an electric charge like real neurons. In 2022, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, demonstrated an artificial spiking neuron based on polymers that operates in the biological wetware, enabling synergetic operation between the artificial and biological components. Companies active in wetware computing Three companies are focusing on wetware computing using living neurons: FinalSpark, Switzerland, founded in 2014 Koniku, USA, founded in 2015 Cortical Labs, Australia, founded in 2020 Convergence of AI and wetware One technology developing today is the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with wetware. Modern research shows that hybrid systems combining living neural networks with AI can enable self-repair, real-time adaptation, and emotional intelligence. These systems are more flexible than conventional AI and can integrate learning and memory in real time. Such integration lays the foundation for AI that mirrors human cognition and behavior, potentially creating intelligent systems grounded in neuroscience. Neural networks embodied in AI systems could facilitate continuous learning, emotional processing, and fault tolerance more than existing silicon-based implementations. Additionally, AI systems based on neuroethical principles could uphold transparency, fairness, and autonomy. While early research is ongoing, the integration of wetware and artificial intelligence seeks to redefine both fields with the possibility of creating more human-like, moral, and resilient intelligent systems.
