s Rigid (EulerTransform) expands the translation adding rotations and the object is seen as a rigid body Similarity (SimilarityTransform) expands the rigid transformation by introducing isotropic scaling Affine (AffineTransform) expands the rigid transformation allowing both scaling and shear B-splines (BSplineTransform) is a deformable transformation usually preceded by a rigid or affine one Thin-plate splines (SplineKernelTransform) is a deformable transformation belonging to the class of kernel-based transformations that is a composition of and affine and a non-rigid part Metric The similarity metric is the mathematical function whose parameters should be optimized to reach the desired registration, and, during the process, it is computed multiple times. Below are reported the available metrics computed employing the reference and the transformed images and the corresponding elastix class names between brackets. Mean squared difference (AdvancedMeanSquares) to be used for mono-modal applications Normalized correlation coefficient (AdvancedNormalizedCorrelation) to be used for images that have an intensity linear relationship Mutual information (AdvancedMattesMutualInformation) to be used for both mono- and multi-modal applications and optimized to reach better performance compared to the normalized version Normalized mutual information (NormalizedMutualInformation) for both mono- and multi-modal applications Kappa statistic (AdvancedKappaStatistic) to be used only for binary images Sampler For the computation of the similarity metrics, it is not always necessary to consider all the voxels and, sometimes, it can be useful to use only a fraction of the voxels of the images, i.e. to reduce the execution time for big input images. Below are reported the available criteria for selecting a fraction of the voxels for the similarity metric computation and the corresponding elastix class names between brackets. Full (Full) to employ all the voxels Grid (Grid) to employ a regular grid defined by the user to downsample the image Random (Random) to randomly select a percentage of voxels defined by the users (all voxels have equal probability to be selected) Random coordinate (RandomCoordinate) like the random criterion, but in this case also off-grid positions can be selected to simplify the optimization process Interpolator After the application of the transformation, it may occur that the voxels used for the similarity metric computation are at non-voxel positions, so intensity interpolation should be performed to ensure the correctness of the computed values. Below are reported the implemented interpolators and the corresponding elastix class names between brackets. Nearest neighbor (NearestNeighborInterpolator) exploits little resources, but gives low quality results Linear (LinearInterpolator) is sufficient in general applications N-th order B-spline (BSplineInterpolator) can be used to increase the order N, increasing quality and computation time. N=0 and N=1 indicate the nearest neighbor and linear cases respectively. Optimizer The optimizer defines the strategy employed for searching the best transformation parameter to reach the correct registration, and it is commonly an iterative strategy. Below are reported some of the implemented optimization strategies. Gradient descent Robbins-Monro, similar to the gradient descent, but employing an approximation of the cost function derivatives A wider range of optimizers is also available, such as Quasi-Newton or evolutionary strategies. Other features The elastix software also offers other features that can be employed to speed up the registration procedure and to provide more advanced algorithms to the end-users. Some examples are the introduction of blur and Gaussian pyramid to reduce data complexity, and multi-image and multi-metric framework to deal with more complex applications. Applications Elastix has applications mainly in the medical field, where image registration is fundam
