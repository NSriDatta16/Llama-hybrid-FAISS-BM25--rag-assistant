g such content to provide context. The Cyberspace Administration of China issued rules obligating service providers to labeling this content online. The popularity of ChatGPT caused the emergence of tools that detect whether content was AI-generated, such as GPTZero, but the risk of false accusations (false positives) has remained a concern. Digital watermarking allows to reach high detection accuracy by subtly altering the generated content in a way that can be detected by software, but without being noticeable by users. OpenAI developed in 2023 a digital watermarking tool that allowed to detect content generated by ChatGPT with an estimated accuracy of 99.9%, when given enough text. But OpenAI chose not to release it, worrying that users would switch to competitor products, and arguing that digital watermarking can be circumvented by bad actors, for example with superficial rephrasing. Google's digital watermarking tool called SynthID was integrated in 2025 into products like Gemini, Imagen and Veo. Google also created the portal SynthID detector for users to check whether text, images or videos were produced with Google's generative AI products.

No chatbox could ever have said that April is the cruelest month or that fog comes on little cat feet (though they might now, because one of their chief skills is plagiarism). And when synthetically extruded text turns out wrong, it can be comically wrong. When a movie fan asked Google whether a certain actor was in Heat, he received this 'AI Overview': 'No, Angelina Jolie is not in heat.'" (p. 44.)
