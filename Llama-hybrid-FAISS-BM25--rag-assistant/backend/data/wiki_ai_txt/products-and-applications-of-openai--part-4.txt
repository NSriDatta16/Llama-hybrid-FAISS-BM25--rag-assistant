eved a 74.9% on SWE-bench Verified and 88% on Aider polyglot. Reporters described the GPT-5 launch as a major milestone moving toward AGI, praising its intelligence, accessibility, and affordability. But some early feedback called it “evolutionary rather than revolutionary”, noting mixed results in creative writing and pointing to competition from models like Grok 4 Heavy. o1 On September 12, 2024, OpenAI released the o1-preview and o1-mini models, which have been designed to take more time to think about their responses, leading to higher accuracy. These models are particularly effective in science, coding, and reasoning tasks, and were made available to ChatGPT Plus and Team members. In December 2024, o1-preview was replaced by o1. In March 2025, the o1-Pro model was made available through OpenAI's developer API, which was previously available to ChatGPT Pro users since December 2024. The pricing is $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens. o3 On December 20, 2024, OpenAI unveiled o3, the successor of the o1 reasoning model. OpenAI also unveiled o3-mini, a lighter and faster version of OpenAI o3. As of December 21, 2024, this model is not available for public use. According to OpenAI, they are testing o3 and o3-mini. Until January 10, 2025, safety and security researchers had the opportunity to apply for early access to these models. The model is called o3 rather than o2 to avoid confusion with telecommunications services provider O2. In April 2025, OpenAI released o3 to all the paid users. o3 has enhance reasoning and problem-solving capabilities than o1. Deep research Deep research is an AI agent developed by OpenAI, unveiled on February 2, 2025. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's o3 model to perform extensive web browsing, data analysis, and synthesis, delivering comprehensive reports within a timeframe of 5 to 30 minutes. With browsing and Python tools enabled, it reached an accuracy of 26.6 percent on HLE (Humanity's Last Exam) benchmark. In April 2025, OpenAI started rolling out a lightweight version of Deep Research to all its ChatGPT free users. GPT-OSS GPT-OSS (stylized as gpt-oss) is a set of open-weight reasoning models released by OpenAI on August 5, 2025. Currently, they come in two variants—a larger 117-billion-parameter model called gpt-oss-120b and a smaller 21-billion-parameter model called gpt-oss-20b. Both models are released under an Apache 2.0 licence, allowing commercial and non-commercial use. In terms of performance, they are comparable to o4-mini and o3-mini respectively, according to OpenAI. Image classification CLIP Revealed in 2021, CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a model that is trained to analyze the semantic similarity between text and images. It can notably be used for image classification. Text-to-image DALL-E Revealed in 2021, DALL-E is a Transformer model that creates images from textual descriptions. DALL-E uses a 12-billion-parameter version of GPT-3 to interpret natural language inputs (such as "a green leather purse shaped like a pentagon" or "an isometric view of a sad capybara") and generate corresponding images. It can create images of realistic objects ("a stained-glass window with an image of a blue strawberry") as well as objects that do not exist in reality ("a cube with the texture of a porcupine"). As of March 2021, no API or code is available. DALL-E 2 In April 2022, OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, an updated version of the model with more realistic results. In December 2022, OpenAI published on GitHub software for Point-E, a new rudimentary system for converting a text description into a 3-dimensional model. DALL-E 3 In September 2023, OpenAI announced DALL-E 3, a more powerful model better able to generate images from complex descriptions without manual prompt engineering and render complex details like hands and text. It was released to the public as a ChatGPT Plus feature in October. Text-to-video Sora Sora is a text-to-video mod
