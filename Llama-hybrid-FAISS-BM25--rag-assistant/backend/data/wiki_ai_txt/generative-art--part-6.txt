n generative art? For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art? What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? How could generative art give rise to artifacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable? What characterizes good generative art? How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art? What can we learn about art from generative art? For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market? What future developments would force us to rethink our answers? Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?
