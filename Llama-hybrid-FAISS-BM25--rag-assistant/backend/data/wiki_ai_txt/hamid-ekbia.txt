Hamid Reza Ekbia is an Iranian-American scholar, theorist, and writer. His academic writing is on AI, the political economy of computing, artificial intelligence, the future of work, and global development. Ekbia’s non-academic prose reflects on themes of solitude, war, reform, and revolution. His narratives weave together geopolitical histories with firsthand accounts of his lived experience as an activist in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution and the rise of the Iranian Islamic regime. Career Ekbia is currently a university professor at Syracuse University and director of the Autonomous Systems Policy Institute at Syracuse University Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. He is the founding director of the Academic Alliance for AI Policy – a group of scholars and journalists who provide nonpartisan, interdisciplinary research, insights, and strategic analysis to inform and advise policymakers, media, and the public on issues of artificial intelligence governance. In his director roles, he advocates for responsible AI regulatory policy. Before joining Syracuse in 2022, Ekbia was a professor of informatics, cognitive science, and international studies with the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington. He was also the founding director of the Center for Research on Mediated Interaction. Before that, Ekbia spent a year as a visiting lecturer at the Indiana University Bloomington School of Informatics and then an assistant professor at the University of Redlands.{ Biography Ekbia was born in Mashhad, the capital city of Khorasan.{ Ekbia’s teenage years coincided with a period of major transformations in Iranian ways of life. The outlooks and attitudes young people like himself held also shifted dramatically, in no small part due to the introduction of an American educational model to Iranian society in the 1960’s and 70’s. In 1969, Ekbia transferred from Ibn Yamin, a high school built on the 19th century French education model, to the newly opened Alam High School at IMDb where he attended until graduating in 1973. Formerly an elite sports club, the school was established in 1969 by order of the former Prime Minister and then Minister of the Court of the Shah, Asadollah Alam. It followed the liberal American model and was run by U.S. Peace Corps volunteers. In 1977, he received a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from the Abadan Institute of Technology in Iran. Ekbia then studied electrical engineering under Dr. Neville Luhmann, Jr. at the University of California, Los Angeles. Upon finishing his master's thesis in 1979, Ekbia abandoned his plans to pursue doctoral studies in plasma physics and traveled back to Iran in the aftermath of the Iranian regime change. On February 14, 1984, Ekbia was arrested by Iranian authorities and taken to a prison where he spent the next 30 months. Upon arrest he was placed in solitary confinement, where he stayed for the first 352 days of this period. No reason for the arrest was ever provided by authorities, but it is presumed to be related to his political activism against the Iranian Islamic regime. Prior to its use as a detention center, the building where Ekbia was detained housed Alam High School, the school he attended in his teenage years. The high school had been recently converted into a prison after the Islamic Revolution. Years later, he returned to the U.S. to pursue a dual Ph.D in computer science and cognitive science at Indiana University Bloomington, studying under Douglas Hofstadter and working closely with philosopher Brian Cantwell Smith and social informaticist Rob Kling. At Indiana University Bloomington, Ekbia became a Fargonaut at the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition. Ekbia spent a year as a visiting lecturer at the Indiana University Bloomington School of Informatics before teaching at the University of Redlands. He then returned to Indiana, becoming a professor of informatics, cogni
