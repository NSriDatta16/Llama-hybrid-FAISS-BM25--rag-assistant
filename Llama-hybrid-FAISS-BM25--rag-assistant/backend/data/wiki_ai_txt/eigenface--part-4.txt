le W=[w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{k},...,w_{n}]} Compare W with weight vectors W m {\displaystyle W_{m}} of images in the database. Find the Euclidean distance. d = ‖ W − W m ‖ 2 {\displaystyle d=\|W-W_{m}\|^{2}} If d < ϵ 1 {\displaystyle d<\epsilon _{1}} , then the mth entry in the database is a candidate of recognition. If ϵ 1 < d < ϵ 2 {\displaystyle \epsilon _{1}<d<\epsilon _{2}} , then U may be an unknown face and can be added to the database. If d > ϵ 2 , U {\displaystyle d>\epsilon _{2},U} is not a face image. The weights of each gallery image only convey information describing that image, not that subject. An image of one subject under frontal lighting may have very different weights to those of the same subject under strong left lighting. This limits the application of such a system. Experiments in the original Eigenface paper presented the following results: an average of 96% with light variation, 85% with orientation variation, and 64% with size variation. Various extensions have been made to the eigenface method. The eigenfeatures method combines facial metrics (measuring distance between facial features) with the eigenface representation. Fisherface uses linear discriminant analysis and is less sensitive to variation in lighting and pose of the face. Fisherface uses labelled data to retain more of the class-specific information during the dimension reduction stage. A further alternative to eigenfaces and Fisherfaces is the active appearance model. This approach uses an active shape model to describe the outline of a face. By collecting many face outlines, principal component analysis can be used to form a basis set of models that encapsulate the variation of different faces. Many modern approaches still use principal component analysis as a means of dimension reduction or to form basis images for different modes of variation. Review Eigenface provides an easy and cheap way to realize face recognition in that: Its training process is completely automatic and easy to code. Eigenface adequately reduces statistical complexity in face image representation. Once eigenfaces of a database are calculated, face recognition can be achieved in real time. Eigenface can handle large databases. However, the deficiencies of the eigenface method are also obvious: It is very sensitive to lighting, scale and translation, and requires a highly controlled environment. Eigenface has difficulty capturing expression changes. The most significant eigenfaces are mainly about illumination encoding and do not provide useful information regarding the actual face. To cope with illumination distraction in practice, the eigenface method usually discards the first three eigenfaces from the dataset. Since illumination is usually the cause behind the largest variations in face images, the first three eigenfaces will mainly capture the information of 3-dimensional lighting changes, which has little contribution to face recognition. By discarding those three eigenfaces, there will be a decent amount of boost in accuracy of face recognition, but other methods such as fisherface and linear space still have the advantage.
