Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a crucial role in driving the application and research in many fields. In pharmacy, AI helps discover, develop and deliver medications. It can enhance patient care through personalized treatment plans. It can also assist with drug safety and dosage recommendations. Applications Drug discovery and development The traditional methods for producing drugs are very complex. It costs around $2.6 billion for a pharmaceutical company to make a drug and it can take as long as 12-14 years. AI algorithms analyze vast datasets with greater speed and accuracy than traditional methods. This has enabled the identification of potential drug candidates, prediction of their interactions, and optimization of formulations. AI-driven analysis and modeling assist researchers in understanding molecular interactions, thus expediting the drug development timeline. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been particularly useful for drug discovery. These models were used for tasks like virtual screening, structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling, and de novo molecule generation. For example, peptides designed using AI were far more effective against a large number of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Also, transcriptomic data from human cell lines was used to train deep learning models that were used to classify drugs based on therapeutic properties. These innovations help reduce the time, cost and effort involved in early-stage drug development using traditional methods. Drug delivery systems AI is revolutionizing drug delivery systems. AI techniques like neural networks, principal component analysis, and neuro-fuzzy logic are being used in identifying biological targets for pharmaceuticals, evaluating the pharmacological profiles of potential drugs, and analyzing genetic information. Intelligent systems can monitor patient response and adjust doses in real time based on individual physiology, with potential applications in the management of chronic diseases. In the future, this could lead to drugs personalized to an individual, targeted cancer treatments, and edible vaccines. Drug safety AI is helping in drug safety by predicting and detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Different techniques like knowledge graphs, logistic regression classifier, and neural networks are used. In a 2023 study, a machine learning (ML) algorithm was developed using the knowledge graph to classify the known causes of adverse reactions. Two studies showed that natural language processing and deep learning models like long short-term memory (LSTM) are better than the traditional methods for detecting opioid misuse and preventing overdoses. To accomplish this, the models analyze both structured data from electronic health records (EHRs) and unstructured sources such as clinical notes or social media. Clinical decision support and personalized medicine AI tools are increasingly used in clinical decision-making. Machine learning systems can be trained on patient datasets to predict individual risk profiles, including possible allergies and drug-drug interactions that can be harmful for the patient. This can save a significant amount of time for doctors, and reduce the probability of error. It helps provide a personalized treatment plan for a person. Pharmacy operations and automation Automating pharmacy operations using AI can improve speed, accuracy, and safety. The adoption of robotic technology at the University of San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center allowed them to make 350,000 medication doses with 100% accuracy. Robots like TUG help in preparing and transporting the medications and lab samples. AI is also used in inventory management, it can predict the demand for a particular medicine based on certain circumstances, and make sure there is no shortage. Medication adherence Monitoring that the correct medication is taken by the patient is a big problem in healthcare. AI can check this wi
