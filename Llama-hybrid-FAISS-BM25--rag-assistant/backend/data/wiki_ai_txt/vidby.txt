This was the world's first video calling app with translation. The technology was pronounced a competitor of Skype and Viber by Forbes and claimed first prize at the "Innovative Breakthrough 2013" Competition. In 2021, with a new business-oriented focus, DROTR became vidby, with the former Google technology partners Konovalov and Rubinberg remaining at the helm, each with the title Co-CEO.

Additionally, the technology is capable of removing the original language while maintaining ambient sounds. Currently, some 70 languages plus 60 dialects are possible with the algorithm-based technology.
