d, but widely accepted requirements are provided by the Open Source Initiative. Some open foundation models are: PaLM 2, Llama 2, Granite, and Mistral. While open foundation models can further research and development more easily, they are also more susceptible to misuse. Open foundation models can be downloaded by anyone, and particularly powerful models can be fine-tuned to intentionally or unintentionally cause harm. During a closed release, the foundation model cannot be accessed by the public, but is used internally by an organization. Such releases are considered safer, but offer no additional value to the research community or the public at large. Some foundation models like Google DeepMind's Flamingo are fully closed, meaning they are available only to the model developer; others, such as OpenAI's GPT-4, are limited access, available to the public but only as a black box; and still others, such as Meta's Llama 2 are open, with broadly available model weights enabling downstream modification and scrutiny. == References ==
