't understand, comparing such faith to a tourist who can find his way to a hotel room exclusively by turning left or right on a coin toss. Crucially, the tourist has no basis of understanding how or why he arrived at his destination, and a successful arrival does not mean the process is accurate or reliable. An early example of algorithmic bias resulted in as many as 60 women and ethnic minorities denied entry to St. George's Hospital Medical School per year from 1982 to 1986, based on implementation of a new computer-guidance assessment system that denied entry to women and men with "foreign-sounding names" based on historical trends in admissions. While many schools at the time employed similar biases in their selection process, St. George was most notable for automating said bias through the use of an algorithm, thus gaining the attention of people on a much wider scale. In recent years, as algorithms increasingly rely on machine learning methods applied to real-world data, algorithmic bias has become more prevalent due to inherent biases within the data itself. For instance, facial recognition systems have been shown to misidentify individuals from marginalized groups at significantly higher rates than white individuals, highlighting how biases in training datasets manifest in deployed systems. A 2018 study by Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru found that commercial facial recognition technologies exhibited error rates of up to 35% when identifying darker-skinned women, compared to less than 1% for lighter-skinned men. Algorithmic biases are not only technical failures but often reflect systemic inequities embedded in historical and societal data. Researchers and critics, such as Cathy O'Neil in her book Weapons of Math Destruction (2016), emphasize that these biases can amplify existing social inequalities under the guise of objectivity. O'Neil argues that opaque, automated decision-making processes in areas such as credit scoring, predictive policing, and education can reinforce discriminatory practices while appearing neutral or scientific. Contemporary critiques and responses Though well-designed algorithms frequently determine outcomes that are equally (or more) equitable than the decisions of human beings, cases of bias still occur, and are difficult to predict and analyze. The complexity of analyzing algorithmic bias has grown alongside the complexity of programs and their design. Decisions made by one designer, or team of designers, may be obscured among the many pieces of code created for a single program; over time these decisions and their collective impact on the program's output may be forgotten. In theory, these biases may create new patterns of behavior, or "scripts", in relationship to specific technologies as the code interacts with other elements of society. Biases may also impact how society shapes itself around the data points that algorithms require. For example, if data shows a high number of arrests in a particular area, an algorithm may assign more police patrols to that area, which could lead to more arrests. The decisions of algorithmic programs can be seen as more authoritative than the decisions of the human beings they are meant to assist, a process described by author Clay Shirky as "algorithmic authority". Shirky uses the term to describe "the decision to regard as authoritative an unmanaged process of extracting value from diverse, untrustworthy sources", such as search results. This neutrality can also be misrepresented by the language used by experts and the media when results are presented to the public. For example, a list of news items selected and presented as "trending" or "popular" may be created based on significantly wider criteria than just their popularity. Because of their convenience and authority, algorithms are theorized as a means of delegating responsibility away from humans. This can have the effect of reducing alternative options, compromises, or flexibility. Sociologist Sco
