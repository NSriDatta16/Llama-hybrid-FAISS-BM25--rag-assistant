 classifier and the following notation: S {\textstyle S} refers to the score given by the classifier, which is the probability of a certain subject to be in the positive or the negative class. R {\textstyle R} represents the final classification predicted by the algorithm, and its value is usually derived from S {\textstyle S} , for example will be positive when S {\textstyle S} is above a certain threshold. Y {\textstyle Y} represents the actual outcome, that is, the real classification of the individual and, finally, A {\textstyle A} denotes the sensitive attributes of the subjects. Definitions based on predicted outcome The definitions in this section focus on a predicted outcome R {\textstyle R} for various distributions of subjects. They are the simplest and most intuitive notions of fairness. Demographic parity, also referred to as statistical parity, acceptance rate parity and benchmarking. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal probability of being assigned to the positive predicted class. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P ( R = + | A = a ) = P ( R = + | A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A {\displaystyle P(R=+\ |\ A=a)=P(R=+\ |\ A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A} Conditional statistical parity. Basically consists in the definition above, but restricted only to a subset of the instances. In mathematical notation this would be: P ( R = + | L = l , A = a ) = P ( R = + | L = l , A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A ∀ l ∈ L {\displaystyle P(R=+\ |\ L=l,A=a)=P(R=+\ |\ L=l,A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A\quad \forall l\in L} Definitions based on predicted and actual outcomes These definitions not only considers the predicted outcome R {\textstyle R} but also compare it to the actual outcome Y {\textstyle Y} . Predictive parity, also referred to as outcome test. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal PPV. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P ( Y = + | R = + , A = a ) = P ( Y = + | R = + , A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A {\displaystyle P(Y=+\ |\ R=+,A=a)=P(Y=+\ |\ R=+,A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A} Mathematically, if a classifier has equal PPV for both groups, it will also have equal FDR, satisfying the formula: P ( Y = − | R = + , A = a ) = P ( Y = − | R = + , A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A {\displaystyle P(Y=-\ |\ R=+,A=a)=P(Y=-\ |\ R=+,A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A} False positive error rate balance, also referred to as predictive equality. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal FPR. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P ( R = + | Y = − , A = a ) = P ( R = + | Y = − , A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A {\displaystyle P(R=+\ |\ Y=-,A=a)=P(R=+\ |\ Y=-,A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A} Mathematically, if a classifier has equal FPR for both groups, it will also have equal TNR, satisfying the formula: P ( R = − | Y = − , A = a ) = P ( R = − | Y = − , A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A {\displaystyle P(R=-\ |\ Y=-,A=a)=P(R=-\ |\ Y=-,A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A} False negative error rate balance, also referred to as equal opportunity. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal FNR. This is, if the following formula is satisfied: P ( R = − | Y = + , A = a ) = P ( R = − | Y = + , A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A {\displaystyle P(R=-\ |\ Y=+,A=a)=P(R=-\ |\ Y=+,A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A} Mathematically, if a classifier has equal FNR for both groups, it will also have equal TPR, satisfying the formula: P ( R = + | Y = + , A = a ) = P ( R = + | Y = + , A = b ) ∀ a , b ∈ A {\displaystyle P(R=+\ |\ Y=+,A=a)=P(R=+\ |\ Y=+,A=b)\quad \forall a,b\in A} Equalized odds, also referred to as conditional procedure accuracy equality and disparate mistreatment. A classifier satisfies this definition if the subjects in the protected and unprotected groups have equal TPR and equal FPR, satisfying the formula: P ( R = + | Y = y , A = a ) = P ( R = + | Y = y , A = b ) y ∈ { +
