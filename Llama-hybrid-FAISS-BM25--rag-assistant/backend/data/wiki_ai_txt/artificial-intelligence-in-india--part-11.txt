 International Cooperation Agency. It will enable access to structured datasets and developer tools required to create AI solutions. TGDeX will utilize Open Data Telangana platform. TGDeX's goal of hosting more than 2,000 AI-ready datasets over the next five years will be aided by the Telangana AI Mission (T-AIM), Tâ€“Hub, MATH (AI/ML Centre of Excellence of T-Hub), IIT Hyderabad, and IIIT-Hyderabad. Launched in August 2025, the India-Japan AI Cooperation Initiative aims to advance strategic cooperation in AI through cooperative research, university-company partnerships, LLM development, and cooperation in building a reliable AI ecosystem. Impact Agriculture On December 12, 2023, KissanAI announced the release of Dhenu 1.0, world's first agriculture-specific LLM designed for Indian farmers. It can handle 300,000 instruction sets and understand English, Hindi, and Hinglish queries. The platform provides voice-based, tailored assistance. KissanAI used Sarvam AI's OpenHathi for bilingual support and worked with NimbleBox for APIs. Dhenu 1.0 utilizes OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B. KissanAI is supported by Microsoft for Startups. For climate resilient agriculture practices, KissanAI partnered with the United Nations Development Programme in January 2024 to develop a voice-based vernacular GenAI virtual assistant. The main goals of this project are to overcome language barriers and offer easily comprehensible information so that female farmers can actively engage in and profit from generative AI developments. Dhenu2, an open-source version, was launched in October 2024, providing solutions for agribusinesses, farmers, and policymakers worldwide. It is available in three models: 8B, 3B, and 1B, and is powered by the Llama 3. The platform is based on 1.5 million synthetic and real-world instructions that cover more than 4,000 agricultural topics and categories. Over 100,000 farmers were interviewed to gain insights that provided practical information for better decision-making. Uttar Pradesh Open Network for Agriculture, a digital public infrastructure, powered by Gemini and Beckn protocol, was launched in January 2025 by the Government of Uttar Pradesh in collaboration with Google Cloud Platform. Farmers will get one-stop access to market linkages, loans, mechanization, and advisory services for selling their produce. Voice user interface will be available to farmers in Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, Gujarati, and Punjabi, with other Indian languages to be added in 2025. AgriHub, a center of excellence for sustainable agriculture co-funded by the MeitY and the Government of Madhya Pradesh, was opened by IIT Indore on January 27, 2025. It will use AI, machine learning, and deep learning to revolutionize the agricultural industry. By using big data analytics and genomic research to support data-driven agriculture, it will enable research in precision agriculture, xerophyte, and AI-driven disease diagnostics. Farmers in Fazilka have embraced AI-powered weather sensors created by IIT Ropar. It provides real-time information on atmospheric conditions by utilizing data gathered from satellites, weather balloons and a network of weather stations on the ground. Parameters like temperature, humidity, precipitation, and lux are used with data from the India Meteorological Department to forecast rainfall. AI is being used by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare to assist farmers. An AI-powered chatbot called Kisan e-Mitra was built to help farmers with their questions on Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme in multiple Indian languages. The National Pest Surveillance System uses AI and ML to identify pest infestation, allowing for prompt action for healthier crops and addressing the loss of produce brought on by climate change. AI-based analytics that use field photos to monitor and evaluate crop health utilizing weather, soil moisture, and satellite data for wheat and rice cultivation.
