The Cutter Expansive Classification system is a library classification system devised by Charles Ammi Cutter. The system was the basis for the top categories of the Library of Congress Classification. History Charles Ammi Cutter, inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary Melvil Dewey, and with Dewey's initial encouragement, developed his own classification scheme for the Winchester, Massachusetts town library and then the Boston Athenæum, at which he served as librarian for twenty-four years. He began work on it around the year 1880, publishing an overview of the new system in 1882. The same classification would later be used, but with a different notation, also devised by Cutter, at the Cary Library in Lexington, Massachusetts. Many libraries found this system too detailed and complex for their needs, and Cutter received many requests from librarians at small libraries who wanted the classification adapted for their collections. While numbers and letters are required in large library classifications, small libraries did not need their classification system to be too specific. He devised the Expansive Classification in response, to meet the needs of growing libraries, and to address some of the complaints of his critics. Cutter completed and published an introduction and schedules for the first six classifications of his new system (Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications), but his work on the seventh was interrupted by his death in 1903. The Cutter Expansive Classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications. Library historian Leo E. LaMontagne wrote: Cutter produced the best classification of the nineteenth century. While his system was less "scientific" than that of J. P. Lesley, its other key features – notation, specificity, and versatility – make it deserving of the praise it has received. Its top level divisions served as a basis for the Library of Congress Classification, which also took over some of its features. It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the twentieth century. Structure The Expansive Classification uses seven separate schedules, each designed to be used by libraries of different sizes. After the first, each schedule was an expansion of the previous one, and Cutter provided instructions for how a library might change from one expansion to another as it grows. Summary of schedules First classification The first classification is meant for very small libraries. The first classification has only seven top-level classes, and only eight classes in total: A Works of reference and general works which include several of the following sections, and so could not go in any one. B Philosophy and Religion E Biography F History and Geography and Travels H Social sciences L Natural sciences and Arts Y Language and Literature YF Fiction Further classifications Further expansions add more top-level classes and subdivisions. Many subclasses arranged systematically, with common divisions, such as those by geography and language, following a consistent system throughout. By the fifth classification all the letters of the alphabet are in use for top-level classes. These are: A General Works B Philosophy C Christianity and Judaism D Ecclesiastical History E Biography F History, Universal History G Geography and Travels H Social Sciences I Demotics, Sociology J Civics, Government, Political Science K Legislation L Science and Arts together M Natural History N Botany O Zoology P Anthropology and Ethnology Q Medicine R Useful arts, Technology S Constructive arts (Engineering and Building) T Manufactures and Handicrafts U Art of War V Recreative arts, Sports, Games, Festivals W Art X English Language Y Eng
