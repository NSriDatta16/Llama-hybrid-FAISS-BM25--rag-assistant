ord and Christopher Miller were also still involved as producers. A search for a replacement director began immediately. After the divisive reception to Batman v Superman, Warner Bros. Pictures sought to stabilize the direction of the DCEU. In May 2016, the studio reorganized to have genre-responsible film executives, with the studio's DC Entertainment films placed under a new division, DC Films, to be led by Johns—who had since become DC Comics's chief creative officer—and Warner Bros. EVP Jon Berg. The division was formed to compete more directly with Marvel Studios and its franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but it was not designed to override the "director-driven" mandate for the franchise. Rick Famuyiwa was hired to take over as director in June 2016. Warner Bros. believed Famuyiwa's vision for the film would resonate with younger audiences, and also be compatible with Grahame-Smith's existing script. Filming was expected to begin later in 2016 and was not believed to be delayed by the director change. Famuyiwa's top choice to portray the film's female lead, Iris West, was Kiersey Clemons, who worked with him on Dope (2015). Rita Ora and Lucy Boynton were also in the running for the role, but Clemons was cast as the character at the end of July. At that time, Warner Bros. gave the film's release date to Tomb Raider (2018), leaving The Flash without a release date. In August, Ray Fisher was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as Victor Stone / Cyborg from Batman v Superman and Justice League. Famuyiwa completed a revision of the script a month later, when Gal Gadot was set to reprise her role as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman from Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman (2017), and Justice League, and Billy Crudup was in negotiations to portray Barry's father, Henry Allen. Clemons and Crudup both filmed cameo appearances for Justice League after being cast in The Flash. Pre-production began by October 2016 ahead of a filming start in March 2017, scheduled before another commitment that Ezra Miller had in July. Oliva and Famuyiwa worked together for six-to-seven months up to that point. They planned for the character Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash to serve as a background antagonist before being revealed as the main antagonist of the DCEU in an adaptation of the DC Animated Universe (DCAU) series Justice League Unlimited (2004–2006) and The Flashpoint Paradox, which was intended to reboot the DCEU. At the end of October, Famuyiwa left the project after he could not "come together creatively" with the studio, which disagreed with the more mature direction that he wanted to take the film. After Famuyiwa's exit, the film was put on hold while the studio searched for a new director, Miller prepared to film Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018), and Oliva transitioned to work on reshoots for Wonder Woman. During that time, Warner Bros. decided to take the film in a new direction, and in January 2017, Joby Harold was hired to perform a page-one rewrite of the script. He turned in a draft by May, when the studio's top choices to direct were Robert Zemeckis and Matthew Vaughn. Both had expressed interest in the project, but had potential scheduling issues that could prevent them from taking it on. Raimi, Marc Webb, Jordan Peele, and Ben Affleck—who portrayed Bruce Wayne / Batman in previous DCEU films—had already turned down offers to direct the film. At the July 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, the film was announced with the new title Flashpoint, based on the eponymous 2011 comic book storyline, in which Allen travels back in time to save his mother's life and accidentally creates an alternate timeline. Dan Mazeau returned to contribute to the script during this time. Johns confirmed in November that the Flashpoint concept would allow the film to tell a unique story about Batman, with the comic book storyline exploring a timeline where Thomas Wayne is Batman; Jeffrey Dean Morgan expressed interest in reprising his
