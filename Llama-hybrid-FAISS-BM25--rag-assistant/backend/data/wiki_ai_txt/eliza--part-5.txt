chatbot. This effect is first defined in Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models and the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought as humans' interpretations that some computer programs understand the user inputs and make analogies. These interpretations can potentially manipulate and misinform users. When interacting and communicating with chatbots, users can be overly confident in the reliability of the chatbots' answers. Other than misinforming, the chatbot's human-mimicking nature can also cause severe consequences, especially for younger users who lack a sufficient understanding of the chatbot's mechanism.
