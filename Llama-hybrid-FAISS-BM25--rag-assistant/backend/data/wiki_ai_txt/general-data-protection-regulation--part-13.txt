The U.S. state of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act on 28 June 2018, taking effect on 1 January 2020; it grants rights to transparency and control over the collection of personal information by companies in a similar means to GDPR. Critics have argued that such laws need to be implemented at the federal level to be effective, as a collection of state-level laws would have varying standards that would complicate compliance. Two other U.S. states have since enacted similar legislation: Virginia passed the Consumer Data Privacy Act on 2 March 2021, and Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act on 8 July 2021. The Republic of Turkey, a candidate for European Union membership, has adopted the Law on The Protection of Personal Data on 24 March 2016 in compliance with the EU acquis. China's 2021 Personal Information Protection Law is the country's first comprehensive law on personal data rights and is modeled after the GDPR. Switzerland will also adopt a new data protection law that largely follows EU's GDPR. With the addition of overseas regions of the European Union joining non-governmental organsational (NGO) bodies in the Caribbean region such as the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the GDPR rules have become necessary to consider in the lack of any current legislation found in the region concerning privacy rights and maintaining compliance of the laws of those outer regions. The CLOUD Act, enacted in 2018, is seen by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) as a law in possible conflict with the GDPR.

EU Digital Single Market The EU Digital Single Market strategy relates to "digital economy" activities related to businesses and people in the EU. As part of the strategy, the GDPR and the NIS Directive all apply from 25 May 2018. The proposed ePrivacy Regulation was also planned to be applicable from 25 May 2018, but will be delayed for several months. The eIDAS Regulation is also part of the strategy. In an initial assessment, the European Council has stated that the GDPR should be considered "a prerequisite for the development of future digital policy initiatives".
