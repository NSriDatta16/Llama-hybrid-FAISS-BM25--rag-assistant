Bias ADM may incorporate algorithmic bias arising from: Data sources, where data inputs are biased in their collection or selection Technical design of the algorithm, for example where assumptions have been made about how a person will behave Emergent bias, where the application of ADM in unanticipated circumstances creates a biased outcome Explainability Questions of biased or incorrect data or algorithms and concerns that some ADMs are black box technologies, closed to human scrutiny or interrogation, has led to what is referred to as the issue of explainability, or the right to an explanation of automated decisions and AI. This is also known as Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, in which the results of the solution can be analysed and understood by humans. XAI algorithms are considered to follow three principles - transparency, interpretability and explainability. Information asymmetry Automated decision-making may increase the information asymmetry between individuals whose data feeds into the system and the platforms and decision-making systems capable of inferring information from that data. On the other hand it has been observed that in financial trading the information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent agents may be much less than between two human agents or between human and machine agents. A research validated Daniel Kahneman's theory on noisy decisions by human experts in finance. It demonstrates the inherent inconsistencies in human judgments, which consequently affect the outcomes of automated decisions made by AI decision-support systems. Research fields Many academic disciplines and fields are increasingly turning their attention to the development, application and implications of ADM including business, computer sciences, human computer interaction (HCI), law, public administration, and media and communications. The automation of media content and algorithmically driven news, video and other content via search systems and platforms is a major focus of academic research in media studies. The ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT) was established in 2018 to study transparency and explainability in the context of socio-technical systems, many of which include ADM and AI. Key research centres investigating ADM include: Algorithm Watch, Germany ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society, Australia Citizen Lab, Canada Informatics Europe See also Automated decision support Algorithmic bias Decision-making software Decision Management Ethics of artificial intelligence Government by algorithm Machine learning Recommender systems == References ==
