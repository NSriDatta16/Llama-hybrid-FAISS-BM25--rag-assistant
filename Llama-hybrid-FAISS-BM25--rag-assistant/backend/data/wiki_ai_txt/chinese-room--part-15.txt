m". Steven Pinker suggested that a response to that conclusion would be to make a counter thought experiment to the Chinese Room, where the incredulity goes the other way. He brings as an example the short story They're Made Out of Meat which depicts an alien race composed of some electronic beings, who upon finding Earth express disbelief that the meat brains of humans can experience consciousness and thought. However, Searle himself denied being carbon chauvinist. He said "I have not tried to show that only biological based systems like our brains can think ... I regard this issue as up for grabs". He said that even silicon machines could theoretically have human-like consciousness and thought, if the actual physical–chemical properties of silicon could be used in a way that produces consciousness and thought, but "until we know how the brain does it we are not in a position to try to do it artificially".
