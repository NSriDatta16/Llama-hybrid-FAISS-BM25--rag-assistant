 acquisition of the Torment license, and various inXile staff will transition over to the Numenera team as production on Wasteland 2 winds down. In late January 2013, inXile confirmed the game's title as Torment: Tides of Numenera, and announced that Planescape: Torment composer Mark Morgan would create the soundtrack. The pre-production period was initially expected to continue until October 2013. During this phase, team composition for the project was to be finalised and development would focus on production planning, game design and dialog writing. With the Wasteland 2 project facing delays in 2014, full production of Torment: Tides of Numenera was rescheduled to a later date. A Kickstarter campaign to crowd fund Torment: Tides of Numenera was launched on March 6, 2013 with a US$900,000 goal. Project director Kevin Saunders explained this choice of a funding source by stating that the traditional publisher-based funding model is flawed because it forces the developer into attempting to appeal to an abstract target audience, picked by the publisher. A crowd funding platform, on the other hand, would allow the developers to present their vision directly to potential buyers and determine its viability early on, making it a better choice for a mid-sized or smaller developer studio, like inXile. The campaign had attracted several high-profile backers, such as Markus Persson, creator of Minecraft, and Min-Liang Tan, CEO of Razer USA. The campaign reached its initial funding goal in six hours, and went on to surpass a million dollars mark in seven hours, breaking the then-Kickstarter-record for the fastest project to do so. At the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign, a total of $4,188,927 had been pledged. Two post-Kickstarter stretch goals locations were also reached and added into the game. After its official campaign ended, the game continued to raise funding on its website, with more than $870,000 being raised. Release The planned release date announced during the fund raising campaign was set to December 2014, but was later postponed "a few months" due to the need to implement the numerous achieved stretch goals. During the course of the game's development, its release was delayed to the fourth quarter of 2015, then 2016, and eventually to the first quarter of 2017. The game would ship DRM-free to the Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux platforms and would be available in six languages: English, French, German, Polish, Russian and Spanish. A beta version of the game was released for Kickstarter backers on January 17, 2016, and through Steam Early Access on January 26, 2016. On June 9, 2016, inXile announced that the game's beta is available for all Kickstarter backers. On August 4, 2016, inXile announced that the game would additionally be released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on the same release date as previous platforms. The game was released on February 28, 2017 on the Windows, MacOS, Linux, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 platforms. Reception Torment: Tides of Numenera received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Destructoid's Ray Porreca scored the game a 7.5/10, arguing that "[its] various parts [...] come together in a solid package. Though it isn’t perfect, there’s no doubt that this is an RPG that will appeal to a specific type of person." Porecca criticized the combat, saying "The turn-based system is functional, but even with a host of skills and companions to help pitch in, it still feels clunky". He, however, praised the worldbuilding and character creation and recommended it to "role-players keen on experiencing a game of consequences and twisted fantasy". James Kozanitis's 4.5 out of 5 stars score on Game Revolution stated that "Whereas the fun in a game like For Honor comes from physically learning how to play, the fun in Tides of Numenera comes from achieving encyclopedic knowledge of a whole new universe through truly meaningful choices."
