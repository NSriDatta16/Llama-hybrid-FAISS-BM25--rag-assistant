heir counter plan. March summit and Egyptian proposal On 4 March, at the Extraordinary Arab Summit in Cairo on Developments in the Palestinian Issue, Arab leaders adopted a $53 billion plan proposed by Egypt that did not involve displacing Palestinians from the Strip. The plan was to create an interim committee of "independent, professional Palestinian technocrats" to govern Gaza to prepare for the Palestinian Authority’s return. Hamas said that it would not bring its own candidates to the proposed governing committee but that it would need to give its permission in regards to the committee’s tasks, members and agenda. Mahmoud Abbas said that he would be prepared to hold elections, which Hamas welcomed. The summit released an AI-enhanced presentation showing modern housing developments, as well as blueprints for resorts and attractions. The plan was to seek international funding. The plan outlines a six-month phase of recovery providing temporary housing for 1.5 million displaced Palestinians within seven sites in Gaza, followed by a two-stage reconstruction program: a two-year first stage of $20 billion and a 2.5 year second stage of $30 billion. The New York Times reported the funding for the plan remains unclear as Gulf states will be reluctant to invest in rebuilding Gaza only to see it destroyed again if violence returns. The Israeli foreign ministry said the plan had "outdated" outlooks and rejected the plan's dependence on the Palestinian Authority, adding that Hamas would be given power by the plan. When asked if Trump supported the Arab leaders' plan, a White House spokesman said that the current Arab plan does not address that Gaza is "currently uninhabitable" for Palestinians to live in to due to the amount of debris and unexploded ordnance, adding that "President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region." The US special envoy Steve Witkoff said the plan had "compelling features", was a good first step, and they needed additional discussions. The plan was also endorsed by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and several European countries. On 12 March, Arab foreign ministers confirmed continuous consultations on Egypt's plan with the U.S. special envoy. September 2025 proposal During the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in September 2025, Trump met in New York a group of leaders of several Arab states to discuss the situation of the Gaza Strip. Reportedly, he presented them with a 21-point plan that called for ending the war and ending Hamas rule over the strip while establishing an international Arab military force to control the area for a period of three years. He also assured them that he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. In late September 2025, Israeli and British media reported a proposal by former British prime minister Tony Blair for a Gaza International Transitional Authority to administer the Gaza Strip for a transitional period, before turning over administration to the Palestinian Authority.
