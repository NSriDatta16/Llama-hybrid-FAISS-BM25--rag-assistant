The Void Trilogy is a space opera series by British author Peter F. Hamilton. The series is set in the same universe as The Commonwealth Saga, 1,200 years after the end of Judas Unchained. Peter F. Hamilton sold the American rights to the series to Random House. The series includes the following books: The Dreaming Void (2007) The Temporal Void (2008) The Evolutionary Void (2010) Synopsis The Dreaming Void What was formerly believed to be a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way is revealed to be an artificial construct, known as the Void. Inside, there is a strange universe where the laws of physics are very different from standard physics. It is slowly consuming the other stars of the galactic coreâ€”one day it will have devoured the entire galaxy. In AD 3320, a human member of the Commonwealth, Inigo, begins to have dreams of the wonderful existence inside the Void. His dreams inspire the disaffected, who desire to travel into the Void, where their every wish will be fulfilled. By AD 3456, the pseudo-religious Living Dream movement exceeds 5 billion members, organizing the followers into a powerful political force. Other star-faring species fear their migration will cause the Void to expand again thus devouring the galaxy. They are prepared to stop the pilgrimage fleet no matter what the cost. The Dreaming Void is broken into two distinct sections. The first follows Edeard, a young boy who lives inside the Void on a planet called Querencia, the subject of Inigo's dreams. Edeard, an orphan and apprentice, lives in Ashwell, a town in Rulan province. A gifted psychic, he is trained by Master Akeem in crafting and modding. Initially a loner, he comes to prominence in his village after designing an alternative pump mechanism for the local well. Unfortunately his luck changes for the worse after Ashwell is raided by bandits. Forced to flee, he joins the local caravan and travels to Makkathran, the capital of Querencia. In Makkathran, Edeard joins the constables and after a brutal couple of months in training, he graduates and is promoted to the commander of his Squad. He makes little progress battling the rigid and backward judicial system of Makkathran; his first real break is when his squad overcomes a trap set by the local gang, and Edeard walks on water chasing the leader of the gang. A testament to his growing psychic abilities, Edeard's stunt earns him the title of Waterwalker, and he becomes an instant star in Makkathran. The second section of The Dreaming Void is set back in the Commonwealth. Inigo, the first dreamer, and founder of Living Dream, has disappeared, leaving the 5 billion strong Living Dream movement in a state of flux. When Ethan, succeeding Inigo as the head of the movement, proclaims that the Living Dream will embark on a pilgrimage into the Void, the Commonwealth is thrown into a state of political chaos. Fearing that the human migration might cause the Void to expand (and in the process destroy whole systems or even the whole Galaxy) other spacefaring races such as the Raiel and Ocisen Empire are deeply concerned, with the latter threatening military action. This has left the Commonwealth government deeply divided, with the two largest factions in disagreement, the Accelerators faction/party supporting the pilgrimage and the Conservative faction opposing. As both parties are unable to solve the situation politically they have resolved to take matters into their own hands, with each party sending agents to further its interests. Aaron, a sleeper cell agent, is tasked with finding Inigo. He kidnaps and manipulates Corrie-Lyn, a former lover of Inigo and interrogates her for information. He also travels to Kuhmo (Inigo's homeworld) to get further information and robs Inigo's secure storage (a bank for memory). He eventually tracks Inigo to Hanko, a desolate and barren world. However, before Aaron can extract Inigo, Accelerator agents destroy Aaron's starship leaving him marooned on Hanko. Mean
