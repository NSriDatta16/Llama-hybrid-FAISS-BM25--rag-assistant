TPUs). According to Anthropic, the partnership will bring more than one gigawatt of AI compute capacity online by 2026. Business structure According to Anthropic, its goal is to research AI systems' safety and reliability. The Amodei siblings were among those who left OpenAI due to directional differences. Anthropic incorporated itself as a Delaware public-benefit corporation (PBC), which enables directors to balance stockholders' financial interests with its public benefit purpose. Anthropic's "Long-Term Benefit Trust" is a purpose trust for "the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity". It holds Class T shares in the PBC, which allow it to elect directors to Anthropic's board. As of April 2025, the members of the Trust are Neil Buddy Shah, Kanika Bahl, and Zach Robinson. Investors include Amazon at $8 billion, Google at $2 billion, and Menlo Ventures at $750 million.

The name "Claude" was chosen as a reference to mathematician Claude Shannon, and as a masculine name to contrast with the feminine names of AI assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Cortana. In March 2023, Anthropic released two versions of its model, Claude and Claude Instant, the latter being more lightweight. The next iteration, Claude 2, was launched in July 2023. Unlike Claude, which was only available to select users, Claude 2 is available for public use. Claude 3 was released in March 2024, with three language models: Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku. The Opus model is the largest. According to Anthropic, it outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 and Google's Gemini Ultra in benchmark tests at the time. Sonnet and Haiku are Anthropic's medium- and small-sized models, respectively. All three models accept image input. Amazon has added Claude 3 to its cloud AI service Bedrock. In May 2024, Anthropic announced the Claude Team plan, its first enterprise offering for Claude, and Claude iOS app. In June 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which demonstrated significantly improved performance on benchmarks compared to the larger Claude 3 Opus, notably in coding, multistep workflows, chart interpretation, and text extraction from images. Released alongside 3.5 Sonnet was the new Artifacts capability, in which Claude generates content in a dedicated window and renders interactive elements such as websites or SVGs in real time. In October 2024, Anthropic released an improved version of Claude 3.5, along with a beta feature called "Computer use", which enables Claude to take screenshots, click, and type text. In November 2024, Palantir announced a partnership with Anthropic and Amazon Web Services to give U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access to Claude 3 and 3.5. According to Palantir, this was the first time that Claude would be used in "classified environments". In December 2024, Claude 3.5 Haiku was made available to all users on web and mobile platforms. In February 2025, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was introduced to all paid users. It is a "hybrid reasoning" model (one that responds directly to simple queries, while taking more time for complex problems). In May 2025, Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet were introduced. With these models, Anthropic also introduced Extended thinking with tool use and the ability to use tools in parallel. In August 2025, Claude Opus 4.1 was introduced. U.S. military and intelligence In November 2024, Anthropic partnered with Palantir and Amazon Web Services to provide the Claude model to U.S. intelligence and defen
