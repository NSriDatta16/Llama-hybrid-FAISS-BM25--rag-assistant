x)} is the activation function corresponding to each variable. An ensemble learning model is represented as a linear combination of the predictions from each constituent approach, a ^ m = argmin a m ∑ i = 1 N L ( y i , a 0 + ∑ m = 1 M a m f m ( x i ) ) + λ ∑ m = 1 M | a m | {\displaystyle {\hat {a}}_{m}={\underset {a_{m}}{\operatorname {argmin} }}\sum _{i=1}^{N}L\left(y_{i},a_{0}+\sum _{m=1}^{M}a_{m}f_{m}(x_{i})\right)+\lambda \sum _{m=1}^{M}|a_{m}|} where y i {\displaystyle y_{i}} is the actual value, the second parameter is the value predicted by each constituent method, and λ {\displaystyle \lambda } is a coefficient representing each model's variation for a certain predictor variable. Applications Cognitive development Sensorimotor signals are neural impulses sent to the brain upon physical touch. Using predictive learning to detect sensorimotor signals plays a key role in early cognitive development, as the human brain represents sensorimotor signals in a predictive manner (it attempts to minimize prediction error between incoming sensory signals and top–down prediction). In order to update an unadjusted predictor, it must be trained through sensorimotor experiences because it does not inherently have prediction ability. In a recent research paper, Dr. Yukie Nagai suggested a new architecture in predictive learning to predict sensorimotor signals based on a two-module approach: a sensorimotor system which interacts with the environment and a predictor which simulates the sensorimotor system in the brain. Spatiotemporal memory Computers use predictive learning in spatiotemporal memory to completely create an image given constituent frames. This implementation uses predictive recurrent neural networks, which are neural networks designed to work with sequential data, such as a time series. Using predictive learning in conjunction with computer vision enables computers to create images of their own, which can be helpful when replicating sequential phenomena such as replicating DNA strands, face recognition, or even creating X-ray images. Social media consumer behavior In a recent study, data on consumer behavior was collected from various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest. The usage of predictive learning analytics led researchers to discover various trends in consumer behavior, such as determining how successful a campaign could be, estimating a fair price for a product to attract consumers, assessing how secure data is, and analyzing the specific audience of the consumers they could target for specific products.
