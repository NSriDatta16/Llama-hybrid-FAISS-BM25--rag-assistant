uane never graduated high school and has been in and out of jail for the past seven years since his mother died, so a sentencing circle sends him to Thunderbird Island, a fictional island on Otter Lake in Ontario, Canada that contains dozens of petroglyphs, in order to teach him the ways of their people. Duane's grandfather transports him to the island via boat and leaves him there, returning every Sunday to bring him food and cigarettes. During his three weeks on the island, Duane becomes interested in the petroglyphs and says he feels a humming coming from the rocks. The last Sunday Duane leaves the island with his grandfather but has with him an authentic looking Anishinaabe tomahawk he says he found on the island. His grandfather presses him on where specifically he found it but Duane says he doesn't know “yet.” A few days later his grandfather visits Duane at home where he lives with his Aunt Maggie, Duane's father's sister. Duane has been doing online research and tells his grandfather that Stonehenge, the Nazca Lines, the Cochno Stone, Machu Picchu, and Judaculla Rock all form a sacred geometric pattern across the globe. His grandfather warns him about conspiracy theories but Duane says there's a pattern to these sites and the petroglyphs on Thunderbird Island are part of it. The next morning, his grandfather goes to the petroglyphs on Thunderbird Island to see what Duane's talking about and there he finds Aunt Maggie's boat and two new rock carvings but no Duane, so he returns home. That evening, Duane arrives at his grandfather's home but looks like he's been lost in the wilderness for a week. His grandfather plans to scold him for his vandalism of a sacred site but Duane shows him a flintlock pistol he claims he stole from a coureur des bois. Duane says he's cracked the code of the petroglyphs and is able to travel through time by carving new petroglyphs into the rock. His grandfather is skeptical, so a week later Duane's grandfather travels to Thunderbird Island to investigate the petroglyphs where he finds Duane lying on the ground, dying of smallpox. His grandfather says to the funeral crowd he doesn't know if Duane was telling the truth but he knows that Duane is the first North American to die of the diseases since the 1930s so it is possible he really did travel through time. "Stars" "Stars" depicts the stories of three different characters, each at different points in time. Though different, each boy is fascinated by and identifies with the stars and uses them as an escape from their father issues. The first part introduces the reader to Nimki, a fourteen-year-old Indigenous boy from an unknown tribe on Turtle Island well before European colonization. He is one of the best trackers in his village, even better than his father, which causes friction within the family, though his poor eyesight keeps him from being a successful hunter. Though Nimki contemplates his tribe's way of life, he cannot keep his mind away from the stars above him. Unaware of what they are, he believes that if he wishes or thinks hard enough, he hopes he may float up and disappear among them. He wonders if those among their own campfires might be looking down on his own. The second part of the story describes a scene in which Walter, a Native boy living on a reservation, is leaving his house after yet another scolding from his alcoholic father. Walter is studying astronomy in his science class, which he enjoys, as it provides a distraction from his home life. His last class discussed Kepler-186f, a possible habitable planet about 490 light-years away from Earth in the Cygnus constellation. Walter wonders if there are other boys like him out in space. The last part of the story is set on Kepler-186f, where the reader becomes acquainted with Eric. Unable to sleep, he decides to walk the compounds of Plymroc, their twenty-two-year-old settlement, named for its symbolism of Earth's Plymouth Rock. His father never notices Eric's absences as he
