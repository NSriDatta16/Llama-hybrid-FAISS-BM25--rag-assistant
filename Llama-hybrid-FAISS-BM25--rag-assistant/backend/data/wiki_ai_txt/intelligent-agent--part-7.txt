 defined by Business Insider as "filters, rules, and tools that can be used to identify and remove inaccurate content" have been suggested to help reduce errors. To address security vulnerabilities related to data access, language models could be redesigned to separate instructions and data, or agentic applications could be required to include guardrails. These ideas were proposed in response to a zero-click exploit that affected Microsoft 365 Copilot. Applications The concept of agent-based modeling for self-driving cars was discussed as early as 2003. Hallerbach et al. explored the use of agent-based approaches for developing and validating automated driving systems. Their method involved a digital twin of the vehicle under test and microscopic traffic simulations using independent agents. Waymo developed a multi-agent simulation environment called Carcraft, to test algorithms for self-driving cars. This system simulates interactions between human drivers, pedestrians, and automated vehicles. Artificial agents replicate human behavior using real-world data. Salesforce's Agentforce is an agentic AI platform that allows for the building of autonomous agents to perform tasks. The Transport Security Administration is integrating agentic AI into new technologies, including machines to authenticate passenger identities using biometrics and photos, and also for incident response.
