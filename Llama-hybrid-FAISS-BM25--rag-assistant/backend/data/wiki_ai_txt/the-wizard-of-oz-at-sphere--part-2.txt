or the tornado scene and a recreation of the Wizard's ghostly green head during his throne room scenes. Live multi-sensory effects such as flashing lights, haptics, wind, fog and scents will be employed during screenings of the film. Jennifer Lame served as editor, along with Ben Grossmann as visual effects specialist, Paul Freeman as principal audio artist and Zack Winokur as creative director. The film's soundtrack was also remastered to fit the Sphere's immersive sound system, in addition to having the entire score re-recorded with an 80-piece orchestra under the direction of David Newman, on the same scoring stage where it was originally recorded. The changes made to select sequences resulted in the film's runtime also being shortened to 75 minutes from the original 101 minutes. Sphere Entertainment Executive Chairman and CEO James L. Dolan commented, "The original kind of dwelled on a few things that were somewhat superfluous." He added, "Everything you love about the movie, I guarantee, is in the movie." Among the cut material was the musical number "If I Were King of the Forest," sung by the Cowardly Lion as he, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Dorothy and Toto wait to see the Wizard outside his palace in the original film. Dolan and Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO David Zaslav make "two-second cameos" in the immersive film, their faces superimposed on two sailors in a rowboat during the tornado sequence. Release and marketing Tickets went on sale on June 10, 2025, coinciding with Judy Garland's 103rd birthday. As part of the experience, a 50-foot-long and 22-foot-tall replica of the legs of the Wicked Witch of the East wearing the ruby slippers was installed onto the exterior of the Sphere, suggesting that the "venue has landed on top of her." As part of the promotional campaign, a viral marketing stunt involving the phrase "Surrender Dorothy" being skywritten above Long Beach, California and Robert Moses State Park in Fire Island, New York took place over the Fourth of July weekend, with the help of the Farmingdale-based Skytypers Air Show Team. The Venetian Las Vegas, which adjoins Sphere, also promoted the film with a display in the resort's Waterfall Atrium that was filled with 5,000 vibrant silk poppies. The cafeteria behind it showcased themed d√©cor and displays previewing the film's merchandise. By August 12, 2025, Sphere reported that over 120,000 tickets were sold for screenings of the film. The world premiere screening was attended by multiple entertainment personalities, including Lorna Luft (daughter of Judy Garland), Skylar Astin, Rosanna Arquette, Kris Jenner, T Bone Burnett, Edie Falco, Joe Manganiello, Zahn McClarnon, Oz historian Ryan Jay and Wicked stars Jessica Vosk and Marissa Bode. Dolan introduced the film in-person before it began, with himself, Rosenthal, Sphere Entertainment COO Jennifer Koester and their fellow execs dressed up as each of the film's characters. Reception and impact Pre-release On May 28, 2025, Rosenthal believed that if The Wizard of Oz proves to be a success at Sphere, that it could lead to more immersive versions of other films being screened at the venue, saying: "It's a template for our industry ... a way for us to go back and look at films through the eyes of the director and the time in which they were made. We hope to do other films, but we don't know what those are." On July 27, 2025, Lorna Luft gave her thoughts on the immersive version of the film on CBS News Sunday Morning, saying that her mother would approve of how the film was handled and that she looked forward to seeing a new generation of fans and audiences introduced to the film through this format. Ahead of the film's premiere, the use of AI to enhance the film for Sphere's capabilities was not met with unanimous favor from the public, given ongoing societal and governmental concerns regarding the regulation of AI in filmmaking. In response to the criticism, Grossman remarked: "I don't think you understand how artists work,
