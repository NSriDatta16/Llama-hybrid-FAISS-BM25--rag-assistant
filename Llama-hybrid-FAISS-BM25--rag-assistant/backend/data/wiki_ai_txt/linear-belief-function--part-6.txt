tion of two pieces of knowledge: one is specified by the linear equation involving three variables X, Y, and E, and the other is a simple normal distribution of E, i.e., E ~ N(0, Σ). Let M 1 ( X → , E → , Y ) = [ 0 0 b 0 0 A 0 0 I A T I 0 ] {\displaystyle M_{1}({\vec {X}},{\vec {\rm {E}}},Y)=\left[{\begin{array}{*{20}c}0&0&b\\0&0&A\\0&0&I\\{A^{T}}&I&0\\\end{array}}\right]} and M 2 ( E → ) = [ 0 − Σ − 1 ] {\displaystyle M_{2}({\vec {\rm {E}}})=\left[{\begin{array}{*{20}c}0\\{-\Sigma ^{-1}}\\\end{array}}\right]} be their moment matrices respectively. Then the two matrices can be combined directly without sweeping M 1 ( X → , E → , Y ) {\displaystyle M_{1}({\vec {X}},{\vec {\rm {E}}},Y)} on Y first. The result of the combination is a partially swept matrix as follows: M ( X → , E → , Y ) = [ 0 0 b 0 0 A 0 − Σ − 1 I A T I 0 ] {\displaystyle M({\vec {X}},{\vec {\rm {E}}},Y)=\left[{\begin{array}{*{20}c}0&0&b\\0&0&A\\0&{-\Sigma ^{-1}}&I\\{A^{T}}&I&0\\\end{array}}\right]} If we apply a reverse sweeping on E and then remove E from the matrix, we will obtain the same representation of the regression model. Applications We may use an audit problem to illustrate the three types of variables as follows. Suppose we want to audit the ending balance of accounts receivable (E). As we saw earlier, E is equal to the beginning balance (B) plus the sales (S) for the period minus the cash receipts (C) on the sales plus a residual (R) that represents insignificant sales returns and cash discounts. Thus, we can represent the logical relation as a linear equation: E = B + S − C + R {\displaystyle E=B+S-C+R} Furthermore, if the auditor believes E and B are 100 thousand dollars on the average with a standard deviation 5 and the covariance 15, we can represent the belief as a multivariate normal distribution. If historical data indicate that the residual R is zero on the average with a standard deviation of 0.5 thousand dollars, we can summarize the historical data by normal distribution R ~ N(0, 0.52). If there is a direct observation on cash receipts, we can represent the evidence as an equation say, C = 50 (thousand dollars). If the auditor knows nothing about the beginning balance of accounts receivable, we can represent his or her ignorance by a vacuous LBF. Finally, if historical data suggests that, given cash receipts C, the sales S is on the average 8C + 4 and has a standard deviation 4 thousand dollars, we can represent the knowledge as a linear regression model S ~ N(4 + 8C, 16). == References ==
