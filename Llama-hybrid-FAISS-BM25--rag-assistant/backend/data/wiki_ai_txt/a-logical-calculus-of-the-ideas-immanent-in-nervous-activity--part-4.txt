nificant evidence for a general method for how animals recognizing objects, by scanning a scene from multiple transformations and finding a canonical representation. He hypothesized that this "scanning" activity is clocked by the alpha wave, which he mistakenly thought was tightly regulated at 10 Hz (instead of the 8 -- 13 Hz as modern research shows). McCulloch worked with Manuel Blum in studying how a neural network can be "logically stable", that is, can implement a boolean function even if the activation thresholds of individual neurons are varied. They were inspired by the problem of how the brain can perform the same functions, such as breathing, under influence of caffeine or alcohol, which shifts the activation threshold over the entire brain.
