h can be seen by considering the ratio of the area of the line tolerance zone (roughly wL) and the overall area (roughly L2). So, based on the approximate estimates above, the expected number of k-point alignments in the overall set can be estimated to be very roughly equal to n ! ( n − k ) ! k ! ( w L ) k − 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {n!}{(n-k)!\,k!}}\left({\frac {w}{L}}\right)^{k-2}} Among other things this can be used to show that, contrary to intuition, the number of k-point lines expected from random chance in a plane covered with points at a given density, for a given line width, increases much more than linearly with the size of the area considered, since the combinatorial explosion of growth in the number of possible combinations of points more than makes up for the increase in difficulty of any given combination lining up. More precise estimate of expected number of alignments Using a similar, but more careful analysis, a more precise expression for the number of 3-point alignments of maximum width w and maximum length d expected by chance among n points placed randomly on a square of side L can be found as μ = π 3 w L ( d L ) 3 n ( n − 1 ) ( n − 2 ) {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\pi }{3}}{\frac {w}{L}}\left({\frac {d}{L}}\right)^{3}n(n-1)(n-2)} If d ≈ L and k = 3, it can be seen that this makes the same prediction as the rough estimate above, up to a constant factor. If edge effects (alignments lost over the boundaries of the square) are included, then the expression becomes μ = π 3 w L ( d L ) 3 n ( n − 1 ) ( n − 2 ) ( 1 − 3 π ( d L ) + 3 5 ( 4 π − 1 ) ( d L ) 2 ) {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\pi }{3}}{\frac {w}{L}}\left({\frac {d}{L}}\right)^{3}n(n-1)(n-2)\left(1-{\frac {3}{\pi }}\left({\frac {d}{L}}\right)+{\frac {3}{5}}\left({\frac {4}{\pi }}-1\right)\left({\frac {d}{L}}\right)^{2}\right)} A generalisation to k-point alignments (ignoring edge effects) is μ = π n ( n − 1 ) ( n − 2 ) ⋯ ( n − ( k − 1 ) ) k ( k − 2 ) ! ( w L ) k − 2 ( d L ) k {\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {\pi n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-(k-1))}{k(k-2)!}}\left({\frac {w}{L}}\right)^{k-2}\left({\frac {d}{L}}\right)^{k}} which has roughly similar asymptotic scaling properties as the crude approximation in the previous section, for the same reason; that combinatorial explosion for large n overwhelms the effects of other variables. Computer simulation of alignments Computer simulations show that points on a plane tend to form alignments similar to those found by ley hunters in numbers consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates above, suggesting that ley lines may also be generated by chance. This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the points are generated pseudo-randomly by computer, or from data sets of mundane features such as pizza restaurants or telephone booths. On a map with a width of tens of kilometers, it is easy to find alignments of 4 to 8 points even in relatively small sets of features with w = 50 m. Choosing larger areas, denser sets of features, or larger values of w makes it easy to find alignments of 20 or more points.
