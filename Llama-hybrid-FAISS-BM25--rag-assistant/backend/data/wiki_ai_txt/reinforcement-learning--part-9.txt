, text summarization, and machine translation, where the quality of the output depends on optimizing long-term or human-centered goals rather than the prediction of single correct label. Early application of RL in NLP emerged in dialogue systems, where conversation was determined as a series of actions optimized for fluency and coherence. These early attempts, including policy gradient and sequence-level training techniques, laid a foundation for the broader application of reinforcement learning to other areas of NLP. A major breakthrough happened with the introduction of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a method in which human feedback ratings are used to train a reward model that guides the RL agent. Unlike traditional rule-based or supervised systems, RLHF allows models to align their behavior with human judgments on complex and subjective tasks. This technique was initially used in the development of InstructGPT, an effective language model trained to follow human instructions and later in ChatGPT which incorporates RLHF for improving output responses and ensuring safety. More recently, researchers have explored the use of offline RL in NLP to improve dialogue systems without the need of live human interaction. These methods optimize for user engagement, coherence, and diversity based on past conversation logs and pre-trained reward models. Statistical comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms Efficient comparison of RL algorithms is essential for research, deployment and monitoring of RL systems. To compare different algorithms on a given environment, an agent can be trained for each algorithm. Since the performance is sensitive to implementation details, all algorithms should be implemented as closely as possible to each other. After the training is finished, the agents can be run on a sample of test episodes, and their scores (returns) can be compared. Since episodes are typically assumed to be i.i.d, standard statistical tools can be used for hypothesis testing, such as T-test and permutation test. This requires to accumulate all the rewards within an episode into a single numberâ€”the episodic return. However, this causes a loss of information, as different time-steps are averaged together, possibly with different levels of noise. Whenever the noise level varies across the episode, the statistical power can be improved significantly, by weighting the rewards according to their estimated noise. Challenges and Limitations Despite significant advancements, reinforcement learning (RL) continues to face several challenges and limitations that hinder its widespread application in real-world scenarios. Sample Inefficiency RL algorithms often require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn effective policies, leading to high computational costs and time-intensive to train the agent. For instance, OpenAI's Dota-playing bot utilized thousands of years of simulated gameplay to achieve human-level performance. Techniques like experience replay and curriculum learning have been proposed to deprive sample inefficiency, but these techniques add more complexity and are not always sufficient for real-world applications. Stability and Convergence Issues Training RL models, particularly for deep neural network-based models, can be unstable and prone to divergence. A small change in the policy or environment can lead to extreme fluctuations in performance, making it difficult to achieve consistent results. This instability is further enhanced in the case of the continuous or high-dimensional action space, where the learning step becomes more complex and less predictable. Generalization and Transferability The RL agents trained in specific environments often struggle to generalize their learned policies to new, unseen scenarios. This is the major setback preventing the application of RL to dynamic real-world environments where adaptability is crucial. The challenge is to develop such algorithms t
