curate, nor is the camera pose even possible to know. These imperfections result in artifacts and suboptimal convergence. So, a method was developed to optimize the camera pose along with the volumetric function itself. Called Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Field (BARF), the technique uses a dynamic low-pass filter (DLPF) to go from coarse to fine adjustment, minimizing error by finding the geometric transformation to the desired image. This corrects imperfect camera poses and greatly improves the quality of NeRF renders. Multiscale representation Conventional NeRFs struggle to represent detail at all viewing distances, producing blurry images up close and overly aliased images from distant views. In 2021, researchers introduced a technique to improve the sharpness of details at different viewing scales known as mip-NeRF (comes from mipmap). Rather than sampling a single ray per pixel, the technique fits a gaussian to the conical frustum cast by the camera. This improvement effectively anti-aliases across all viewing scales. mip-NeRF also reduces overall image error and is faster to converge at about half the size of ray-based NeRF. Learned initializations In 2021, researchers applied meta-learning to assign initial weights to the MLP. This rapidly speeds up convergence by effectively giving the network a head start in gradient descent. Meta-learning also allowed the MLP to learn an underlying representation of certain scene types. For example, given a dataset of famous tourist landmarks, an initialized NeRF could partially reconstruct a scene given one image. NeRF in the wild Conventional NeRFs are vulnerable to slight variations in input images (objects, lighting) often resulting in ghosting and artifacts. As a result, NeRFs struggle to represent dynamic scenes, such as bustling city streets with changes in lighting and dynamic objects. In 2021, researchers at Google developed a new method for accounting for these variations, named NeRF in the Wild (NeRF-W). This method splits the neural network (MLP) into three separate models. The main MLP is retained to encode the static volumetric radiance. However, it operates in sequence with a separate MLP for appearance embedding (changes in lighting, camera properties) and an MLP for transient embedding (changes in scene objects). This allows the NeRF to be trained on diverse photo collections, such as those taken by mobile phones at different times of day. Relighting In 2021, researchers added more outputs to the MLP at the heart of NeRFs. The output now included: volume density, surface normal, material parameters, distance to the first surface intersection (in any direction), and visibility of the external environment in any direction. The inclusion of these new parameters lets the MLP learn material properties, rather than pure radiance values. This facilitates a more complex rendering pipeline, calculating direct and global illumination, specular highlights, and shadows. As a result, the NeRF can render the scene under any lighting conditions with no re-training. Plenoctrees Although NeRFs had reached high levels of fidelity, their costly compute time made them useless for many applications requiring real-time rendering, such as VR/AR and interactive content. Introduced in 2021, Plenoctrees (plenoptic octrees) enabled real-time rendering of pre-trained NeRFs through division of the volumetric radiance function into an octree. Rather than assigning a radiance direction into the camera, viewing direction is taken out of the network input and spherical radiance is predicted for each region. This makes rendering over 3000x faster than conventional NeRFs. Sparse Neural Radiance Grid Similar to Plenoctrees, this method enabled real-time rendering of pretrained NeRFs. To avoid querying the large MLP for each point, this method bakes NeRFs into Sparse Neural Radiance Grids (SNeRG). A SNeRG is a sparse voxel grid containing opacity and color, with learned feature vectors to encode vie
