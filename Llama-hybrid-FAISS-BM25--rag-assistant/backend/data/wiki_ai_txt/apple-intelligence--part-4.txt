ously improved, and encouraged users to send feedback for unexpected summaries. Notification summaries for all news applications were later disabled in the iOS 18.3 beta, and a disclaimer was added to the Settings app warning that summaries "may contain errors". This was eventually enabled back on iOS 26 beta 4; however, all news summaries now have a "Summarized by Apple Intelligence" label . Lawsuit over false advertising On March 19, 2025, a federal lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in San Jose over allegations of false advertising and unfair competition regarding the delayed launch of some of its Apple Intelligence features. The suit said that Apple's ads for Apple Intelligence "saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone’s release." The suit continued: "This drove unprecedented excitement in the market, even for Apple, as the company knew it would, and as part of Apple’s ongoing effort to convince consumers to upgrade at a premium price and to distinguish itself from competitors deemed to be winning the AI arms race." "Apple deceived millions of consumers into purchasing new phones they did not need based on features that do not exist, in violation of multiple false advertising and consumer protection laws," claimed the lawsuit filing, adding that Apple's "pervasive marketing campaign" was "built on a lie." In September 2025, Apple filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that only two out of the "nearly two dozen" promised features were left out of the release. China rollout In early 2025, reputable news outlets reported that Apple had entered into a partnership with Alibaba Group to integrate Alibaba's Qwen large language models into Apple Intelligence for devices sold in mainland China. Earlier reporting indicated Apple had explored working with Baidu to adapt Chinese-language AI models for iPhones, but encountered technical and performance hurdles during integration efforts. The rollout has been subject to regulatory review by the Cyberspace Administration of China and has faced delays attributed to regulatory and geopolitical issues. Major outlets reported that Apple was targeting a China-specific launch of Apple Intelligence features in mid-to-late 2025, while noting those features may be adapted to meet local regulatory requirements. U.S. officials were reported to have raised concerns about the arrangement between Apple and local Chinese partners on national security and data access grounds.
