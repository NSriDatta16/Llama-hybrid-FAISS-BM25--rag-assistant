t is more useful if the study area can be split into two adjacent parts so that an automation algorithm can carry out mapping of a new area with the input of expert-processed data of adjacent land. Feature identification and detection Discontinuity analyses Discontinuities such as fault planes and bedding planes have important implications in civil engineering. Rock fractures can be recognized automatically by machine learning through photogrammetric analysis, even with the presence of interfering objects such as vegetation. In ML training for classifying images, data augmentation is a common practice to avoid overfitting and increase the training dataset size and variability. For example, in a study of rock fracture recognition, 68 images for training and 23 images for testing were prepared via random splitting. Data augmentation was performed, increasing the training dataset size to 8704 images by flipping and random cropping. The approach was able to recognize rock fractures accurately in most cases. Both the negative prediction value (NPV) and the specificity were over 0.99. This demonstrated the robustness of discontinuity analyses with machine learning. Carbon dioxide leakage detection Quantifying carbon dioxide leakage from a geological sequestration site has gained increased attention as the public is interested in whether carbon dioxide is stored underground safely and effectively. Carbon dioxide leakage from a geological sequestration site can be detected indirectly with the aid of remote sensing and an unsupervised clustering algorithm such as Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). The increase in soil CO2 concentration causes a stress response for plants by inhibiting plant respiration, as oxygen is displaced by carbon dioxide. The vegetation stress signal can be detected with the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE). The hyperspectral images are processed by the unsupervised algorithm, clustering pixels with similar plant responses. The hyperspectral information in areas with known CO2 leakage is extracted so that areas with leakage can be matched with the clustered pixels with spectral anomalies. Although the approach can identify CO2 leakage efficiently, there are some limitations that require further study. The NDRE may not be accurate due to reasons like higher chlorophyll absorption, variation in vegetation, and shadowing effects; therefore, some stressed pixels can be incorrectly classed as healthy. Seasonality, groundwater table height may also affect the stress response to CO2 of the vegetation. Quantification of water inflow The rock mass rating (RMR) system is a widely adopted rock mass classification system by geomechanical means with the input of six parameters. The amount of water inflow is one of the inputs of the classification scheme, representing the groundwater condition. Quantification of the water inflow in the faces of a rock tunnel was traditionally carried out by visual observation in the field, which is labour and time-consuming, and fraught with safety concerns. Machine learning can determine water inflow by analyzing images taken on the construction site. The classification of the approach mostly follows the RMR system, but combining damp and wet states, as it is difficult to distinguish only by visual inspection. The images were classified into the non-damaged state, wet state, dripping state, flowing state, and gushing state. The accuracy of classifying the images was approximately 90%. Classification Soil classification The most popular cost-effective method od soil investigation method is cone penetration testing (CPT). The test is carried out by pushing a metallic cone through the soil: the force required to push at a constant rate is recorded as a quasi-continuous log. Machine learning can classify soil with the input of CPT data. In an attempt to classify with ML, there are two tasks required to analyze the data, namely segmentation and classification.
