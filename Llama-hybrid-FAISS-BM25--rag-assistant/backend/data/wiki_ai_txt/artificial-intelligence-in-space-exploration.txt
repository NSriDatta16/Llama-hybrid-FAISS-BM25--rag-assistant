Artificial intelligence is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, there are multiple subfields. The subfield of Machine learning has been used for various scientific and commercial purposes including language translation, image recognition, decision-making, credit scoring, and e-commerce. In recent years, there have been massive advancements in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence, which uses generative models to produce text, images, videos or other forms of data. This article describes applications of AI in different sectors. Agriculture In agriculture, AI has been proposed as a way for farmers to identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatments to increase yields, thereby improving efficiency. AI has been used to attempt to classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and optimize irrigation. Architecture and design Business A 2023 study found that generative AI increased productivity by 15% in contact centers. Another 2023 study found it increased productivity by up to 40% in writing tasks. An August 2025 review by MIT found that of surveyed companies, 95% did not report any improvement in revenue from the use of AI. A September 2025 article by the Harvard Business Review describes how increased use of AI does not automatically lead to increases in revenue or actual productivity. Referring to "AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task" the article coins the term workslop. Per studies done in collaboration with the Stanford Social Media Lab, workslop does not improve productivity and undermines trust and collaboration among colleagues. Computer science Programming assistance AI-assisted software development AI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. AI-assisted software development systems differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy. Creating software primarily via AI is known as "vibe coding". Code created or suggested by AI can be incorrect or inefficient, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before being accepted. The use of AI-assisted coding can potentially speed-up software development, but can also slow-down the process by creating more work when debugging and testing. The rush to prematurely adopt AI technology can also incur additional technical debt. AI also requires additional consideration and careful review for cybersecurity, since AI coding software is trained on a wide range of code of inconsistent quality and often replicates poor practices. Neural network design AI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet. Quantum computing Machine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology, including quantum sensors. Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications, and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry problems as well as for quantum an
