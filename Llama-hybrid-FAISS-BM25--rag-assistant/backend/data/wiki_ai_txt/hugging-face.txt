Hugging Face, Inc. is an American company based in New York City that develops computation tools for building applications using machine learning. It is most notable for its transformers library built for natural language processing applications and its platform that allows users to share machine learning models and datasets and showcase their work. History The company was founded in 2016 by French entrepreneurs ClÃ©ment Delangue, Julien Chaumond, and Thomas Wolf in New York City, originally as a company that developed a chatbot app targeted at teenagers. The company was named after the U+1F917 ðŸ¤— HUGGING FACE emoji. After open sourcing the model behind the chatbot, the company pivoted to focus on being a platform for machine learning. In March 2021, Hugging Face raised US$40 million in a Series B funding round. On April 28, 2021, the company launched the BigScience Research Workshop in collaboration with several other research groups to release an open large language model. In 2022, the workshop concluded with the announcement of BLOOM, a multilingual large language model with 176 billion parameters. In December 2022, the company acquired Gradio, an open source library built for developing machine learning applications in Python. On May 5, 2022, the company announced its Series C funding round led by Coatue and Sequoia. The company received a $2 billion valuation. On August 3, 2022, the company announced the Private Hub, an enterprise version of its public Hugging Face Hub that supports SaaS or on-premises deployment. In February 2023, the company announced partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) which would allow Hugging Face's products to be available to AWS customers to use them as the building blocks for their custom applications. The company also said the next generation of BLOOM will be run on Trainium, a proprietary machine learning chip created by AWS. In August 2023, the company announced that it raised $235 million in a Series D funding round, at a $4.5 billion valuation. The funding was led by Salesforce and notable participation came from Google, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, Intel, IBM, and Qualcomm. In June 2024, the company announced, along with Meta and Scaleway, their launch of a new AI accelerator program for European startups. This initiative aims to help startups integrate open foundation models into their products, accelerating the EU AI ecosystem. The program, based at STATION F in Paris, will run from September 2024 to February 2025. Selected startups will receive mentoring, access to AI models and tools, and Scalewayâ€™s computing power. On September 23, 2024, to further the International Decade of Indigenous Languages, Hugging Face teamed up with Meta and UNESCO to launch a new online language translator built on Meta's No Language Left Behind open-source AI model, enabling free text translation across 200 languages, including many low-resource languages. On April 2025, Hugging Face announced that they acquired a humanoid robotics startup, Pollen Robotics. Pollen Robotics is a France based Robotics Startup founded by Matthieu Lapeyre and Pierre Rouanet in 2016. In an X tweet, ClÃ©ment Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, shared his vision to make Artificial Intelligence robotics Open Source. Services and technologies Transformers Library The Transformers library is a Python package that contains open-source implementations of transformer models for text, image, and audio tasks. It is mainly compatible with the PyTorch library, but previous versions were also compatible with TensorFlow and JAX deep learning libraries. It includes implementations of notable models like BERT and GPT-2. The library was originally called "pytorch-pretrained-bert" which was then renamed to "pytorch-transformers" and finally "transformers." A JavaScript version (Transformers.js) has also been developed, allowing models to run directly in the browser through the ONNX runtime.
