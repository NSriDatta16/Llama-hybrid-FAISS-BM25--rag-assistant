and they should provide effective means to remedy for affected individuals. It is important for national and regional governments to expand on and contextualize international law. Responsibilities of private sector actors: human rights due diligence Private entities are responsible for conducting "human rights due diligence." Just like governments, private entities should identify risks before development by considering common risks and consulting stakeholders, "including affected groups, organizations that work on human rights, equality and discrimination, as well as independent human rights and machine learning experts." They should design systems that mitigate risks, subject systems to regular audits, and forego projects that carry too high of risks. They should be transparent about assumed risks, including details of the technical implementation where necessary, and should provide a mechanism for affected individuals to dispute any decisions that affect them. The right to an effective remedy "The right to justice is a vital element of international human rights law." Private entities should create processes for affected individuals to seek remedy, and they should designate roles for who will oversee these processes. Governments must be especially cautious when deploying machine learning systems in the justice sector. Transparency, accountability, and remedy can help. == References ==
