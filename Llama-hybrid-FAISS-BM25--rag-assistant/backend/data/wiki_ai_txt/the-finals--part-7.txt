ta occurring between June 14â€“21. An open beta took place between October 26 until November 5. The Finals was released on PC, Xbox Series X&S, and PlayStation 5 on December 7, 2023, during The Game Awards 2023. The Finals features full support for crossplay, allowing players on different platforms to play together. On release, underperforming servers caused the developers to put a temporary cap on player counts. The game was also later ported to the PlayStation 4 on December 12th, 2024, however it wasn't ported to the Xbox One due to hardware limitations. Despite Kernel-Level Anti-cheat imported into the game, to combat cheaters, the developers noted that they will continue to support the Steam Deck, and other SteamOS devices. Early Reception According to IGN, poor performance and low frame rates posed an issue during the game's early closed betas. This game also has problems in balance, as Justin Koreis pointed out that"balance issues are a bit of a concern at the moment" generally due to "Heavies tend to be ubiquitous in competitive modes." The Finals has also been criticized for the use of the A.I. text-to-speech program created by ElevenLabs to artificially generate the voices of characters, rather than utilizing traditional voice actors. Embark Studios responded to the criticism, telling Axios the generated voicework in The Finals is "based on a mix of professional voice actors and temp voices from Embark employees."
