The increasing adoption and development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are having a significant and multifaceted impact on the political sphere. AI is viewed both as a fundamental pillar for modernizing political processes and as a potential threat to democratic integrity and stability. Artificial intelligence has been making its impact on politics in many ways but some key places are in Elections, public trust in politics, and in political policy. History Computational foundations (1950s-1970s) The first involvement of artificial intelligence in politics occurred during a live CBS broadcast on November 4, 1952, when Remington Rand's UNIVAC I computer predicted that Eisenhower would win 438 electoral votes to Stevenson's 93 after analyzing 3 million votes. The final result was 442 to 89, less than 1% error. During the 1950s political science became an independent discipline, with Ithiel de Sola Pool coining social network theory and developing methodologies that would influence the field for decades. His collaboration with Robert Abelson at Yale produced the first systematic computer simulations of electoral behavior, creating mathematical models that could predict voter responses to different campaign strategies. In 1959, Ed Greenfield founded the private U.S. data science firm Simulmatics Corporation with Pool as head of research. Simulmatics developed "The People Machine"â€”an IBM 704 computer system using FORTRAN programming to analyze voter behavior through sophisticated demographic modeling. The 1960 presidential election marked the first systematic deployment of artificial intelligence to influence a major campaign outcome. Simulmatics divided American voters into 480 distinct demographic categories, analyzing archived interviews from 130,000 respondents to predict how different groups would respond to specific messages and policy positions. The computer analysis concluded that Kennedy could win despite anti-Catholic sentiment and that supporting civil rights would ultimately benefit the campaign by mobilizing Black voters. The 1960s witnessed rapid expansion of academic research in computational politics. Harold Guetzkow published "Simulation in International Relations" in 1963, extending computer modeling to foreign policy analysis. In 1965, Pool, Abelson, and Samuel Popkin published their seminal work Candidates, Issues, and Strategies: A Computer Simulation of the 1960 and 1964 Presidential Elections, providing the first comprehensive documentation of electoral simulation methodologies. The Pentagon's 1966-1968 contract with Simulmatics to analyze Vietnamese civilian attitudes and develop propaganda strategies provides an early example of AI's limitations in political contexts. The project failed due to cultural barriers and oversimplified human behavior modeling, leading to the company's bankruptcy in 1970. Database-driven campaigns in the Reagan Era (1980s-1990s) The 1980s database revolution changed political campaigning by enabling sophisticated voter file management and demographic targeting. Richard Viguerie pioneered computerized direct mail political fundraising, creating extensive conservative donor databases that established the template for data-driven political targeting. The Reagan campaigns of 1980 and 1984 utilized early computerized voter file management systems, representing the first systematic use of databases for voter contact and fundraising at scale. Technological breakthroughs in relational database management systems enabled this transformation. E.F. Codd's 1970 relational database model paper provided the theoretical foundation, while Oracle's first commercial SQL database in 1979 and IBM's DB2 system democratized data processing capabilities. The 1982 IBM PC introduction made database technology accessible to local campaigns, enabling sophisticated voter file management, demographic modeling, and direct mail targeting across different organizational levels.
