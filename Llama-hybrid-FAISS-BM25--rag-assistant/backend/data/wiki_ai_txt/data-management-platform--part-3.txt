Disadvantages Data management platforms rely heavily on Cookie technology to identify behaviours. Recent moves from Apple and now Google are moving towards blocking third party advertising cookies which places the Data management platform value proposition at risk. Moreover, the adoption of such a platform may be difficult in an organization's current environment. This is because data aggregation technology is complex and requires the correct technical knowledge for implementation. Another area of concern is the quality of the imported data: if it is of low quality, then the DMP will fail to provide meaningful results. Ownership of collected data and privacy concerns There are three main types of data in general: 1st party data – data collected and owned by the company itself. For example, website data, mobile application data, and CRM data. 2nd party data – data collected as a result of corporate cooperation. This includes online campaign data and customer journey data. 3rd party data – data delivered by data providers, which is available on the market for purchase. There are also three main types of data collected by DMPs: Observed data – the digital footprint of internet users, i.e. search history or type of web browser used. Inferred data – conclusions based on a user's internet behavior. Declared data – data explicitly provided from users such as online forms or application sign ups. DMPs are beneficial in helping digital marketers discover new audiences based on third-party data. Although this is the case, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) makes it harder for DMPs to obtain third-party data. Previously, DMPs processed third-party data through cookies and existing laws did not require user consent for such data collection. However, the GDPR now demands that personal data - which includes data collected through the use of cookies - can only be used with user consent. Going forward, this means that collecting third-party data will become harder for companies, and DMPs will have greater legal obligations. As a result, future DMPs may rely more heavily on first-party and second-party data. == References ==
