C) framework, where a single-layer Neural Network and the extreme learning machine training algorithm are employed. X-TFC allows to improve the accuracy and performance of regular PINNs, and its robustness and reliability are proved for stiff problems, optimal control, aerospace, and rarefied gas dynamics applications. Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) for multiple sets of irregular geometries Regular PINNs are only able to obtain the solution of a forward or inverse problem on a single geometry. It means that for any new geometry (computational domain), one must retrain a PINN. This limitation of regular PINNs imposes high computational costs, specifically for a comprehensive investigation of geometric parameters in industrial designs. Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) is fundamentally the result of a combination of PINN's loss function with PointNet. In fact, instead of using a simple fully connected neural network, PIPN uses PointNet as the core of its neural network. PointNet has been primarily designed for deep learning of 3D object classification and segmentation by the research group of Leonidas J. Guibas. PointNet extracts geometric features of input computational domains in PIPN. Thus, PIPN is able to solve governing equations on multiple computational domains (rather than only a single domain) with irregular geometries, simultaneously. The effectiveness of PIPN has been shown for incompressible flow, heat transfer and linear elasticity. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inverse computations Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proven particularly effective in solving inverse problems within differential equations, demonstrating their applicability across science, engineering, and economics. They have shown to be useful for solving inverse problems in a variety of fields, including nano-optics, topology optimization/characterization, multiphase flow in porous media, and high-speed fluid flow. PINNs have demonstrated flexibility when dealing with noisy and uncertain observation datasets. They also demonstrated clear advantages in the inverse calculation of parameters for multi-fidelity datasets, meaning datasets with different quality, quantity, and types of observations. Uncertainties in calculations can be evaluated using ensemble-based or Bayesian-based calculations. PINNs can also be used in connection with symbolic regression for discovering the mathematical expression in connection with discovery of parameters and functions. One example of such application is the study on chemical ageing of cellulose insulation material, in this example PINNs are used to first discover a parameter for a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and later a function solution, which is later used to find a more fitting expression using a symbolic regression with a combination of operators. Physics-informed neural networks for elasticity problems Ensemble of physics-informed neural networks is applied for solving plane elasticity problems. Surrogate networks are intended for the unknown functions, namely, the components of the strain and the stress tensors as well as the unknown displacement field, respectively. The residual network provides the residuals of the partial differential equations (PDEs) and of the boundary conditions. The computational approach is based on principles of artificial intelligence. This approach can be extended to nonlinear elasticity problems, where the constitutive equations are nonlinear. PINNs can also be used for Kirchhoff plate bending problems with transverse distributed loads and to contact models with elastic Winkler's foundations. A comparison of PINNs with classical approximation methods in mechanics, especially the Least Squares Finite Element Method, is outlined in .
