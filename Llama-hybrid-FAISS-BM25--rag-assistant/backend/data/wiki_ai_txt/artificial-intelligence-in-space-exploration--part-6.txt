 digitized art. While distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork. Computer animation Pixar began experimenting with a machine learning project called "Genesis" in the early 2000s. It was designed to learn algorithms and create 3D models for its characters and props. In 2023, Netflix of Japan's usage of AI to generate background images for short The Dog & the Boy was met with backlash online. Finance Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking began in 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank launched a fraud prevention task-force to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards. Banks use AI to organize operations for bookkeeping, investing in stocks, and managing properties. AI can adapt to changes during non-business hours. AI is used to combat fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns for any abnormal changes or anomalies. The use of AI in applications such as online trading and decision-making has changed major economic theories. For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms estimate personalized demand and supply curves, thus enabling individualized pricing. AI systems reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus make markets more efficient. The application of artificial intelligence in the financial industry can alleviate the financing constraints of non-state-owned enterprises, especially for smaller and more innovative enterprises. Trading and investment Algorithmic trading involves using AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds of magnitude greater than any human is capable of, making millions of trades in a day without human intervention. Such high-frequency trading represents a fast-growing sector. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have AI-managed portfolios. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional investors but include smaller firms trading with their own AI systems. Large financial institutions use AI to assist with their investment practices. BlackRock's AI engine, Aladdin, is used both within the company and by clients to help with investment decisions. Its functions include the use of natural language processing to analyze text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use SQREEM (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) to mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with wealth management products. Underwriting Online lender Upstart uses machine learning for underwriting. ZestFinance's Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform is used for credit underwriting. This platform uses machine learning to analyze data, including purchase transactions and how a customer fills out a form, to score borrowers. The platform is handy for assigning credit scores to those with limited credit histories. Audit AI makes continuous auditing possible. Potential benefits include reducing audit risk, increasing the level of assurance, and reducing audit duration. Continuous auditing with AI allows real-time monitoring and reporting of financial activities and provides businesses with timely insights that can lead to quick decision-making. Anti–money laundering AI software, such as LaundroGraph which uses contemporary suboptimal datasets, could be used for anti–money laundering (AML).Anti–money laundering Collections and Account Receivables In recent years, the debt collection industry has begun to adopt AI-driven "agents" to automate routine outreach and negotiation tasks. Platforms use natural-language processing and machine learning to interact with consumers. Proponents claim these systems can handle high volumes of standard enquiries, freeing human collectors to focus on more complex cases, while deli
