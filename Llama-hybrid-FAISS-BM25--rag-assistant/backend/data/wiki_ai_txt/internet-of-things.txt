The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet or other communication networks. The IoT encompasses electronics, communication, and computer science engineering. "Internet of Things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable. The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, and control systems independently and collectively enable the Internet of Things. While in the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with "smart home" products—including devices and appliances like thermostats and smart speakers—the technology's largest applications are in the business and industrial sectors. Commercial asset tracking and fleet management represent the largest single application of IoT, accounting for 22% of the total market, driven by the need to monitor mobile assets like vehicles and shipping containers. Other major applications include industrial monitoring, smart metering in utilities, and connected healthcare. However, several concerns exist regarding the risks associated with the growth and diffusion of IoT technologies and products, particularly in the areas of privacy and security. Consequently, several industries, technology companies, and governments (or their branches, ministries, bureaus, departments, etc.) of many countries have taken multiple steps and implemented a variety of precautionary measures to address these concerns adequately and minimize safety risks, including the development and implementation of international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks. Due to their interconnected nature, IoT devices are vulnerable to security breaches and privacy concerns. At the same time, the way these devices communicate wirelessly creates regulatory ambiguities, complicating jurisdictional boundaries of the data transfer. Background Around 1972, for its remote site use, Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory developed a computer-controlled vending machine, adapted from a machine rented from Canteen Vending, which sold for cash or, through a computer terminal (Teletype Model 33 KSR), on credit. Amongst its products were beer, yogurt, and milk. It was named Prancing Pony, after the name of the room, which was named after an inn in J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. Each room at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was named after a Lord Of The Rings' fantasy world, known as Middle-earth. A successor version still operates in the Computer Science Department at Stanford, with updated hardware and software. History In 1982, an early concept of a network connected smart device was constructed as an Internet interface for sensors installed in the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department's departmental Coca-Cola vending machine, supplied by graduate student volunteers, provided a temperature model and an inventory status, inspired by the computer controlled vending machine in the Prancing Pony room at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. While it was initially accessible only on the CMU campus, it gained prominence as the first ARPANET-connected appliance. Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom, produced the contemporary vision of the IoT. In 1994, Reza Raji described the concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set of nodes, so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories."
