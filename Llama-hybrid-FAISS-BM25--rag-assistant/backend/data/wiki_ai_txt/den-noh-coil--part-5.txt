 air to control them. They can also listen to sound through futuristic ear monitors embedded in the vines of their glasses. Den-noh space It is often referred to simply as "space," in which the Den-noh materials exist. The world in the work is a ubiquitous society that uses it. It is also used for fully automatic control of transportation, and is greatly involved in the daily lives of people who do not use glasses. It is provided by Megamass, and in Daikoku City, it is managed by Daikoku City Hall as an administrative service under the jurisdiction of the Postal Bureau. For this reason, Megamass employees are seconded to the city hall. Den-noh Navi A navigation system for self-driving cars using Den-noh glasses. Den-noh materials A general term for anything that can be seen by wearing Den-noh glasses, including holograms for PC operation, Den-noh pets, and Den-noh items. People can see the images and hear the sounds they make, but do not feel any physical touch. Den-noh pets A legitimate petmaton. Den-noh life forms exist only in Den-noh space, but by wearing Den-noh glasses, they can be seen just like normal animals. Yasako's Denuske, Fumie's Oyaji, and Isako's Mojo fall into this category. Anti-illegal Den-noh object software In Daikoku City, powerful but inflexible software called Searchmaton constantly monitors for damaged or outdated spaces, computer viruses, and illegal Den-noh items, and repairs, formats, and deletes them. The children of Daikoku City are battling daily with Searchmatons, who mercilessly delete even harmless mischievous items and legal Den-noh pets that have wandered into old spaces due to their biased priorities. Illegals A mysterious black Den-noh creature rumored in urban legends. Its true identity is a new kind of computer virus that infects petmatons, a black illegal Den-noh-thing that has grown to a huge size. It can only live in old space or inside the body of a Den-noh creature. Isako hunts special forms of illegals in the hope of collecting valuable Meta-Bugs. Nulls A mysterious humanoid Den-noh creature that is said to be the oldest Illegal. They exist in countless numbers on "the other side" and come to the real world through the "passage". Den-noh coil phenomenon occurs in those whom Null touches, and Den-noh bodies separated from their physical bodies are taken away to "the other side" by Null. Tamako suspects that they are ruined null-carriers that were left to feral after the bankruptcy of Coils. Coils Node An experimental Den-noh lifeform with the ability to connect to the C-domain created by Coils. Den-noh Items Useful items that can be used within the Den-noh space. The children of Daikoku City purchase them at the Megashiya or mail-order Den-noh candy shops. Den-noh items include the Megane beam, which can destroy a small amount of Den-noh material, black bug spray, which artificially generates bugs, defensive walls such as brick walls and iron walls, and missiles called Tyokushin-kun (Mr. Straight) and Tsuiseki-kun (Mr. Chase). Meta-Bugs A mysterious Den-noh Materials that looks like a gemstone. It tends to occur in spatial distortions, and is thought to be the result of spatial bugs that have solidified.Since it can only be mined in Daikoku City, it is unofficially considered a specialty of the city. Most of them are useless bugs, but very rarely they have useful features that contain information such as sounds and images, and from their unique properties they can be refined into items or Meta-Tags by skilled craftsmen. Because of this, they sometimes fetch high prices and are used as virtual currency for trading Den-noh items only among children. The unit of currency in illegal stores on the Internet is "meta," and 1 meta = 1 yen. However, as Searchmatons delete damaged or corrupted spaces from one side to the other, the scarcity value is gradually increasing. Kira-Bugs A kind of special Meta-Bugs that is said to be sold at a high price, some say 30 times the price of a normal one.
