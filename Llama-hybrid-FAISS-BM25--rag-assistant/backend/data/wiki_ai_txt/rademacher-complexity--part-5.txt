2 = { ( w ⋅ x 1 , … , w ⋅ x m ) ∣ ‖ w ‖ 2 ≤ 1 } = {\displaystyle A_{2}=\{(w\cdot x_{1},\ldots ,w\cdot x_{m})\mid \|w\|_{2}\leq 1\}=} the set of dot-products of the vectors in S {\displaystyle S} with vectors in the unit ball. Then: Rad ⁡ ( A 2 ) ≤ max i ‖ x i ‖ 2 m {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (A_{2})\leq {\max _{i}\|x_{i}\|_{2} \over {\sqrt {m}}}} Define A 1 = { ( w ⋅ x 1 , … , w ⋅ x m ) ∣ ‖ w ‖ 1 ≤ 1 } = {\displaystyle A_{1}=\{(w\cdot x_{1},\ldots ,w\cdot x_{m})\mid \|w\|_{1}\leq 1\}=} the set of dot-products of the vectors in S {\displaystyle S} with vectors in the unit ball of the 1-norm. Then: Rad ⁡ ( A 1 ) ≤ max i ‖ x i ‖ ∞ ⋅ 2 log ⁡ ( 2 n ) m {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (A_{1})\leq \max _{i}\|x_{i}\|_{\infty }\cdot {\sqrt {2\log(2n) \over m}}} Bounds related to covering numbers The following bound relates the Rademacher complexity of a set A {\displaystyle A} to its external covering number – the number of balls of a given radius r {\displaystyle r} whose union contains A {\displaystyle A} . The bound is attributed to Dudley. Suppose A ⊂ R m {\displaystyle A\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m}} is a set of vectors whose length (norm) is at most c {\displaystyle c} . Then, for every integer M > 0 {\displaystyle M>0} : Rad ⁡ ( A ) ≤ c ⋅ 2 − M m + 6 c m ⋅ ∑ i = 1 M 2 − i log ⁡ ( N c ⋅ 2 − i ext ( A ) ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (A)\leq {c\cdot 2^{-M} \over {\sqrt {m}}}+{6c \over m}\cdot \sum _{i=1}^{M}2^{-i}{\sqrt {\log \left(N_{c\cdot 2^{-i}}^{\text{ext}}(A)\right)}}} In particular, if A {\displaystyle A} lies in a d-dimensional subspace of R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} , then: ∀ r > 0 : N r ext ( A ) ≤ ( 2 c d / r ) d {\displaystyle \forall r>0:N_{r}^{\text{ext}}(A)\leq (2c{\sqrt {d}}/r)^{d}} Substituting this in the previous bound gives the following bound on the Rademacher complexity: Rad ⁡ ( A ) ≤ 6 c m ⋅ ( d log ⁡ ( 2 d ) + 2 d ) = O ( c d log ⁡ ( d ) m ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (A)\leq {6c \over m}\cdot {\bigg (}{\sqrt {d\log(2{\sqrt {d}})}}+2{\sqrt {d}}{\bigg )}=O{\bigg (}{c{\sqrt {d\log(d)}} \over m}{\bigg )}} Gaussian complexity Gaussian complexity is a similar complexity with similar physical meanings, and can be obtained from the Rademacher complexity using the random variables g i {\displaystyle g_{i}} instead of σ i {\displaystyle \sigma _{i}} , where g i {\displaystyle g_{i}} are Gaussian i.i.d. random variables with zero-mean and variance 1, i.e. g i ∼ N ( 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle g_{i}\sim {\mathcal {N}}(0,1)} . Gaussian and Rademacher complexities are known to be equivalent up to logarithmic factors. Equivalence of Rademacher and Gaussian complexity Given a set A ⊆ R n {\displaystyle A\subseteq \mathbb {R} ^{n}} then it holds that: G ( A ) 2 log ⁡ n ≤ Rad ( A ) ≤ π 2 G ( A ) {\displaystyle {\frac {G(A)}{2{\sqrt {\log {n}}}}}\leq {\text{Rad}}(A)\leq {\sqrt {\frac {\pi }{2}}}G(A)} Where G ( A ) {\displaystyle G(A)} is the Gaussian Complexity of A. As an example, consider the rademacher and gaussian complexities of the L1 ball. The Rademacher complexity is given by exactly 1, whereas the Gaussian complexity is on the order of log ⁡ d {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\log d}}} (which can be shown by applying known properties of suprema of a set of subgaussian random variables).
