fails. In default logic, instead, a default having ¬ F {\displaystyle \neg F} as a justification can only be applied if ¬ F {\displaystyle \neg F} is consistent with the current knowledge. Restrictions A default is categorical or prerequisite-free if it has no prerequisite (or, equivalently, its prerequisite is tautological). A default is normal if it has a single justification that is equivalent to its conclusion. A default is supernormal if it is both categorical and normal. A default is seminormal if all its justifications entail its conclusion. A default theory is called categorical, normal, supernormal, or seminormal if all defaults it contains are categorical, normal, supernormal, or seminormal, respectively. Semantics of default logic A default rule can be applied to a theory if its precondition is entailed by the theory and its justifications are all consistent with the theory. The application of a default rule leads to the addition of its consequence to the theory. Other default rules may then be applied to the resulting theory. When the theory is such that no other default can be applied, the theory is called an extension of the default theory. The default rules may be applied in different order, and this may lead to different extensions. The Nixon diamond example is a default theory with two extensions: ⟨ { R e p u b l i c a n ( X ) : ¬ P a c i f i s t ( X ) ¬ P a c i f i s t ( X ) , Q u a k e r ( X ) : P a c i f i s t ( X ) P a c i f i s t ( X ) } , { R e p u b l i c a n ( N i x o n ) , Q u a k e r ( N i x o n ) } ⟩ {\displaystyle \left\langle \left\{{\frac {\mathrm {Republican} (X):\neg \mathrm {Pacifist} (X)}{\neg \mathrm {Pacifist} (X)}},{\frac {\mathrm {Quaker} (X):\mathrm {Pacifist} (X)}{\mathrm {Pacifist} (X)}}\right\},\left\{\mathrm {Republican} (\mathrm {Nixon} ),\mathrm {Quaker} (\mathrm {Nixon} )\right\}\right\rangle } Since Nixon is both a Republican and a Quaker, both defaults can be applied. However, applying the first default leads to the conclusion that Nixon is not a pacifist, which makes the second default not applicable. In the same way, applying the second default we obtain that Nixon is a pacifist, thus making the first default not applicable. This particular default theory has therefore two extensions, one in which Pacifist(Nixon) is true, and one in which Pacifist(Nixon) is false. The original semantics of default logic was based on the fixed point of a function. The following is an equivalent algorithmic definition. If a default contains formulae with free variables, it is considered to represent the set of all defaults obtained by giving a value to all these variables. A default α : β 1 , … , β n γ {\displaystyle {\frac {\alpha :\beta _{1},\ldots ,\beta _{n}}{\gamma }}} is applicable to a propositional theory T if T ⊨ α {\displaystyle T\models \alpha } and all theories T ∪ { β i } {\displaystyle T\cup \{\beta _{i}\}} are consistent. The application of this default to T leads to the theory T ∪ { γ } {\displaystyle T\cup \{\gamma \}} . An extension can be generated by applying the following algorithm: T = W /* current theory */ A = 0 /* set of defaults applied so far */ /* apply a sequence of defaults */ while there is a default d that is not in A and is applicable to T add the consequence of d to T add d to A /* final consistency check */ if for every default d in A T is consistent with all justifications of d then output T This algorithm is non-deterministic, as several defaults can alternatively be applied to a given theory T. In the Nixon diamond example, the application of the first default leads to a theory to which the second default cannot be applied and vice versa. As a result, two extensions are generated: one in which Nixon is a pacifist and one in which Nixon is not a pacifist. The final check of consistency of the justifications of all defaults that have been applied implies that some theories do not have any extensions. In particular, this happens whenever this check fails for ev
