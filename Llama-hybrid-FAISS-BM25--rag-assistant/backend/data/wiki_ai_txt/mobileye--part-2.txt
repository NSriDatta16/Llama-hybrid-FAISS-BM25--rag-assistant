 in Munich and New York City. In December 2021, Intel announced its plan to take Mobileye public via in 2022, while maintaining its majority ownership, this time on Nasdaq. In October 2022, Intel offered 5–6% of outstanding shares, raising $861 million on 41 million shares. This valued Mobileye at around $17 billion – more than what Intel had paid in 2017. Intel continued to hold all Class B shares, giving itself an overall 99.4% of voting power. Partnerships Mobileye formed partnerships with various automakers. Mobileye launched multiple series productions for LDW on GM Cadillac STS and DTS vehicles, and on BMW 5 and 6 Series vehicles. In 2016, Mobileye and Delphi formed a partnership to develop an autonomous driving system. In early 2017, Mobileye announced a partnership with BMW to integrate Mobileye technology into vehicles going to market in 2018. In 2018, Mobileye announced partnerships with BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen. In 2019, Mobileye and NIO announced that they would partner on the development of AVs for consumer markets in China and other major territories. In July 2020, Mobileye and Ford announced a deal in which Mobileye would supply its EyeQ camera-based gear and software across Ford's global product line. Also in 2020, Mobileye partnered with WILLER29 to launch a robotaxi service in Japan, Taiwan and Southeast Asia and with Geely for ADAS. The same year, Intel announced that it had acquired Moovit, a mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) company, to enhance Mobileye's MaaS offering. In February 2021, Mobileye, Transdev Autonomous Transport System (ATS) and Lohr Group formed a partnership to develop and deploy autonomous shuttles, and in April Mobileye announced a partnership with Udelv on the company's Transporter electric self-driving delivery vehicle. In 2021, Toyota Motor Corp. selected Mobileye and German supplier ZF to develop and supply ADAS and Mobileye began a partnership with Mahindra. Porsche In May 2023, Porsche and Mobileye launched a collaboration to provide Mobileye’s SuperVision™ in future Porsche production models. Tesla In August 2015, Tesla Motors announced that it would incorporate Mobileye's technology in Model S cars. Tesla reportedly did not share its plans with Mobileye, and after the first deadly crash of a self-driving Model S with Autopilot became public in June 2016, Mobileye ended their partnership. The two companies expressed disagreement over what caused the accident, with Shashua claiming that Tesla "was pushing the envelope in terms of safety" and that Autopilot is a "driver assistance system" and not a "driverless system". Mobileye issued a statement that its systems did not recognize a "lateral turn across path". Technology EyeQ The EyeQ system-on-chip (SoC) utilizes a single camera sensor to provide passive/active ADAS features including automatic emergency braking (AEB), adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane keeping assist(LKA), traffic jam assist (TJA) and forward collision warning (FCW). Mobileye's fifth-generation EyeQ supports fully autonomous vehicles. More than 27 automobile manufacturers utilize EyeQ for their assisted-driving technologies. Road Experience Management (REM) Mobileye's Road Experience Management, or REM, uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to maintain its 3D maps. The data collected amounts to about 10 kilobytes per kilometer. It is compiled in a map called Mobileye RoadBook that leverages anonymized, crowdsourced data from vehicle cameras for navigation and localization. According to Mobileye, REM had mapped more than 7.5 billion kilometers of roads by January 2021. Responsibility-Sensitive Safety Model (RSS) RSS, or the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety Model, is a mathematical safety model first proposed by Mobileye in 2017. RSS models AV decision-making and digitizes the implicit rules of safe driving for AVs to prevent self-driving vehicles from causing accidents. RSS is defined in software.
