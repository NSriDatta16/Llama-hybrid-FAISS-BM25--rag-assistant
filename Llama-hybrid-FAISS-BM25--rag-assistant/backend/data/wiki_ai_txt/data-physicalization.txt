A data physicalization (or simply physicalization) is a physical artefact whose geometry or material properties encode data. It has the main goals to engage people and to communicate data using computer-supported physical data representations. History Before the invention of computers and digital devices, the application of data physicalization already existed in ancient artifacts as a medium to represent abstract information. One example is Blombo ocher plaque which is estimated to be 70000 – 80000 years old. The geometric and iconographic shapes engraved at the surface of the artifact demonstrated the cognitive complexity of ancient humans. Moreover, since such representations were deliberately made and crafted, the evidences suggest that the geometric presentation of information is a popular methodology in the context of society. Although researchers still cannot decipher the specific type of information encoded in the artifact, there are several proposed interpretations. For example, the potential functions of the artifact are divided into four categories, categorized as "numerical", "functional", "cognitive", and "social". Later, at around 35,000 B.C, another artifact, the Lebombo bone, emerged and the encoded information became easier to read. There are around 29 distinct notches carved on the baboon fibula. It is estimated that the number of notches is closely related to the number of lunar cycles. Moreover, this early counting system was also regarded as the birth of calculation. Right before the invention of writing, the clay token system was spread across ancient Mesopotamia. When the buyers and sellers want to make a trade, they prepare a set of tokens and seal them inside the clay envelope after impressing the shape on the surface. Such physical entity was widely used in trading, administrative documents, and agricultural settlement. Moreover, the token system is evidence of the early counting system. Each shape corresponds to a physical meaning such as the representation of "sheep", forming a one-to-one mapping relationship. The significance of the token is it uses physical shape to encode numerical information and it is regarded as the precursor of the early writing system. The logical reason is the two-dimension symbol would record the same information as the impression created by the clay token. From 3000 BCE to the 17th century, a more complex visual encoding, Quipus, was developed and widely used in Andean South America. Knotted strings unrelated to quipu have also been used to record information by the ancient Chinese, Tibetans and Japanese. The ancient Inca empire used it for military and taxation purposes. The Base-10 logical-numerical system can record information based on the relative distance of knots, the color of the knots, and the type of knots. Due to the texture (cotton) of Quipus, very few of them survive. By analyzing those remaining artifacts, Erland Nordenskiöld proposed that Quipus is the only writing system used by Inca, and the information encoding technique is sophisticated and distinctive. The idea of data physicalization become popular since the 17th century in which architects and engineers widely used such methods in civil engineering and city management. For example, from 1663 to 1867, Plan-relief model was used to visualize French territorial structure and important military units such as citadels and walled cities. Therefore, one of the functions of the Plan-relief model was to plan defense or offense. It is worth noting that the model can be categorized as a military technology and it did not encode any abstract information. The tradition of using tangible models to represent buildings and architectures still remains today. One of the contemporary examples of data physicalization is the Galton board designed by Francis Galton who promoted the concept of Regression toward the mean. The Galton board, a very useful tool in approximating the Gaussian law of errors, consists of evenly sp
