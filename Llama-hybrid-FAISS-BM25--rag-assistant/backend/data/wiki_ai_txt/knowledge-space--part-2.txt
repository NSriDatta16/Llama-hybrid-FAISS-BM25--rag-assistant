 of other possible topics. But the covering relation associated with the prerequisite partial does control curricular structure: if students know a before a lesson and b immediately after, then b must cover a in the partial order. In such a circumstance, the new topics covered between a and b constitute the outer fringe of a ("what the student was ready to learn") and the inner fringe of b ("what the student just learned"). Construction of knowledge spaces In practice, there exist several methods to construct knowledge spaces. The most frequently used method is querying experts. There exist several querying algorithms that allow one or several experts to construct a knowledge space by answering a sequence of simple questions. Another method is to construct the knowledge space by explorative data analysis (for example by item tree analysis) from data. A third method is to derive the knowledge space from an analysis of the problem solving processes in the corresponding domain. == References ==
