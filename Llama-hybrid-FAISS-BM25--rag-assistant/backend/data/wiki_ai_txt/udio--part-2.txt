rds wrote that Udio's generation capability was imperfect and "less impressive" than Suno's, noting that its songs were substantially shorter than Suno's. He also called the songs it produced "half-baked and almost nightmarish". In response to the company's announcement of Udio's beta release on Twitter, Telefon Tel Aviv member Joshua Eustis tweeted that Udio was "an app to replace musicians" and called into question the data that it used. Udio has also been criticized online as "soulless" and for having the potential to create audio deepfakes. Lucas Ropek of Gizmodo stated that Udio was "full of acoustical nonsense" and that its songs were "extraordinarily bad". Copyright concerns Critics of Udio have questioned what data was used to train it and if that data consisted of copyrighted music. Rolling Stone wrote that there was "substantial reason to believe" that both Udio and Suno were trained with copyrighted music, while Benj Edwards of Ars Technica wrote that its training data was "likely filled with copyrighted material". Udio does not directly recreate copyrighted songs if prompted. Ding has stated that Udio has "extensive automated copyright filters" and that the company is "continually refining [its] safeguards". Stability AI took a different approach with Stable Audio 2.0, and used an explicitly licensed dataset of music called AudioSparx. In June 2024, a lawsuit, led by the Recording Industry Association of America, was filed against Udio and Suno alleging widespread infringement of copyrighted sound recordings. The lawsuit sought to bar the companies from training on copyrighted music, as well as damages of up to $150,000 per work from infringements that have already taken place.
