signs and zero a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition ⊥ {\displaystyle \bot } represents the falsity or absurdum and corresponds to the classical truth value false. Negation ¬ {\displaystyle \neg } (unary), sometimes called residual negation if other negation connectives are considered, as it is defined from the residual implication by the reductio ad absurdum: ¬ A ≡ A → ⊥ {\displaystyle \neg A\equiv A\rightarrow \bot } Equivalence ↔ {\displaystyle \leftrightarrow } (binary), defined as A ↔ B ≡ ( A → B ) ∧ ( B → A ) {\displaystyle A\leftrightarrow B\equiv (A\rightarrow B)\wedge (B\rightarrow A)} In t-norm logics, the definition is equivalent to ( A → B ) & ( B → A ) . {\displaystyle (A\rightarrow B){\mathbin {\And }}(B\rightarrow A).} (Weak) disjunction ∨ {\displaystyle \vee } (binary), also called lattice disjunction (as it is always realized by the lattice operation of join in algebraic semantics). In t-norm logics it is definable in terms of other connectives as A ∨ B ≡ ( ( A → B ) → B ) ∧ ( ( B → A ) → A ) {\displaystyle A\vee B\equiv ((A\rightarrow B)\rightarrow B)\wedge ((B\rightarrow A)\rightarrow A)} Top ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } (nullary), also called one and denoted by 1 {\displaystyle 1} or 1 ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {1}}} (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } corresponds to the classical truth value true and can in t-norm logics be defined as ⊤ ≡ ⊥ → ⊥ . {\displaystyle \top \equiv \bot \rightarrow \bot .} Some propositional t-norm logics add further propositional connectives to the above language, most often the following ones: The Delta connective △ {\displaystyle \triangle } is a unary connective that asserts classical truth of a proposition, as the formulae of the form △ A {\displaystyle \triangle A} behave as in classical logic. Also called the Baaz Delta, as it was first used by Matthias Baaz for Gödel–Dummett logic. The expansion of a t-norm logic L {\displaystyle L} by the Delta connective is usually denoted by L △ . {\displaystyle L_{\triangle }.} Truth constants are nullary connectives representing particular truth values between 0 and 1 in the standard real-valued semantics. For the real number r {\displaystyle r} , the corresponding truth constant is usually denoted by r ¯ . {\displaystyle {\overline {r}}.} Most often, the truth constants for all rational numbers are added. The system of all truth constants in the language is supposed to satisfy the bookkeeping axioms: r & s ¯ ↔ ( r ¯ & s ¯ ) , {\displaystyle {\overline {r{\mathbin {\And }}s}}\leftrightarrow ({\overline {r}}{\mathbin {\And }}{\overline {s}}),} r → s ¯ ↔ ( r ¯ → s ¯ ) , {\displaystyle {\overline {r\rightarrow s}}\leftrightarrow ({\overline {r}}{\mathbin {\rightarrow }}{\overline {s}}),} etc. for all propositional connectives and all truth constants definable in the language. Involutive negation ∼ {\displaystyle \sim } (unary) can be added as an additional negation to t-norm logics whose residual negation is not itself involutive, that is, if it does not obey the law of double negation ¬ ¬ A ↔ A {\displaystyle \neg \neg A\leftrightarrow A} . A t-norm logic L {\displaystyle L} expanded with involutive negation is usually denoted by L ∼ {\displaystyle L_{\sim }} and called L {\displaystyle L} with involution. Strong disjunction ⊕ {\displaystyle \oplus } (binary). In the context of substructural logics it is also called group, intensional, multiplicative, or parallel disjunction. Even though standard in contraction-free substructural logics, in t-norm fuzzy logics it is usually used only in the presence of involutive negation, which makes it definable (and so axiomatizable) by de Morgan's law from strong conjunction: A ⊕ B ≡ ∼ ( ∼ A & ∼ B ) . {\displaystyle A\oplus B\equiv \mathrm {\sim } (\mathrm {\sim } A{\mathbin {\And }}\mat
