{\displaystyle (\Phi ,\alpha )} if and only if β = ¬ ( ϕ 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ ϕ n ) {\displaystyle \beta =\neg (\phi _{1}\wedge \dots \wedge \phi _{n})} for { ϕ 1 , … , ϕ n } ⊆ Φ {\displaystyle \{\phi _{1},\dots ,\phi _{n}\}\subseteq \Phi } Relation rebuttal : ( Ψ , β ) {\displaystyle (\Psi ,\beta )} attacks ( Φ , α ) {\displaystyle (\Phi ,\alpha )} if and only if β ⇔ ¬ α {\displaystyle \beta \Leftrightarrow \neg \alpha } is a tautology Given a particular attack relation, one can build a graph and reason in a similar way to the abstract argumentation frameworks (use of semantics to build extension, skeptical or credulous inference), the difference is that the information inferred from a logic based argumentation framework is a set of formulae (the consequences of the accepted arguments). Value-based argumentation frameworks The value-based argumentation frameworks come from the idea that during an exchange of arguments, some can be stronger than others with respect to a certain value they advance, and so the success of an attack between arguments depends on the difference of these values. Formally, a value-based argumentation framework is a tuple V A F = ⟨ A , R , V , val , valprefs ⟩ {\displaystyle VAF=\langle A,R,V,{\textit {val}},{\textit {valprefs}}\rangle } with A {\displaystyle A} and R {\displaystyle R} similar to the standard framework (a set of arguments and a binary relation on this set), V {\displaystyle V} is a non empty set of values, val {\displaystyle {\textit {val}}} is a mapping that associates each element from A {\displaystyle A} to an element from V {\displaystyle V} , and valprefs {\displaystyle {\textit {valprefs}}} is a preference relation (transitive, irreflexive and asymmetric) on V × V {\displaystyle V\times V} . In this framework, an argument a {\displaystyle a} defeats another argument b {\displaystyle b} if and only if a {\displaystyle a} attacks b {\displaystyle b} in the "standard" meaning: ( a , b ) ∈ R {\displaystyle (a,b)\in R} ; and ( val ( b ) , v a l ( a ) ) ∉ valprefs {\displaystyle ({\textit {val}}(b),val(a))\not \in {\textit {valprefs}}} , that is the value advanced by b {\displaystyle b} is not preferred to the one advanced by a {\displaystyle a} . One remarks that an attack succeeds if both arguments are associated to the same value, or if there is no preference between their respective values. Assumption-based argumentation frameworks In assumption-based argumentation (ABA) frameworks, arguments are defined as a set of rules and attacks are defined in terms of assumptions and contraries. Formally, an assumption-based argumentation framework is a tuple ⟨ L , R , A , ␣ ¯ ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\mathcal {L}},{\mathcal {R}},{\mathcal {A}},{\overline {\mathrm {\textvisiblespace} }}\rangle } , where ⟨ L , R ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\mathcal {L}},{\mathcal {R}}\rangle } is a deductive system, where L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} is the language and R {\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}} is the set of inference rules in the form of s 0 ← s 1 , … , s m {\displaystyle s_{0}\leftarrow s_{1},\dotsc ,s_{m}} , for m > 0 {\displaystyle m>0} and s 0 , s 1 , … , s m ∈ L {\displaystyle s_{0},s_{1},\dotsc ,s_{m}\in {\mathcal {L}}} ; A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} , where A ⊆ L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}\subseteq {\mathcal {L}}} is a non-empty set, named the assumptions; ␣ ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {\mathrm {\textvisiblespace} }}} is a total mapping from A {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}} to L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} , where a ¯ {\displaystyle {\overline {a}}} is defined as the contrary of a {\displaystyle a} . As a consequence of defining an ABA, an argument can be represented in a tree-form. Formally, given a deductive system ⟨ L , R ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle {\mathcal {L}},{\mathcal {R}}\rangle } and set of assumptions A ⊆ L {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A}}\subseteq {\mathcal {L}}} , an argument for claim c ∈ L {\textstyle c\in {\mathcal {L}}} supported by S ⊆ A {\displaystyle S\subseteq {\mathcal {A}}} ,
