TensorFlow is a software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks, but is used mainly for training and inference of neural networks. It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, alongside others such as PyTorch. It is free and open-source software released under the Apache License 2.0. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. The initial version was released under the Apache License 2.0 in 2015. Google released an updated version, TensorFlow 2.0, in September 2019. TensorFlow can be used in a wide variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java, facilitating its use in a range of applications in many sectors. History DistBelief Starting in 2011, Google Brain built DistBelief as a proprietary machine learning system based on deep learning neural networks. Its use grew rapidly across diverse Alphabet companies in both research and commercial applications. Google assigned multiple computer scientists, including Jeff Dean, to simplify and refactor the codebase of DistBelief into a faster, more robust application-grade library, which became TensorFlow. In 2009, the team, led by Geoffrey Hinton, had implemented generalized backpropagation and other improvements, which allowed generation of neural networks with substantially higher accuracy, for instance a 25% reduction in errors in speech recognition. TensorFlow TensorFlow is Google Brain's second-generation system. Version 1.0.0 was released on February 11, 2017. While the reference implementation runs on single devices, TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs (with optional CUDA and SYCL extensions for general-purpose computing on graphics processing units). TensorFlow is available on 64-bit Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile computing platforms including Android and iOS. Its flexible architecture allows for easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices. TensorFlow computations are expressed as stateful dataflow graphs. The name TensorFlow derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays, which are referred to as tensors. During the Google I/O Conference in June 2016, Jeff Dean stated that 1,500 repositories on GitHub mentioned TensorFlow, of which only 5 were from Google. In March 2018, Google announced TensorFlow.js version 1.0 for machine learning in JavaScript. In Jan 2019, Google announced TensorFlow 2.0. It became officially available in September 2019. In May 2019, Google announced TensorFlow Graphics for deep learning in computer graphics. Tensor processing unit (TPU) In May 2016, Google announced its Tensor processing unit (TPU), an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC, a hardware chip) built specifically for machine learning and tailored for TensorFlow. A TPU is a programmable AI accelerator designed to provide high throughput of low-precision arithmetic (e.g., 8-bit), and oriented toward using or running models rather than training them. Google announced they had been running TPUs inside their data centers for more than a year, and had found them to deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning. In May 2017, Google announced the second-generation, as well as the availability of the TPUs in Google Compute Engine. The second-generation TPUs deliver up to 180 teraflops of performance, and when organized into clusters of 64 TPUs, provide up to 11.5 petaflops. In May 2018, Google announced the third-generation TPUs delivering up to 420 teraflops of performance and 128 GB high bandwidth memory (HBM). Cloud TPU v3 Pods offer 100+ petaflops of performance and 32 TB HBM. In February 2018, Google announced that they were making TPUs available in beta on the Google Cloud Platform. Edge TPU In July 2018, the Edge TPU was announced.
