een integrated with Project Sanjay to provide a common operational picture for improved coordination, situational awareness, and decision superiority, and the Trinetra system, which has been used to identify and prioritize critical threats in order to achieve strategic dominance. AI-enabled weather forecast, allowed for accurate planning and targeting of artillery units and long-range vectors. The battlefield AI model was fed 26 years of data that had recorded and archived the Pakistan Armed Forces' frequency signature and radio emission. This specified which military unit in Pakistan was responsible for each piece of equipment and where it had previously been used. Integrating feeds from sensors, drones, radars, and satellites allowed for the collection of real-time data. All the data, including information on adversary positions, resources, and logistics, were combined and presented to the military commanders for appropriate action. Global trends Various countries are researching and deploying AI military applications, in what has been termed the "artificial intelligence arms race". Ongoing research is focused on intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US$5.1 billion in 2010 to US$7.5 billion in 2015. In November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology. Many AI researchers try to avoid military applications, with guardrails to prevent military applications integrated into most mainstream large language models. In popular culture Military artificial intelligence systems have appeared in many works of fiction, often as antagonists.
