rom Voiceverse at this point. At the same time, Voiceverse attempted to address the criticisms, stating that they were working to move to more environmentally friendly blockchain technology and that voice actors would receive royalties from NFT sales, with actors benefiting from any increase in NFT value. Plagiarism revelation On December 13, 2021, amidst the increasingly negative reactions toward NFTs among the general public, the creator of 15.ai (known pseudonymously as 15) announced that they had "no interest in incorporating NFTs into any aspect of [their] work." On January 14, 2022, 11:17 a.m. EST (10 hours after Baker's initial announcement), 15 commented on the Voiceverse venture, stating that it "sounds like a scam". Two hours later, at 1:20 p.m., 15 explicitly accused Voiceverse of "actively attempting to appropriate [15's] work for [Voiceverse's] own benefit." 15 provided evidence through server log files that showed that the voices Voiceverse was claiming credit for had actually been generated by 15.ai. The log files, which showed the details of the server request–responses exactly matching up with those present in Voiceverse's video, proved that Voiceverse had used 15.ai to create the voice samples that they were marketing as their own technology. The Chubbiverse promotion videos featured distorted voices of characters from the animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. The voice lines had then been sold as NFTs, a violation of 15.ai's terms of service, which explicitly prohibited commercial use and required proper attribution. Voiceverse initially responded sarcastically before deleting that response. At 2:09 p.m. EST, Voiceverse wrote in an apology to 15: "We are extremely sorry about this. The voice was indeed taken from your platform, which our marketing team used without giving proper credit. Chubbiverse team has no knowledge of this. We will make sure this never happens again." In their Discord server, Voiceverse further stated that their marketing team had been in such a rush to create a partnership technology demo that they resorted to using 15.ai without waiting for their own voice technology to be ready. In response, at 3:34 p.m. EST, 15 tweeted "Go fuck yourself"; the interaction went viral, garnering widespread support for 15. In a subsequent statement, the creator expressed being "extremely depressed" by the incident and wrote: "Not only because my work was stolen and used for profit, but also because of this scandal, the entire field of vocal synthesis is now being misrepresented by charlatans who are only in it for the money." Voiceverse subsequently deleted the incriminating tweet, but Twitter users had already saved and reshared the video. Reactions News publications universally characterized the incident as theft. English-language news websites—including Eurogamer, NME, Kotaku Australia, The Mary Sue, The Journal, PlayStation Universe, Geek Culture, Tech Times, Stevivor, Checkpoint Gaming, Metro, Kakuchopurei, Wccftech, and Mobidictum—reported that Voiceverse had stolen, taken, or used content without permission. Briana Lawrence of The Mary Sue wrote that "15's pinned tweet explicitly states that they have no interest in NFTs, so the theft in this case is a double dose of 'the audacity.'" Ruby Innes of Kotaku Australia called the theft "a case of absolute and unadulterated degenerate behaviour." Brandon Toh of Geek Culture remarked that Voiceverse's actions "seem to run counter to their purported support for content creators as a whole."
