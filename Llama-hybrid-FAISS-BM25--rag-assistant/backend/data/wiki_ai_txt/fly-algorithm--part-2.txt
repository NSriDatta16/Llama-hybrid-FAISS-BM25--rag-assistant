th and without the particular fly whose individual fitness function has to be evaluated. In the fitness of each fly is considered as a `level of confidence'. It is used during the voxelisation process to tweak the fly's individual footprint using implicit modelling (such as metaballs). It produces smooth results that are more accurate. More recently it has been used in digital art to generate mosaic-like images or spray paint. Examples of images can be found on YouTube Parisian evolution Here, the population of individuals is considered as a society where the individuals collaborate toward a common goal. This is implemented using an evolutionary algorithm that includes all the common genetic operators (e.g. mutation, cross-over, selection). The main difference is in the fitness function. Here two levels of fitness function are used: A local fitness function to assess the performance of a given individual (usually used during the selection process). A global fitness function to assess the performance of the whole population. Maximising (or minimising depending on the problem considered) this global fitness is the goal of the population. In addition, a diversity mechanism is required to avoid individuals gathering in only a few areas of the search space. Another difference is in the extraction of the problem solution once the evolutionary loop terminates. In classical evolutionary approaches, the best individual corresponds to the solution and the rest of the population is discarded. Here, all the individuals (or individuals of a sub-group of the population) are collated to build the problem solution. The way the fitness functions are constructed and the way the solution extraction is made are of course problem-dependent. Examples of Parisian Evolution applications include: The Fly algorithm. Text-mining. Hand gesture recognition. Modelling complex interactions in industrial agrifood process. Positron Emission Tomography reconstruction. Disambiguation Parisian approach vs cooperative coevolution Cooperative coevolution is a broad class of evolutionary algorithms where a complex problem is solved by decomposing it into subcomponents that are solved independently. The Parisian approach shares many similarities with the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm. The Parisian approach makes use of a single-population whereas multi-species may be used in cooperative coevolutionary algorithm. Similar internal evolutionary engines are considered in classical evolutionary algorithm, cooperative coevolutionary algorithm and Parisian evolution. The difference between cooperative coevolutionary algorithm and Parisian evolution resides in the population's semantics. Cooperative coevolutionary algorithm divides a big problem into sub-problems (groups of individuals) and solves them separately toward the big problem. There is no interaction/breeding between individuals of the different sub-populations, only with individuals of the same sub-population. However, Parisian evolutionary algorithms solve a whole problem as a big component. All population's individuals cooperate together to drive the whole population toward attractive areas of the search space. Fly Algorithm vs particle swarm optimisation Cooperative coevolution and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) share many similarities. PSO is inspired by the social behaviour of bird flocking or fish schooling. It was initially introduced as a tool for realistic animation in computer graphics. It uses complex individuals that interact with each other in order to build visually realistic collective behaviours through adjusting the individuals' behavioural rules (which may use random generators). In mathematical optimisation, every particle of the swarm somehow follows its own random path biased toward the best particle of the swarm. In the Fly Algorithm, the flies aim at building spatial representations of a scene from actual sensor data; flies do not communicate or explicitly cooperate, and do not us
