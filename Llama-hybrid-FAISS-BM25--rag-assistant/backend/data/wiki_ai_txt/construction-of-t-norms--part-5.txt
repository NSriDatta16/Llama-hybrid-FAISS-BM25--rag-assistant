ade t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to p.. Mayor–Torrens t-norms, introduced by Gaspar Mayor and Joan Torrens in the early 1990s, are the ordinal sums of the Łukasiewicz t-norm on [0, p] for a parameter p in [0, 1] and the (default) minimum t-norm on the rest of the unit interval. The family of Mayor–Torrens t-norms is decreasing and continuous with respect to p.. Rotations The construction of t-norms by rotation was introduced by Sándor Jenei (2000). It is based on the following theorem: Let T be a left-continuous t-norm without zero divisors, N: [0, 1] → [0, 1] the function that assigns 1 − x to x and t = 0.5. Let T1 be the linear transformation of T into [t, 1] and R T 1 ( x , y ) = sup { z ∣ T 1 ( z , x ) ≤ y } . {\displaystyle R_{T_{1}}(x,y)=\sup\{z\mid T_{1}(z,x)\leq y\}.} Then the function T r o t = { T 1 ( x , y ) if x , y ∈ ( t , 1 ] N ( R T 1 ( x , N ( y ) ) ) if x ∈ ( t , 1 ] and y ∈ [ 0 , t ] N ( R T 1 ( y , N ( x ) ) ) if x ∈ [ 0 , t ] and y ∈ ( t , 1 ] 0 if x , y ∈ [ 0 , t ] {\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {rot} }={\begin{cases}T_{1}(x,y)&{\text{if }}x,y\in (t,1]\\N(R_{T_{1}}(x,N(y)))&{\text{if }}x\in (t,1]{\text{ and }}y\in [0,t]\\N(R_{T_{1}}(y,N(x)))&{\text{if }}x\in [0,t]{\text{ and }}y\in (t,1]\\0&{\text{if }}x,y\in [0,t]\end{cases}}} is a left-continuous t-norm, called the rotation of the t-norm T. Geometrically, the construction can be described as first shrinking the t-norm T to the interval [0.5, 1] and then rotating it by the angle 2π/3 in both directions around the line connecting the points (0, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0). The theorem can be generalized by taking for N any strong negation, that is, an involutive strictly decreasing continuous function on [0, 1], and for t taking the unique fixed point of N. The resulting t-norm enjoys the following rotation invariance property with respect to N: T(x, y) ≤ z if and only if T(y, N(z)) ≤ N(x) for all x, y, z in [0, 1]. The negation induced by Trot is the function N, that is, N(x) = Rrot(x, 0) for all x, where Rrot is the residuum of Trot.
