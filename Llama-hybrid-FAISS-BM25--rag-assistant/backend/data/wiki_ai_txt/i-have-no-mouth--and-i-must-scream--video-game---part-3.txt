s should the computers ever regain consciousness. Should the human intruder fail to disable AM properly before facing it, however, AM will punish them by transforming the character into an immobile blob (referred to in-game as a "great, soft jelly thing") with no mouth that cannot harm itself or others and must spend eternity with AM in this form. Endings The game can end in seven different ways depending on how the finale is completed. AM wins, using Nimdok's research to turn the last character played into an immobile blob with each character quoting a different part of the final section of the original short story. AM joins with the Russian and Chinese supercomputers, reawakens and tortures the 750 humans on Luna. As in the first ending, the character responsible for this is turned into an immobile blob and quotes a part of the final lines of the short story. AM is made harmless with the help of the humans, but the Russian and Chinese supercomputers take over in its stead. As consolation, they allow AM to choose what to do to the humans, and AM turns the last character played into an immobile blob as in the previous two endings. The player gives the Totem of Entropy to Surgat, one of AM's servants. He activates it, killing the Russian and Chinese supercomputers, and then AM turns the player into a great soft jelly thing. The human invokes the Totem of Entropy in front of the Russian and Chinese supercomputers. AM tells the player that they did not earn its mercy, then turns them into an immobile blob. The player disables either the id, superego, or both, then invokes the Totem of Entropy. This ends with the player monitoring the computers, but the ego kills the 750 humans. AM and the Chinese and Russian supercomputers are destroyed and the 750 humans cryogenically frozen on Luna are reawakened to begin the rebirth of humanity; Earth is terraformed to become a habitable environment, with the overseer being the last character played. It is possible to prevent the physical bodies of the protagonists from being destroyed if Nimdok is the first to go face AM, but even so, some dialogue from the Chinese and Russian supercomputers suggests that they may have died when their digital counterparts were erased. Characters The characters have all been slightly altered from their original portrayals in the short story. The plot itself is not a direct adaptation but instead focuses on the individual characters' psychodramas which are the scenarios that make up the game. Notably, none of the characters interact with one another and eventually only one of them will be able to defeat AM. Gorrister – Gorrister is suicidal due to the guilt of having had his wife committed to a mental institution. Gorrister finds himself on board a zeppelin over a desert with signs of a struggle, and a gaping hole in his own chest where his heart used to be. AM offers him the chance to finally kill himself, but sabotages all his means of doing so. In his scenario, Gorrister learns that his mother-in-law Edna also felt responsible for driving his wife insane despite previously hounding him for it and learns to bury the past. Benny – Benny has been the most heavily altered from the original story. Although he has an ape-like appearance, just as in the short story, his past as a homosexual scientist is entirely altered and he does not have the giant sex organs. In the game Benny was an overly demanding military officer who ends up killing members of his unit for failing to meet his expectations (with the game also implying that he might have cannibalized them). Benny's psychodrama places him in a stone-aged community where the villagers draw a lottery to decide which of them will be sacrificed to AM. Benny obsesses over food and eating—but is incapable of chewing anything he finds. AM had severely damaged Benny's brain but restores it for the scenario so that he can think clearly again—then AM cripples Benny's body so he cannot act on any thoughts he has. Eventual
