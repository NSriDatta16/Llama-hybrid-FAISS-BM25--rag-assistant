wledge base K {\displaystyle K} generates the knowledge base K ∪ { ¬ f | f ∈ F } {\displaystyle K\cup \{\neg f~|~f\in F\}} . The set F {\displaystyle F} of formulae that are free for negation in K {\displaystyle K} can be defined in different ways, leading to different formalizations of the closed-world assumption. The following are the definitions of f {\displaystyle f} being free for negation in the various formalizations. CWA (closed-world assumption) f {\displaystyle f} is a positive literal not entailed by K {\displaystyle K} ; GCWA (generalized CWA) f {\displaystyle f} is a positive literal such that, for every positive clause c {\displaystyle c} such that K ⊬ c {\displaystyle K\not \vdash c} , it holds K ⊬ c ∨ f {\displaystyle K\not \vdash c\vee f} ; EGCWA (extended GCWA) same as above, but f {\displaystyle f} is a conjunction of positive literals; CCWA (careful CWA) same as GCWA, but a positive clause is only considered if it is composed of positive literals of a given set and (both positive and negative) literals from another set; ECWA (extended CWA) similar to CCWA, but f {\displaystyle f} is an arbitrary formula not containing literals from a given set. The ECWA and the formalism of circumscription coincide on propositional theories. The complexity of query answering (checking whether a formula is entailed by another one under the closed-world assumption) is typically in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy for general formulae, and ranges from P to coNP for Horn formulae. Checking whether the original closed-world assumption introduces an inconsistency requires at most a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle; however, the exact complexity of this problem is not currently known. In situations where it is not possible to assume a closed world for all predicates, yet some of them are known to be closed, the partial-closed world assumption can be used. This regime considers knowledge bases generally to be open, i.e., potentially incomplete, yet allows to use completeness assertions to specify parts of the knowledge base that are closed. Partial-closed world assumption The language of logic programs with strong negation allows us to postulate the closed-world assumption for some statements and leave the other statements in the realm of the open-world assumption. An intermediate ground between OWA and CWA is provided by the partial-closed world assumption (PCWA). Under the PCWA, the knowledge base is generally treated under open-world semantics, yet it is possible to assert parts that should be treated under closed-world semantics, via completeness assertions. The PCWA is especially needed for situations where the CWA is not applicable due to an open domain, yet the OWA is too credulous in allowing anything to be possibly true.
