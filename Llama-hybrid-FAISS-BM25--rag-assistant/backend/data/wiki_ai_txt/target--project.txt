Target is the name of a collaborative research project specialising in big data processing and management in northern Netherlands. It is a public-private cooperation, initiated in 2009 and supported by government subsidies. It is run by a consortium of ten academic and computer industry partners, coordinated by the University of Groningen, and researches data management of science projects in the areas of astronomy, life sciences, artificial intelligence and medical diagnosis. Cooperating in the Target project are various divisions of the University of Groningen, its medical center, IBM, Oracle, ASTRON and Dutch IT firms Elkoog/Heeii and Nspyre. Target's computer center is hosted by the Center for Information Technology, the computing center of the University of Groningen, and consist of more than 10 petabytes of storage based on IBM's GPFS storage technology, a high-performance computing cluster and a grid cluster, which is a part of the European Grid Infrastructure. History The project was initiated to transfer expertise of astronomers in massive data processing to other areas of science. Target builds on a distributed computing environment called Astro-WISE. Astro-WISE itself originated as an initiative of the OPTICON Wide Field Imaging Working Group, which was set up to consider a standardised European survey system to facilitate research, data reduction and data mining using data from the new generation of wide field survey cameras. The Target project launched in 2009 after receiving 32 million euros of funding for a period of five years from the European Fund for Regional Development, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs ("Pieken in de Delta" project), and the provinces of Groningen and Drenthe. The project runs under the auspices of the Northern Netherlands Provinces Alliance (SNN) and the Groningen municipality. Technological findings At the start of the project, one aim was to develop a single integrated processing system, consisting of a multi-petabyte scale file system and several different types of grid and compute clusters. During the first few years, it became apparent that different e-Science disciplines have different data processing requirements. In some areas, a massive data streaming effort takes place, as in Lofar. In astronomy, the number of data objects may run in the billions, with a limited number of data columns. In genomics, only a small number of rows are needed, but the number of columns can range in the hundreds of thousands. Other areas, such as visual text retrieval in the Monk search engine for historical manuscripts, are at an intermediate position, with hundreds of millions of rows and thousands of dimensions. Furthermore, genomics applications often require stringent access control, whereas other disciplines do not need to prioritize privacy. Consequently, the various sub-projects within Target adopted a pragmatic approach on which aspects of the WISE technology and components of the Target hardware infrastructure were applicable to their specific field. Projects Target participates in a number of data-intensive scientific projects in astronomy, Big Data visualization (collaboration with the eScience center in Amsterdam), handwritten text recognition algorithms, medical research on healthy aging, development of diagnostic tools for Parkinson's disease, and more. LOFAR Long-term Archive Much of the data from the LOFAR telescope is stored, accessed from, and archived on the LOFAR Long-Term archive, designed by ASTRON and Target. The data will be hosted at the Target data center and several other European centers. Monk Monk is a system that was developed by Schomaker and his group at the Artificial Intelligence Institute (ALICE) at the University of Groningen. It uses pattern-recognition and machine-learning algorithms for handwritten text recognition in a variety of existing archives. Currently a number of books from the Dutch National Archives, as well as more than 70 international historica
