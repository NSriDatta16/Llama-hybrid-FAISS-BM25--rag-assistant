 the ethical and societal questions raised by artificial intelligence featuring prominent philosopher Nick Bostrom as advisor. In October 2017, DeepMind launched a new research team to investigate AI ethics. In December 2019, co-founder Suleyman announced he would be leaving DeepMind to join Google, working in a policy role. In March 2024, Microsoft appointed him as the EVP and CEO of its newly created consumer AI unit, Microsoft AI. In April 2023, DeepMind merged with Google AI's Google Brain division to form Google DeepMind, as part of the company's continued efforts to accelerate work on AI in response to OpenAI's ChatGPT. This marked the end of a years-long struggle from DeepMind executives to secure greater autonomy from Google. Products and technologies As of 2020, DeepMind has published over a thousand papers, including thirteen papers that were accepted by Nature or Science. DeepMind received media attention during the AlphaGo period; according to a LexisNexis search, 1842 published news stories mentioned DeepMind in 2016, declining to 1363 in 2019. Games Unlike earlier AIs, such as IBM's Deep Blue or Watson, which were developed for a pre-defined purpose and only function within that scope, DeepMind's initial algorithms were intended to be general. They used reinforcement learning, an algorithm that learns from experience using only raw pixels as data input. Their initial approach used deep Q-learning with a convolutional neural network. They tested the system on video games, notably early arcade games, such as Space Invaders or Breakout. Without altering the code, the same AI was able to play certain games more efficiently than any human ever could. In July 2018, researchers from DeepMind trained one of its systems to play the computer game Quake III Arena. In 2013, DeepMind published research on an AI system that surpassed human abilities in games such as Pong, Breakout and Enduro, while surpassing state of the art performance on Seaquest, Beamrider, and Q*bert. This work reportedly led to the company's acquisition by Google. DeepMind's AI had been applied to video games made in the 1970s and 1980s; work was ongoing for more complex 3D games such as Quake, which first appeared in the 1990s. In 2020, DeepMind published Agent57, an AI Agent which surpasses human level performance on all 57 games of the Atari 2600 suite. In July 2022, DeepMind announced the development of DeepNash, a model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning system capable of playing the board game Stratego at the level of a human expert. AlphaGo and successors In October 2015, a computer Go program called AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the European Go champion Fan Hui, a 2 dan (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five to zero. This was the first time an artificial intelligence (AI) defeated a professional Go player. Previously, computers were only known to have played Go at "amateur" level. Go is considered much more difficult for computers to win compared to other games like chess, due to the much larger number of possibilities, making it prohibitively difficult for traditional AI methods such as brute-force. In March 2016 it beat Lee Sedol, one of the highest ranked players in the world, with a score of 4 to 1 in a five-game match. In the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie, who had been the world's highest-ranked player for two years. In 2017, an improved version, AlphaGo Zero, defeated AlphaGo in a hundred out of a hundred games. Later that year, AlphaZero, a modified version of AlphaGo Zero, gained superhuman abilities at chess and shogi. In 2019, DeepMind released a new model named MuZero that mastered the domains of Go, chess, shogi, and Atari 2600 games without human data, domain knowledge, or known rules. AlphaGo technology was developed based on deep reinforcement learning, making it different from the AI technologies then on the market. The data fed into the AlphaGo algorithm consisted of various
