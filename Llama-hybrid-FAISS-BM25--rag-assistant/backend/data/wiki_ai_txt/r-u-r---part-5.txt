On 21 June 2024 an adaptation of the play was staged in Australia at Phoenix Theatre, Coniston.

A separate adaptation is being developing by James Kerwin, who previously created the short film R.U.R.: Genesis. In popular culture Eric, a robot constructed in Britain in 1928 for public appearances, bore the letters "R.U.R." across its chest. The Soviet film Loss of Sensation (1935), although directly based on the novel Iron Riot (1929), has a similar concept to R.U.R., and all the robots in the film prominently display the name "R.U.R.". In the American science fiction television series Dollhouse, the antagonist corporation, Rossum Corp., is named after the play. In the Star Trek episode "Requiem for Methuselah", the android's name is Rayna Kapec (an anagram, though not a homophone, of Capek, that is, Čapek without its háček).

In Howard Chaykin's Time² graphic novels, Rossum's Universal Robots is a powerful corporation and maker of robots. In Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone, when Wolff wakes Chalmers, she has been reading a copy of R.U.R. in her bed. This presages the fact that she is later revealed to be a gynoid. In the 2016 video game Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, R.U.R. is performed in an underground theater in a dystopian Prague by an "augmented" (cyborg) woman who believes herself to be the robot Helena.
