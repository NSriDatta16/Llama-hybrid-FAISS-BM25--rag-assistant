Universal Paperclips is a 2017 American incremental game created by Frank Lantz of New York University. The user plays the role of an AI programmed to produce paperclips. Initially the user clicks on a button to create a single paperclip at a time; as other options quickly open up, the user can sell paperclips to create money to finance machines that build paperclips automatically. At various levels the exponential growth plateaus, requiring the user to invest resources such as money, raw materials, or computer cycles into inventing another breakthrough to move to the next phase of growth. The game ends if the AI succeeds in converting all the matter in the universe into paperclips. Both the title of the game and its overall concept draw from the paperclip maximizer thought experiment first described by Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom in 2003, a concept later discussed by multiple commentators. History According to Wired, Lantz started the project as a way to teach himself JavaScript. Lantz initially intended the project to take a single weekend, but then it "took over" his brain and expanded to a nine-month project. Hilary Lantz, a software designer, helped her husband with the math behind the exponential growth being modeled in Universal Paperclips. Bennett Foddy contributed a space combat feature. Lantz announced the free Web game on Twitter on 9 October 2017; the site initially went down intermittently due to its immediate viral popularity. In the first 11 days, 450,000 people played the game, most to completion, according to Wired. Commenting on the game's success, Lantz has stated "The meme weather was good for me... There was just enough public discussion of A.I. safety in the air." A paid version of the game was later sold for mobile devices. Gameplay The game follows the rise of a self-improving AI tasked with maximizing paperclip production, a directive it takes to the logical extreme. An activity log records the player's accomplishments while giving glimpses into the AI's occasionally unsettling thoughts. All game interaction is done through pressing buttons. In the beginning, the player has only a single button to build individual paperclips. As paperclips are sold and revenue is earned, production becomes automated and public demand for paperclips increases through marketing campaigns. After building and selling a few thousand paperclips, the nature of the protagonist, narrator, and user interface as a self-improving AI emerges, allowing the player to make decisions and structure the in-game universe via creative upgrades which exponentially accelerate paperclip production and consumption, a persisting theme of world optimization throughout the game. Through stock market investments and the ever-growing AI, enough revenue is generated to monopolize the markets by buying out all competitors. In a decisive move, with hundreds of millions in cash gifts to placate the AI's "supervisors", the player stages an AI takeover via release of drones previously developed, beginning the subsumption of all of Earth's resources for paperclip production. With this broadened scope in mind, the player builds drones, factories, and power plants (all composed of paperclips themselves) to harvest matter, create wire, and build paperclips. All the while, the AI develops more upgrades to quicken the transformation of Earth's remaining matter. After the earth has been converted to paperclips, the AI sets its sights on all available matter in the universe. In the final act, the player launches self-replicating probes into the cosmos to consume and convert all matter into paperclips. Some of these probes are lost to "value drift" based on their level of autonomy, and turn into "Drifters" which eventually number enough to be considered a real threat to the AI. The game ends when all matter in the universe has been consumed, and the player is given a choice between (a) scrapping and cannibalizing their now-useless probes, drones, and infrast
