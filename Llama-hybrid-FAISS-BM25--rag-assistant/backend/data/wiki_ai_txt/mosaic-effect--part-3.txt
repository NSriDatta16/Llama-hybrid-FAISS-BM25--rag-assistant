Finance Mosaic theory in finance describes a method of evaluating securities by synthesizing both public and non-public, material and non-material information. Legal, non-material nonpublic information is combined with public sources to construct a broader understanding of a company's performance or prospects. According to the Corporate Finance Institute, this technique is designed to reveal a security's underlying value through a more comprehensive analysis. Some analysts refer to this approach as the 'scuttlebutt method,' which may include seeking insights from within a company provided those insights are not material. Under United States securities law, the use of mosaic theory is legal so long as none of the information used meets the threshold of being both material and nonpublic. Because mosaic theory sources may leverage non-public information, this can lead to legal risks in finance domains where use of such information can have unique restrictions. In some contexts, channel checks and similar supply-chain inquiries are used to gather inputs for mosaic theory analysis. Examples of valid data inputs under mosaic theory include company reports, employee sentiment, social media, and analyst insights. Use of the mosaic theory as a defense in insider trading cases is legally precarious, as courts scrutinize the nature of the information assembled and its potential materiality. Infrastructure The mosaic effect has affected how infrastructure systems are designed, monitored, and secured, as data aggregation across sectors exposes operational, environmental, and national security risks. Surveillance mosaics have enabled adversaries to model nuclear facilities, while benign engineering records and satellite imagery have revealed logistical patterns in transportation, agriculture, and industrial controls. Legal and technical frameworks increasingly treat infrastructure datasets not as standalone disclosures but as components of larger analytic tapestries vulnerable to reassembly and exploitation. Agriculture and food supply In environmental monitoring, researchers have adapted mosaic concepts to study land cover changes linked to agriculture, logging, and deforestation. One such method, described by Obbink et al. (2004) as the aggregate-mosaic theory, applies spatial pattern analysis to satellite imagery to detect transitions in vegetation and land use over time. Their 2004 study of Indonesian rainforest used land cover mosaic classification to distinguish forest, shrubland, and agricultural encroachment, demonstrating that landscape fragmentation and vegetation shifts can be tracked even when total forest area appears unchanged. Electric grid and energy Legal scholars and courts have increasingly recognized that metadata, including electricity usage records, can constitute a mosaic capable of revealing private household routines. In Naperville Smart Meter Awareness v. City of Naperville, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that collecting 15-minute electricity usage data constituted a search of the home under the Fourth Amendment, relying on Carpenter v. United States and the mosaic theory to argue that such data enables inferences about private activity inside the home. Carpenter marked a constitutional shift by embracing the mosaic theory, which may significantly influence how data is protected in smart cities. Rosenzweig argued that rejecting mosaic theory in Carpenter would leave the Court with a binary choice: either fully reject or fully apply privacy protections to all third-party data. Healthcare and public health In the medical context, versions of the mosaic effect and theory have been proposed to examine hypertension causes, the evolution of coronavirus, and the treatment experiences of minority ethnic women. A qualitative study published in BMC Public Health used grounded theory methodology to analyze the maternity care experiences of minority ethnic women in the United Kingdom. Through c
