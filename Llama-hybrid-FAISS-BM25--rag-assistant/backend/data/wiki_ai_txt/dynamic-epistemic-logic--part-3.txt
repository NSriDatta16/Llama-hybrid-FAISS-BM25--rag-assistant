isplaystyle i} will not feel safe to drive on the right because he might consider that the agent j {\displaystyle j} , not knowing p {\displaystyle p} , could drive on the left. To avoid this problem, we could then assume that everybody knows that everybody knows that p {\displaystyle p} (formally E E p {\displaystyle EEp} ). This is again not enough to ensure that everybody feels safe to drive on the right. Indeed, it might still be possible that agent i {\displaystyle i} considers possible that agent j {\displaystyle j} considers possible that agent i {\displaystyle i} does not know p {\displaystyle p} (formally ¬ K i K j K i p {\displaystyle \neg K_{i}K_{j}K_{i}p} ). In that case and from i {\displaystyle i} ’s point of view, j {\displaystyle j} considers possible that i {\displaystyle i} , not knowing p {\displaystyle p} , will drive on the left. So from i {\displaystyle i} ’s point of view, j {\displaystyle j} might drive on the left as well (by the same argument as above). So i {\displaystyle i} will not feel safe to drive on the right. Reasoning by induction, Lewis showed that for any k ∈ N {\displaystyle k\in \mathbb {N} } , E p ∧ E 1 p ∧ … ∧ E k p {\displaystyle Ep\land E^{1}p\land \ldots \land E^{k}p} is not enough for the drivers to feel safe to drive on the right. In fact what we need is an infinite conjunction. In other words, we need common knowledge of p {\displaystyle p} : C p {\displaystyle Cp} . Distributed knowledge. Distributed knowledge of ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } means that if the agents pulled their knowledge altogether, they would know that ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } holds. In other words, the knowledge of ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } is distributed among the agents. The formula D A ϕ {\displaystyle D_{A}\phi } reads as ‘it is distributed knowledge among the set of agents A {\displaystyle A} that ϕ {\displaystyle \phi } holds’. Semantics Epistemic logic is a modal logic. So, what we call an epistemic model M = ( W , R 1 , … , R n , I ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}=(W,R_{1},\ldots ,R_{n},I)} is just a Kripke model as defined in modal logic. The set W {\displaystyle W} is a non-empty set whose elements are called possible worlds and the interpretation I : W → 2 P R O P {\displaystyle I:W\rightarrow 2^{PROP}} is a function specifying which propositional facts (such as ‘Ann has the red card’) are true in each of these worlds. The accessibility relations R j ⊆ W × W {\displaystyle R_{j}\subseteq W\times W} are binary relations for each agent j ∈ A G T S {\displaystyle j\in AGTS} ; they are intended to capture the uncertainty of each agent (about the actual world and about the other agents' uncertainty). Intuitively, we have ( w , v ) ∈ R j {\displaystyle (w,v)\in R_{j}} when the world v {\displaystyle v} is compatible with agent j {\displaystyle j} ’s information in world w {\displaystyle w} or, in other words, when agent j {\displaystyle j} considers that world v {\displaystyle v} might correspond to the world w {\displaystyle w} (from this standpoint). We abusively write w ∈ M {\displaystyle w\in {\mathcal {M}}} for w ∈ W {\displaystyle w\in W} and R j ( w ) {\displaystyle R_{j}(w)} denotes the set of worlds { v ∈ W ; ( w , v ) ∈ R j } {\displaystyle \{v\in W;(w,v)\in R_{j}\}} . Intuitively, a pointed epistemic model ( M , w ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {M}},w)} , where w ∈ M {\displaystyle w\in {\mathcal {M}}} , represents from an external point of view how the actual world w {\displaystyle w} is perceived by the agents A G T S {\displaystyle {AGTS}} . For every epistemic model M {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}} , every w ∈ M {\displaystyle w\in {\mathcal {M}}} and every ϕ ∈ L EL {\displaystyle \phi \in {\mathcal {L}}_{\textsf {EL}}} , we define M , w ⊨ ϕ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}},w\models \phi } inductively by the following truth conditions: where ( ⋃ j ∈ A R j ) + {\displaystyle \left({\underset {j\in A}{\bigcup }}R_{j}\right)^{+}} is the transitive closure of ⋃ j ∈ A R j {\displaystyle {\underset {j\in A}{\bi
