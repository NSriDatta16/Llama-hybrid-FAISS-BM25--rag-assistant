 1.694)^{1/4}=0.830} to get the estimated parameters p = [0.516, 1.413, 0.672, 2.041]. To improve the estimates further, we repeat the process, using the new p values. For example, p 1 = 2 ⋅ 1.413 0.516 + 1.413 + 0 ⋅ 0.672 0.516 + 0.672 + 1 ⋅ 2.041 0.516 + 2.041 3 ⋅ 1 0.516 + 1.413 + 0 ⋅ 1 0.516 + 0.672 + 4 ⋅ 1 0.516 + 2.041 = 0.725. {\displaystyle p_{1}={\frac {2\cdot {\frac {1.413}{0.516+1.413}}+0\cdot {\frac {0.672}{0.516+0.672}}+1\cdot {\frac {2.041}{0.516+2.041}}}{3\cdot {\frac {1}{0.516+1.413}}+0\cdot {\frac {1}{0.516+0.672}}+4\cdot {\frac {1}{0.516+2.041}}}}=0.725.} Repeating this process for the remaining parameters and normalizing, we get p = [0.677, 1.034, 0.624, 2.287]. Repeating a further 10 times gives rapid convergence toward a final solution of p = [0.640, 1.043, 0.660, 2.270]. This indicates that Team D is the strongest and Team B the second strongest, while Teams A and C are nearly equal in strength but below Teams B and D. In this way the Bradley–Terry model lets us infer the relationship between all four teams, even though not all teams have played each other. Variations Crowd-BT The Crowd-BT model, developed in 2013 by Chen et al, attempts to extend the standard Bradley–Terry model for crowdsourced settings while reducing the number of comparisons needed by taking into account the reliability of each judge. In particular, it identifies and excludes judges presumed to be spammers (selecting choices at random) or malicious (selecting always the wrong choice). In a crowdsourced task of ranking documents by reading difficulty with 624 judges contributing up to 40 pairwise comparisons each, Crowd-BT was shown to outperform both standard Bradley–Terry as well as ranking system TrueSkill. It has been recommended for use when quality results are valued over efficiency and the number of comparisons is high.
