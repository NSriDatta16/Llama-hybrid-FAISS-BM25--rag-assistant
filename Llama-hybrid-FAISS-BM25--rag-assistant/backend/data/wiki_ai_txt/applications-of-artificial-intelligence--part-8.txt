ts from among the more than 800 medicines and vaccines. Its goal is to memorize all the relevant papers to predict which (combinations of) drugs will be most effective for each patient. Myeloid leukemia is one target. Another study reported on an AI that was as good as doctors in identifying skin cancers. Another project monitors multiple high-risk patients by asking each patient questions based on data acquired from doctor/patient interactions. In one study done with transfer learning, an AI diagnosed eye conditions similar to an ophthalmologist and recommended treatment referrals. Another study demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel judged better than a surgeon. Artificial neural networks are used as clinical decision support systems for medical diagnosis, such as in concept processing technology in EMR software. Other healthcare tasks thought suitable for an AI that are in development include: Screening Companion robots for elder care Drug creation (e.g. by identifying candidate drugs and by using existing drug screening data such as in life extension research) Clinical training Identifying genomic pathogen signatures of novel pathogens or identifying pathogens via physics-based fingerprints (including pandemic pathogens) Helping link genes to their functions, otherwise analyzing genes and identification of novel biological targets Help development of biomarkers Help tailor therapies to individuals in personalized medicine/precision medicine Workplace health and safety AI-enabled chatbots decrease the need for humans to perform basic call center tasks, and machine learning in sentiment analysis can spot fatigue in order to prevent overwork. Decision support systems can potentially prevent industrial disasters and make disaster response more efficient. For manual workers in material handling, predictive analytics has been proposed to reduce musculoskeletal injury. AI can attempt to process workers' compensation claims. AI has been proposed for detection of accident near misses, which are underreported. Biochemistry Machine learning has been used for drug design, drug discovery and development, drug repurposing, improving pharmaceutical productivity, and clinical trials. Computer-planned syntheses via computational reaction networks, described as a platform that combines "computational synthesis with AI algorithms to predict molecular properties", has been used in drug-syntheses, and developing routes for recycling 200 industrial waste chemicals into important drugs and agrochemicals (chemical synthesis design). It has also been used to explore the origins of life on Earth. Deep learning has been used with databases for the development of a 46-day process to design, synthesize and test a drug which inhibits enzymes of a particular gene, DDR1. DDR1 is involved in cancers and fibrosis which is one reason for the high-quality datasets that enabled these results. The AI program AlphaFold 2 can determine the 3D structure of a (folded) protein in hours rather than the months required by earlier automated approaches and was used to provide the likely structures of all proteins in the human body and essentially all proteins known to science (more than 200 million). Language processing Language translation Speech translation technology attempts to convert one language's spoken words into another language. This potentially reduces language barriers in global commerce and cross-cultural exchange, enabling speakers of various languages to communicate with one another. AI has been used to automatically translate spoken language and textual content in products such as Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, and DeepL Translator. Additionally, research and development are in progress to decode and conduct animal communication. Meaning is conveyed not only by text, but also through usage and context (see semantics and pragmatics). A
