eplacing multiple denoising algorithms with a single AI model trained on five times more data than DLSS 3. Ray Reconstruction is available on all RTX GPUs and first targeted games with path tracing (aka "full ray tracing"), including Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC, Portal with RTX, and Alan Wake 2. DLSS 4.0 The fourth generation of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) was unveiled alongside the GeForce RTX 50 series. DLSS 4 upscaling uses a new vision transformer-based model for enhanced image quality with reduced ghosting and greater image stability in motion compared to the previous convolutional neural network (CNN) model. DLSS 4 allows a greater number of frames to be generated and interpolated based on a single traditionally rendered frame. This form of frame generation called Multi Frame Generation is exclusive to the GeForce RTX 50 series while the GeForce RTX 40 series is limited to one interpolated frame per traditionally rendered frame. According to Nvidia, this technique will increase performance by up to 800% while retaining low latency with Nvidia Reflex. Nvidia claims that DLSS 4x Frame Generation model uses 30% less video memory with the example of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide using 400MB less memory at 4K resolution with Frame Generation enabled. Nvidia claims that 75 games will integrate DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation at launch, including Alan Wake 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Star Wars Outlaws. Manually upgrading DLSS support Users can manually replace the DLLs in games to support a newer version of DLSS. DLSS Swapper, an open source utility, can automatically do this for all installed games. Replacing DLL files can not add DLSS support or features to games that do not already implement them, though some mods can add frame generation support. Anti-aliasing DLSS requires and applies its own anti-aliasing method. Thus, depending on the game and quality setting used, using DLSS may improve image quality even over native resolution rendering. It operates on similar principles to TAA. Like TAA, it uses information from past frames to produce the current frame. Unlike TAA, DLSS does not sample every pixel in every frame. Instead, it samples different pixels in different frames and uses pixels sampled in past frames to fill in the unsampled pixels in the current frame. DLSS uses machine learning to combine samples in the current frame and past frames, and it can be thought of as an advanced and superior TAA implementation made possible by the available tensor cores. Nvidia also offers Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing (DLAA), which provides the same AI-driven anti-aliasing DLSS uses, but without any upscaling or downscaling. Architecture With the exception of the shader-core version implemented in Control, DLSS is only available on GeForce RTX 20, GeForce RTX 30, GeForce RTX 40, GeForce RTX 50, and Quadro RTX series of video cards, using dedicated AI accelerators called Tensor Cores. Tensor Cores are available since the Nvidia Volta GPU microarchitecture, which was first used on the Tesla V100 line of products. They are used for doing fused multiply-add (FMA) operations that are used extensively in neural network calculations for applying a large series of multiplications on weights, followed by the addition of a bias. Tensor cores can operate on FP16, INT8, INT4, and INT1 data types. Each core can do 1024 bits of FMA operations per clock, so 1024 INT1, 256 INT4, 128 INT8, and 64 FP16 operations per clock per tensor core, and most Turing GPUs have a few hundred tensor cores. The Tensor Cores use CUDA Warp-Level Primitives on 32 parallel threads to take advantage of their parallel architecture. A Warp is a set of 32 threads which are configured to execute the same instruction. Since Windows 10 version 1903, Microsoft Windows provided DirectML as one part of DirectX to support Tensor Cores.
