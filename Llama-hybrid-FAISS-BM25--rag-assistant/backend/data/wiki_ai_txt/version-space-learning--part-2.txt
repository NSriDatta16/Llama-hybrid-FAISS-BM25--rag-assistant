ribed because the available feature set fails to disambiguate objects belonging to different categories. The version space framework focuses on the (classical induction) case where the ambiguity is introduced by an impoverished data set. That is, the target concept cannot be decisively described because the available data fails to uniquely pick out a hypothesis. Naturally, both types of ambiguity can occur in the same learning problem.] Inductive reasoning. [On the general problem of induction.] References Hong, Tzung-Pai; Shian-Shyong Tsang (1997).
