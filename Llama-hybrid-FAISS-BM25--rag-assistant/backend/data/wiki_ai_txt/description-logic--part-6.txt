These are some of the most popular: CEL is an open source LISP-based reasoner (Apache 2.0 License). Cerebra Engine was a commercial C++-based reasoner, acquired in 2006 by webMethods. FaCT++ is a free open-source C++-based reasoner. KAON2 is a free (for non-commercial use) Java-based reasoner, offering fast reasoning support for OWL ontologies. MSPASS is a free open-source C reasoner for numerous DL models. Pellet is a dual-licensed (AGPL and proprietary) commercial, Java-based reasoner. RacerPro of Racer Systems was a commercial (free trials and research licenses are available) lisp-based reasoner, today both an open source version of RACER exists from the original developers at Lübeck University using the BSD 3 license, and also a commercialized version, still named RacerPro by Franz Inc. Sim-DL is a free open-source Java-based reasoner for the language ALCHQ. It also provides a similarity measurement functionality between concepts. To access this functionality a Protégé plugin can be used. HermiT is an open-source reasoner based on the "hypertableau" calculus. It is developed by the University of Oxford. Owlready2 is a package for ontology-oriented programming in Python. It can load OWL 2.0 ontologies as Python objects, modify them, save them, and perform reasoning via HermiT (included). Owlready2 allows a transparent access to OWL ontologies (contrary to usual Java-based API). OWLAPY. OWLAPY is an open-source Python framework for creating, manipulating, and reasoning with OWL ontologies. It includes a built-in StructuralReasoner for efficient, lightweight reasoning and wrappers for well-known Java-based reasoners like HermiT, Pellet, JFact, and Openllet. Editors Protégé is a free, open-source ontology editor and a knowledge base framework, which can use DL reasoners offering DIG I
