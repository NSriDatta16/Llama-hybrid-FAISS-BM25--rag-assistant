ia. A faceted system focuses on the important, essential or persistent characteristics of content objects, helping it to be useful for categorization of fine-grained rapidly changing repositories. In faceted classification systems one does not have to know the name of the category into which an object is placed a priori. A controlled vocabulary is presented with the number of documents matching each vocabulary term. New facets may be created at any time without disruption of a single hierarchy or reorganizing other facets. Faceted classification systems make few assumptions about the scope and organization of the domain. It is difficult to break a faceted classification schema.
