 because for 30 years, I've been working for famous Hollywood filmmakers who come to me with another artist's work and say, 'See this picture from this movie? We want to do something like that'... The original movie already exists. We don't have to improve it." Post-release Peter Debruge of Variety was both intrigued by the immersive experience and disappointed by the results of AI-aided work on the film, saying: "Extremely high resolution is the enemy of this experience, I've decided, as it makes random details... pull our attention away from the characters. Meanwhile, the augmented reality aspects suggest the sky's the limit in terms of how creative people can get in reimagining classic movies." Debruge felt troubled by "whatever strange AI technique was used to replace Judy Garland's face with a poreless plastic sheen" and was distracted by crowd scenes in which "unblinking Munchkin extras stare into space for minutes on end", saying the characters landed in the uncanny valley. G. Allen Johnson of the San Francisco Chronicle said, "If it's possible to be both blown away — literally — and underwhelmed, the new version of 'The Wizard of Oz' accomplishes this rather dubious achievement." Johnson said the immersive sound mix would "likely bring tears to your eyes" but that the emotion on Garland's face was "muted by a waxy look". He judged that the "most head-scratching and unforgivable part... is the emotionless, synthetic sheen of its figures", believing the AI was best used for landscape scenes. Johnson believed that the tornado scene "alone might be worth the hefty price of admission", and thought it was best to view the film "not as a movie but as a theme park thrill ride akin to Disneyland's 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'" Melissa Ruggieri of USA Today said that the film was "nothing short of extraordinary", calling it a "gleaming spectacle that will move you – literally and emotionally". Ruggieri praised the intensity and realism of the tornado sequence, the emotion conjured by Garland's voice, and the "mesmerizing" facade of the Wizard. Alissa Wilkinson of The New York Times said that the film defied interpretation in just one manner. Assessing it from a cinematic perspective, she said: "Despite its presentation as such, it's not even really 'a movie.' And for long stretches, I was deeply unnerved." She believed the lack of a traditional visual frame negatively impacted the visual storytelling and that "Some generated performances seem robotic, others smoothed-over and inhuman". Wilkinson was upset by the reduced running time compared to the original film and concluded that the Sphere version, "in trying to straddle the line between 'experiential storytelling' and 'film,' does neither as well as it could, undercutting what it celebrates". Wilkinson was disconcerted by the film as a portent of how works of art could be altered, saying that it "suggests that in the future, every artist's choices could be reversed, altered or ripped to shreds, then presented by their corporate owners as if they're essentially the original, just zhuzhed up a bit for a new century". Amy Nicholson of the Los Angeles Times said that, "Despite my queasiness about cutting 'Oz' by half an hour, the experiment is a romp", finding the experience immersive and the foam apples and drone-piloted flying monkeys to be "giggle-inducing". Nicholson said the film "loses a dram of its spellcraft" once it reaches Munchkinland, criticizing the "cheesy martian" look of the Wizard's disembodied head and the glitchy appearance of the AI-generated extras; she singled out the hundreds of Emerald City citizens, waving distractingly without concern for Dorothy during a scene in which she pleads with the Wizard. Nicholson summarized: "Overall, you're so caught up observing the experience itself that the emotions of the story don’t register as anything more than theme-ride hydraulics."
