st: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century", a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the New York Times and the Boston Globe. A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that "the job is more in demand than ever with employers". The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland. In 2014, the American Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science. The professional title of "data scientist" has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report "Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection. Data science and data analysis In data science, data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modelling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), which uses graphics and descriptive statistics to explore patterns and generate hypotheses, and confirmatory data analysis, which applies statistical inference to test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty. Typical activities comprise: data collection and integration; data cleaning and preparation (handling missing values, outliers, encoding, normalisation); feature engineering and selection; visualisation and descriptive statistics; fitting and evaluating statistical or machine-learning models; communicating results and ensuring reproducibility (e.g., reports, notebooks, and dashboards). Lifecycle frameworks such as CRISP-DM describe these steps from business understanding through deployment and monitoring. Data science involves working with larger datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. Data science often uses statistical analysis, data preprocessing, and supervised learning. Cloud computing for data science Cloud computing can offer access to large amounts of computational power and storage. In big data, where volumes of information are continually generated and processed, these platforms can be used to handle complex and resource-intensive analytical tasks. Some distributed computing frameworks are designed to handle big data workloads. These frameworks can enable data scientists to process and analyze large datasets in parallel, which can reduce processing times. Ethical consideration in data science Data science involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data which often includes personal and sensitive information. Ethical concerns include potential privacy violations, bias perpetuation, and negative societal impacts. Machine learning models can amplify existing biases present in training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes.
