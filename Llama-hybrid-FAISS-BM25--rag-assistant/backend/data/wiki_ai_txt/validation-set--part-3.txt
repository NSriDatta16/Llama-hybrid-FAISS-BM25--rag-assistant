 of English) and to validate is to prove that something is valid ("To confirm; to render valid" Collaborative International Dictionary of English). With this perspective, the most common use of the terms test set and validation set is the one here described. However, in both industry and academia, they are sometimes used interchanged, by considering that the internal process is testing different models to improve (test set as a development set) and the final model is the one that needs to be validated before real use with an unseen data (validation set). "The literature on machine learning often reverses the meaning of 'validation' and 'test' sets. This is the most blatant example of the terminological confusion that pervades artificial intelligence research." Nevertheless, the important concept that must be kept is that the final set, whether called test or validation, should only be used in the final experiment. Cross-validation In order to get more stable results and use all valuable data for training, a data set can be repeatedly split into several training and a validation data sets. This is known as cross-validation. To confirm the model's performance, an additional test data set held out from cross-validation is normally used. It is possible to use cross-validation on training and validation sets, and within each training set have further cross-validation for a test set for hyperparameter tuning. This is known as nested cross-validation. Causes of error Omissions in the training of algorithms are a major cause of erroneous outputs. Types of such omissions include: Particular circumstances or variations were not included. Obsolete data Ambiguous input information Inability to change to new environments Inability to request help from a human or another AI system when needed An example of an omission of particular circumstances is a case where a boy was able to unlock the phone because his mother registered her face under indoor, nighttime lighting, a condition which was not appropriately included in the training of the system. Usage of relatively irrelevant input can include situations where algorithms use the background rather than the object of interest for object detection, such as being trained by pictures of sheep on grasslands, leading to a risk that a different object will be interpreted as a sheep if located on a grassland.
