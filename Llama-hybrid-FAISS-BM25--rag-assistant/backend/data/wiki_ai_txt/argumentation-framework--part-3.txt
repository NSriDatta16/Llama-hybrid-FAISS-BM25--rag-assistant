l). For these two methods to infer information, one can identify the set of accepted arguments, respectively C r σ ( S ) {\displaystyle Cr_{\sigma }(S)} the set of the arguments credulously accepted under the semantic σ {\displaystyle \sigma } , and S c σ ( S ) {\displaystyle Sc_{\sigma }(S)} the set of arguments accepted skeptically under the semantic σ {\displaystyle \sigma } (the σ {\displaystyle \sigma } can be missed if there is no possible ambiguity about the semantic). Of course, when there is only one extension (for instance, when the system is well-founded), this problem is very simple: the agent accepts arguments of the unique extension and rejects others. The same reasoning can be done with labellings that correspond to the chosen semantic : an argument can be accepted if it is in for each labelling and refused if it is out for each labelling, the others being in an undecided state (the status of the arguments can remind the epistemic states of a belief in the AGM framework for dynamic of beliefs). Equivalence between argumentation frameworks There exists several criteria of equivalence between argumentation frameworks. Most of those criteria concern the sets of extensions or the set of accepted arguments. Formally, given a semantic σ {\displaystyle \sigma } : E Q 1 {\displaystyle {\mathit {EQ_{1}}}} : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they have the same set of σ {\displaystyle \sigma } -extensions, that is S 1 ≡ 1 S 2 ⇔ E x t σ ( S 1 ) = E x t σ ( S 2 ) {\displaystyle S_{1}\equiv _{1}S_{2}\Leftrightarrow Ext_{\sigma }(S_{1})=Ext_{\sigma }(S_{2})} ; E Q 2 {\displaystyle {\mathit {EQ_{2}}}} : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept skeptically the same arguments, that is S 1 ≡ 2 S 2 ⇔ S c σ ( S 1 ) = S c σ ( S 2 ) {\displaystyle S_{1}\equiv _{2}S_{2}\Leftrightarrow Sc_{\sigma }(S_{1})=Sc_{\sigma }(S_{2})} ; E Q 2 {\displaystyle {\mathit {EQ_{2}}}} : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept credulously the same arguments, that is S 1 ≡ 3 S 2 ⇔ C r σ ( S 1 ) = C r σ ( S 2 ) {\displaystyle S_{1}\equiv _{3}S_{2}\Leftrightarrow Cr_{\sigma }(S_{1})=Cr_{\sigma }(S_{2})} . The strong equivalence says that two systems S 1 {\displaystyle S_{1}} and S 2 {\displaystyle S_{2}} are equivalent if and only if for all other system S 3 {\displaystyle S_{3}} , the union of S 1 {\displaystyle S_{1}} with S 3 {\displaystyle S_{3}} is equivalent (for a given criterion) with the union of S 2 {\displaystyle S_{2}} and S 3 {\displaystyle S_{3}} . Other kinds The abstract framework of Dung has been instantiated to several particular cases. Logic-based argumentation frameworks In the case of logic-based argumentation frameworks, an argument is not an abstract entity, but a pair, where the first part is a minimal consistent set of formulae enough to prove the formula for the second part of the argument. Formally, an argument is a pair ( Φ , α ) {\displaystyle (\Phi ,\alpha )} such that Φ ⊬ ⊥ {\displaystyle \Phi \nvdash \bot } Φ ⊢ α {\displaystyle \Phi \vdash \alpha } Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } is a minimal set of Δ {\displaystyle \Delta } satisfying α {\displaystyle \alpha } where Δ {\displaystyle \Delta } is a set of formulae used by the agent to reason. One calls α {\displaystyle \alpha } a consequence of Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } , and Φ {\displaystyle \Phi } a support of α {\displaystyle \alpha } . In this case, the attack relation is not given in an explicit way, as a subset of the Cartesian product A × A {\displaystyle A\times A} , but as a property that indicates if an argument attacks another. For instance, Relation defeater : ( Ψ , β ) {\displaystyle (\Psi ,\beta )} attacks ( Φ , α ) {\displaystyle (\Phi ,\alpha )} if and only if β ⊢ ¬ ( ϕ 1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ ϕ n ) {\displaystyle \beta \vdash \neg (\phi _{1}\wedge \dots \wedge \phi _{n})} for { ϕ 1 , … , ϕ n } ⊆ Φ {\displaystyle \{\phi _{1},\dots ,\phi _{n}\}\subseteq \Phi } Relation undercut : ( Ψ , β ) {\displaystyle (\Psi ,\beta )} attacks ( Φ , α )
