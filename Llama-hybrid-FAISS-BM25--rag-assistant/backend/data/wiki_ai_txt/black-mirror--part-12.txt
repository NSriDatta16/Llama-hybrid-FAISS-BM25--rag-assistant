Miller called it "Black Mirror, but with a full and beating heart". Simon Cellan Jones, who directed the first four of six episodes, saw it as less dystopian than Black Mirror, and with less emphasis on technology. The science fiction film Friend of the World (2020) was arranged like a Black Mirror episode. The creator Brian Patrick Butler said he wanted a sequence of stories with escalating tension, to create a "creepy and thought-provoking experience". There was critical consensus that the anthology series Soulmates (2020) is inferior to Black Mirror due to its overly ambitious nature and repetitiveness. Its central conceit—that a company can determine its customers' perfect partner—is similar to the series four episode "Hang the DJ". Soulmates was created by William Bridges, a writer for two Black Mirror episodes, and Georgina Campbell—who has a starring role in "Hang the DJ"—is a main character in one episode. The One, a science-fiction programme with the same premise, was also seen as lesser than Black Mirror by critics, who cited its poor dialogue, storylines and pacing. The romantic comedy Made for Love (2021) stars Cristin Milioti and Billy Magnussen of series four episode "USS Callister" and its technological premise of a woman whose ex-husband implanted a monitoring device in her body was compared to Black Mirror. Milioti saw both stories as about "a woman trying to find herself". The series has also been positioned as the paradigmatic forerunner of a new sub-genre of dystopian fiction, emerged during the 2010s, that has been theorised as "new media dystopia," which includes other series such as Sam Esmail's Mr Robot (2015-19), Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's Westworld (2016-2022), Alex Garland's Devs (2020). The "new media dystopia" pioneered by Black Mirror is specifically defined as a mode of science fiction that, "more than speculating with future scenarios or building alternative realities, seem to be primarily concerned with reflexively examining their own medium of consumption and distribution and, therefore, in so doing, also reflecting upon their media-dominated moment" (Sebastián-Martín 120). Black Mirror, in this sense, represents a sub-genre that continues the legacy of cyberpunk but, "[a]s opposed to cyberpunk, [...] [is] much more directly and overtly about the present epoch, especially insofar as cyberpunk imaginaries have been re- appropriated— and some of its nova, materialized— with the advent of digital capitalism" (Sebastián-Martín 20). Comparisons to reality Brooker has often been described by commentators as prescient in his scripts for Black Mirror. In 2015, G. Clay Whitaker of The Daily Beast called the show a Magic 8 Ball. The first episode, "The National Anthem", features the UK prime minister blackmailed into having sexual intercourse with a pig. Four years later, the Daily Mail published allegations that the then-prime minister David Cameron had placed a "private part of his anatomy" into the mouth of a dead pig as an initiation rite at university. Brooker later said that after hearing the news, he "did genuinely for a moment wonder if reality was a simulation, whether it exists only to trick me". In a 2013 episode called "The Waldo Moment", the animated cartoon Waldo places second in a UK by-election. The 2017–2021 US presidency of the media personality Donald Trump and the Ukrainian presidency of the comedian Volodymyr Zelensky from 2019 onwards were compared by journalists to the political platform of Waldo. Brooker described Trump as "an anti-politics candidate who's raucous and defensive" and "offers nothing", like Waldo. Adrian Karatnycky of Politico stated that as with Waldo, Zelenskyy had few clear policy positions prior to his election. The 2016 episode "Nosedive" presents a society in which citizens rate interactions with each other from one to five stars and receive an overall rating that largely determines their socioeconomic status. This has been compared to China's Social Credi
