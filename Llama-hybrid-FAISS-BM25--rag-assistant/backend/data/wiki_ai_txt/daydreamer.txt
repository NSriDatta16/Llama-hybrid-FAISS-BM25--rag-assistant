DAYDREAMER is a goal-based agent and cognitive architecture developed at University of California, Los Angeles by Erik Mueller. It models the human stream of thought and its triggering and direction by emotions, as in human daydreaming. The architecture is implemented as 12,000 lines of Lisp code. History DAYDREAMER was begun by Erik Mueller in 1983 while he was studying under Michael G. Dyer in the UCLA Computer Science Department. It was completed in 1987 and was followed by the ThoughtTreasure program, which was started in 1993. See also Intelligent agent Interactive storytelling References Further reading Mueller, Erik T.
