 GVF has also been modified in motion GVF (MGVF) to incorporate object motion in an image sequence. Whereas the diffusion of GVF vectors from a conventional edge map acts in an isotropic manner, the formulation of MGVF incorporates the expected object motion between image frames. An alternative to GVF called vector field convolution (VFC) provides many of the advantages of GVF, has superior noise robustness, and can be computed very fast. The VFC field v V F C {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {VFC} }} is defined as the convolution of the edge map f {\displaystyle f} with a vector field kernel k {\displaystyle \mathbf {k} } where The vector field kernel k {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbf {k} } has vectors that always point toward the origin but their magnitudes, determined in detail by the function m {\displaystyle m} , decrease to zero with increasing distance from the origin. The beauty of VFC is that it can be computed very rapidly using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), a multiplication, and an inverse FFT. The capture range can be large and is explicitly given by the radius R {\displaystyle R} of the vector field kernel. A possible drawback of VFC is that weak edges might be overwhelmed by strong edges, but that problem can be alleviated by the use of a hybrid method that switches to conventional forces when the snake gets close to the boundary. Properties. GVF has characteristics that have made it useful in many diverse applications. It has already been noted that its primary original purpose was to extend a local edge field throughout the image domain, far away from the actual edge in many cases. This property has been described as an extension of the capture range of the external force of an active contour model. It is also capable of moving active contours into concave regions of an object's boundary. These two properties are illustrated in Figure 3. Previous forces that had been used as external forces (based on the edge map gradients and simply related variants) required pressure forces in order to move boundaries from large distances and into concave regions. Pressure forces, also called balloon forces, provide continuous force on the boundary in one direction (outward or inward), and tend to have the effect of pushing through weak boundaries. GVF can often replace pressure forces and yield better performance in such situations. Because the diffusion process is inherent in the GVF solution, vectors that point in opposite directions tend to compete as they meet at a central location, thereby defining a type of geometric feature that is related to the boundary configuration, but not directly evident from the edge map. For example, perceptual edges are gaps in the edge map which tend to be connected visually by human perception. GVF helps to connect them by diffusing opposing edge gradient vectors across the gap; and even though there is no actual edge map, active contour will converge to the perceptual edge because the GVF vectors drive them there (see Xu, C.; Prince, J.L. (2012). "Active contours, deformable models, and gradient vector flow". Online resource including code download.). This property carries over when there are so-called weak edges identified by regions of edge maps having lower values. GVF vectors also meet in opposition at central locations of objects thereby defining a type of medialness. This property has been exploited as an alternative definition of the skeleton of objects and also as a way to initialize deformable models within objects such that convergence to the boundary is more likely. Applications The most fundamental application of GVF is as an external force in a deformable model. A typical application considers an image I ( x ) {\displaystyle \textstyle I(\mathbf {x} )} with an object delineated by intensity from its background. Thus, a suitable edge map f ( x ) {\displaystyle \textstyle f(\mathbf {x} )} could be defined by where G Ïƒ {\displaystyle \textstyle G_{\sigma }} is
