kers like Zed and Sourcegraph suggests growing consensus around its utility. In April 2025, security researchers released analysis that there are multiple outstanding security issues with MCP, including prompt injection, tool permissions where combining tools can exfiltrate files, and lookalike tools can silently replace trusted ones. It has been likened to OpenAPI, a similar specification that aims to describe APIs.
