Obituary piracy or obit piracy is the unauthorised copying or re-fabrication of online obituaries that have previously been published elsewhere in order to generate revenue. The obituaries used by obituary pirates are often lifted from funeral home websites, local newspapers, and legitimate obituary publishers such as Legacy.com. Obituary pirating has in some cases involved simply copying the text and images used in the original obituaries, which has been classified as copyright infringement. However, other sites create summaries of the obituaries to avoid this charge, often using generative artificial intelligence to do so. The websites engaging in this practice then place online advertising, ask for donations, and claim to sell memorial products such as flowers next to the obituaries, taking in revenue from the unwitting friends and family of the deceased. They use search engine optimization to maximise their reach in search results. Background In the 2000s and 2010s, obituaries became more valuable as commodities due to their ability to attract web traffic. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this change. In 2020, the websites of Service Corporation International (SCI), a conglomerate which owned 1,500 funeral homes, attracted nearly 160 million visitors, an increase from 130 million in 2019. In 2021, Barbara Kemmis, executive director for the Cremation Association of North America, said that reports of obituary piracy were on the rise. Examples Pascal Leclerc In January 2018, the website Afterlife, owned by Pascal Leclerc, was sued by Newfoundland lawyer Erin Best on behalf of clients Dawn Thomson and Raylene Manning-Puddister in Federal Court in Ottawa. Manning-Puddister had found an obituary she had written in 2012 for her son Tyller Pittman on the Afterlife website with no changes from its original state, including pictures and a poem she had written. Similarly, Thomson had found an obituary for her father, who had died in 2017, on the Afterlife website a year later, copied and pasted from elsewhere. Afterlife was selling memorial-themed products like candles and sympathy cards for unwitting friends and family to buy, and taking in the revenue for itself. Leclerc initially hired a lawyer, but later backed down. Justice Catherine Kane thus issued a default judgment in 2019, ordering Afterlife to pay CA$10 million in statutory damages and the same amount in aggravated damages, and issuing an injunction against the website to prevent it from operating in the future. At the time it was taken down, the site had posted over 1 million Canadian obituaries. After this, the site redirected to Everhere, another site run by Leclerc. Everhere, which described itself as a "database of obituaries that are found online", received controversy itself after it posted unauthorised obituaries for 12 of the 16 people who were killed in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash. Many of the obituaries were inaccurate, and had an incorrect place of death. The site placed advertisements next to the obituaries, charging $4.99 to remove them, as well as adding offers to purchase gifts and memorials. In February 2018, a month after the filing of the Afterlife lawsuit, Leclerc started Echovita, a Quebec-based company, stating that he would "prove with a new business model that [he was] trying to help society." Echovita does not copy obituaries directly, instead crawling the internet for obituaries and publishing summaries, and as such does not fall into the realm of copyright infringement for which Afterlife was sued. The company generated CA$5 million in revenue in 2020, including commissions on floral, candle, and memorial tree sales. Echovita has also been accused of engaging in obituary piracy. In July 2021, Service Corporation International (SCI), a conglomerate which owned 1,500 funeral homes, sued Echovita, alleging that the company had scraped details from obituaries on SCI's website and republished them as their own. A spokesperson for SCI wrote that "
