imilar professional interest from researchers as the Artificial Evolution conference and the other conferences mentioned above. The GECCO conferences held in Europe to date are mentioned in the table below: The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC) is another significant conference in the field of evolutionary computation and natural computing. While many IEEE CEC conferences have been held on other continents, some, like GECCO, have been held in Europe. The table below summarises their occurrence: GECCO, FOGA and Parallel Problem Solving from Nature all received a CORE rank A in that conference ranking system for computer science suggesting their importance to attendees in evolutionary computation, natural computing and related fields. These are thus probably some suitable alternative research conferences. Artificial Evolution Association The Artificial Evolution Association (AEA) was created to organise the Artificial Evolution conferences as described in history above, and it continues in this activity. But as well as organising the conferences, it also organises other activities. JET days JET abbreviates in French Journées Évolutionnaires Thématiques (in English Thematic Evolutionary Days), formerly Journées Évolutionnaires Trimestrielles with the same initials. These are day-long meetings informal meetings on artificial evolution, evolutionary computation and related fields. They were held one or more times a year between 1998 and 2016, excepting one instance at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, always in France. It is not clear whether the lack of meetings after 2016 reflects a lack of updating the website or their cessation. Mailing list The AEA maintains a mailing list for people interested in Artificial Evolution. Following the trend of the JET days referred to above, its title is (in French) jet – Personnes interessées par l'Evolution Artificielle en France An approximate translation in English is jet – Persons interested in Artificial Evolution in France. This mailing list appears to be live and thus is likely to have greater reach than the JET days above. Summer schools The AEA has supported Summer Schools at different locations across France, designed for a combination of students, researchers and industrial practitioners in the fields that the Artificial Evolution conference and Association cover. These included introductions to the subjects as well as advanced lectures, and practical exercises which are essential for application in these field. The AEA has recorded Summer Schools as having taken place annually between 2006 and 2013. Workshops The AEA supported a number of workshops, held in Paris, Bordeaux and Luxembourg from 2010 to 2011, in addition to its organisation of the Artificial Evolution conferences and other activities. Details of these workshops are no longer accessible. This is perhaps not surprising since it is fourteen years since the last recorded workshop supported by the Artificial Evolution Association. == References and notes ==
