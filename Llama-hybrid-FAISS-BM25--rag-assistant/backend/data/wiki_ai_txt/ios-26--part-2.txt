ithout an internet connection or access point. Captive Assist: when the user accesses a public Wi-Fi network on an Apple device by filling out a web form, the form information is automatically shared with the other Apple devices, making it easier to connect to the same network. Screenshots and screen recordings The "General" section of the Settings app has a new section for configuring screenshots. Full-screen previews: a screenshot-capture mode that keeps the captured screen in full-screen view instead of minimizing it to an icon in the screen's bottom-left corner. HDR captures: it is now possible to capture HDR screenshots and screen recordings. eSIM transfer iOS 26 allows the user to directly transfer an eSIM between an iPhone and an Android phone without a QR code from the mobile carrier. Ringtones New ringtones have been introduced for the first time since iOS 17, including five variations of the "Reflection" ringtone: "Buoyant", "Dreamer", "Pond, "Pop", "Reflected", and "Surge". App features Phone An optional unified layout has been introduced, for those who want to have favorite contacts, recent calls, and voicemail in a single view. Call Screening automatically answers calls from unknown numbers to determine whether they are from a real person or spam. It asks the caller to identify themself and state the reason for the call. If the call is deemed legitimate, it is passed through, and the phone rings. Hold Assist lets users put a call on hold and notify the caller when they are ready to resume the conversation. Tap Recents to Call is a setting that, when disabled, prevents accidental calls by tapping a name or number in the user's call history. Live Translations in Calls allows real-time translation of the caller's voice, converting it into the desired language during the call. The Phone app provides haptic feedback, vibrating when the call is answered on the other end. From the Recent Calls page, it is possible to create a reminder to re-call recently called numbers in an hour, tonight, tomorrow, or later. Full per-contact Call History: for each contact, you can now view the full call history, spanning months and years, rather than just the most recent calls. Messages The Messages app now supports custom backgrounds, polls, and the user indicator for typing in group chats. The user can also select and copy part of a message instead of the entire message. Spam messages from unknown senders are automatically recognized and moved to a separate list. Users can activate translation in real time to ensure that everything written in one language is sent as a message written in another. Music The user can pin favorite songs or albums at the top of the library. Translation and pronunciation of live lyrics allows users to understand the lyrics of the songs in other languages and to sing (i.e., pronounce) them even if the user person does not know the language. AutoMix switches from one song to another using Time Stretching and Beat Matching techniques for a more continuous mix. Users can create folders in which to put playlists. Live Radio Widget is a widget for the Home screen that allows direct access to 6 radio stations. Fullscreen artwork: the album cover of the playing song extends to full screen on the Lock Screen. Photos The Photos app is redesigned to replace its short-lived design from iOS 18 with a layout that reinstates the command bar at the bottom of the screen, though unlike before, it is simplified to allow the user to quickly switch among Library, Collections, and Search selections. It is possible to apply a 3D effect to a photo to make it appear that the represented subjects come out of the screen when the phone moves. This is the same VisionOS technology that has been brought to the iPhone. Camera The Camera interface is simpler, with two main buttons, "Photo" and "Video", initially visible and placed at the bottom. An expandable and scrollable command bar reveals other shooting modes. Menus are also more intu
