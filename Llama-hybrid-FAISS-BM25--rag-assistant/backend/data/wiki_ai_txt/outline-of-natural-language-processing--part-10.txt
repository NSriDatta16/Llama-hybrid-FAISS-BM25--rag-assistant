LRE Map – Reification (linguistics) – Semantic Web – Metadata – Spoken dialogue system – Affix grammar over a finite lattice – Aggregation (linguistics) – Bag-of-words model – model that represents a text as a bag (multiset) of its words that disregards grammar and word sequence, but maintains multiplicity. This model is a commonly used to train document classifiers Brill tagger – Cache language model – ChaSen, MeCab – provide morphological analysis and word splitting for Japanese Classic monolingual WSD – ClearForest – CMU Pronouncing Dictionary – also known as cmudict, is a public domain pronouncing dictionary designed for uses in speech technology, and was created by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). It defines a mapping from English words to their North American pronunciations, and is commonly used in speech processing applications such as the Festival Speech Synthesis System and the CMU Sphinx speech recognition system.

String kernel – Natural-language processing tools Google Ngram Viewer – graphs n-gram usage from a corpus of more than 5.2 million books Corpora Text corpus (see list) – large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). They are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory. Bank of English British National Corpus Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) Oxford English Corpus Natural-language processing toolkits The following natural-language processing toolkits are notable collections of natural-language processing software. They are suites of libraries, frameworks, and applications for symbolic, statistical natural-language and speech processing. Named-entity recognizers ABNER (A Biomedical Named-Entity Recognizer) – open source text mining program that uses linear-chain conditional random field sequence models. It automatically tags genes, proteins and other entity names in text. Written by Burr Settles of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Stanford NER (Named-Entity Recognizer) — Java implementation of a Named-Entity Recognizer that uses linear-chain conditional random field sequence models. It automatically tags persons, organizations, and locations in text in English, German, Chinese, and Spanish languages.
