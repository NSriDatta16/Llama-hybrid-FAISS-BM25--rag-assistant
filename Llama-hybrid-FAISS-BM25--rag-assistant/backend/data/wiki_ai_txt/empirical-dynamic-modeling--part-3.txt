sually influencing Y {\displaystyle Y} . Multiview Embedding Multiview Embedding is a Dimensionality reduction technique where a large number of state-space time series vectors are combitorially assessed towards maximal model predictability. Extensions Extensions to EDM techniques include: Generalized Theorems for Nonlinear State Space Reconstruction Extended Convergent Cross Mapping Dynamic stability S-Map regularization Visual analytics with EDM Convergent Cross Sorting Expert system with EDM hybrid Sliding windows based on the extended convergent cross-mapping Empirical Mode Modeling Accounting for missing data and variable step sizes Hierarchical Bayesian EDM via Gaussian processes Optimal control via Empirical dynamic programming Multiview distance regularised S-map See also System dynamics Complex dynamics Nonlinear dimensionality reduction References Further reading Chang, CW., Ushio, M. & Hsieh, Ch.
