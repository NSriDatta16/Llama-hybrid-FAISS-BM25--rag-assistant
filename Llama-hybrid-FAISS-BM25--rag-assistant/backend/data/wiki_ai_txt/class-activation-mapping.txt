Class activation mapping methods are explainable AI (XAI) techniques used to visualize the regions of an input image that are the most relevant for a particular task, especially image classification, in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods generate heatmaps by weighting the feature maps from a convolutional layer according to their relevance to the target class. In the field of artificial intelligence, generically defined as "the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans", machine learning and deep learning were created. They both use statistical and computational methods to learn patterns from data, reducing the need for manually coded rules. Machine learning models are trained on input data and the known respective answers, learning the underlying patterns or structures present in the data. Traditional Machine learning algorithms employ manually designed feature sets, posing a direct link between machine learning designers and employed features. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, based on the concept of successive layers of representation, in which the data is progressively unfolded in different ways, to extract relevant and informative patterns in data analysis. Deep learning algorithms are defined as feature learning algorithms automatically learning hierarchical feature representations from raw data, extracting increasingly abstract features through multiple layers. CNNs are a specific architecture of deep learning models, designed to process spatially structured data, such as images, exploiting a series of convolution, non-linear activation and pooling operations to extract relevant features, contained in the so-called feature maps from input data. CNNs have demonstrated to be highly effective in a variety of computer vision and image processing tasks. CNNs (and deep learning models more broadly) are described as black boxes due to their complex and non-transparent internal layers of representation. The need for clearer indications on its internal working and decision-making process gave birth to XAI techniques. Among the proposed XAI techniques for computer vision tasks, Class activation mapping methods can show which pixels in an input image are important to the predicted logit for a class of interest, in a classification task. Class activation mapping methods were originally developed for class-discriminative scenarios to visualize which parts of the input image influenced the classification decision. Namely, to visually highlight the regions of those feature maps which contribute most strongly to the prediction of a given class. More advanced versions of these methods are not limited to image classification tasks, but have been extended also to several vision-related tasks, such as object detection, image captioning, visual question answering and image segmentation. Background The following methods laid the groundwork for the class activation maps approaches, forming the conceptual basis of using gradients to highlight class-discriminative regions. Class model visualization and saliency maps for convolutional neural networks The class model visualization and image-specific saliency maps approaches have been presented in the foundational work "Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps" by Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman and it generalizes the deconvnet method by Zeiler and Fergus. Class model visualization synthesizes an artificial input image that strongly activates the output neurons associated with a target class. Given a trained, fixed model, this method starts with a zero-initialized image, backpropagates the gradients from the class score to the image pixels, updates the image pixels increasing the specific class scores and it repeats the pixel updating process, showing an encoded (idealized version) prototype of the class of interest.
