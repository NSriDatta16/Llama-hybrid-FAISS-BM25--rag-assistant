GPT Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate content. Users can interact with it through text or voice conversations. It can generate images using GPT-4o, which replaced DALL-E 3. ChatGPT gained 100 million users during the two months following its launch. OpenAI launched multiple subscription plans: Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can access GPT-4o, but at a reduced limit. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Pro", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide increased usage limits and access to additional features or models. In May 2023, OpenAI launched a user interface for ChatGPT for the App Store on iOS and later in July 2023 for the Play Store on Android. In December 2024, OpenAI launched a new feature allowing users to call ChatGPT for up to 15 minutes per month for free. SearchGPT SearchGPT, a prototype search engine developed by OpenAI, was unveiled on July 25, 2024, with an initial limited release to 10,000 test users. It combines traditional search engine features with generative AI capabilities. ChatGPT Atlas In October 2025, OpenAI released a web browser called ChatGPT Atlas. Stargate and other supercomputers Unveiled in 2024, Stargate was initially a $100 billion project between OpenAI and Microsoft to build data-centers. The name "Stargate" is a homage to the 1994 sci-fi film Stargate. It eventually became a company, Stargate LLC, which was founded in January 2025 as a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX. Hardware development On May 21, 2025, OpenAI announced the acquisition of io, an AI hardware startup founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive. The deal, valued at approximately $6.5 billion, marks OpenAI's strategic entry into the consumer hardware market. Ive, known for designing the iPhone, iPad and iMac, will lead hardware and design efforts for OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive have expressed a shared vision for developing AI-native devices that go beyond conventional screens and interfaces. Though specific product details have not been released, the Washington Post reports that Ive and Altman have already been working on a new product. "The first one I’ve been working on has just completely captured my imagination,” said Jony Ive. Altman added, “I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.” The company has also started to work in the robotics space with the goal of creating general purpose robots.
