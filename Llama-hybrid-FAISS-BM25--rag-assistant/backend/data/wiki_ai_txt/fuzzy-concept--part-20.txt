rmation content in a few words." Paradoxes Even using ordinary set theory and binary logic to reason something out, logicians have discovered that it is possible to generate statements which are logically speaking not completely true or imply a paradox, even although in other respects they conform to logical rules (see Russell's paradox). If a margin of indeterminacy therefore persists, then binary logic cannot totally remove fuzziness. David Hilbert concluded that the existence of logical paradoxes tells us "that we must develop a meta-mathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic method; their importance is methodological as well as epistemological". Social science and the media The idea of fuzzy concepts has also been applied in the linguistic, economic and sociological analysis of human behaviour. Sociology and linguistics In a 1973 paper, George Lakoff analyzed hedges in the interpretation of the meaning of categories. Charles Ragin and others have applied the idea to sociological analysis. For example, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis ("fsQCA") has been used by German researchers to study problems posed by ethnic diversity in Latin America. In New Zealand, Taiwan, Iran, Malaysia, the European Union and Croatia, economists have used fuzzy concepts to model and measure the underground economy of their country. Kofi Kissi Dompere applied methods of fuzzy decision, approximate reasoning, negotiation games and fuzzy mathematics to analyze the role of money, information and resources in a "political economy of rent-seeking", viewed as a game played between powerful corporations and the government. The German researcher Thomas Kron has used fuzzy methods to model sociological theory, creating an integral action-theoretical model with the aid of fuzzy logic. With Lars Winter, Kron developed the system theory of Niklas Luhmann further, using the so-called "Kosko-Cube". Kron studies transnational terrorism and other contemporary phenomena using fuzzy logic, to understand conditions involving uncertainty, hybridity, violence and cultural systems. A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an ideal type to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a "true and complete description" or a "true and complete reflection" of whatever is being conceptualized. In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a "fuzzy concept" has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers â€“ often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize". To specify the relevant meaning more precisely, additional distinctions, conditions and/or qualifiers would be required. A few examples can illustrate this kind of usage: a handbook of sociology states that "The theory of interaction rituals contains some gaps that need to be filled and some fuzzy concepts that need to be differentiated." The idea is, that if finer distinctions are introduced, then the fuzziness or vagueness would be eliminated. a book on youth culture describes ethnicity as "a fuzzy concept that overlaps at times with concepts of race, minority, nationality and tribe". In this case, part of the fuzziness consists in the inability to distinguish precisely between a concept and a different, but closely related concept. a book on sociological theory argues that the Critical Theory of domination faces the problem that "reality itself has become a rather meaningless, fuzzy concept." The suggestion here is, that the variations in how theoretical concepts are applied have become so large, that the concepts could mean all kinds of things, and therefore are crucially vague (with the implication, that they are not useful any longer for that very reason). A history book states: "Sodomy was a vague and fuzzy concept in medieval
