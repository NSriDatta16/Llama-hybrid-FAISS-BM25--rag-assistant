The first one, I1, is analogous to the moment of inertia around the image's centroid, where the pixels' intensities are analogous to physical density. The first six, I1 ... I6, are reflection symmetric, i.e. they are unchanged if the image is changed to a mirror image. The last one, I7, is reflection antisymmetric (changes sign under reflection), which enables it to distinguish mirror images of otherwise identical images. A general theory on deriving complete and independent sets of rotation moment invariants was proposed by J. Flusser. He showed that the traditional set of Hu moment invariants is neither independent nor complete. I3 is not very useful as it is dependent on the others ( I 3 = ( I 5 2 + I 7 2 ) / I 4 3 {\displaystyle I_{3}=(I_{5}^{2}+I_{7}^{2})/I_{4}^{3}} ). In the original Hu's set there is a missing third order independent moment invariant: I 8 = η 11 [ ( η 30 + η 12 ) 2 − ( η 03 + η 21 ) 2 ] − ( η 20 − η 02 ) ( η 30 + η 12 ) ( η 03 + η 21 ) {\displaystyle I_{8}=\eta _{11}[(\eta _{30}+\eta _{12})^{2}-(\eta _{03}+\eta _{21})^{2}]-(\eta _{20}-\eta _{02})(\eta _{30}+\eta _{12})(\eta _{03}+\eta _{21})} Like I7, I8 is also reflection antisymmetric. Later, J. Flusser and T. Suk specialized the theory for N-rotationally symmetric shapes case. Applications Zhang et al. applied Hu moment invariants to solve the Pathological Brain Detection (PBD) problem. Doerr and Florence used information of the object orientation related to the second order central moments to effectively extract translation- and rotation-invariant object cross-sections from micro-X-ray tomography image data. D. A. Hoeltzel and Wei-Hua Chieng used Hu moment invariant to perform on a dimensionally-parameterized four bar mechanism which yielded 15 distinct coupler curve groups (patterns) from a total of 356 generated coupler curves.
