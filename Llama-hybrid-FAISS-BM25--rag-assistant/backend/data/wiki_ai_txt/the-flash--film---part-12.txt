ilm Supergirl (2026), which does not star Calle. Following the alterations made in post-production, Gunn and Safran arranged for George Clooney to reprise his role as another version of Batman from Batman & Robin (1997), replacing Affleck's version in the timeline, in a third version of the ending. This idea came after a recurring joke was made during production regarding how many versions of Batman could be included in the film. Clooney agreed to join the project after he and his talent agent Bryan Lourd were shown a mostly completed cut, which they reportedly liked, and Clooney filmed his scenes with Miller for half a day in January 2023, in what was described as a "quick and efficient shoot". Miller received advice from Clooney on handling publicity and his behavior in between takes, and Miller was said to have been in "top form". This ending with Clooney was kept a secret until the film's release. In March, Affleck revealed that he had filmed a scene with Gadot, who appeared in an in-progress cut of the film screened at CinemaCon the following month. Later in April 2023, Muschietti revealed some of the planned cameos that did not make the final film, including Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman from the television series Wonder Woman (1975–1979), Marlon Brando's Jor-El from Superman (1978), Burgess Meredith's the Penguin and Cesar Romero's the Joker from the series Batman (1966–1968), and Grant Gustin's Barry Allen from the Arrowverse continuity (2013–2023). Gustin was not approached to appear in the film, although the Golden Age incarnation of the Flash, Jay Garrick, does appear in the film's Chronobowl Speed Force sequence, with the character's likeness based on Ballantine; the character was initially believed to be based on the appearance of Teddy Sears's Hunter Zolomon / "Jay Garrick" from the Arrowverse, but he was not involved. Multiple other cameos are featured in the film as part of the Chronobowl sequence. Nicolas Cage portrays an alternate version of Superman, who he was cast as in 1997 for Tim Burton's unproduced film Superman Lives. Cage filmed his scenes through volumetric capture and was digitally de-aged for the role, which paid homage to a scene that producer Jon Peters wanted to include in Burton's film. Cage originally filmed a different scene of his character standing in an alternate universe while witnessing its destruction. For that scene, Cage said that he conveyed the character's emotions in his eyes with no dialogue. Previous incarnations of Superman, Batman, and Supergirl also appear in the sequence through artificial intelligence and deepfake technology, including Christopher Reeve as Superman from the 1978–1987 Superman films, Helen Slater as Supergirl from Supergirl (1984), Adam West as Batman from the film Batman (1966) and the 1966 Batman series, and George Reeves as his version of Superman from Superman and the Mole Men (1951) and Adventures of Superman (1952–1958), through archive footage. West's appearance was almost cut before Muschietti chose to retain it because he and Barbara felt personally attached to the series, which they watched reruns of during their childhood in Argentina. Muschietti said the crew was given "total freedom" with these cameos. Music Benjamin Wallfisch was set to compose the film's score by April 2021, after previously collaborating with Muschietti on It and It Chapter Two as well as scoring the DCEU film Shazam! (2019). By late August 2022, Wallfisch was set to begin a scoring session at Abbey Road Studios in London. Wallfisch referenced the themes from the 1989 Batman score and the Batman Returns soundtrack by composer Danny Elfman throughout the film, due to the inclusion of Keaton's Batman. Marketing Miller debuted the first footage from the film at the virtual DC FanDome event in October 2021. They said there was not enough footage available to make a full trailer or teaser, but William Hughes at The A.V. Club felt the footage could comfortably be categorized as a tea
