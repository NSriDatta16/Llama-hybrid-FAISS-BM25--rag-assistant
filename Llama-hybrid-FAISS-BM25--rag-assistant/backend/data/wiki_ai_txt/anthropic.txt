Anthropic PBC is an American artificial intelligence (AI) startup company founded in 2021. It has developed a family of large language models (LLMs) named Claude. According to the company, it researches and develops AI to "study their safety properties at the technological frontier" and use this research to deploy safe models for the public. Anthropic was founded by former members of OpenAI, including siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei (who serves as CEO). In September 2023, Amazon announced an investment of up to $4 billion. Google committed $2 billion the next month. As of September 2025, Anthropic is the fourth most valuable private company globally, valued at over $183 billion. History Founding and early development (2021â€“2022) Anthropic was founded in 2021 by seven former employees of OpenAI, including siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei, the latter of whom was OpenAI's Vice President of Research. In April 2022, Anthropic announced it had received $580 million in funding, including a $500 million investment from FTX under the leadership of Sam Bankman-Fried. In the summer of 2022, Anthropic finished training the first version of Claude but did not release it, citing a need for further internal safety testing and a desire to avoid initiating a potentially hazardous race to develop increasingly powerful AI systems. Major investments In September 2023, Amazon announced a partnership with Anthropic. Amazon became a minority stakeholder by initially investing $1.25 billion and planning a total investment of $4 billion. The remaining $2.75 billion was invested in March 2024. In November 2024, Amazon invested another $4 billion, doubling its total investment. As part of the deal, Anthropic uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its primary cloud provider and makes its AI models available to AWS customers. In October 2023, Google invested $500 million in Anthropic and committed to an additional $1.5 billion over time. In March 2025, Google agreed to invest another $1 billion in Anthropic. Recruitment (2024) In February 2024, Anthropic hired former Google Books head of partnerships Tom Turvey, and tasked him with obtaining "all the books in the world". The company then began using destructive book scanning to digitize "millions" of books to train Claude. In 2024, Anthropic attracted several notable employees from OpenAI, including Jan Leike, John Schulman, and Durk Kingma. Additional funding and partnerships (2025) Anthropic raised $3.5 billion in a Series E funding round in March 2025, achieving a post-money valuation of $61.5 billion, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from several major investors. In March, Databricks and Anthropic announced that Claude would be integrated into the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. In May 2025, the company announced Claude 4, introducing both Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 with improved coding capabilities and other new features. It also introduced new API capabilities, including the Model Context Protocol (MCP) connector. In May, Anthropic launched a web search API that enables Claude to access real-time information from the internet. Claude Code, Anthropic's coding assistant, transitioned from research preview to general availability, featuring integrations with VS Code and JetBrains IDEs and support for GitHub Actions. In September 2025, Anthropic completed a Series F funding round, raising $13 billion at a post-money valuation of $183 billion. The round was co-led by Iconiq Capital, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from the Qatar Investment Authority and other investors. The same month, Anthropic announced that it would stop selling its products to groups majority-owned by Chinese, Russian, Iranian, or North Korean entities due to national security concerns. In October 2025, Anthropic announced a cloud partnership with Google, giving it access to up to one million of Google's custom Tensor Processing Units (
