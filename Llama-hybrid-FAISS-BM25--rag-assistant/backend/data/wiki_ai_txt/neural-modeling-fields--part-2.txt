sential part of perception and cognition, and in NMF theory it is driven by the dynamics that increase a similarity measure between the sets of models and signals, L({X},{M}). The similarity measure is a function of model parameters and associations between the input bottom-up signals and top-down, concept-model signals. In constructing a mathematical description of the similarity measure, it is important to acknowledge two principles: First, the visual field content is unknown before perception occurred Second, it may contain any of a number of objects. Important information could be contained in any bottom-up signal; Therefore, the similarity measure is constructed so that it accounts for all bottom-up signals, X(n), L ( { X → ( n ) } , { M → m ( S → m , n ) } ) = ∏ n = 1 N l ( X → ( n ) ) . {\displaystyle L(\{{\vec {X}}(n)\},\{{\vec {M}}_{m}({\vec {S}}_{m},n)\})=\prod _{n=1}^{N}{l({\vec {X}}(n))}.} (1) This expression contains a product of partial similarities, l(X(n)), over all bottom-up signals; therefore it forces the NMF system to account for every signal (even if one term in the product is zero, the product is zero, the similarity is low and the knowledge instinct is not satisfied); this is a reflection of the first principle. Second, before perception occurs, the mind does not know which object gave rise to a signal from a particular retinal neuron. Therefore, a partial similarity measure is constructed so that it treats each model as an alternative (a sum over concept-models) for each input neuron signal. Its constituent elements are conditional partial similarities between signal X(n) and model Mm, l(X(n)|m). This measure is "conditional" on object m being present, therefore, when combining these quantities into the overall similarity measure, L, they are multiplied by r(m), which represent a probabilistic measure of object m actually being present. Combining these elements with the two principles noted above, a similarity measure is constructed as follows: L ( { X → ( n ) } , { M → m ( S → m , n ) } ) = ∏ n = 1 N ∑ m = 1 M r ( m ) l ( X → ( n ) | m ) . {\displaystyle L(\{{\vec {X}}(n)\},\{{\vec {M}}_{m}({\vec {S}}_{m},n)\})=\prod _{n=1}^{N}{\sum _{m=1}^{M}{r(m)l({\vec {X}}(n)|m)}}.} (2) The structure of the expression above follows standard principles of the probability theory: a summation is taken over alternatives, m, and various pieces of evidence, n, are multiplied. This expression is not necessarily a probability, but it has a probabilistic structure. If learning is successful, it approximates probabilistic description and leads to near-optimal Bayesian decisions. The name "conditional partial similarity" for l(X(n)|m) (or simply l(n|m)) follows the probabilistic terminology. If learning is successful, l(n|m) becomes a conditional probability density function, a probabilistic measure that signal in neuron n originated from object m. Then L is a total likelihood of observing signals {X(n)} coming from objects described by concept-model {Mm}. Coefficients r(m), called priors in probability theory, contain preliminary biases or expectations, expected objects m have relatively high r(m) values; their true values are usually unknown and should be learned, like other parameters Sm. Note that in probability theory, a product of probabilities usually assumes that evidence is independent. Expression for L contains a product over n, but it does not assume independence among various signals X(n). There is a dependence among signals due to concept-models: each model Mm(Sm,n) predicts expected signal values in many neurons n. During the learning process, concept-models are constantly modified. Usually, the functional forms of models, Mm(Sm,n), are all fixed and learning-adaptation involves only model parameters, Sm. From time to time a system forms a new concept, while retaining an old one as well; alternatively, old concepts are sometimes merged or eliminated. This requires a modification of the similarity measure L; The
