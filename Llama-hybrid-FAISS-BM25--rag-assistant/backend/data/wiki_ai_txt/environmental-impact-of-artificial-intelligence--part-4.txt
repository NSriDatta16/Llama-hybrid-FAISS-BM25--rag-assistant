illion tonnes annually, on track to reach 82 million tonnes by 2030, a further 33% increase from the 2022 figure. AI could have an important role because it is expected to add 1.2 million to 5 million metric tons of e-waste in total by 2030, which would represent up to 12% of global e-waste. Some applications of AI, such as for robot recycling, may reduce e-waste. Mining Large-scale AI is typically housed in data centres, which can exact heavy tolls on the planet. Their electronics rely on huge amounts of raw materials: making a 2 kg computer requires 800 kg of raw materials. In addition, the microchips that power AI require rare-earth elements, often mined in environmentally destructive ways. Climate solutions AI has been claimed to have significant potential to help mitigate effects of climate change, such as through better weather predictions, disaster prevention and weather tracking. Some climate scientists have suggested that AI could be used to improve efficiencies of systems, such as renewable-energy systems, despite their massive initial energy investment. Google has claimed AI could help mitigate some effects of climate change such as predicting floods or making traffic more efficient. Some algorithms may help predict the impacts of more severe hurricanes, measure the melting of polar ice, deforestation, and help monitor emissions from sources. AI is used to model and analyze extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves by processing vast amounts of climate data and identifying patterns that may not be easily detected by traditional methods. These advanced predictive capabilities help governments, emergency responders, and policymakers improve disaster preparedness, optimize resource allocation, and develop early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on communities. AI is also being applied to genetic engineering. An AI tool called Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP) is being used to improve the carbon sequestration of plant root systems. One machine learning project, the Open Catalyst project, has been used to identify "suitable low-cost electrocatalysts" for battery storage of renewable energy sources. AI may also improve the efficiencies of supply chains and productions for environmentally detrimental industries such as food and fast fashion. However, as yet there are no widely accepted frameworks which evaluate AI systems' total climate impacts, factoring in both costs and benefits. Policy and regulation United States The environmental impacts of AI have been a blindspot in the range of AI legislation proposed in the US Congress. As of November 2024, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024 introduced in the Senate by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey was the only federal bill to make environmental recommendations for the use of AI. The Act would have required the administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Energy to study the environmental effects of AI's development, deployment, and post-deployment and enact a voluntary reporting system for AI-related environmental impacts. The bill has not been reintroduced in the 119th Congress. In lieu of federal legislation on the subject, certain state governments have introduced policy on the environmental cost of AI. Virginia is considering legislation requiring data centers to submit water use estimates, reflecting growing concerns about resource consumption, sustainability, and land use. For instance, Virginia's Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) has recommended that data centers report their energy and water usage to address the strain these facilities place on infrastructure and resources. Another Virginia bill proposed a mandatory review and approval process from the State Corporation Commission (SCC) for data center developments exceeding 100 megawatts to ensure grid reliability. However, the House
