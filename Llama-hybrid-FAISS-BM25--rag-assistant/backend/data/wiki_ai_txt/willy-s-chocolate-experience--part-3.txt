lluminati's behalf, stating that they "either have no regards for the families and young children they have disappointed or are too embarrassed to comment", and offered to provide a venue free of charge for those who attended the event. House of Illuminati later stated that they would not host any future events. Coull deleted his LinkedIn profile, his YouTube channel, and his personal website in response to the controversy. A few days after the event, Connell said he felt that Coull was "probably one of the most disliked people in Glasgow right now". In an interview with The Sunday Times, Coull apologised for how the event turned out, saying he would accept responsibility. Fundraising In an interview with Wired magazine, Connell stated that he and the other actors were working with parents to provide a free show for the children who attended. Some items from the event were later auctioned for charity. The venue auctioned the leftover hand-written "event cancelled" sign, raising £850 for a local children's hospital, while the Monorail Music record store in Glasgow auctioned two of the backdrops "rescued from the bin by a pal of the shop" for £2,250, with the proceeds going to the Medical Aid for Palestinians charity. In popular culture A photo of a dispirited Paterson playing a Wonkidoodle in the "Jellybean Room" (a table covered in chemistry equipment) became a viral phenomenon. The image became a meme and was compared to a picture of a "meth lab" and to Édouard Manet's 1882 painting A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, which depicts "an alienated woman at work". The character of "The Unknown" was also featured in several memes, after appearing in a video recorded by a mother at the event, Maryanne McCormack. Some Twitter users expressed plans to dress up as the character for Halloween. The event was spoofed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in April 2024 in a skit called "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Part Two", featuring Freddie Highmore, who had played Charlie Bucket in the 2005 film adaptation of the novel. In February 2025, John Oliver compared the United States Department of Government Efficiency, then headed by Elon Musk, to the event due to their "stark disconnect between marketing and reality." On 6 March 2024, Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party and future Prime Minister, joked in the House of Commons that it seemed Jeremy Hunt, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, had been taking marketing lessons from the event, in reference to Hunt's promises regarding childcare. Similarly, Conservative MP Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons at the time, joked that she was under the impression that the Scottish National Party had organised the Glasgow event given its "high cost, poor return, and the fact that the police were called." An hour-long documentary about the event, called Wonka: The Scandal that Rocked Britain, was commissioned by Channel 5 on 6 March 2024 and broadcast on 16 March 2024. The programme included interviews with Coull and the actors from the event; Coull stated that "I have lost my friends. I've lost the love of my life. I was made out to be the face of all evil. And genuinely, that's really not the case." He also said he had received "hundreds and hundreds [of messages] calling me the most awful names saying I’m a villain, I’m a horrific dad, I’m better off dead, I should kill myself." The documentary received 2 stars out of 5 from The Guardian, which described it as having "the strong whiff of someone vastly overexplaining the joke" and that the "only real scoop" was the interview with Coull. Following the popularity of the event, Felicia Dawkins was offered the opportunity to train with the performance team and make a guest appearance acting in the London Dungeon, a haunted house attraction in London. A London Dungeon spokesperson said the aspiring actor who played The Unknown is "clearly a natural when it comes to the art of the scare". In April 2024, Kirsty Paterson appeared at a "Willy's Choc
