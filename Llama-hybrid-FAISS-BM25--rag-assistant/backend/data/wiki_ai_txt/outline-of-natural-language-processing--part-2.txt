ncludes many application oriented aspects of these. It is often called human language technology (HLT). Prerequisite technologies The following technologies make natural-language processing possible: Communication – the activity of a source sending a message to a receiver Language – Speech – Writing – Computing – Computers – Computer programming – Information extraction – User interface – Software – Text editing – program used to edit plain text files Word processing – piece of software used for composing, editing, formatting, printing documents Input devices – pieces of hardware for sending data to a computer to be processed Computer keyboard – typewriter style input device whose input is converted into various data depending on the circumstances Image scanners – Subfields of natural-language processing Information extraction (IE) – field concerned in general with the extraction of semantic information from text. This covers tasks such as named-entity recognition, coreference resolution, relationship extraction, etc. Ontology engineering – field that studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, which are formal representations of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Speech processing – field that covers speech recognition, text-to-speech and related tasks. Statistical natural-language processing – Statistical semantics – a subfield of computational semantics that establishes semantic relations between words to examine their contexts. Distributional semantics – a subfield of statistical semantics that examines the semantic relationship of words across a corpora or in large samples of data. Related fields Natural-language processing contributes to, and makes use of (the theories, tools, and methodologies from), the following fields: Automated reasoning – area of computer science and mathematical logic dedicated to understanding various aspects of reasoning, and producing software which allows computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. A sub-field of artificial intelligence, automatic reasoning is also grounded in theoretical computer science and philosophy of mind. Linguistics – scientific study of human language. Natural-language processing requires understanding of the structure and application of language, and therefore it draws heavily from linguistics. Applied linguistics – interdisciplinary field of study that identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied linguistics are education, linguistics, psychology, computer science, anthropology, and sociology. Some of the subfields of applied linguistics relevant to natural-language processing are: Bilingualism / Multilingualism – Computer-mediated communication (CMC) – any communicative transaction that occurs through the use of two or more networked computers. Research on CMC focuses largely on the social effects of different computer-supported communication technologies. Many recent studies involve Internet-based social networking supported by social software. Contrastive linguistics – practice-oriented linguistic approach that seeks to describe the differences and similarities between a pair of languages. Conversation analysis (CA) – approach to the study of social interaction, embracing both verbal and non-verbal conduct, in situations of everyday life. Turn-taking is one aspect of language use that is studied by CA. Discourse analysis – various approaches to analyzing written, vocal, or sign language use or any significant semiotic event. Forensic linguistics – application of linguistic knowledge, methods and insights to the forensic context of law, language, crime investigation, trial, and judicial procedure. Interlinguistics – study of improving communications between people of different first languages with the use of ethnic and auxiliary languages (lingua franca). For instance by use of intentional
