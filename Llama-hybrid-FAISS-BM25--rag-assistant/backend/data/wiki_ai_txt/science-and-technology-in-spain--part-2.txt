 some of the programs included in the National Plans. The following OPI's are attached to the Ministry of Science and Innovation: Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT). Geological and Mining Institute of Spain (IGME). Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). National Institute of Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA). Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC), in which the Government of the Canary Islands also participates. The following OPI's are attached to other ministerial departments: Hydrodynamic Experimental Channel of El Pardo (CEHIPAR). Center for Sociological Research (CIS). Centre for Political and Constitutional Studies (CEPC). Center for Public Works Studies and Experimentation (CEDEX). R&D Centers under the General Directorate of Armament and Material (DGAM) of the Ministry of Defense (MINISDEF). Institute of Fiscal Studies (IEF). Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII). National Geographic Institute (IGN). National Institute for Research and Training on Drugs (INIFD). State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). National Institute of Aerospace Technology (INTA) National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences (INTCF). Within the national territory The Advisory Committee for Singular Infrastructures (until 2006 called the Advisory Committee for Large Scientific Facilities, CAGIC) distinguishes between two types of Scientific and Technological Facilities: Large Scientific Facilities (GIC) and Medium Size Facilities (ITM). Their recognition as such is the responsibility of the Interministerial Commission for Science and Technology (CICYT). Singular Scientific and Technical Infrastructures (ICTS) Singular Scientific and Technical Infrastructure (ICTS) refers to a facility that is unique or exceptional in Spain, that requires a relatively high investment cost, and that its importance in research or development justifies its availability. At present, the following facilities are recognized as Spanish ICTS (outdated list): Spanish Antarctic Bases. Oceanographic Research Vessel Hespérides. Cornide de Saavedra Oceanographic Vessel. Yebes Astronomical Center. TJ-II Thermonuclear Fusion Device. CISA High Biological Security Facility. Singular Civil Engineering Installations of CEDEX. CESGA FinisTerrae Supercomputer. MareNostrum and MinoTauro supercomputers of the National Supercomputing Center. Fine Chemical Plant of Catalonia. Almeria Solar Platform. Catalonia Computing and Communications Center. RedIRIS. Nuclear magnetic resonance laboratory of the Barcelona Science Park. Clean Room of the National Microelectronics Center. Technology Center of the Institute of Optoelectronic Systems of the Polytechnic University of Madrid. Fauna and Flora Collections of the Museum of Natural Sciences and the Royal Botanical Garden. ALBA Synchrotron Light Laboratory. Oceanic Platform of the Canary Islands. In addition, these are ICTS located in Spain, but with international participation: Calar Alto Astronomical Center. Teide Observatory. Roque de los Muchachos Observatory. Institut de radioastronomie millimétrique. Gran Telescopio Canarias. Medium Size Installations (MSI) A Medium Size Installation is defined as an Installation that is unique in Spain, requiring an investment cost of between 3 and 8 million euros and a maintenance cost of more than half a million euros per year. Outside the national territory, with Spanish participation Spain participates in several international scientific programs and organizations. The benefit obtained from this participation is twofold: on the one hand, Spanish scientists can use the facilities for the development of their projects; on the other hand, the business network has the opportunity to make important business contracts. Some of the facilities in which Spain participates are: European Space Agency. European Laboratory for Particle Physics. European Molecular Biology Laboratory. European Synchrotron
