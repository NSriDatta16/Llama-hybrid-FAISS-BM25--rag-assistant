 timeline, Diana cannot be located, Victor Stone has not gained his abilities yet, and Arthur Curry never existed. They travel to Wayne Manor, hoping to find Bruce, but they instead find an alternate version who has long retired. Bruce theorizes that altering history via time travel affected events both before and after the alteration, which has also caused several realities to collapse into one. They convince Bruce to return as Batman and help them find Kal-El / Superman. The Barrys and Bruce locate a Kryptonian pod discovered in Siberia. Upon arrival, they instead find Kal-El's cousin, Kara Zor-El, imprisoned in the facility. They rescue Kara and return to Wayne Manor, where Barry enlists Bruce's help to regain his powers. The first two attempts fail, prompting Kara to fly Barry into a storm, where he regains his powers. Kara, Bruce, and the Barrys fight Zod and his forces. Kara learns that Zod had intercepted Kal-El's escape pod from Krypton and, attempting to extract the Codex needed to repopulate the Kryptonian species, killed him. Zod reveals that the Codex is actually within Kara before subduing and killing her, extracting the Codex from her blood. Meanwhile, Bruce sacrifices himself in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Zod's ship. The Barrys repeatedly time-travel to save Bruce and Kara, but keep failing. Barry realizes the sequence of events cannot be changed, but 2013-Barry keeps trying, which causes the multiverse to begin imploding. The unknown speedster who initially knocked Barry out of the Speed Force returns and is revealed to be an older, future version of 2013-Barry who still believes he can defeat Zod and save his Earth. Barry decides to reverse the changes he made to the timeline by letting Nora die. The elder 2013-Barry attempts to kill Barry to stop him, but young 2013-Barry sacrifices himself and is impaled instead, causing the elder 2013-Barry to fade from existence. Barry reverts the timeline and comes to terms with his mother's death; however, he subtly alters the past by moving the canned tomatoes to a higher shelf. Returning to the present day, Barry attends Henry's court hearing, where the security footage now reveals Henry looking up to grab the can, allowing for his exoneration. Barry is then contacted by Bruce, whose appearance has changed once again due to the timeline alteration. Cast Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash:A police forensic investigator from Central City and member of the Justice League who can move at superhuman speeds using the Speed Force. Miller described Barry as multi-dimensional, with human flaws. Miller also portrays an alternate younger version of Barry from 2013, with producer Barbara Muschietti describing the pair as a "delicious odd couple", and a corrupted older version of 2013-Barry known as the Dark Flash who became obsessed with reversing time and is caught in a time loop.

Sasha Calle as Kara Zor-El / Supergirl:A powerful Kryptonian from an alternative universe who possesses powers, abilities, and a costume similar to her cousin, Kal-El / Superman.

Michael Shannon as General Zod:A Kryptonian general who possesses the same powers as Superman and was killed by him in Man of Steel (2013).
