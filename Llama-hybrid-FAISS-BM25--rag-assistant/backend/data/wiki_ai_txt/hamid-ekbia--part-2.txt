tive science, and international studies with the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington. He was also founding director of the Center for Research on Mediated Interaction. In 2022 Ekbia took a new position as university professor at Syracuse University and director of the Syracuse University Autonomous Systems Policy Institute in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. Ekbia was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of West Bohemia in 2022. Ideas Ekbia's body of research is tied together by a focus on the complexly mediated relations between humans, computing technologies, and the socio-economic, cultural, and geopolitical forces that shape our world. In his book Artificial Dreams: The Quest for Non-Biological Intelligence (2008) he introduced the notion of the attribution fallacy—the propensity for human beings to over-attribute intelligence to artifacts in unwarranted ways, similar to how we anthropomorphize our pets, toys, or other objects and phenomena. The term provides meaningful language to critique the overpromising, underdelivering nature of AI systems. His concept of heteromation accounts for transformations in the division of labor between humans and machines which have coincided with technological advances in recent decades. He co-authored the book Heteromation and Other Stories of Computing and Capitalism (2017) with Bonnie A. Nardi.{ Political economy of computing Ekbia has introduced and is developing a new area of study, which he refers to as the "political economy of computing". He approaches it as a dynamic relationship between computing and the capitalist economy. He envisions the study of the interactions between computing and the economy as a recursive process that would start at the macro scale of the social and historical (world-economies, nation-states, law, trade, infrastructures, crisis, etc.), move to the meso level of the institutional and organizational (firms, markets, platforms, innovation, jobs, automation, etc.) and finally zoom in on the micro level of the personal and psychological (affect, attention, labor, value, privacy, etc.).{ Heteromation Ekbia, together with Bonnie A. Nardi, introduced the term "heteromation" to grasp the practice of extraction of economic value from low-cost or free labor in computer-mediated networks. Heteromation is the third stage in the process of division of labor between humans and machines, following automation and augmentation.{ In his book Heteromation and Other Stories of Computing and Capitalism (2017), he argues rather than simply automating tasks that were once performed by humans, digital technologies increasingly perform heteromation by pushing the workload of critical tasks onto end users, who come to act as indispensable mediators in processes of capitalist accumulation. Artificial intelligence Ekbia studies artificial intelligence (AI) from a socio-philosophical perspective, exploring the metaphors and language surrounding it. According to him, a great deal of confusion has currently been created through the use of "AI" as an umbrella term for a set of related technologies that are sold to the public as snake oil. The confusion, in turn, gives rise to policies and practices pursued by various social institutions (governments, businesses, media, judiciary bodies, funding agencies, etc.) the outcomes of which feed back into the underlying misconceptions about AI, generating even more confusion — a vicious cycle that seems to reproduce itself without end and without a driving vision on the horizon, let alone taking responsibility for it. The current fever about AI, which fuels these policies and practices, is symptomatic of a paradoxical situation where, on the one hand, technological innovations that, in the words of Edmund Husserl, "we can never cease to admire," allow us to tackle a wide range of health, medical, and environmental problems in a novel fashion, while, on the ot
