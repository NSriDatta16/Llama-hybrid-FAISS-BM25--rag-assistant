 the model to specific tasks is typically done with supervised learning, either by fine-tuning the model / representations with the labels as the signal, or freezing the representations and training an additional model which takes them as an input. Many self-supervised training schemes have been developed for use in representation learning of various modalities, often first showing successful application in text or image before being transferred to other data types. Text Word2vec is a word embedding technique which learns to represent words through self-supervision over each word and its neighboring words in a sliding window across a large corpus of text. The model has two possible training schemes to produce word vector representations, one generative and one contrastive. The first is word prediction given each of the neighboring words as an input. The second is training on the representation similarity for neighboring words and representation dissimilarity for random pairs of words. A limitation of word2vec is that only the pairwise co-occurrence structure of the data is used, and not the ordering or entire set of context words. More recent transformer-based representation learning approaches attempt to solve this with word prediction tasks. GPTs pretrain on next word prediction using prior input words as context, whereas BERT masks random tokens in order to provide bidirectional context. Other self-supervised techniques extend word embeddings by finding representations for larger text structures such as sentences or paragraphs in the input data. Doc2vec extends the generative training approach in word2vec by adding an additional input to the word prediction task based on the paragraph it is within, and is therefore intended to represent paragraph level context. Image The domain of image representation learning has employed many different self-supervised training techniques, including transformation, inpainting, patch discrimination and clustering. Examples of generative approaches are Context Encoders, which trains an AlexNet CNN architecture to generate a removed image region given the masked image as input, and iGPT, which applies the GPT-2 language model architecture to images by training on pixel prediction after reducing the image resolution. Many other self-supervised methods use siamese networks, which generate different views of the image through various augmentations that are then aligned to have similar representations. The challenge is avoiding collapsing solutions where the model encodes all images to the same representation. SimCLR is a contrastive approach which uses negative examples in order to generate image representations with a ResNet CNN. Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) removes the need for negative samples by encoding one of the views with a slow moving average of the model parameters as they are being modified during training. Graph The goal of many graph representation learning techniques is to produce an embedded representation of each node based on the overall network topology. node2vec extends the word2vec training technique to nodes in a graph by using co-occurrence in random walks through the graph as the measure of association. Another approach is to maximize mutual information, a measure of similarity, between the representations of associated structures within the graph. An example is Deep Graph Infomax, which uses contrastive self-supervision based on mutual information between the representation of a "patch" around each node, and a summary representation of the entire graph. Negative samples are obtained by pairing the graph representation with either representations from another graph in a multigraph training setting, or corrupted patch representations in single graph training. Video With analogous results in masked prediction and clustering, video representation learning approaches are often similar to image techniques but must utilize the temporal sequence of video frames as an addition
