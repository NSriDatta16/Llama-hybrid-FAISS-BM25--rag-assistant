media with the intent of humiliating or otherwise harming the participants, may be fined, imprisoned for up to 5 years or both. A newer version of bill was introduced in 2021 which would have required any "advanced technological false personation records" to contain a watermark and an audiovisual disclosure to identify and explain any altered audio and visual elements. The bill also includes that failure to disclose this information with intent to harass or humiliate a person with an "advanced technological false personation record" containing sexual content "shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both." However this bill has since died in 2023. In the United Kingdom, the Law Commission for England and Wales recommended reform to criminalise sharing of deepfake pornography in 2022. In 2023, the government announced amendments to the Online Safety Bill to that end. The Online Safety Act 2023 amends the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to criminalise sharing intimate images that shows or "appears to show" another (thus including deepfake images) without consent. In 2024, the Government announced that an offence criminalising the production of deepfake pornographic images would be included in the Criminal Justice Bill of 2024. The bill did not pass before Parliament was dissolved before the general election. In South Korea, the creation, distribution, or possession of deepfake pornography is classified as a sex crime, with a mandatory prison sentence between three and seven years as part of the country's Special Act on Sexual Violence Crimes. Controlling the distribution While the legal landscape remains undeveloped, victims of deepfake pornography have several tools available to contain and remove content, including securing removal through a court order, intellectual property tools like the DMCA takedown, reporting for terms and conditions violations of the hosting platform, and removal by reporting the content to search engines. Several major online platforms have taken steps to ban deepfake pornography. As of 2018, gfycat, reddit, Twitter, Discord, and Pornhub have all prohibited the uploading and sharing of deepfake pornographic content on their platforms. In September of that same year, Google also added "involuntary synthetic pornographic imagery" to its ban list, allowing individuals to request the removal of such content from search results.
