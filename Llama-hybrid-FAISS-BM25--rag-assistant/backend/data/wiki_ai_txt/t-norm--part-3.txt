For any left-continuous t-norm ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } , there is a unique binary operation ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } on [0, 1] such that ⊤ ( z , x ) ≤ y {\displaystyle \top (z,x)\leq y} if and only if z ≤ ( x ⇒ y ) {\displaystyle z\leq (x\Rightarrow y)} for all x, y, z in [0, 1]. This operation is called the residuum of the t-norm. In prefix notation, the residuum of a t-norm ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } is often denoted by ⊤ → {\displaystyle {\vec {\top }}} or by the letter R. The interval [0, 1] equipped with a t-norm and its residuum forms a residuated lattice. The relation between a t-norm T and its residuum R is an instance of adjunction (specifically, a Galois connection): the residuum forms a right adjoint R(x, –) to the functor T(–, x) for each x in the lattice [0, 1] taken as a poset category. In the standard semantics of t-norm based fuzzy logics, where conjunction is interpreted by a t-norm, the residuum plays the role of implication (often called R-implication). Basic properties of residua If ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } is the residuum of a left-continuous t-norm ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } , then ( x ⇒ y ) = sup { z ∣ ⊤ ( z , x ) ≤ y } . {\displaystyle (x\Rightarrow y)=\sup\{z\mid \top (z,x)\leq y\}.} Consequently, for all x, y in the unit interval, ( x ⇒ y ) = 1 {\displaystyle (x\Rightarrow y)=1} if and only if x ≤ y {\displaystyle x\leq y} and ( 1 ⇒ y ) = y . {\displaystyle (1\Rightarrow y)=y.} If ∗ {\displaystyle *} is a left-continuous t-norm and ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } its residuum, then min ( x , y ) ≥ x ∗ ( x ⇒ y ) max ( x , y ) = min ( ( x ⇒ y ) ⇒ y , ( y ⇒ x ) ⇒ x ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcl}\min(x,y)&\geq &x*(x\Rightarrow y)\\\max(x,y)&=&\min((x\Rightarrow y)\Rightarrow y,(y\Rightarrow x)\Rightarrow x).\end{array}}} If ∗ {\displaystyle *} is continuous, then equality holds in the former. Residua of common left-continuous t-norms If x ≤ y, then R(x, y) = 1 for any residuum R. The following table therefore gives the values of prominent residua only for x > y. T-conorms T-conorms (also called S-norms) are dual to t-norms under the order-reversing operation that assigns 1 – x to x on [0, 1]. Given a t-norm ⊤ {\displaystyle \top } , the complementary conorm is defined by ⊥ ( a , b ) = 1 − ⊤ ( 1 − a , 1 − b ) . {\displaystyle \bot (a,b)=1-\top (1-a,1-b).} This generalizes De Morgan's laws. It follows that a t-conorm satisfies the following conditions, which can be used for an equivalent axiomatic definition of t-conorms independently of t-norms: Commutativity: ⊥(a, b) = ⊥(b, a) Monotonicity: ⊥(a, b) ≤ ⊥(c, d) if a ≤ c and b ≤ d Associativity: ⊥(a, ⊥(b, c)) = ⊥(⊥(a, b), c) Identity element: ⊥(a, 0) = a T-conorms are used to represent logical disjunction in fuzzy logic and union in fuzzy set theory. Examples of t-conorms Important t-conorms are those dual to prominent t-norms: Maximum t-conorm ⊥ m a x ( a , b ) = max { a , b } {\displaystyle \bot _{\mathrm {max} }(a,b)=\max\{a,b\}} , dual to the minimum t-norm, is the smallest t-conorm (see the properties of t-conorms below). It is the standard semantics for disjunction in Gödel fuzzy logic and for weak disjunction in all t-norm based fuzzy logics. Probabilistic sum ⊥ s u m ( a , b ) = a + b − a ⋅ b = 1 − ( 1 − a ) ⋅ ( 1 − b ) {\displaystyle \bot _{\mathrm {sum} }(a,b)=a+b-a\cdot b=1-(1-a)\cdot (1-b)} is dual to the product t-norm. In probability theory it expresses the probability of the union of independent events. It is also the standard semantics for strong disjunction in such extensions of product fuzzy logic in which it is definable (e.g., those containing involutive negation). Bounded sum ⊥ L u k ( a , b ) = min { a + b , 1 } {\displaystyle \bot _{\mathrm {Luk} }(a,b)=\min\{a+b,1\}} is dual to the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It is the standard semantics for strong disjunction in Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic. Drastic t-conorm ⊥ D ( a , b ) = { b if a = 0 a if b = 0 1 otherwise, {\displaystyle \bot _{\mathrm {D} }(a,b)={\begin{cases}b&{\mbox{if }}a=0\\a
