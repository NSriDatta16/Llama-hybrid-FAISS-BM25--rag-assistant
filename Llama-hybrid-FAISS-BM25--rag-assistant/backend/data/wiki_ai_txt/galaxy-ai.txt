Galaxy AI is a collection of artificial intelligence (AI) features developed by Samsung Electronics for use in Galaxy-branded mobile devices. First released with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series in January 2024, the system integrates both on-device and cloud-based processing to support features such as language translation, image editing, and content search. These tools operate within various Samsung applications and are intended to assist with everyday tasks. Overview Galaxy AI integrates Samsung’s own AI models with external technologies, including Google's Gemini AI, to provide a variety of context-sensitive functions. These include tools for language translation, media editing, and task automation. They are available within specific Samsung applications. Features Galaxy AI includes multiple tools that apply artificial intelligence to specific user tasks, such as communication, notetaking, photography, and productivity. Each tool is categorized by function and operates within Samsung’s software environment. Communication Call Assist Provides translation-related features within the default Phone app on supported Galaxy devices. It includes Live Translate, which enables two-way voice and text translation during calls, and Text Call, which converts speech into real-time text and generates responses. These tools aim to support communication across different languages and offer alternatives to voice-based interaction. Text Call does not involve AI processing and is available on all devices supporting One UI 6.1 or later. Writing Assist A feature integrated into the Samsung Keyboard that supports tasks such as translation, sentence composition, and text correction. It offers tools for adjusting phrasing, grammar, and tone across supported apps, including messaging and email platforms. Suggested replies may also be generated based on context. Interpreter A translation feature on Galaxy devices running One UI 6.1 or later, offering real-time spoken and on-screen translations for two-way face-to-face conversations. It supports over a dozen languages and includes a screen-flip view so each speaker can read translations in their own language. Offline use is available with downloaded language packs.

Gemini Live A multimodal AI feature included in the Galaxy AI suite, powered by Google Gemini. It enables interaction through voice, camera input, and screen sharing, supporting tasks such as object recognition, text translation, and content analysis.
