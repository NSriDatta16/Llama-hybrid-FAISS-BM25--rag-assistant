ized datasets, when aggregated, can enable re-identification of vulnerable populations through the mosaic effect. The Centre outlines four types of mosaic-based attacks: database cross-match, specific individual match, arbitrary individual match, and group-level targeting—each with distinct goals and risks. These digital mosaics include information about transactions, communications, locations, and relationships, collected through routine interactions. Identifiers such as names, pseudonyms, and digital traces that are not only self-generated but also co-constructed through engaging with systems, institutions, and other people—together forming a collaborative mosaic of digital identity. Personal data also includes content shared by others—such as social media tags, public records, workplace profiles, or bystander videos—that, while seemingly harmless alone, collectively revealing sensitive details through aggregation. Legal scholar Benjamin Wittes argues that traditional understandings of privacy are insufficient to capture the risks posed by aggregated personal data. He describes the modern data environment as a mosaic of digital fingerprints encompassing nearly every aspect of human life. Wittes identifies behavioral and targeted advertising as private-sector counterparts to government data-mining, raising similar concerns under databuse logic. Advertising/behavioral targeting Personal data is used to build detailed identity portraits for purposes ranging from criminal activity to targeted advertising. Anonymization Removing explicit identifiers from datasets does not guarantee anonymity, as individuals can often be re-identified by linking demographic details with external information. The publication of beneficial ownership data in public records increases the risk of re-identification, as the mosaic effect allows the combination of anonymized or de-identified datasets from different sources to reveal individual identities. Aggregating beneficial ownership data with information from social media and location metadata can expose individuals to security threats, including risks such as kidnapping and extortion. Combinations like ZIP code, gender, and date of birth can uniquely identify the majority of U.S. residents, showing that anonymized data is still vulnerable to the mosaic effect. Location data spanning two to three months can enable analytic programs to identify a person's home or workplace, while a single day's data lacks predictive value. In this research, Latanya Sweeney discovered 87 percent of Americans could be uniquely identified by their zip code, combined with only gender and date of birth. Predictive analytics can identify sensitive locations such as stash houses from three months of geolocation data, exemplifying the mosaic effect in action. Scholars have warned that aggregated surveillance data can retrospectively reconstruct an individual's movements and behavior over time—a concern described as the "time-machine" problem. Even datasets that have been anonymized or pseudonymized can result in the exposure of identity traits when combined with auxiliary data, posing political and physical risks in fragile contexts. Empirical research demonstrates that it is possible to assemble a comprehensive profile of individuals by linking information from multiple government sources, illustrating the operational risks associated with the mosaic effect. The wide scale collection of big data makes it unrealistic for individuals to know what is being gathered about them. Rosenzweig termed big data surveillance "dataveillance", characterizing it as a novel form of knowledge creation through aggregation, distinct from individual surveillance events. Even when privacy techniques such as k-anonymity are used to group records and mask identifying details, the process is vulnerable if data publishers fail to anticipate which attributes can be linked with external information. Seemingly neutral identifiers, such as national ID o
