Industrial big data refers to a large amount of diversified time series generated at a high speed by industrial equipment, known as the Internet of things. The term emerged in 2012 along with the concept of "Industry 4.0”, and refers to big data”, popular in information technology marketing, in that data created by industrial equipment might hold more potential business value. Industrial big data takes advantage of industrial Internet technology. It uses raw data to support management decision making, so to reduce costs in maintenance and improve customer service. Please see intelligent maintenance system for more reference. Definition Big data refers to data generated in high volume, high variety, and high velocity that require new technologies of processing to enable better decision making, knowledge discovery and process optimization. Sometimes, the feature of veracity is also added to emphasize the quality and integrity of the data. However, for industrial big data, there should be two more "V’s". One is visibility, which refers to the discovery of unexpected insights of the existing assets and/or processes and in this way transferring invisible knowledge to visible value. The other "V" is value. Background General "Big Data" analytics often focuses on the mining of relationships and capturing the phenomena. Yet "Industrial Big Data" analytics is more interested in finding the physical root cause behind features extracted from the phenomena. This means effective "Industrial Big Data" analytics will require more domain know-how than general "Big Data" analytics. Broken Compared to "Big Data" analytics, "Industrial Big Data" analytics favors the "completeness" of data over the "volume" of the data, which means that in order to construct an accurate data-driven analytical system, it is necessary to prepare data from different working conditions. Due to communication issues and multiple sources, data from the system might be discrete and un-synchronized. That is why pre-processing is an important procedure before actually analyzing the data to make sure that the data are complete, continuous and synchronized. Bad-Quality The focus of "Big Data" analytics is mining and discovering, which means that the volume of the data might compensate the low-quality of the data. However, for "Industrial Big Data", since variables usually possess clear physical meanings, data integrity is of vital importance to the development of the analytical system. Low-quality data or incorrect recordings will alter the relationship between different variables and will have a catastrophic impact on the estimation accuracy. Technologies Data acquisition, storage and management As data from automated industrial equipment are being generated at an extraordinary speed and volume, the infrastructure of storing and managing these data becomes the first challenge any industry will face. Different from the tradition business intelligence which mostly focuses on internal structured data and processes that information in regularly occurring cycles, "Industrial Big Data” analytical system requires near real-time analytics and visualization of the results. The first step is to collect the right data. Since the automation level of modern equipment is getting higher, data are being generated from an increasing number of sensors. Recognizing the parameters are related to equipment status is important to reducing the amount of data necessary to be collected and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of data analytics. The next step is to build a data management system that will be able to handle large amounts of data and perform analytics in near real-time. In order to enable rapid decision making, data storage, management and processing need to be more integrated. General Electric has built a prototype data storage infrastructure for fleet of gas turbines. The developed in-memory data grids (IMDG)-based system was proved to be able to handle challenging high velocit
