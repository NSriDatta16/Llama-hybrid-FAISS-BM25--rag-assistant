 environment. What a Web server is to the Internet, a model server is to AI. Where a Web server receives an HTTP request and returns data about a Web site, a model server receives data, and returns a decision or prediction about that data: e.g. sent an image, a model server might return a label for that image, identifying faces or animals in photographs. The SKIL model server is able to import models from Python frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, Theano and CNTK, overcoming a major barrier in deploying deep learning models. Benchmarks Deeplearning4j is as fast as Caffe for non-trivial image recognition tasks using multiple GPUs. For programmers unfamiliar with HPC on the JVM, there are several parameters that must be adjusted to optimize neural network training time. These include setting the heap space, the garbage collection algorithm, employing off-heap memory and pre-saving data (pickling) for faster ETL. Together, these optimizations can lead to a 10x acceleration in performance with Deeplearning4j. API Languages: Java, Scala, Python, Clojure & Kotlin Deeplearning4j can be used via multiple API languages including Java, Scala, Python, Clojure and Kotlin. Its Scala API is called ScalNet. Keras serves as its Python API. And its Clojure wrapper is known as DL4CLJ. The core languages performing the large-scale mathematical operations necessary for deep learning are C, C++ and CUDA C. Tensorflow, Keras & Deeplearning4j Tensorflow, Keras and Deeplearning4j work together. Deeplearning4j can import models from Tensorflow and other Python frameworks if they have been created with Keras.
