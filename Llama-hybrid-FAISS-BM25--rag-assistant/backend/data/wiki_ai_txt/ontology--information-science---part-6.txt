Libraries The development of ontologies has led to the emergence of services providing lists or directories of ontologies called ontology libraries. The following are libraries of human-selected ontologies. COLORE is an open repository of first-order ontologies in Common Logic with formal links between ontologies in the repository. DAML Ontology Library maintains a legacy of ontologies in DAML. Ontology Design Patterns portal is a wiki repository of reusable components and practices for ontology design, and also maintains a list of exemplary ontologies. Protégé Ontology Library contains a set of OWL, Frame-based and other format ontologies. SchemaWeb is a directory of RDF schemata expressed in RDFS, OWL and DAML+OIL. The following are both directories and search engines. OBO Foundry is a suite of interoperable reference ontologies in biology and biomedicine. Bioportal (ontology repository of NCBO) Linked Open Vocabularies OntoSelect Ontology Library offers similar services for RDF/S, DAML and OWL ontologies. Ontaria is a "searchable and browsable directory of semantic web data" with a focus on RDF vocabularies with OWL ontologies. (NB Project "on hold" since 2004). Swoogle is a directory and search engine for all RDF resources available on the Web, including ontologies. Open Ontology Repository initiative ROMULUS is a foundational ontology repository aimed at improving semantic interoperability. Currently there are three foundational ontologies in the repository: DOLCE, BFO and GFO. Examples of applications In general, ontologies can be used beneficially in several fields. Enterprise applications. A more concrete example is SAPPHIRE (Health care) or Situational Awareness and Preparedness for Public Health Incidences and Reasoning Engines which is a semantics-based health information system capable of tracking and evaluating situations and occurrences that may affect public health. Geographic information systems bring together data from different sources and benefit therefore from ontological metadata which helps
