poses the learner to a variety of experiences rather than trying to fit to reality. The setup for Dactyl, aside from having motion tracking cameras, also has RGB cameras to allow the robot to manipulate an arbitrary object by seeing it. In 2018, OpenAI showed that the system was able to manipulate a cube and an octagonal prism. In 2019, OpenAI demonstrated that Dactyl could solve a Rubik's Cube. The robot was able to solve the puzzle 60% of the time. Objects like the Rubik's Cube introduce complex physics that is harder to model. OpenAI did this by improving the robustness of Dactyl to perturbations by using Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR), a simulation approach of generating progressively more difficult environments. ADR differs from manual domain randomization by not needing a human to specify randomization ranges. API In June 2020, OpenAI announced a multi-purpose API which it said was "for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI" to let developers call on it for "any English language AI task". AgentKit On October 6, 2025, Sam Altman announced OpenAI's new AgentKit at the 2025 Dev Day opening keynote. AgentKit is a new integrated suite of tools for building, deploying and optimizing AI agents. According to OpenAI, AgentKit builds upon its Responses API released in March, offering a more streamlined approach to agent creation. Several early adopters report significant time savings and efficiency gains when using the new agentic tools. Text generation The company has popularized generative pretrained transformers (GPT). OpenAI's original GPT model ("GPT-1") The original paper on generative pre-training of a transformer-based language model was written by Alec Radford and his colleagues, and published as a preprint on OpenAI's website on June 11, 2018. It showed how a generative model of language could acquire world knowledge and process long-range dependencies by pre-training on a diverse corpus with long stretches of contiguous text. GPT-2 Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 ("GPT-2") is an unsupervised transformer language model and the successor to OpenAI's original GPT model ("GPT-1"). GPT-2 was announced in February 2019, with only limited demonstrative versions initially released to the public. The full version of GPT-2 was not immediately released due to concerns about potential misuse, including applications for writing fake news. Some experts expressed skepticism that GPT-2 posed a significant threat. In response to GPT-2, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence responded with a tool to detect "neural fake news". Other researchers, such as Jeremy Howard, warned of "the technology to totally fill Twitter, email, and the web up with reasonable-sounding, context-appropriate prose, which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter". In November 2019, OpenAI released the complete version of the GPT-2 language model. Several websites host interactive demonstrations of different instances of GPT-2 and other transformer models. GPT-2's authors argue that unsupervised language models are general-purpose learners, illustrated by GPT-2 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and perplexity on 7 of 8 zero-shot tasks (i.e., the model was not further trained on any task-specific input-output examples). The corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly 40 gigabytes of text from URLs shared in Reddit submissions with at least 3 upvotes. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using byte pair encoding. This permits representing any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens. GPT-3 First described in May 2020, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an unsupervised transformer language model and the successor to GPT-2. OpenAI stated that the full version of GPT-3 contained 175 billion parameters, two orders of magnitude larger than the 1.5 billion in the full version of GPT-2 (although GPT-3 models with as few a
