illance can do just that. Predictive policing allows police to intervene in potential crimes to create safer communities and better understand potential threats. Businesses also rely on dataveillance to help them understand the online activity for potential clients by tracking their online activity. By tracking their online activity through cookies, as well as various other methods, businesses are able to better understand what sort of advertisements work with their existing and potential clients. While making online transactions users often give away their information freely which is later used by the company for corporate or private interests. For businesses this information can help boost sales and attract attention towards their products to help generate revenue. Cons On the other hand, there are many concerns that arise with dataveillance. Dataveillance assumes that our technologies and data are a true reflection of ourselves. This presents itself as a potential concern. This becomes a critical concern when associated with the surveillance of criminal suspects and terrorist groups. Authorities who monitor these suspects would then assume that the data they have collected reflects their actions. This helps to understand potential or past threats for criminals as well. There is also the lack of transparency and privacy regarding companies who collect and share their user's data. This is a critical issue with both the trust and belief of the data and its uses. Many social networks have argued that their users forfeit part of their privacy in order to provide their service for free. Several of these companies choose not to fully disclose what data is collected and who it is shared with. When data is volunteered to companies it is difficult to know what companies have gained data about you and your online activity. Much of an individual's data is shared with websites and social networks in order to provide a more customized marketing experience. Many of those social networks may share your information with intelligence agencies and authorities, without a user's knowledge. Since the recent scandal involving Edward Snowden and National Security Agency, it has been revealed that authorities may have access to more data from various devices and platforms. It has become very difficult to know what will happen with your data or what specifically has been collected. It is also important to recognize that while online users are worried about their information, many of those same worries are not always applied to their activities or behavior. With social networks collecting a large amount of personal data such as birth date, legal name, sex, and photos there is an issue of dataveillance compromising confidentiality. Ultimately, dataveillance can compromise online anonymity. Despite dataveillance compromising anonymity, anonymity itself presents a crucial issue. Online criminals who steal users' data and information may exploit it for their own gain. Tactics used by online users to conceal their identity, make it difficult for others to track the criminal behavior and identify those responsible. Having unique identifiers such as IP addresses allows for the identification of users actions, which are often used to track illegal online activity such as piracy. While dataveillance may help businesses market their products to existing and potential clients, there are concerns over how and who has access to customer data. When visiting a business's website, cookies are often installed onto users' devices. Cookies have been a new way for businesses to obtain data on potential customers, since it allows them to track their online activities. Companies may also look to sell information they have collected on their clients to third parties. Since clients are not notified about these transactions it becomes difficult to know where your data has been sold. Furthermore, since dataveillance is discrete, clients are very unlikely to know the exact nat
