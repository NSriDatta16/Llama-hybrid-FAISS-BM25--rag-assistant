s like Loab are representative of the "limitations of AI image-generator models" and was more concerned about the urban legends that are born from such "boring" innocuous things and how easily "other people take these things seriously". Carly Cassella for ScienceAlert described Loab as a "modern day tronie" that isn't representative of something that is an actual person, but just a concept or idea, similar but distinct from tronies like the Girl With A Pearl Earring. Wired's Joel Warner argued that Loab is only the beginning and that, with AI text generators such as ChatGPT becoming more commonplace, a "linguistic version of Loab" will emerge in that space as well and begin creating ideas through "intentional prompts" or otherwise that will be as disturbing as The 120 Days of Sodom.
