y and thus have an ethical obligation to be transparent in their efforts. Organizations like Hugging Face and EleutherAI have been actively open-sourcing AI software. Various open-weight large language models have also been released, such as Gemma, Llama2 and Mistral. However, making code open source does not make it comprehensible, which by many definitions means that the AI code is not transparent. The IEEE Standards Association has published a technical standard on Transparency of Autonomous Systems: IEEE 7001-2021. The IEEE effort identifies multiple scales of transparency for different stakeholders. There are also concerns that releasing AI models may lead to misuse. For example, Microsoft has expressed concern about allowing universal access to its face recognition software, even for those who can pay for it. Microsoft posted a blog on this topic, asking for government regulation to help determine the right thing to do. Furthermore, open-weight AI models can be fine-tuned to remove any countermeasure, until the AI model complies with dangerous requests, without any filtering. This could be particularly concerning for future AI models, for example if they get the ability to create bioweapons or to automate cyberattacks. OpenAI, initially committed to an open-source approach to the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), eventually switched to a closed-source approach, citing competitiveness and safety reasons. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's former chief AGI scientist, said in 2023 "we were wrong", expecting that the safety reasons for not open-sourcing the most potent AI models will become "obvious" in a few years. Strain on open knowledge platforms In April 2023, Wired reported that Stack Overflow, a popular programming help forum with over 50 million questions and answers, planned to begin charging large AI developers for access to its content. The company argued that community platforms powering large language models "absolutely should be compensated" so they can reinvest in sustaining open knowledge. Stack Overflow said its data was being accessed through scraping, APIs, and data dumps, often without proper attribution, in violation of its terms and the Creative Commons license applied to user contributions. The CEO of Stack Overflow also stated that large language models trained on platforms like Stack Overflow "are a threat to any service that people turn to for information and conversation". Aggressive AI crawlers have increasingly overloaded open-source infrastructure, "causing what amounts to persistent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on vital public resources", according to a March 2025 Ars Technica article. Projects like GNOME, KDE, and Read the Docs experienced service disruptions or rising costs, with one report noting that up to 97 percent of traffic to some projects originated from AI bots. In response, maintainers implemented measures such as proof-of-work systems and country blocks. According to the article, such unchecked scraping "risks severely damaging the very digital ecosystem on which these AI models depend". In April 2025, the Wikimedia Foundation reported that automated scraping by AI bots was placing strain on its infrastructure. Since early 2024, bandwidth usage had increased by 50 percent due to large-scale downloading of multimedia content by bots collecting training data for AI models. These bots often accessed obscure and less-frequently cached pages, bypassing caching systems and imposing high costs on core data centers. According to Wikimedia, bots made up 35 percent of total page views but accounted for 65 percent of the most expensive requests. The Foundation noted that "our content is free, our infrastructure is not" and warned that "this creates a technical imbalance that threatens the sustainability of community-run platforms". Transparency Approaches like machine learning with neural networks can result in computers making decisions that neither they nor their d
