ns each optimization process with an initial algorithm and metrics to evaluate the quality of a solution. At each step, it uses the LLM to generate variations of the algorithms or combine them, and selects the best candidates for further iterations. AlphaEvolve has made several algorithmic discoveries, including in matrix multiplication. According to Google, when tested on 50 open mathematical problems, AlphaEvolve was able to match the efficiency of state-of-the-art algorithms in 75% of cases, and discovered improved solutions 20% of the time, such as with the kissing number problem in 11 dimensions. It also developed a new heuristic for data center scheduling, recovering on average 0.7% of Google's worldwide compute resources. Chip design AlphaChip is a reinforcement learning-based neural architecture that guides the task of chip placement. DeepMind claimed that the technique reduced the time needed to create chip layouts from weeks to hours. According to the company, its chip designs were used in every Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) iteration since 2020. Multiple independent researchers remained unconvinced, citing a lack of direct public benchmarks and independent proof of its claimed superiority over existing commercial chip design tools. The TPU chips were co-designed with Broadcom. Communications of the ACM noted that despite substantial publicity, DeepMind had not provided the comparative benchmarks long requested by experts, leaving some skepticism in the field. Similarly, New Scientist reported that while Google claims AlphaChip has produced “superhuman” chip layouts now used in production, external specialists called for transparent performance data to substantiate these assertions and enable fair comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods. Safety Google Research released a paper in 2016 regarding AI safety and avoiding undesirable behaviour during the AI learning process. In 2017 DeepMind released GridWorld, an open-source testbed for evaluating whether an algorithm learns to disable its kill switch or otherwise exhibits certain undesirable behaviours. Miscellaneous contributions to Google DeepMind (alongside other Alphabet AI researchers) assists Google Play's personalized app recommendations. DeepMind has also collaborated with the Android team at Google for the creation of two new features which were made available to people with devices running Android Pie, the ninth installment of Google's mobile operating system. These features, Adaptive Battery and Adaptive Brightness, use machine learning to conserve energy and make devices running the operating system easier to use. It is the first time DeepMind has used these techniques on such a small scale, with typical machine learning applications requiring orders of magnitude more computing power. DeepMind Health In July 2016, a collaboration between DeepMind and Moorfields Eye Hospital was announced to develop AI applications for healthcare. DeepMind would be applied to the analysis of anonymised eye scans, searching for early signs of diseases leading to blindness. In August 2016, a research programme with University College London Hospital was announced with the aim of developing an algorithm that can automatically differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues in head and neck areas. There are also projects with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to develop new clinical mobile apps linked to electronic patient records. Staff at the Royal Free Hospital were reported as saying in December 2017 that access to patient data through the app had saved a 'huge amount of time' and made a 'phenomenal' difference to the management of patients with acute kidney injury. Test result data is sent to staff's mobile phones and alerts them to changes in the patient's condition. It also enables staff to see if someone else has responded, and to show patients their results in visual form. In November 2017, DeepMind announce
