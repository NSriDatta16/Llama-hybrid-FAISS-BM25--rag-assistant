e Moral Circle, argues for expanding the scope of ethics to include not only humans but also animals, insects, artificial intelligence, and microbes. He critiques the concept of human exceptionalism, examining how human practices such as factory farming, captivity, and technological development often fail to consider the interests of nonhuman entities. Sebo explores these ideas through case studies on captive elephants, farmed insects, and the ethical issues surrounding the creation of digital minds. The book calls for a reconsideration of ethical responsibilities and advocates for systemic changes to create a more inclusive and equitable future. Moral circle expansion in effective altruism The effective altruism movement, particularly the Sentience Institute, regularly discusses moral circle expansion as a part of its philosophy. Launched in 2017 as a spinoff of the Effective Altruism Foundation, the Sentience Institute describes itself as a "think tank dedicated to the expansion of humanity's moral circle." Its website provides a more detailed model of the circle itself, including concentric circles: the innermost represents full moral consideration, the outermost represents minimal consideration, and some entities fall entirely outside the circles. They additionally distinguish between a moral circle for attitudes and one for actions, and between a societal moral circle and an individual one. Moral circle expansion as a concept per se was developed in a 2021 paper in the journal Futures entitled "Moral Circle Expansion: A Promising Strategy to Impact the Far Future" by Sentience Institute co-founder Jacy Reese Anthis and philosopher Eze Paez. Claimed expansions Many different entities have arguably entered, and sometimes exited, the moral circle at some point during human history: Humans of other genders (feminism, women's rights, opposition to the patriarchy, transgender rights) Humans of other nationalities (xenophobia) Humans of other races and ethnic groups (anti-racism) Humans of other families, tribes or social groups Non-human animals, especially mammals (anti-speciesism, sentientism) Ecosystems and species (rights of nature) Plants (plant rights) Artificial intelligence (AI rights and their potential welfare) Future people (longtermism) Deities Past people (i.e., ancestors) Any given entity or group of entities may enter the moral circle at different times for different people. This current expansion of the moral circle to include animals is referred to by Kasperbauer as an expansion from a circle of all humans to a circle of all sentient things. Sigal Samuel has also suggested that plants, nature and robots may be beginning to enter the moral circle. Anthis and Paez refer to the circle as a "multidimensional gradient" that ranges from wishing harm on someone to caring about someone even more than one's self. Counterarguments Kasperbauer and others point out that it is not entirely clear whether the actual conditions of animals used for food or scientific research are improving, despite claims that they are entering the moral circle. A related criticism is that religion gave some animals a protected status that they no longer have, so they have experienced moral circle contraction. Other suggested groups that have left the moral circle or gone farther from the center are gods and ancestors, whereas infants and fetus have had different moral standings in different societies. The idea of a moral circle has also been criticized as based in Western morality and so not reflecting the diversity of moral views found in the rest of the world, including concepts such as ahimsa that give greater value to animals than found in Western culture. Causes of expansion The question of what causes the expansion of the moral circle is an active topic of debate among the idea's proponents. The inclusion of animals within the moral circle has been credited to various traits that some animals possess, such as being cute or intelligent or
