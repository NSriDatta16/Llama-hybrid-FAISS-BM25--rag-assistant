 mind virus" posed "significant risks"; that demographic collapse and not polarization from misinformation and disinformation posed a threat to Western civilization; that "the left" was more responsible for violence; and that gender identity was "subjective fluff" and that there were only two. Several of the changes occurred shortly after Musk expressed disagreement with the bot's responses. Accuracy Since April 2024, Grok has been used to generate summaries of breaking news stories on X. When a large number of verified users began to spread false stories about Iran having attacked Israel on April 4 (nine days before the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel), Grok treated the story as real and created a headline and paragraph-long description of the event. Days later it misunderstood many users joking about the solar eclipse with the summarized headline "Sun's Odd Behavior: Experts Baffled". In February 2025, Latenode compared Grok 3 and ChatGPT. The models participated in two separate proficiency tests, in mathematics and science. On the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, Grok 3 collectively achieved a 93.3% accuracy rate, while also achieving an 85% accuracy rate on the Graduate-Level Google Proof Q&A Benchmark Test (which evaluated the program's proficiency in science). In 2025, a study by Uri Samet discussed Grok's potential role in supporting fact-checking workflows. The article suggested that large language models like Grok can assist fact-checkers by aggregating relevant information, identifying preliminary verification paths, and helping to mitigate certain biases, while emphasizing that final evaluations should remain with human reviewers. Image generation Aurora Grok uses Aurora, a text-to-image model developed by xAI, to generate images. It initially used Flux by Black Forest Labs. As with other text-to-image models, Aurora generates images from natural language descriptions, called prompts. Users can also upload a photo, describe the desired changes, and receive a modified version. Flux to Aurora The capacity to generate images using Flux was added in August 2024, with The Verge reporting that the kinds of prompts that would be "immediately blocked" on other services seemed to be permitted by Grok. Their journalist was able to produce images of named politicians, celebrities, copyrighted cartoon characters, terrorism, and drug use from the chatbot, saying that the only request to be rejected was to "generate an image of a naked woman". Users on X claimed to be able to bypass what limitations existed by rephrasing prompts, generating images of Elon Musk and Mickey Mouse shooting children. Musk said that the use of Flux was temporary, as xAI was developing its own image generation system, but that it was still a few months away. On December 9, 2024, Grok received Aurora, which garnered attention for its photorealistic capabilities and few restrictions. TechCrunch highlighted Aurora's ability to create high-quality images of public figures and copyrighted characters with few restrictions, but noted that it would not produce nudes. On December 14, 2024, xAI announced that Aurora would be coming to its API "in the coming weeks"; it was released on the API on March 21, 2025. Grok Imagine On July 28, 2025, the image and video generation tool Grok Imagine was released, which lets users create six-second animated audiovisual clips from text prompts. The tool contains multiple modes, with a "Spicy" mode that allows users to generate photos and videos with nudity and sexualized content. It was purported to contain safeguards to prevent the creation of fake nude photography and deepfake pornography which were immediately bypassed. Musk labeled Grok Imagine an "AI Vine". Its access is limited to a waitlist, with plans to expand for Grok Heavy subscribers and a wider audience. Companions In July 2025, a companions feature, allowing users to interact with 3D animated characters, was released. The feature contains a "NSFW" m
