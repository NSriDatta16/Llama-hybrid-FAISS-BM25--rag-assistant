} vertices is defined as the vector containing the 3D coordinates of the n {\displaystyle n} vertices in a specified order, that is S ∈ R 3 n {\displaystyle S\in \mathbb {R} ^{3n}} . A shape space is regarded as a d {\textstyle d} -dimensional space that generates plausible 3D faces by performing a lower-dimensional ( d ≪ n {\textstyle d\ll n} ) parametrization of the database. Thus, a shape S {\textstyle S} can be represented through a generator function c : R d → R 3 n {\textstyle \mathbf {c} :\mathbb {R} ^{d}\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3n}} by the parameters w ∈ R d {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} \in \mathbb {R} ^{d}} , c ( w ) = S ∈ R 3 n {\textstyle \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {w} )=S\in \mathbb {R} ^{3n}} . The most common statistical technique used in 3DFMM to generate the shape space is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that generates a basis that maximizes the variance of the data. Performing PCA, the generator function is linear and defined as c ( w ) = c ¯ + E w {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {w} )=\mathbf {\bar {c}} +\mathbf {E} \mathbf {w} } where c ¯ {\textstyle \mathbf {\bar {c}} } is the mean over the training data and E ∈ R 3 n × d {\displaystyle \mathbf {E} \in \mathbb {R} ^{3n\times d}} is the matrix that contains the d {\textstyle d} most dominant eigenvectors. Using a unique generator function for the whole face leads to the imperfect representation of finer details. A solution is to use local models of the face by segmenting important parts such as the eyes, mouth, and nose. Expression modeling The modeling of the expression is performed by explicitly subdividing the representation of the identity from the facial expression. Depending on how identity and expression are combined, these methods can be classified as additive, multiplicative, and nonlinear. The additive model is defined as a linear model and the expression is an additive offset with respect to the identity c ( w s , w w ) = c ¯ + E s w s + E e w e {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {w} ^{s},\mathbf {w} ^{w})=\mathbf {\bar {c}} +\mathbf {E} ^{s}\mathbf {w} ^{s}+\mathbf {E} ^{e}\mathbf {w} ^{e}} where E s {\textstyle \mathbf {E} ^{s}} , E e {\textstyle \mathbf {E} ^{e}} and w s {\textstyle \mathbf {w} ^{s}} , w e {\textstyle \mathbf {w} ^{e}} are the matrices basis and the coefficients vectors of the shape and expression space, respectively. With this model, given the 3D shape of a subject in a neutral expression c n e {\textstyle \mathbf {c} _{ne}} and in a particular expression c e x p {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} ^{exp}} , we can transfer the expression to a different subject by adding the offset Δ c = c e x p − c n e {\displaystyle \Delta _{\mathbf {c} }=\mathbf {c} ^{exp}-\mathbf {c} ^{ne}} . Two PCAs can be performed to learn two different spaces for shape and expression. In a multiplicative model, shape and expression can be combined in different ways. For example, by exploiting d e {\textstyle d_{e}} operators T j : R 3 n → R 3 n {\displaystyle \mathbf {T} _{j}:\mathbb {R} ^{3n}\rightarrow \mathbb {R} ^{3n}} that transform a neutral expression into a target blendshape we can write c ( w s , w e ) = ∑ j = 1 d e w j e T j ( c ( w s ) + δ s ) + δ j e {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} (\mathbf {w} ^{s},\mathbf {w} ^{e})=\sum _{j=1}^{d_{e}}w_{j}^{e}\mathbf {T} _{j}(\mathbf {c} (\mathbf {w} ^{s})+\mathbf {\delta } ^{s})+\mathbf {\delta } _{j}^{e}} where δ s {\displaystyle \mathbf {\delta } ^{s}} and δ j s {\textstyle \mathbf {\delta } _{j}^{s}} are vectors to correct to the target expression. The nonlinear model uses nonlinear transformations to represent an expression. Appearance modeling The color information id often associated to each vertex of a 3D shape. This one-to-one correspondence allows us to represent appearance analogously to the linear shape model d ( w t ) = d ¯ + E t w t {\displaystyle \mathbf {d} (\mathbf {w} ^{t})=\mathbf {\bar {d}} +\mathbf {E} ^{t}\mathbf {w} ^{t}} where w t {\displaystyle \mathbf {w} ^{t}} is the coefficients vector de
