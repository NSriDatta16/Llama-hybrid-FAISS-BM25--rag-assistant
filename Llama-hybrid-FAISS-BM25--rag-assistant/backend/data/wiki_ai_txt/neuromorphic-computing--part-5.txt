able to mimic or replicate human functions. Neuromorphic engineering, by definition, is designed to replicate the function of the human brain. The social concerns surrounding neuromorphic engineering are likely to become even more profound in the future. The European Commission found that EU citizens between the ages of 15 and 24 are more likely to think of robots as human-like (as opposed to instrument-like) than EU citizens over the age of 55. When presented an image of a robot that had been defined as human-like, 75% of EU citizens aged 15â€“24 said it corresponded with the idea they had of robots while only 57% of EU citizens over the age of 55 responded the same way. The human-like nature of neuromorphic systems, therefore, could place them in the categories of robots many EU citizens would like to see banned in the future. Personhood As neuromorphic systems have become increasingly advanced, some scholars have advocated for granting personhood rights to these systems. Daniel Lim, a critic of technology development in the Human Brain Project, which aims to advance brain-inspired computing, has argued that advancement in neuromorphic computing could lead to machine consciousness or personhood. If these systems are to be treated as people, then many tasks humans perform using neuromorphic systems, including their termination, may be morally impermissible as these acts would violate their autonomy. Ownership and property rights There is significant legal debate around property rights and artificial intelligence. In Acohs Pty Ltd v. Ucorp Pty Ltd, Justice Christopher Jessup of the Federal Court of Australia found that the source code for Material Safety Data Sheets could not be copyrighted as it was generated by a software interface rather than a human author. The same question may apply to neuromorphic systems: if a neuromorphic system successfully mimics a human brain and produces a piece of original work, who, if anyone, should be able to claim ownership of the work?
